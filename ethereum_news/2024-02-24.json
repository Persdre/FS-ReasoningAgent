        "content": "Grayscale: Ethereum\u2019s Rally Mainly Due to Dencun Upgrade, Not Spot ETFs\n\nWhile the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has been cited as a reason for Ethereum's recent price increase, Grayscale Investments offers a different perspective. In a recent report, the asset manager suggests the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, 2024, is the true driver behind the surge.\n\nGrayscale analyst William Ogden Moore argues that the market anticipates the upgrade's ability to improve transaction throughput and cost reduction, making Ethereum more competitive with faster blockchains like Solana. While bullish on Ethereum, the report acknowledges the cryptocurrency's underperformance compared to its sector in 2023, particularly against Solana's impressive 900% growth.\n\nThis bullish stance from Grayscale might be influenced by their ongoing efforts to convert their Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. With spot Bitcoin ETFs already approved, some predict similar approval for the Ethereum equivalent by May 2024.\n\nBeyond Dencun and potential ETF approval, Grayscale also highlights \"net deflationary supply\" and \"network revenue generation\" as factors contributing to Ethereum's future. Additionally, the report emphasizes Ethereum's potential to recapture lost ground in the smart contract application market. They believe that by becoming more competitive in throughput and cost, Ethereum can attract applications requiring high levels of security and censorship resistance, such as stablecoins and tokenized financial assets."

        "content": "The CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Ethereum (ETH) could appreciate to a five-figure price.\n\nYusko says in a new Altcoin Daily interview that based on the Ethereum versus Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC), ETH could go up by 410% from its present level in a scenario where Bitcoin ends up hitting the $150,000 mark.\n\n\u201cI probably have no reason to go against what has existed for a long time which is the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It used to be almost exactly 10-to-1. So if Bitcoin was $20,000, Ethereum would be $2,000\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say Bitcoin gets to $150,000 like I think it will. And let\u2019s say we don\u2019t go all the way back to [a Bitcoin-to-Ethereum ratio of] 10-to-1 but we go to\u2026 Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1.5. So that\u2019s [an Ethereum price of] $10,000.\n\nI think there are a lot of people that have that number in their brain. And a lot of people say, \u2018Well that\u2019s not enough.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s say it gets all the way back to 10-to-1. Then that would be [an Ethereum price of] $15,000. So, comfortably somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,921 at time of writing.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s expected price performance relative to that of Bitcoin (BTC), the hedge fund veteran says,\n\n\u201cI could see a bigger rally in Ethereum than Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of what you would expect in the pump part, in the final meteoric parabolic move. Ethereum has historically outperformed Bitcoin and it probably should again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $51,904 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The price of Bitcoin is now at $51,064, after a modest 2% weekly drop.\n\nCash had flooded into the market as retail investors showed interest in the newly approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that has finally slowed.\n\nStill, the asset is up significantly since the start of the year, when it was trading for $42,245 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Ethereum (ETH) has been the star of the week. The price of ETH crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, and now it's trading for $2,956, a 6% jump over the past seven days.\n\nInvestors are interested in the asset again as more major Wall Street firms apply to release a spot Ethereum ETF. The SEC has until May to approve or deny such a product.\n\nAnd Uniswap (UNI), the 16th biggest token, is doing really well: it's up 66% this week and priced at $12.41. It shot up sharply yesterday on news that the foundation behind the popular decentralized exchange wants to overhaul the governance system to reward users who stake the token.\n\nThe idea is a \"large-scale upgrade to Uniswap protocol governance to incentivize active, engaged, and thoughtful delegation,\" the foundation said. A vote will come in March.\n\nOver the past week, UNI has been the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy far, though, the most impressive performers have been AI tokens, which boomed along with AI sticks after Nvidia's earnings report. The top chipmaker reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the final quarter of 2023, beating analyst estimates.\n\nAs a result, AI-associated digital assets are soaring. Worldcoin (WLD) is up 71% over the past seven days, while SingularityNET (AGIX) doubled before settling at a 71% gain for the week.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nDigital assets like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have evolved to become more than mere currencies; they are now platforms for decentralized applications. This evolution has blurred the lines between traditional means of exchange and digital assets. However, some people believe they can still be used as means of exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike regular money, cryptocurrencies possess traits such as programmability, interoperability and self-executing smart contracts. They are not just used for buying and selling goods but also for creating decentralized financial systems and other applications.\n\nEthereum has long been the leader in the smart contract platform space. However, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender, with both networks now operating on proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.\n\nThis shift to PoS for Ethereum, known as Ethereum 2.0, marks a significant transition toward a more energy-efficient and scalable network. Solana, on the other hand, was built on PoS from the ground up, focusing on high throughput and low transaction costs, which has attracted a substantial user base and developer community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparing Ethereum and Solana, one must look beyond just the monetary value. Both networks provide a foundation for building decentralized applications (dApps), but they approach scalability and transaction speed differently. Ethereum's transition to PoS aims to address its scalability issues, whereas Solana has been marketed as a \"high-performance blockchain,\" capable of handling many more transactions per second from the outset.\n\nThe SOLETH charts reflect Solana's poor performance against Ethereum, indicating a strong preference of Ethereum among investors, likely after the most recent outage on the Solana network. Ethereum's larger ecosystem and longer track record provide it with a more substantial market capitalization and a broader range of dApps."

Behind this surge was significant developments within the Ethereum network, poised to propel the growth of this cryptocurrency further.\n\nNew updates\n\nThe recent Ethereum developers\u2019 call, ACDC #128, unveiled crucial updates set to shape the network\u2019s future. The eagerly awaited Dencun upgrade took center stage, with all client teams (excluding lodestar) finalizing software versions.\n\nThese versions, along with the lodestar candidate client, are undergoing thorough testing on a mainnet shadow fork.\n\nFlashbots, a key player, plans to release Dendon-ready MEV-Boost software early next week.\n\nNotably, the Dencun mainnet activation is scheduled for 13th March, emphasizing the urgency for validator node operators to upgrade their EL, CL, and MEV-Boost software promptly.\n\nThe impact of the Cancun upgrade is poised to be significant. With Flashbots gearing up to enhance MEV-Boost capabilities, the Ethereum network anticipates increased efficiency and security, potentially influencing market sentiment positively.\n\nAnother pivotal development on the horizon is the Electra upgrade. Developers have initiated work on Electra, encompassing EIP 6110, EIP 7002, and EIP 7549. These proposals aim to enhance validator deposits, triggerable exits in the execution layer, and reposition committee index outside attestation, respectively.\n\nFurther refinement and consideration of inclusion lists will determine their seamless integration into Electra without delaying other essential code changes.\n\nIn parallel, discussions on lowering staking rewards have emerged. As the amount of staked ETH rises, stakeholders engage in deliberations on potentially reducing ETH issuance.\n\nThis ongoing discourse is critical, as it signifies the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to adapt and optimize network dynamics in response to changing conditions.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nDespite these advancements, Ethereum\u2019s price, at $2,935.49, reflects a 2.63% decline in the last 24 hours. More notably, network growth for the ETH token has experienced a decline, signaling waning interest among new users.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nA lack of interest from new addresses could severely impact the ability of ETH\u2019s price to see green.\n\nMoreover, the velocity of ETH being transferred also declined. The reduced velocity indicated a lower frequency of interactions around ETH, suggesting a potential decrease in overall engagement."

The market witnessed a withdrawal of approximately $36 million from Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on February 21, as reported by sources like BitMEX Research. However, this trend reversed on February 22, with the ETFs experiencing net inflows of nearly $251 million.\n\nMarket analysts, including the well-known trader and analyst Rekt Capital, suggest that the market might be preparing for a correction ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event in April. Drawing parallels to the bull markets of 2016 and 2020, Rekt Capital speculates that a pattern of a pre-halving dip followed by a post-halving accumulation phase could unfold. The reluctance of Bitcoin to extend its upward trajectory has triggered some investors to cash in profits on certain altcoins. Such corrective actions are deemed beneficial for the market\u2019s long-term stability as they weed out weaker participants, thereby providing opportunities for more committed investors to buy in at lower prices.\n\nWhat are the key support levels that we should keep an eye on for Ethereum and other leading altcoins?

This level is crucial, especially since it\u2019s in close proximity to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 4-hour price chart.\n\nA vigorous rebound from $2,700 would suggest that the bulls have successfully converted this level into a support zone, setting the stage for another push to overcome the $3,000 barrier. A breakthrough could send the ETH/USDT trading pair towards the $3,100-$3,300 zone.\n\nOn the flip side, for the bears to undermine the bullish momentum, they would need to consistently drive and keep the price below $2,700. Should this occur, the pair could potentially fall below moving averages. A decline to such depths might send the ETH price toward $2,400.\n\nSingularityNET (AGIX) Price Analysis\n\nAGIX price continued its upward trend after surpassing the $0.6 resistance, setting its sights on the $1 mark as the next upward milestone. However, bears attempted to hinder progress at $0.85.\n\nIf the bulls manage to hold their position near this level without significant losses, it suggests strong buying interest on minor pullbacks, enhancing the likelihood of an advance to $1.\n\nOn the downside, the initial support is found at 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.68, followed by $0.6. Should these support levels fail to sustain, the correction might extend to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (SMA) at $0.48. Holding above this crucial threshold is vital for the bulls, as a breach could indicate a shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) Price Analysis\n\nThe extended lower shadow of the NEAR candlestick indicates that investors continue to see any drops to the Fib levels as an opportunity to buy. As a result, NEAR price continued breaking above resistance lines and is now nearing the ascending line.\n\nInvestors are making efforts to keep the price over the immediate resistance level of $3.8. Should they succeed, the NEAR/USDT trading pair might surge to the crucial resistance point at $4.6. At this juncture, a fierce contest is anticipated between buyers and sellers. However, if the buyers come out on top, the price is likely to climb to $6 next.\n\nConversely, a sharp decline from $3.8 would show that the sellers are effectively protecting this threshold. A fall below the 20-day EMA would indicate a decline in buying pressure.\n\nCelo Price Analysis\n\nSellers attempted to push Celo price back within the symmetrical triangle pattern, but buyers aggressively defended the level. As a result, the price jumped above $0.88; however, bears defended that level. As of writing, CELO price trades at $0.825, surging over 5.7% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.79 is showing signs of a gradual increase, and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing above 62, it suggests that buyers are gearing up for a rally. A successful move past the $0.88 mark could send the CELO/USDT pair toward the resistance zone of $0.9 to $1.\n\nHowever, this bullish scenario could be challenged if the price declines and falls below the moving averages, signaling that sellers are capitalizing on every slight upward movement. A breach below $0.76 could further amplify selling pressure.\n\nCoti Price Analysis\n\nCOTI has experienced a slight downturn within an upward trend, indicating that short-term traders might be cashing in their profits. However, buyers are focused on extending the uptrend above $0.18.\n\nThe upward trajectory is supported by a climbing 20-day EMA (at $0.11) and an RSI that is approaching overbought conditions, signaling that the market momentum is still predominantly bullish. A jump in price and a subsequent climb above $0.18 would confirm that the upward trend is continuing. Following this, the COTI/USDT pair might aim for a target of $0.35.\n\nConversely, should the price decline further and fall below the 20-day EMA, a level that could potentially entice buyers. However, if selling pressure outweighs buying interest, the pair might drop to the consolidated zone of $0.1."

        "title": "What is EigenLayer? Boosting Ethereum functionality through restaking - OKX",
        "content": "EigenLayer is an Ethereum-built protocol that supports the restaking of ETH on the blockchain's consensus layer. Through EigenLayer smart contracts, those who stake ETH can provide cryptoeconomic security to other applications across the network.\n\nFollowing a stakedrop of EIGEN, the project's native token, users have been rewarded with a portion of EIGEN for their active restaking efforts and willingness to be early adopters in the EigenLayer ecosystem.\n\nWith EigenLayer, Ethereum security is no longer fragmented across modules but is aggregated instead, improving security for the decentralized applications (DApps) that use the modules. EigenLayer addresses some of the trust and innovation challenges faced on Ethereum, allowing for faster development and deployment of DApps.\n\nEager to learn more about what EigenLayer is? Read on as we explain what the project was built to achieve, the role of the EIGEN token, and the project's restaking function.\n\nTL;DR\n\nInnovative platform: The security of Ethereum is transformed by EigenLayer through the ability to restake staked ETH.\n\nSolves fragmented trust: Addresses the slow progress and lack of confidence among some in Ethereum, caused by divided trust.\n\nEnhances security: Enhances the safety of DApps and bridges, decreasing the need for security expenditure.\n\nMarket-based governance: Unifies the Ethereum community through shared security and governance.\n\nPotential and risks: Provides rewards for extra measures to ensure protocol security in the face of novel risks.\n\nWhat is EigenLayer?\n\nEigenLayer is a platform designed to enhance the cryptoeconomic security and functionality of the Ethereum network by enabling the restaking of staked ETH.\n\nThe project addresses the challenges of divided trust and sluggish development on the Ethereum base. These challenges have traditionally hindered the network's ability to offer secure DApps and middleware services at a reasonable cost.\n\nEigenLayer aims to enhance security for Ethereum DApps, bridges, and other protocols by enabling the restaking of staked ETH. As a result, projects using EigenLayer avoid the need to allocate further resources to their security systems.\n\nWith this approach, Ethereum can use its established network of trust while incorporating collective security and market-based governance to better align the goals of DApps, middleware services, and Ethereum.\n\nEigenLayer has an optional feature that allows users to earn extra incentives by securing additional protocols, but this also comes with the possibility of facing new penalties. Users can decide to participate in securing protocols with specific penalty conditions, which means they must accept new risks and potential rewards. The platform supports any protocol that requires robust security, such as oracles, bridges, and rollup services, providing services such as data availability through the same network.\n\nOne example of EigenLayer's utility is EigenDA, a data availability layer designed for Ethereum. Its goal is to offer more affordable and faster data availability when compared to the current Ethereum base layer. This can ultimately improve programmability and the pace of progress on the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe benefits of using EigenLayer include improved capital efficiency, access to higher rewards, and support for novel actively validated services (AVS) and DApps. It also allows for the restaking of liquid staking tokens, which broadens the scope of participation beyond active validators to include those who've staked ETH through liquid staking providers like Lido and Swell. This inclusivity is balanced with measures to prevent centralization, such as imposing caps on the allocation of liquid staking tokens and single deposits.\n\nHowever, like any innovative platform, EigenLayer comes with its challenges. These include the potential for slashing risks, where staked ETH could be rapidly depleted if validators misbehave, yield risks, and centralization risks that could pose systemic threats to the Ethereum network.Despite these concerns, EigenLayer represents a significant step forward in addressing the fragmented trust issue and making Ethereum a more unified and secure platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond.\n\nEigenLayer's approach to restaking staked ETH is a vital component of the broader Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, aiming to enhance the security and efficiency of the network. By allowing for the creation of a security pool through restaking, EigenLayer supports DApps, bridges, oracles, and more, enabling these entities to leverage Ethereum's security without establishing their validator networks.\n\nHow does restaking work on EigenLayer?\n\nThe ability to restake ETH on multiple protocols concurrently reinforces the validation of the network, maximizes capital efficiency, and decreases the costs for validators. Restaking can be divided into two main forms: liquid restaking and native restaking.\n\nLiquid restaking: Involves depositing liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into EigenLayer smart contracts. Supported tokens include stETH (Lido), rETH (Rocket Pool), and several others, with plans to expand support to more tokens. Liquid restaking offers flexibility and inclusivity, allowing a wider range of stakeholders to participate in the restaking process.\n\nNative restaking: Native restaking is targeted at those operating an Ethereum validator node. It involves setting an Ethereum validator's withdraw credential to EigenLayer's smart contracts, enabling direct participation in the restaking mechanism. This form of restaking is crucial for maintaining the Ethereum network's integrity and security.\n\nEigenLayer improves Ethereum ecosystem security by pooling resources and using a free-market governance model. This extends security to different protocols, incentivizing participation and honesty for validators and stakeholders who choose to restake with EigenLayer.\n\nRestaking has benefits such as promoting competition among security providers, lowering barriers for new protocols, and strengthening Ethereum's resilience against attacks. Validators earn income, and stakeholders can increase efficiency by diversifying their staked assets.\n\nWho uses EigenLayer?\n\nThree parties make up the EigenLayer ecosystem, and each plays its own specific role.\n\nStakers\n\nStakers in the EigenLayer ecosystem can restake ETH or liquid staking tokens (e.g. stETH, rETH, cbETH, and LsETH) across multiple protocols. This allows them to use their staked ETH as security for other protocols and earn fees and rewards. This is essential for improving Ethereum's network security and efficiency by using existing staked capital.\n\nOperators\n\nOperators validate transactions and maintain network integrity. They benefit from the EigenLayer ecosystem by validating multiple networks at lower costs, promoting a competitive market for pooled security. As a restaker, users will get to select from a pool of operator nodes that includes OKX, Coinbase, and others.\n\nActively Validated Services (AVS)\n\nThe EigenLayer ecosystem allows AVS developers to access Ethereum's staked capital and validator set, enabling them to create decentralized services and tap into a trusted network for security. This eliminates the need to create a new trust network, reducing fragmentation and promoting permissionless innovation. AVS developers within the ecosystem today include Edgevana, Ethos, and Everstake, among others.\n\nWhat are some key features of EigenLayer?\n\nRestaking mechanism\n\nAllows for the restaking of assets by both ETH stakers and Liquid Staking Token holders.\n\nContributes to Ethereum's security and allows stakers to earn extra rewards without additional capital.\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)\n\nMarket value of $28B, enhancing liquidity for stakers.\n\nEnables engagement in DeFi ventures while maintaining possession of staked assets.\n\nEigenDA\n\nEigenLayer's initial AVS offers decentralized data availability.\n\nProvides lower transaction fees, increased speed, and reliable compatibility with rollup technology.\n\nCost reduction and throughput in EigenDA\n\nAddresses capital, operational, and congestion costs through erasure coding and other mechanisms.\n\nCan sustain high-throughput, accommodating applications that require large amounts of bandwidth.\n\nSecurity features\n\nUses restaking to ensure economic stability and promote decentralization.\n\nUses proof of custody to guarantee the validity of stored data.\n\nFaults and EIGEN, the universal intersubjective work token\n\nWhen it comes to blockchains, faults can be categorized into four types:\n\nObjectively attributable faults: Verified mathematically and cryptographically.\n\nIntersubjectively attributable faults: Most observers must agree.\n\nNon-attributable faults: Privacy breaches that only the victim notices.\n\nSubjective faults: Relies on personal preferences. To use a real-world example, something like your favorite cafe.\n\nEigenLayer focuses on objectively attributable and intersubjectively attributable faults, for broader consensus and resolution.\n\nThe role of social consensus\n\nSocial consensus is crucial for solving conflicts. It makes decisions fairly and that are, in theory, widely accepted. Several methods help achieve this.\n\nSlashing operators' stakes: Here, operators are penalized if they act outside of the norm.\n\nUsing a committee: A group determines the true answer and penalizes those who disagree.\n\nForking the chain: If there's a big disagreement, a new version of the blockchain can be made.\n\nRestaking ETH and the role of EIGEN\n\nEigenLayer uses Ethereum's security to handle objective faults. But, it needs a new way to deal with subjective faults. This is where the EIGEN token comes in.\n\nEIGEN token explained\n\nThe EIGEN token introduces intersubjective staking to fix intersubjective faults. This process involves a setup phase, where rules of coordination are established, and an execution phase, where these rules are implemented.\n\nIf the majority of EIGEN token stakers act outside the rules, a challenger can make a new token version. This new version penalizes malicious stakers to encourage honest and compliant behavior.\n\nUnique features of EIGEN\n\nThe EIGEN token has numerous unique features. It's universal and can be used in various applications, providing broad cryptoeconomic security. It also uses a two-token system to avoid forking issues. One token is fork-unaware and is suitable for applications like lending protocols.\n\nTo prevent malicious challenges, anyone who wants to fork the token must put up a bond in EIGEN. If an attack happens, the system redistributes the malicious stake to compensate for the losses, preserving cryptoeconomic security.\n\nHow do EIGEN and ETH complement each other?\n\nETH and EIGEN work together inside EigenLayer. ETH makes the system decentralized and prevents collusion, while EIGEN helps with cryptoeconomic slashing. Together, the tokens support the network's security and effectiveness, and contribute to a stronger decentralized space overall.\n\nWhat's next for EigenLayer?\n\nThe potential applications of EigenLayer are diverse, including DeFi, governance, and cross-chain interoperability. The protocol's embrace of permissionless innovation opens the door to fresh advancements built by developers using the platform.\n\nMeanwhile, the protocol has taken major steps forward itself during 2024, including the EigenDA mainnet launch during April 2024 and the onboarding of rollups onto the EigenDA mainnet for test traffic. Following this final testing and hardening stage, EigenLayer will begin to onboard production traffic for all rollups. The protocol has stated that onboarding of the first rollups onto the EigenDA mainnet is \"the next phase of a multi-stage launch towards the endgame for data availability for the Ethereum ecosystem\".\n\nAlthough big things lay ahead for EigenLayer, its future development isn't without challenges. This includes complicated technology, uncertainty about market acceptance, and the need to balance maintaining overall security and providing economic incentives within its community.\n\nDespite facing these obstacles, EigenLayer is paving the way for a significant impact on the larger blockchain community. By addressing the long-standing hurdles of scalability, interoperability, and security for Ethereum, its solutions have the potential to encourage a new phase of blockchain advancement. This new era could be characterized by heightened productivity, a wider range of applications, and a fairer and more decentralized digital market.\n\nEigenLayer airdrop: explaining the EIGEN Stakedrop\n\nTo bootstrap the EigenLayer ecosystem and drive higher liquidity, EigenLayer announced the EIGEN stakedrop. Pegged as an airdrop designed for EIGEN staking, the stakedrop is meant to reward users who interacted with the overall EigenLayer ecosystem before the season one snapshot. This mostly includes Liquid Restaking Token users, and those who directly restaked ETH or LSTs on EigenLayer. As a whole, the EigenLayer team mentioned that approximately 113 million EIGEN tokens will be distributed to users in season one.\n\nHow to claim your EIGEN stakedrop\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH and LST restakers can begin redeeming their EIGEN stakedrop claims while season one phase one is live. Simply visit the EigenLayer claim site, connect your OKX Wallet, claim the EIGEN tokens you\u2019re allocated, and begin staking and delegating. Find out more about EIGEN season one eligibility to see if you qualify.\n\nThe final word\n\nEigenLayer innovates on Ethereum by enabling the restaking of ETH to boost network security and speed up development. It helps to align the various interests within the ecosystem, offering incentives for additional protocol security. Key features like EigenDA aim to enhance data availability, improving Ethereum's efficiency.\n\nDespite its obstacles, EigenLayer is an important milestone in developing a stronger and more cohesive Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP\u2019s popularity has surged, outperforming ETH in Google searches in several countries.\n\nRipple\u2019s lawsuit outcome and events like the Bitcoin halving could further boost XRP\u2019s prominence and value.\n\nJapan and Many More\n\nDespite the lengthy lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the entity\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 remains among the trendiest cryptocurrencies. Its popularity rose significantly last year when Ripple secured three vital (yet partial) court victories against its opponent.\n\nAccording to most recent trends, XRP has even surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in Google searches in certain countries (over the past month). Japan, the Philippines, and South Africa are the top 3 nations where Ripple\u2019s coin has dwarfed its. XRP searches have also been on the rise in Finland, Malaysia, and Indonesia, albeit in a more modest fashion.\n\nEthereum remains more popular in some leading European economies, including France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and others.\n\nA few months ago, Solana briefly flipped ETH in terms of Google searches. The trend coincided with SOL\u2019s rapid price increase, which skyrocketed by approximately 1,000% between the beginning of last year and New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nCan XRP Progress Even More?\n\nSome could argue that Ripple\u2019s coin might surge in popularity even more if its price explodes in the following months. The crypto space is rammed with analysts who have recently predicted colossal surges for the coin.\n\nSeveral important factors and upcoming developments hint that such an ascend is not out of the cards. Perhaps the most obvious one is the outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, which is nearing a grand trial (scheduled on April 23).\n\nA decisive win for the company might trigger huge excitement and cause a bull run for XRP and the entire market. On the other hand, the opposite scenario could pause the advancement of the industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is worth mentioning, too. The event occurs approximately every four years and reduces the rate at which new BTC is mined. Historically, it has been followed by a massive crypto bull run, which might positively impact the XRP price.\n\nThose willing to explore additional factors that could play a role, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "title": "Up More Than 900%, Can Solana Really Steal Ethereum's Crown? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "One of the hottest debates in crypto right now is about Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) vs. Solana (CRYPTO: SOL). While the former remains the reigning champion of blockchain development, Solana is building considerable momentum to unseat Ethereum.\n\nDoes Solana have what it takes? Or will Ethereum cement itself as the home of decentralized development?\n\nThe answer is not straightforward, and there are several gray areas to consider. Let's look closer at the state of affairs between Solana and Ethereum to determine which cryptocurrency is a better investment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA little background first\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 changed crypto forever. Its novel smart contracts meant developers could build blockchain-based applications, essentially making Ethereum the first programmable cryptocurrency. With this new functionality, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, yield farming, and many other aspects of today's decentralized finance (DeFi) economy could all be built.\n\nLike any technology, subsequent iterations eventually came along. Enter Solana. Given the title \"Ethereum killer,\" Solana arrived in 2019 and offered developers similar smart-contract capabilities, except with the added benefit of blazing speeds and low fees. As two of Ethereum's primary pinch points, Solana has become one of Ethereum's most formidable challengers.\n\nSolana starts to expand as Ethereum lags\n\nOver the past year, Solana experienced significant growth. After losing more than 95% of its value and falling to just $9 at the depths of the \"crypto winter,\" Solana has since rebounded to more than $100 today. This resurgence is likely fueled by growing momentum in the broader crypto market, as well as its flourishing ecosystem. A quick look at key metrics such as active addresses, total transactions, and total volume on the blockchain reveals that they are all near record levels and hint at a bright future for Solana, especially in this new bull market.\n\nThen there's Ethereum. While Solana has taken center stage, the original smart-contract blockchain has more or less watched from the sidelines. As Solana jumped more than 900% in 2023, Ethereum notched a modest 90% gain. Furthermore, while its blockchain remains one of the busiest in all of crypto, it has not seen an increase as impressive as Solana's. By most accounts, it looks like Solana is closing the lead that Ethereum has enjoyed over the last few years.\n\nEthereum's not standing still\n\nSolana's run over the past year has been nothing short of remarkable. But here's the harsh reality. There's still considerable room separating it from Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Ethereum's total market cap is more than $340 billion. Solana's is just $45 billion. Then there's DeFi. Currently, nearly 60% of the total value within the DeFi economy calls Ethereum home. Solana makes up only 2.7%.\n\nIs it true that Solana is faster and cheaper to use? Absolutely. But this increased throughput isn't without trade-offs. To provide such capabilities, Solana's design makes known sacrifices in decentralization and security -- two crucial factors to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs of last count, Ethereum has roughly 900,000 validators around the world. Solana comes in with around 2,000. In addition, Solana has become notorious for network outages. Over the last three years, Solana's blockchain has gone offline six times, with the most recent occurring in early February 2024. Ethereum's blockchain has never had such a lapse.\n\nThe shiny features that Solana touts will likely fade with time. It often falls on deaf ears, but Ethereum is not a finished product. With the most developers of any blockchain (and five times more than Solana), Ethereum is constantly improving and boasts an impressive roadmap outlining future upgrades that will make the blockchain more capable, faster, and cheaper to use.\n\nTake the Dencun upgrade as an example. Slated for implementation next month, Dencun will introduce new mechanisms that will enable Ethereum to process transactions through its expansive Layer 2 ecosystem at a much cheaper rate. Some estimates project that Dencun will reduce pesky gas fees by up to 10 times.\n\nBuilding a strategic portfolio\n\nNo blockchain is perfect, but some are closer than others. The case for an investment in Solana would be that it's still in its early days and has more room to grow. But with Ethereum, the investment thesis is abundantly more apparent. It still holds a stranglehold on DeFi. It has the most developers. It has a proven track record of functionality and is one of the most secure and decentralized blockchains in the world.\n\nI own both Solana and Ethereum. There are plenty of reasons to believe that Solana's network could keep growing, but it makes up a smaller portion of my portfolio as there is considerably more risk involved. Conversely, I have much more confidence in Ethereum over the long haul, so it receives greater allocation. For investors, the choice comes down to whether they prefer the new kid on the block or the seasoned veteran who has done this a time or two.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In a detailed report, blockchain researchers discussed the promises and challenges of Ethereum (ETH) having concurrent block proposers. A new concept would protect transactions from being censored by malicious validators, but still needs some further engineering and economic evaluations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Ethereum (ETH) block proposers to prevent censorship: Research\n\nYesterday, on Feb. 23, 2023, the Concurrent Block Proposers in Ethereum thesis was published by SMG head researcher Max Resnick and Ethereum Foundation's Mike Neuder. The paper covers the prospects of increasing the number of proposers in a single PoS Ethereum (ETH) slot.\n\nConcurrent Block Proposers in Ethereum\n\n\n\nBy:\n\n- mikeneuder\n\n- max\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/4Uk1DZGpDU\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Introducing multiple proposers per slot in Ethereum could significantly increase censorship resistance by making it more costly and difficult for any single validator to\u2026 \u2014 ethresearchbot (@ethresearchbot) February 23, 2024\n\nAs of today, a block proposer has unilateral authority over the set of transactions included during a 12-second slot. Thus, it can alter the list of transactions, making the second largest blockchain vulnerable to censorship.\n\nBy contrast, with two proposers, there are four possible outcomes for a block slot, ranging from both proposers successfully sharing their blocks to neither proposer presenting a block.\n\nThis variety impacts the blockchain's fork choice and requires adjustments to existing mechanisms like proposer boost. A malicious entity controlling both proposers in a slot could attempt to split the chain by manipulating the timing of block proposals, but the probability of this happening decreases exponentially as the number of required malicious proposers increases.\n\nAs a result, the cost of censorship increases with every new proposer active. However, due to the nature of Ethereum's slot, block and attestation design, the problem of switching toward multiple proposals needs further engineering and economical research.\n\nEthereum (ETH) validator design might change in 2024\n\nAlso, the researchers stressed that the problem of the significance of a potential upgrade to low-priority (\"censored\") transactions remains an open question.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Ethereum (ETH) might see more validation design changes in 2024 post-Dencun upgrade.\n\nYesterday, on Feb. 23, it was announced that the problem of validator deposits was added to the agenda of the Electra hard fork expected in Q4, 2024-Q1, 2025."

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Solana? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto ecosystem has gone through several dramatic changes in the past few years. In 2020 and 2021, the industry was driven by hype and speculation only to crash in 2022 and early 2023. There was no better example of this hype cycle than Solana (CRYPTO: SOL).\n\nIt peaked at more than $250 per token and dropped below $10 per coin after the collapse of FTX. But this continues to be one of the lowest-cost and highest-throughput blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, and if you think the innovation and disruption of crypto is from utility and not just speculation, this is still a cryptocurrency to hold long term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat people do in crypto matters\n\nThe health of a blockchain can be seen in the activity of developers and users. This can be judged by developer activity. Solana reports 2,500 to 3,000 developers consistently, short of only Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) at about 6,000 developers.\n\nOn the user side, transactions per second is a great gauge of how much activity there is on a blockchain. Solana averages between 3,000 and 4,000 transactions per second compared to a blockchain like Ethereum at around 13 transactions per second.\n\nThese two factors together will give you an idea of the health of the blockchain itself. If developers are building it and users are using it, the blockchain has a likely chance of growing in the future.\n\nETFs and the future of crypto investing\n\nWe have seen billions of dollars flow into the crypto industry over the past month after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to speculation that Ethereum will be the next to get an ETF and more cryptocurrencies may follow.\n\nSolana could get an ETF if Ethereum is approved. It has similar characteristics and smart contracts to Ethereum and has strong institutional and consumer interest.\n\nBut I don't think it's likely Solana will hold a place like Bitcoin in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is more like digital gold that investors simply want to hold long term, whereas Solana is more of a utility coin for the blockchain. But there could be buyers for both kinds of assets.\n\nSolana's uncertainty\n\nThe one downside of Solana is the coin itself is not as important to the ecosystem as it is to something like the Ethereum blockchain. Yes, there's a proof-of-stake element to Solana, but a lot of transactions simply happened with USDC stablecoin as the medium of exchange.\n\nThe future of Solana may be driven by a USDC-denominated token or some other fiat-backed token, and not the Solano cryptocurrency that we see today. This may mean less upside with the cryptocurrency itself, despite being the native coin to the blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven all of these factors, I think the biggest reason to be bullish on Solana long term is the fact that this is where innovation development and transactions are taking place on the blockchain today. There's more activity and innovation on Solana than almost any other blockchain. And activity and USDC we are using the Solana blockchain for normal financial transactions without even knowing it in the future. That will be a truly disruptive future, and is a great reason to buy Solana.\n\nIs it too late? I don't think it is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them.
