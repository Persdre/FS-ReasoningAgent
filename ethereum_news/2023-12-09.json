        "title": "Funding Wrap: Bitcoin, Ethereum-based projects see fresh capital - Blockworks",
        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) faces possible sell pressure, one crypto analyst says, citing how it surpassed the $2,300 mark. Whales have been actively taking profit, and this could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto.\n\nEthereum price volatility\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been positively impacted by the recent bullish momentum in the global crypto markets, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above the $43,000 price region.\n\nETH maintains a distinctive market position attributed to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption, and pivotal role in decentralized finance (defi) and various blockchain applications.\n\nDespite the current positive momentum, there are apprehensions regarding the potential influence of selling pressure from whales on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales immediately took profits after Ethereum hit $2,300.\n\nThe impact of significant holders selling could potentially drive down the price of ETH in the coming weeks. In a bearish scenario, the cryptocurrency might retest the $1,555 support level, and sustained selling pressure could push ETH as low as $1,460 within the next two months, the analyst predicts.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAs #Ethereum surpassed $2,300, $ETH whales began to book profits. This surge in selling pressure might soon start to impact the #ETH price. pic.twitter.com/sdrvT2vcCe \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAlthough Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $282 billion lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s $857 billion, both networks generate comparable protocol revenues.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Bitcoin network accrued $61 million in fees, while Ethereum accumulated $61.5 million.\n\nIn addition to institutional interest, the price surge is fueled by expectations of an ETF approval from the SEC. Despite the optimistic momentum, there are apprehensions, that the upswing in selling pressure might have repercussions on the ETH price in the coming days.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scaling startup Versace Labs secured another $2.3m in seed round\n\nEthereum\u2019s surging network fees\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is intricately tied to the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIncreased defi and NFT activities have driven up network fees, with more individuals engaging in intricate transactions, leading to prolonged periods of elevated fees.\n\nThe creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the associated costs can fluctuate based on network congestion and gas prices. While Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees pose challenges for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions like Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization provide optimism for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe surge in DeFi and NFT activity on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in extensive transaction activity, contributing to the persistently high gas fees.\n\nCurrently, the average gas fee for minting an NFT on Ethereum is around $100, subject to variations based on network congestion, gas prices, and smart contract complexity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,348.23, according to Data from CoinGecko."

        "content": "LONDON - The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant activity with both and reaching yearly highs, causing a substantial increase in transaction fees. A recent market rally pushed Bitcoin to its annual peak price of $45,000 on December 5th before it stabilized above $43,000. Following this surge, IntoTheBlock reported on December 8th that Bitcoin's on-chain activity had spiked, leading to a more than 60% increase in transaction fees.\n\nEthereum has also seen remarkable growth, setting new yearly highs on Friday by reaching $2,390. This latest milestone came with daily gains that surpassed Bitcoin's incremental rise. Despite Ethereum's success in price and an increase in whale dominance\u2014with these large holders now owning 35% of the total supply\u2014there has not been a corresponding surge in new user acquisition for the network.\n\nThe rise in transaction fees for Bitcoin outpaced that of Ethereum's, which saw nearly a 50% fee growth. This fee inflation typically indicates a heightened demand for processing transactions on each blockchain, often reflecting increased investor interest and market activity.\n\nAs both cryptocurrencies showcase robust performance, the market is closely watching these developments. The spike in fees particularly underscores the growing costs associated with the surging demand for blockchain space during market rallies. Investors and users are now navigating a landscape where heightened activity can lead to higher costs for transaction processing on these networks.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "content": "This week\u2019s Web3 watch begins with a significant shift in the NFT marketplace. Ethereum, traditionally the frontrunner in NFT trading, has seen a downturn in sales volume, facing competition from two emerging players.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnessed a surge in digital art collectible trading, primarily driven by ongoing interest in ordinal inscriptions. Ordinals allow users to mint NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The past month has seen a 500% increase in sales volume for this asset class, eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s figures over the same timeframe.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin\u2019s cheap-to-mint ordinal inscriptions has led to a significant increase in demand on the network. This trend reflects a broader shift in the digital collectibles market, where novel and cost-effective methods of NFT creation and trading are gaining traction.\n\nRead more: Sotheby\u2019s announces its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale\n\nThe Solana blockchain has also stepped into the spotlight, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum on Friday. This increase in Solana\u2019s trading volume is the culmination of a banner week for the network.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s obviously interesting and different in the ordinals space versus every other popular blockchain is that your NFTs are actually stored on-chain versus in smart contracts-enabled ecosystems, [where] they\u2019re stored on some decentralized server like IPFS,\u201d Sarah Satoshi, the head of business development at ordinals marketplace Gamma.io, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the factors that attracts a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito executed an airdrop on Thursday, distributing $165 million worth of its native token to users. The following day, Solana saw a spike in its NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThere was a marked increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT market, which may have been fueled by speculations of another potential airdrop.\n\nOn Friday, \u201cTensorians,\u201d a Solana-based NFT collection, topped the sales volume charts according to CryptoSlam. The collection\u2019s sales volume rose over 100% in the past week.\n\nPudgy Penguins takes up the Webkinz model\n\nThe NFT collection Pudgy Penguins debuted an online open-world game called Pudgy World Alpha at Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe game lets players control avatar lookalikes of the penguins, but users don\u2019t need to own an NFT to play.\n\nPudgy World builds on the NFT collection\u2019s partnership bringing toy versions of Pudgy Penguins to Walmart stores. Each toy comes with a QR code that claims a Pudgy Penguin character inside of Pudgy World.\n\nEvery toy corresponds to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, and holders receive licensing royalties on their corresponding toys, the project said in a press statement.\n\nOne interesting stat:\n\nInterest in Bitcoin ordinals dramatically increased the blockchain\u2019s mempool to an all-time high.

        "title": "What Are Blockchain Confirmations and Why Do They Matter? - CoinCentral",
        "content": "A blockchain confirmation is a representation of a new block being accepted by a blockchain network. When any transaction is first broadcast to the blockchain it starts with zero confirmations. This number then increases as the information is added to the first block, confirmed, given a permanent place, and followed by more blocks.\n\nA confirmation is considered to have occurred once a miner has verified a block of transactions and added the new block to the blockchain. On average, cryptocurrency exchanges require a minimum of three confirmations until a transaction is accepted. Coinbase, for example, does not consider a Bitcoin transaction as final until it has received at least three confirmations.\n\nAll public blockchains make use of blockchain confirmations. These are important since they can help you understand how confident you can be when making a transaction.\n\nBlockchain confirmations are vital since they are a way of verifying and legitimizing information that will then become immutable. If a transaction is deemed fraudulent, it will be rejected from the blockchain: zero blockchain confirmations means zero transactions.\n\nTthe larger the transaction, the more blockchain confirmations are required. This is because the more confirmations there are, the harder the transaction is to reverse. For a transaction of $1 million, it\u2019s not uncommon to wait for at least 60 confirmations. The amount of blockchain confirmations required to verify a transaction varies by blockchain. Let\u2019s take a look at Bitcoin and Ethereum here.\n\nBitcoin Confirmations\n\nYou probably already know that Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain creates a new block about every 10 minutes through the mining process. This block then verifies and records new transactions and appends them to the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that a transaction is unconfirmed until the new block is generated. Therefore, if you\u2019re sending or receiving Bitcoin, it\u2019s essential to wait until you see that the transaction has been confirmed.\n\nOne confirmation usually takes up to 10 minutes. However, since one confirmation is not enough to be confident about the validity of the transaction, users have to wait for each new block to be created and verify the information. Depending on the amount being sent, this may take anywhere between 30 to 600 minutes. Ten hours is a long time to wait for a transaction confirmation!\n\nSome Bitcoin services are instant and require only the first confirmation, however, the majority ask for more, with some companies requiring at least six Bitcoin blockchain confirmations before accepting the transaction.\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Mempool?\n\nThe Bitcoin mempool is the sea of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. As explained above, once a transaction is uploaded to the blockchain, it is not confirmed immediately but is released into the mempool of transactions, which are considered in-motion.\n\nAll nodes on the Bitcoin network are connected to the mempool, and that includes the miners who collate transactions from the mempool into a block. The miner who first solves the mathematical equation and adds the block to the blockchain is the first to confirm the block. Therefore, the first to receive the miner reward of 12.5 BTC.\n\nThis is fairly straightforward, however, some transactions are picked out of the mempool faster than others. Why? Because miners also earn a bonus percentage of transaction fees (called the Bitcoin mining fee).\n\nMiners will pick out the transactions with the higher fees first to earn a higher bonus. It also explains why not paying transaction fees can lead to your transaction getting stuck. In fact, as more people join the Bitcoin network, this bottleneck is one of the greatest challenges to the Bitcoin community.\n\nHow to Speed Up Blockchain Confirmation Times\n\nThe higher the fee you pay, the more likely your transaction will be confirmed in a timely manner (there is a 60 percent chance that it will take 10 minutes or less). However, if your transaction remains unconfirmed, the recommended wait time is 72 hours before sending it again.\n\nIf you want to avoid paying fees, however, you can check to see how many unconfirmed transactions there are at a given moment and calculate how long it will take.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Confirmations\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum blockchain confirmations, the agreed-upon number seems to be undecided. According to the Ethereum white paper, 7 confirmations should be enough to confirm the transaction (about 2 minutes).\n\nHowever, Ethereum miners must check the parameters of the last 250 blocks. So, if you want to err on the side of caution like the miners, you should wait for 250 confirmations. This sounds like a lot, but in practice is only about an hour.\n\nCoinbase requires 50 ethereum confirmations before considering a transaction complete. It should also be noted that the Ethereum blockchain faces significant scalability issues as well. Ethereum is working to scale quickly to take on more users, and through Proof of Stake, confirmations should be even quicker.\n\nEtherscan and Ether Gas\n\nEthereum doesn\u2019t have a mempool for pending transactions; it\u2019s simply called the transaction pool. The pool contains all the transactions submitted that haven\u2019t yet been assigned to a block.\n\nThere are multiple methods for speeding up your transaction and deciding on the best gas price when sending your Ethereum transaction. You can try ETH Gas Station to see an overview of gas usage, and you can see how many transactions are pending by using Etherscan.\n\nEtherscan is particularly popular since you can order transactions by gas price (simply click on the GasPrice column). You\u2019ll then see more or less the same list that miners see and, if you select a gas price that is within the first couple of pages, you should enjoy short confirmation times.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Wrapping up Bitcoin Confirmations\n\nBlockchain confirmations are essential for securing your transactions. The best way of ensuring a faster confirmation is by paying a higher fee. As all blockchains begin scaling up to prepare for even more users, it will be interesting to see how that affects the prices we pay and the times we wait."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is likely to rally to $48,000, as market participants keep up with the updates on Bitcoin Spot ETF applications.\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum, Chainlink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to gain from BTC\u2019s price rally.\n\nEthereum price is likely to rally alongside Bitcoin as ETH holders await Spot Ethereum ETF approval by the US SEC.\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe picked four altcoins for the ongoing bull run, in his recent video on YouTube. The analyst believes these altcoins could outperform other assets and yield gains for traders, alongside Bitcoin price rally to $48,000.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum derivatives data points at bullish start for ETH in 2024\n\nBitcoin dominance peaks, drives gains in altcoins\n\nBitcoin dominance is at 50.2%, according to data from CoinGecko. At the current level, alongside Bitcoin price rally, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) are likely to yield gains for holders.\n\nPoppe explains that Bitcoin is currently in a stage where the asset is rallying and there is a likelihood of a potential top. There is hype surrounding the speculation of approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and capital is likely to flow into altcoins. Volatility is likely to go away from Bitcoin and drive gains in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nETH holders are awaiting an approval of Spot Ethereum ETF and this could fuel gains in the asset. Ethereum price could correct in response to a correction in BTC, however Poppe has set a target of $3,000 for ETH price this cycle.\n\nWith Bitcoin dominance peaking out, altcoins like ChainLink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to rally. Just as seen in 2019 and 2020, ChainLink price rallies after weeks of sideways price action. LINK is therefore on the brink of multiple bullish breakouts.\n\nPoppe identified a massive bullish divergence in Arbitrum and Optimism and notes that these two altcoins are finalizing their accumulation stage, gearing up for a breakout. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is close to the $44,000 level, ARB and OP are trading at $1.1327 and $2.1510, on Binance, respectively."

        "content": "Crypto analysts at the investment management giant VanEck are predicting big things for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) in 2024.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, and Patrick Bush, a digital assets senior investment analyst, predict that Ethereum will lose market share to Solana next year due to the latter project having \u201cless uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also predict that Solana will rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, total value locked (TVL) and active users.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts. TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets. Solana currently ranks sixth among chains in terms of TVL, according to the decentralized finance aggregator DeFi Llama.\n\nSigel and Bush also predict that Solana will join the race for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. So far, financial firms have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSOL is trading at $74.05 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 6.65% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Prominent crypto analytics platform Santiment says one metric is indicating Bitcoin (BTC) may witness another leg up.\n\nSantiment says that an increase in \u201cbull trap\u201d mentions on social media platforms is indicating a spread of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) for the crypto market.\n\nHowever, the market intelligence firm says that periods following increased FUD tend to lead to a bump in prices for crypto assets and that could mean Bitcoin is on the verge of heading higher after a rally pause.\n\n\u201cTraders are fearful that crypto markets may be in a bull trap at the moment. But while Bitcoin may have stopped its momentum for the time being, Ethereum and altcoins are blasting off once again. FUD could propel BTC to $50,000 if it increases.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $44,198 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, Santiment says Ethereum has more upside potential as the biggest crypto whales holding (ETH) off of exchanges increase their wallet sizes. According to the analytics firm, non-exchange Ethereum whales hold an all-time high of 54.6 million ETH worth $128.69 billion.\n\n\u201cEthereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,353 at time of writing, down slightly on the day.\n\nLastly, Santiment says that peer-to-peer payments network Litecoin could see a bullish trend reversal as wallets holding small amounts of LTC abruptly decline amid rising FUD.\n\n\u201cApproximately 199,000 wallets that held LTC 10 days ago, no longer hold any coins. This is the biggest drop in wallets since October 2022. LTC\u2019s market value vs. BTC has dropped -55% in five months, but FUD and small wallets dropping could turn this around.\u201d\n\nLitecoin is trading for $78.21 at time of writing, up 5.55% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
