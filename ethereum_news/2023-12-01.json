        "title": "Ethereum validator and node growth leads to emissions decline: Report - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by an estimated 99.97% since its shift to proof-of-stake, despite a big rise in node count.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The organization has upped its crypto research effort after in April launching the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI) \u2014 a measure that detailed Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption pre- and post-Merge.\n\nThe Ethereum network currently is responsible for 2.8 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (KtCO 2 e) on an annualized basis, the CCAF said in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cTo contextualize, this would equate to the emissions from five round-trip airplane flights from London to New York, the annual energy consumption-related emissions of 450 UK households, or the annual carbon sequestration capacity of 270 acres of forest,\u201d the report states.\n\nEthereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation had estimated the Merge would reduce the blockchain\u2019s power consumption by 99.95%.\n\nRead more: Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake after 7 years of work\n\nBut electricity usage is only one piece of an environmental impact assessment, according to the Friday report.\n\nAdditional data was required to convert electricity consumption to greenhouse gas emissions. The CCAF used off-chain data from the peer-to-peer communication of Ethereum nodes to gather both electricity usage and the geolocational distribution of nodes.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators has grown 57% since April 1, reaching 880,822. Ethereum nodes have grown to 14,072, reflecting a 23.2% increase over that span.\n\nThe network\u2019s annual electricity consumption increased by 21.2% in those eight months, from 6.19 GWh to 7.50 GWh \u2014 roughly the annual electricity use of 2,000 English households, the Cambridge data shows.\n\nAs for where the nodes are, Europe and North America are home to 43.3% and 40.5% of them, respectively, following the Merge.\n\nSource: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF)\n\nThe CCAF estimates pre-Merge greenhouse gas emissions were about 10.3 MCO 2 e. The latest post-Merge figure of 2.8 KtCO 2 e reflects a 99.97% drop despite a substantial increase in the number of Ethereum nodes, the report notes.\n\nThe network is now powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy \u2014 including 32% renewables and 16% nuclear \u2014 the CCAF estimates, with the remaining 52% coming from natural gas, coal-fired power, and oil.\n\nThe CCAF said it next looks to enhance its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). Despite Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake, bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus model is a cornerstone of its identity, the report acknowledges \u2014 making a similar transition \u201cnot as straightforward as it might appear at first glance.\u201d\n\nThe research institute adds: \u201cThe narrative of Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s different paths is not just a tale of technological advancements but also reflects different ideologies and priorities of their communities, highlighting the multifaceted complexity inherent in the evolution of leading blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders and analysts are discussing the roots of the \"New Solana Summer\" as all core metrics of on-chain activity are rocketing. Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

        "title": "Ethereum to phase out its Goerli testnet \u2013 What now? - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "The Sepolia testnet would become the new test layer for developers.\n\nHolesky would also have a new function.\n\nIf things go as the Ethereum [ETH] Foundation has planned, the project will no longer support the Goerli testnet. This information was disclosed on 30th November in a post published on the foundation\u2019s blog.\n\nGoerli is Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet. It is responsible for providing developers with a reliable test environment for applications built on the blockchain.\n\nIn the statement, the foundation noted that the halt on the operation would take place after the Dencun upgrade. The statement read:\n\n\u201cEither three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun Mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators. Anyone relying on Goerli as a stable Testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.\u201d\n\nMove to a new land\n\nDencun is short from Cancun-Denub upgrade. According to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, the upgrade would take place on the execution and consensus layer.\n\nAlso, the aim of the upgrade is to provide a user-friendly experience for developers and users.\n\nThe foundation has advised developers using Goerli for testing to switch to Sepolia. Sepolia is the default Testnet for smart contract development on the blockchain. Concerning the development, the team explained that:\n\n\u201cApplication and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto checked if these updates affected Ethereum\u2019s development activity.\n\nA look at Santiment\u2019s data showed that the development activity metric rose till 30th November. But, at press time, the metric had declined to 2.41.\n\nDevelopment activity measures the commitment developers have toward new features on a network. So, the slight decrease means users should not expect new functionalities on Ethereum.\n\nTraction drops, but\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, network growth on the blockchain also decreased. Network growth measures the number of new addresses interacting with a project. If the metric increases, it implies an increase in traction.\n\nTherefore, the drop suggests that ETH\u2019s adoption decreased. Also, new addresses who joined the network have refrained from making transactions. Another area the Ethereum Foundation touched on was staking.\n\nStaking on Ethereum is one activity that has experienced a surge in growth.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) means that Goerli had a role in the activity. Regarding the activity, the foundation mentioned that stakers should use the newly launched Holesky Testnet.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis move means that the foundation had fulfilled its promise that Holesky would replace Goerli as Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and protocol-developer Testnet.\n\nAlso, validators were asked to consider the Ephemery Testnet for lightweight end-to-end testing."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is best known for creating the world\u2019s second-most-valuable blockchain, Ethereum, when he was just 19 years old. In the past few years, though, Buterin\u2019s influence has expanded well beyond the world of crypto and into the broader realm of ideas where the young polymath\u2014who taught himself Mandarin while traveling the world\u2014offers important treatises on technology and the future.\n\nThe latest example is a 10,000-word essay Buterin published this week titled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d It\u2019s a response to the much-discussed \u201cmanifesto\u201d with a similar title by the influential venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Buterin\u2019s piece endorses many elements of the manifesto, including an affirmation that technology has delivered marvelous benefits to humanity, and that fear and overzealous regulation have limited progress in fields like biotech. But while he endorses a foot-on-the-gas approach, especially to solve the climate change crisis, Buterin also calls for a more cautious approach when it comes to AI.\n\nWhile the Ethereum creator has long been a leading thinker in computer science, he has also become one in the governance of technology and society. Here is Buterin on the crack-up at OpenAI and the problem of putting guardrails on technology by means of small councils of elite decision-makers:\n\n\u201c[It was] a well-intentioned effort to balance the need to make a profit to satisfy investors who provide the initial capital with the desire to have a check-and-balance to push against moves that risk OpenAI blowing up the world. In practice, however, their recent attempt to fire Sam Altman makes the structure seem like an abject failure: It centralized power in an undemocratic and unaccountable board of five people, who made key decisions based on secret information and refused to give any details on their reasoning until employees threatened to quit en masse.\u201d\n\nDrawing on his experience in trying to build decentralized communities in the Ethereum realm, Buterin provides new and important insights into how to think about AI\u2014including how to avoid the very real possibility that humans end up as pets to machine overlords. He is, of course, hardly the only one with big ideas about the future of technology. But what makes Buterin stand apart is his deep capacity for empathy and lack of ego.\n\nUnlike Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan\u2014another tech genius whose ideas carry a lot of weight in the debate over technology\u2014Buterin doesn\u2019t have contempt for those who disagree with him, and he doesn\u2019t frame the debate in the shrill us-versus-them tone of the venture capital elite.\n\n\u201cI believe that these [technologies] are deeply good, and that expanding humanity\u2019s reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d he writes. In a troubled moment where too many people are consumed with fear and negativity, it is welcome to read a tech genius who relies on empathetic persuasion. If you want a shorter and more approachable window into Buterin\u2019s worldview, you can also check out this new Fortune Q&A, which includes the moral case for supporting Ukraine and the fascinating sci-fi realm of the popular book and film The Three Body Problem.

Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

        "content": "On-chain data shows the ten largest Ethereum whales have continued to expand their holdings recently, now carrying 41 million ETH.\n\nEthereum Top 10 Whales Have Set A New All-Time High For Their Holdings\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest whale wallets have continued to display an optimistic pattern for the cryptocurrency. There are two indicators of interest here: the supply held by top exchange wallets and the supply held by top non-exchange wallets.\n\nThe former keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that the ten largest wallets attached to centralized exchanges are holding right now. In comparison, the latter measures the amount sitting in the ten largest self-custodial wallets on the blockchain.\n\nBoth types of addresses would count as \u201cwhales,\u201d but those attached to the exchanges would be more likely to control an entity like the platform itself rather than a \u201cnormal\u201d investor, like a self-custodial wallet would most likely be.\n\nThe chart below shows how the Ethereum supply held by these two cohorts has changed over the past year.\n\nThe value of the two metrics have gone opposite ways in recent days | Source: Santiment on X\n\nThe graph shows that the supply held by the top ten whales outside exchanges has been constantly going up during the past year, while the addresses attached to exchanges have been rather up and down.\n\nGenerally, investors keep their coins inside self-custodial wallets whenever they want to hold onto them for extended periods. So, these off-exchange whales continuing to increase their supply is undoubtedly a positive sign for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs is apparent from the chart, the supply of these whales has crossed the 41 million ETH mark following the latest continuation of the uptrend, which is a new all-time high.\n\nWhile this rise has come, the top ten Ethereum exchange wallets have seen a plunge instead, as they now hold just 8 million ETH, the lowest amount in about 24 weeks.\n\nA shift of supply towards self-custody is always a good sign for the health of the market, as bankruptcies like that of the FTX exchange already showed during this bear market what happens when central platforms like these go bust.\n\nThe less ETH that\u2019s present on the exchanges, the less the price would be affected if they happen to go out of business. And that\u2019s not all; the supply on exchanges can also be considered the available selling supply of ETH, which has also reduced with this drawdown.\n\nTherefore, this pattern of the self-custodial wallets growing in size while the exchanges lose coins is an encouraging development for the asset. Though while that may be true, supply concentrating on just ten wallets is still something negative, as these humongous entities now control one-third of the supply.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading just below the $2,100 mark, down 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has overall gone up during the past 24 hours | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Vivek Kumar on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "content": "For its fifth anniversary, The Fabricant makes no bones about its visions of grandeur. In addition to celebrating the occasion with a revamped Deep collection, with artificial intelligence reimagining one of its earliest offerings, it is expanding the digital fashion platform with new integrations.\n\nThese moves matter, executives told WWD in an exclusive interview, because they represent the company\u2019s next step in its evolution \u2014 and its ambitions to advance virtual fashion as a whole. The plan, they said, was to finally turn digital fashion into a mainstream movement.\n\nThe work has already begun. It starts with opening up availability for virtual fashion. For Kerry Murphy, cofounder and chief executive officer, and chief technology officer Marco Marchesi, that translates to expanding The Fabricant\u2019s platform to Ethereum, one of the crypto world\u2019s top decentralized blockchain networks, as a way to become a multichain platform. Meanwhile, it is also integrating with Crossmint, which builds tools that make it easier for businesses to build NFTs at scale.\n\nMetaverse skeptics could criticize moves like this, given the tech\u2019s downturn as a cultural phenomenon. But blockchain evangelists beg to differ, and corporate America as well as global brands seem to agree. Not only have fashion brands continued to invest in virtual technology and metaverse initiatives, but Crossmint \u2014 a popular NFT partner for some of the world\u2019s most recognizable companies \u2014 recently inked another notable deal with Coinbase.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nThe original \u201cCopyCopyCopy\u201d look from the 2018 collection. Courtesy image\n\nIn an August social media share, the company announced that \u201cthe world\u2019s coming on-chain. @coinbase is integrating @crossmint to help Coca-Cola, Atari, and other major companies onboard the world to Web3.\u201d That follows the June launch of its NFT \u201cwallet-as-a-service\u201d to help companies put simplified, interoperable blockchain technologies into their existing products. The same month, rapper Snoop Dogg released a \u201cdynamic\u201d NFT collection, which evolves alongside his tour. He used Crossmint, which can work with fiat currency, as the NFT payment processor.\n\n\u201cCrossmint is the perfect partner to really remove the friction between payments and experience that you get with NFTs,\u201d said Marchesi. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the company itself, \u2018Crossmint,\u2019 so they really don\u2019t care anymore what currency you\u2019re using at other servers. And that\u2019s what we need for our community, for our users.\u201d\n\nWith the Ethereum play, The Fabricant\u2019s digital fashions \u2014 its own or those of its brand partners \u2014 are poised to become more available to a greater number of consumers.\n\nLinking to Ethereum is something of a homecoming for the company. \u201cWe sold the world\u2019s first digital fashion couture NFT on Ethereum, back in 2019,\u201d explained Murphy, referring to a high-profile collaboration between The Fabricant and artist Johanna Jaskowska, CryptoKitties and Dapper Labs that resulted in a digital blockchain dress called \u201cIridescence.\u201d The NFT was hailed as the world\u2019s first virtual-only haute couture dress and sold for close to $10,000.\n\nThe project was more about making a statement about digital fashion, said the CEO, and at the time, it prompted the press to wonder why anybody would pay such a high price for clothing that didn\u2019t actually exist. But soon enough, COVID-19 changed the equation, with people living more of their lives online amid widespread lockdowns. \u201cWe became one of the most relevant companies in the fashion industry, and we had all the physical fashion brands calling us up asking, \u2018What is this digital fashion about?\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAs he reflected on his company\u2019s five-year journey, it\u2019s clear that it was quite a whirlwind studded with major figures in gaming, from establishment giant Atari to Web3 hit Star Atlas, and notable names in fashion spanning Rtfkt, the digital sneaker start-up-turned-Nike business, to Virgil Abloh. The Fabricant has been at the heart of millions of dollars in NFT transactions and other investments and not just for partners. In 2021, it scored $14 million in series A funding, which was perhaps fortunate timing. The following year saw a cryptomarket crash that took the shine off of cryptocurrencies and, to some degree, NFTs.\n\nMurphy was quick to note that The Fabricant is not a crypto company, but it does work with the same underlying blockchain technology, so it felt the ripples. \u201c[We] had to really detach ourselves from the narrative of crypto NFT and metaverse, and really focus on digital fashion,\u201d he said, describing it as a highly successful shift.\n\nNow the company is ready to move forward and, once again, timing may be on its side, given recent advancements in artificial intelligence, brands\u2019 growing digital sophistication and greater consumer understanding of virtual experiences. Case in point: The revamped version of Amber Jae Slooten\u2019s Deep collection, as reimagined using generative AI. The original was never available \u201con chain\u201d before, but the collection totaling seven items will drop on Dec. 14 as part of The Fabricant\u2019s Ethereum expansion.\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d from the 2018 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d as reimagined by AI in the 2023 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\nAs for the future, Marchesi pointed to new experiences in development, such as augmented reality dressing. It remains a holy grail in digital fashion, and The Fabricant partnered with Snap Inc. to enable it and, by doing so, it joined myriad players from Google to DressX pursuing the same thing. The key is to not let the technology or complexity get in the way. The CTO sees it as \u201cpart of our vision, [which] is about, everyone should be able to wear digital fashion in any context with any device.\u201d The Fabricant quietly launched AR try-on as a beta feature of its platform, as it has been a work in progress, but it\u2019s ready to call more attention to it now.\n\nAnother area of interest is using virtual fashion and realistic AI models for photo shoots. The company wouldn\u2019t disclose details on that on the record, but it is actively exploring this.\n\nThere\u2019s more happening on the fashion front, including some sort of upcoming collaboration with a notable luxury brand, though neither Murphy nor Marchesi could offer details at press time. But coming on the heels of this slew of updates, exploratory projects and efforts in development, it\u2019s unlikely to be a rank-and-file debut.\n\nWhether any of it succeeds in drawing mainstream interest remains to be seen. But one thing seems quite clear \u2014 The Fabricant\u2019s swirl of activity in the last five years might be nothing compared to what the next five brings."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Ready For New ATH In 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH) price stayed relatively unchanged on Thursday despite the trading volume dropping by 20% to $8.5 billion. Intriguingly, the altcoin\u2019s market cap is holding up above $245 billion, according to market data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis has been a week of consolidation with Ethereum price sitting above the $2,000 level. Recovery has become an uphill battle leaving Ether to wobble between support at $2,020 and a short-term resistance at $2,070.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Far Is Ethereum From Breakout?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator upholds the mundane sideways trading Ethereum has displayed since Monday. Its downside is protected by the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) at $2,020 and the ascending trendline.\n\nEthereum price tends to react bullishly every time it has retraced to touch the trendline. Therefore, in case of dips towards the $2,000 mark, bulls could seize the opportunity to buy into ETH while speculating on the next breakout first to $2,200, and later to the subsequent levels at $2,500 and $3,000.\n\nTraders should exercise caution and restraint as long as Ethereum is trading below the short-term resistance at $2,040, as highlighted by the 50 EMA (red). The action above this level and the next resistance between $2,058 and $2,070 would serve as a breakout signal, paving the way for a bigger move to $2,200.\n\nThe momentum indicator will confirm the uptrend\u2019s continuation with the blue MACD line flipping above the red signal line.\n\nA triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart could nurture a bigger breakout towards $3,000 if validated. Bulls must focus on breaking above resistance at $2,120 to activate the triangle breakout. Most traders would consider going long on Ethereum slightly above the triangle.\n\nRecommended for you: Dogecoin Price Could Blast Through $0.12 Resistance If This Technical Pattern Plays Out\n\nA glimpse of the daily chart assures traders of support at $2,015 but based on the current technical, as depicted by the sell signal from the MACD, ETH might drop again before making another significant recovery attempt.\n\nHowever, backing the bullish outlook in ETH is the position of all three moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. If the MAs uphold the ongoing uptrend, the path with the least resistance is likely to stick to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Shoots To $26 Billion\n\nThe dollar value of all ETH locked in staking protocols and other decentralized finance (DeFi) networks is increasing rapidly. According to data by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $26 billion from approximately $19.4 billion in mid-October.\n\nThe growth in TVL underscores the long-term bullish outlook investors have for Ethereum price. They are willing to lock up their Ether for longer periods, expecting that the uptrend will continue into 2023. A high TVL value significantly reduces the selling pressure.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "A complete guide to fast and secure bridge from BNB to Ethereum (ETH) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The bridging of BNB BEP-20 tokens to the Ethereum network (ETH) opens up new avenues for users seeking increased liquidity, accessibility to DeFi applications, enhanced security, and improved interoperability.\n\nThis guide illustrates a simplified process for bridging tokens from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to Ethereum (ETH) in four simple steps.\n\nThe advantages of BNB to ETH bridge\n\nIncreased liquidity:\n\nThe migration of ERC-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain significantly amplifies liquidity, mitigating price volatility associated with smaller markets. A larger liquidity pool ensures smoother token transactions, offering users greater trading flexibility.\n\nGreater accessibility:\n\nWith the transition of BEP-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain, users have access to a wider range of applications and services in the DeFi. These include lending protocols, staking, and trading, creating opportunities that may not be available on the BNB Chain, thus diversifying user engagement in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nSafety:\n\nThe use of the robust network security of Ethereum ensures greater decentralization and security of user funds. The Ethereum blockchain, renowned for its resilience, becomes a reliable foundation for safeguarding assets during the bridging process.\n\nInteroperability:\n\nThe bridging of BEP-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain promotes greater interoperability between the two networks. Users can transfer tokens seamlessly, facilitating a smoother experience across the different functionalities offered by Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum.\n\nHow to transfer BNB to ETH in 4 easy steps\n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Connect the wallet\n\nVisit the Binance bridge (with attached login) and connect your wallet, which supports a range of options. Choose the wallet containing the tokens to be connected.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Select chains and tokens\n\nChoose the source chain (BNB) and the destination blockchain (Ethereum). Select the specific token from the dropdown menu or paste the contract address if it is not listed.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Setting gas rates\n\nSelect the desired amount of gas for bridge tokens, which affects transaction speed and costs. The recommended settings are standard or high to achieve optimal bridging results.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Confirm the transaction and obtain the tokens\n\nExamine the details of the transaction, including wallets, gas fees, and tokens. Confirm the transaction and wait for processing. Once completed, the tokens have been successfully transferred to Ethereum.\n\nHow to calculate gas fees?\n\nTo calculate gas fees for a transaction from BNB to Ethereum, determine the gas price and gas limit.\n\nMultiply the gas price by the gas limit to obtain the total gas fee. Gas prices can fluctuate, so it is good to adjust accordingly for timely processing.\n\nMinimize costs by adopting a low-price gas strategy, comparing rates from various bridge services and considering factors such as reputation and security. Balance cost effectiveness with reliability to achieve an optimal bridge.\n\nConclusions\n\nA blockchain bridge facilitates the seamless movement of assets between blockchains, allowing users to leverage different ecosystems. Decentralized and centralized bridges offer different features, ensuring flexibility in asset transfers.\n\nThe transfer of BEP-20 tokens from Binance Smart Chain to Ethereum unlocks a series of advantages, including increased liquidity, accessibility to DeFi, enhanced security, and interoperability. Users can seamlessly navigate both ecosystems, maximizing the potential benefits offered by each blockchain."

        "content": "U.Today - market dynamics are often a tale of whose trades can signal shifts in market sentiment. Recently, a whale transaction caught the eye of many, as 3,150 ETH, valued at approximately $6.37 million, were sold at an average price of around $2,023, netting a substantial profit from an earlier purchase of 2,762 ETH at $1,825 each. This move has prompted discussion among traders: is it time to take profits on Ethereum?\n\nThe chart reveals a critical juncture in price action. After a period of bullish momentum, is now testing local resistance levels, creating a moment of decision for investors. The current resistance, formed near the $2,050 mark, is a crucial threshold that has previously prompted sell-offs, suggesting that traders are eyeing this level to secure gains.\n\nConversely, the support levels paint a picture of potential bounce-back zones. The first significant support is visible near the $1,950 level, aligning with the 50-day moving average. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic support, propelling prices upward upon contact. A break below this, however, could see Ethereum's price target the next support at approximately $1,850, where previous demand coalesced to halt bearish runs.\n\nThe probability of a price reversal hinges on the to these critical technical levels. A convincing break above the current resistance could invalidate the bearish thesis, potentially leading to a continuation of the upward trend. However, recent whale activity suggests that some large holders are starting to realize profits, potentially adding to the selling pressure at this price threshold.\n\nVolume trends also provide insight, with a notable decrease in trading volume suggesting that the current price level may be unsustainable in the short term. Combined with the whale's cashout, it could signal a broader sentiment shift among investors, leading to increased volatility and a possible price correction.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

The rumors seem unfounded and the XRP community has failed to present evidence supporting the claims.\n\nAlso read: LUNC ranks among trending tokens alongside Dollar pegged stablecoin USTC, eyes recovery\n\nCharles Hoskinson addresses rumors surrounding Ripple lawsuit\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano is one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Hoskinson has been embroiled in a debate with the XRP community over alleged rumors of ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin bribing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give Ethereum a \u201cfree pass\u201d and go after Ripple. Here free pass meant Ethereum was allowed to conduct business as usual while Ripple was hit by a lawsuit.\n\nIt is important to note that Hoskinson currently finds himself in a similar situation to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, in 2020. The US SEC slammed Ripple with a lawsuit, alleging the unregistered sale of securities, here securities meaning XRP. The SEC has listed Cardano as an investment contract in its lawsuit against Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange. It is therefore clear that the regulator considered Cardano an investment contract.\n\nHoskinson commented on the rumors stating that the XRP community needs to present evidence to back its claims, or else he finds it a \u201cgrand conspiracy.\u201d\n\nFor the argument that Joe bribed the SEC to go after XRP that is the conclusion. That is the entire point of calling it a grand conspiracy. The free pass has nothing to do with the case against Ripple. They are unrelated events.

        "content": "Recently, XRP community members looked back into history to compare XRP\u2019s price through their years of holding on to the digital asset with respect to the performance of other competing crypto projects.\n\nPer statistics from authoritative sources, XRP appears to be the worst-performing cryptocurrency when compared to others ranking in the top ten, like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).\n\nXRP Price Five Years Ago\n\nToday, five years ago, data from prominent market tracker CoinMarketCap shows XRP traded at a low of $0.3625 and a high of $0.381. At that time, it had a market cap of $14.61 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $512 million.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThroughout November 2018, the highest point XRP reached was $0.5605, while its lowest was $0.325, per CoinMarketCap statistics.\n\nXRP\u2019s lowest value five years ago, when compared to its price of $0.6 today, suggests the token has again only 86.45% all the way from 2018 to 2023. On the high side, with $0.5605, XRP has seen only 8.12% in five years.\n\nBitcoin Price Five Years Ago\n\nMeanwhile, on November 30, 2018, BTC traded at a low of $3,942.82 with a valuation of $69.9 billion and a trading volume exceeding $6 billion. The firstborn crypto\u2019s lowest value for November 2018 was $3,585.06, which translates to a 957% gain when factored against today\u2019s price of $37,902.\n\nEmphatically, Bitcoin\u2019s value five years ago compared to today implies BTC investors have reaped more than ten times more profit than XRP investors.\n\nETH and Cardano Price\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum exchanged hands at a low of $111.74 today five years ago, with a market cap exceeding $11,7 billion. In the same month, ETH bottomed at $102.45 and has grown 1887.71% since then to $2,036 today.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn other words, investors who bought ETH\u2019s dip in November 2018 have seen 21 times more profit than those who bought XRP\u2019s dip the same month. Likewise, Cardano sold at a discount of $0.0328 in November 2018. However, ADA\u2019s value has risen 1,053.05% since then to $.378.\n\nCrypto Community Reacts\n\nA crypto enthusiast with X username \u201c@Ianbins\u201d put XRP\u2019s five-year value alongside rivalry tokens with a satirical comment.\n\n\u201cBuy XRP, they said; it will make you rich, they said,\u201d he mocked, given that XRP\u2019s current value is not much different from November 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Morgan, a lawyer known for his pro-XRP stance, remarked:\n\n\u201cWow. I never realized XRP\u2019s price performance was this poor compared to other major coins and not only compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWow. I never realised XRP\u2019s price performance was this poor compared to other major coins and not only compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has of course been under the cloud of a SEC investigation and then lawsuit that entire period but you would think it would have caught up\u2026 https://t.co/Eyflqp0JZq \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 29, 2023\n\nNotably, the XRP Army has argued the multi-year regulatory battle against XRP had hindered its performance. Following the court ruling in July, XRP reached $0.93 but has since lost those gains.\n\nNonetheless, it remains to be seen how XRP will perform in the coming years with the U.S. regulatory fight out of the way."

        "content": "Yeeting ETH into the void is nothing new for Ethereans.\n\nBy the time the Beacon Chain officially launched on Dec. 1, 2020, the staking contract \u2014 referred to as \u201cETH 2.0\u201d back then \u2014 had already seen around 880,000 ETH in deposits.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that multisig-with-a-plan project Blast now sports $650 million in staked ether and stablecoins under its control.\n\nBlast\u2019s explicit promise is that deposited tokens will earn an on-chain yield, plus rewards of unknown value. Ether staking yield comes via Lido\u2019s stETH tokens, while stablecoins are converted to dai deposited in Maker, or savings dai (sDAI).\n\nOn Thursday it emerged that the Blast deposit interface set its slippage tolerance to an inordinately high 10%, resulting in one user losing about $100,000 in value. The Blast team says they\u2019ve fixed it.\n\nBut, sandwich attack surprises aside, most depositors at least know that all assets will be locked until the proposed optimistic rollup launches in February.\n\nDepositors to the Beacon Chain, too, knew that their ether would be locked up for at least a couple of years \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t clear when exactly The Merge and subsequent enabling of staking withdrawals would happen when many aped in.\n\nUltimately it took until April 2023, by which time about 18 million ETH (about $33 billion at the time) were deposited.\n\nIn the interim, there was a rapid growth in liquid staking, with Lido becoming the dominant player in early 2022, and already nearing a third of all staked ether by May 2022. It has remained between 29% and 33% ever since, keeping the project at the center of a debate about centralizing market forces on Ethereum.\n\nThe total percentage staked through Lido currently stands at 32.28%, and Blast \u2014 which uses Lido exclusively \u2014 isn\u2019t helping.\n\nHow much of a problem that is, depends on who you ask.\n\nSome will analogize the concentration of ether stake to the preponderance of the Go Ethereum (Geth) execution client for Ethereum node operators. A great deal of social coordination was needed to bring down the market share of Prysm on the consensus layer, which reduces risks to the network as a whole. Geth is currently at 84%.\n\nClient diversity is widely seen as one of Ethereum\u2019s strengths, a hallmark of its resilience through decentralization, which is unmatched in crypto. Indeed, decentralization and resilience are often seen as synonymous.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThat\u2019s why some are concerned about the Blast-fueled tick up in Lido\u2019s stake share.\n\nBut for others, it\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Blur and Blast investor Izebel.eth stated the \u201c3 line pitch\u201d for Blast is that \u201c[Ethereum] would be better if everyone used stETH\u2026so we use the bridge as a forcing function.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nOf course, the \u201cbridge\u201d is not really a bridge, while it can only be crossed one way. And forcing people into a harmful position isn\u2019t doing them any favors.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIt\u2019s generally good advice to be wary of promises from backers that something can \u201creshape the fabric of society.\u201d That\u2019s not just \u201cambitious\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hubris.\n\nNone of the more academic discussions ultimately matter, though, when you have gamification as your selling point. And, maybe there are bigger fish to fry.\n\nIn any case, Lido has more TVL \u2014 approaching $20 billion \u2014 than any other DeFi protocol by a country mile. And Blast is bigger than Base \u2014 in third place behind Arbitrum and Optimism according to L2Beat \u2014 while now hiring software engineers, much to the amusement of crypto Twitter.\n\nPlenty of folks in this industry idolize the free market; so if that\u2019s your modus operandi, then the market has spoken, for now.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "The Best Crypto Investment: GameStop Memes Beats BNB and Ethereum ROIs with a $4 Million Presale Surge - Tekedia",
        "content": "When we talk about the dynamism of the cryptocurrency world, we are in for a great ride on the excitement of potential gains and the ever-evolving market dynamics that make investors\u2019 choices harder and harder. So, today, we will explore the strategies and impacts of three amazing digital assets: Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), and the current innovator, GameStop Memes (GMS).\n\nIn this article, we will shed light on whether these three currencies will be a successful investment in the world of cryptocurrencies in 2024, especially after the $4 million presale of GameStop Memes.\n\nBNB Sees Surge in Popularity\n\nIn the first corner of our crypto battlefront, we have Binance Coin (BNB), the native cryptocurrency of the world-renowned Binance exchange. BNB has been a prominent player in the crypto space, known for its utility and versatility. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB transitioned to Binance\u2019s native blockchain, Binance Chain, through a coin swap.\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s primary function is to fuel transactions and interactions within the Binance ecosystem. Users can utilise BNB to pay for trading fees, transaction fees, and even goods and services from merchants that accept them. This utility has solidified BNB\u2019s position in the crypto market and continues to evolve.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Binance Coin\u2019s popularity is its participation in various Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales on the Binance Launchpad. This has allowed investors to access promising projects at an early stage, potentially reaping significant rewards, which means it is likely to be a good investment in 2024.\n\nEthereum: An Uncertain Investment in 2024?\n\nIn the opposite corner, Ethereum (ETH) stands out for its groundbreaking approach to blockchain technology. While Bitcoin primarily focuses on digital currency, Ethereum takes a broader perspective.\n\nLaunched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralised applications (DApps) and customise blockchain solutions. This innovation opened doors to a wide range of applications beyond traditional finance.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has grappled with scalability issues. Its current infrastructure struggles to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently. This has resulted in high gas fees and slower transaction processing times, limiting its potential; therefore, Ethereum may not be a good investment in 2024.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 Disruptive Entry to Crypto\n\nNow, let\u2019s shine the spotlight on the disruptor of the hour, GameStop Memes (GMS). Inspired by the GameStop saga that made headlines, GMS takes the meme culture to new heights by turning popular internet memes into tradable assets.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 strength lies in its community-driven ethos. It thrives on the collective enthusiasm of its users, who come together to celebrate and invest in their favourite memes. While it may not possess the technological sophistication of Ethereum or the dominance of Binance Coin, it introduces an element of fun and community spirit to the crypto space.\n\nMoreover, GameStop Memes made a significant mark by amassing an impressive $4 million during its presale, signifying growing interest and support for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency. While its long-term impact on the crypto market remains uncertain, it undeniably injects excitement and unpredictability into the scene.\n\nWe\u2019ve explored the strengths and strategies of Binance Coin, Ethereum, and GameStop Memes in this crypto battle. Binance Coin excels in utility and participation in token sales, Ethereum pioneer\u2019s innovation with its smart contracts, and GameStop Memes adds a playful twist to the world of crypto.\n\nSo far, the GameStop Memes method seems effective and distinct after achieving $4 million in presale.\n\nInvest in GSM while it\u2019s still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://GameStopmemes.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopopMemes\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum-based Layer-2 scaling protocol Starknet has sparked a frenzy in the community after confirming the long-speculated prospects of an airdrop. Taking to its official X account, the Starknet Foundation said it is making plans to distribute its native token, \"STRK\" to some of its community members on the condition that they must have contributed at one point or the other to its overall development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Starknet Foundation announcement resounded through the community, it had to sound a note of warning to enable community members to manage their expectations the right way. The outfit said tech teams typically develop a lot of products, many of which may not see the light of day - its way of insinuating that there is a small margin of probability that the STRK token may not be launched.\n\nWe have seen that a preview of an iteration of a possible provisions portal has been shared on social media. As noted a year ago in the original announcement of the STRK token, the Starknet Foundation is developing plans to distribute the token to certain users/contributors for\u2026 Advertisement December 1, 2023\n\nWith the excitement brooding since the protocol\u2019s mainnet upgrade and since the rumor started making the rounds, Starknet said there are no actions that its community members will make now that will change the criteria as the screenshots to determine eligible recipients had already been taken.\n\nAs a matter of emphasis, it said further criteria or information that might be necessary for the STRK airdrop will be shared when ready.\n\nCrypto airdrops: A major trend\n\nAirdrops in the crypto ecosystem are not uncommon in the digital currency ecosystem and, in particular, among Layer-2 networks. Airdrops from Blur, Arbitrum and Optimism are among the biggest the industry has seen in recent times.\n\nWhile the Starknet airdrops frenzy is relatively new to the broader community, the most anticipated for now is that of XRP Ledger (XRPL)-based L2, Evernode (EVERS). Per recent statistics shared by the protocol earlier today, there are lots of community members vying to get their own share of EVERS as the protocol sets a legacy as one of the pioneering L2 protocols on XRPL."

        "title": "How to make cryptocurrency bridges from the BSC network to ETH or vice versa - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we will see how to perform a cryptocurrency bridge from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) cryptographic network to the Ethereum Mainnet (ETH), or vice versa.\n\nThe bridge represents a cross-chain transfer of digital currencies between different blockchains that, by their nature, cannot overlap and must travel on different roads.\n\nTo carry out this type of operation, we can rely on both non-custodial solutions and custodial ones.\n\nThe former maintain the component of decentralization, typical of those who want to operate in complete privacy and in a trustless mode, while the latter represent a valid alternative for those who handle large amounts of capital and prefer to enjoy greater protection in terms of cybersecurity.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nCrypto bridges from BSC network to ETH or vice versa: the best protocols\n\nOne of the most popular solutions for bridging cryptocurrencies from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to the Ethereum Mainnet (ETH), or vice versa, is to use decentralized interoperability applications.\n\nWith this specific genre of protocols, crypto such as BNB, USDT, and USDC can be easily transferred between the two networks, which due to their nature normally cannot communicate.\n\nTo use them, it is essential to have a non-custodial crypto wallet, such as Metamask or Trustwallet, and be familiar with the practices and operations typical of web3 and DeFi.\n\nAmong the most quoted and reliable applications in the specific case of the BSC to ETH bridge, we find: Stargate, Meson, Symbiosis, Orbiter Finance, and Layerswap.\n\nAll of them represent a quick and economical option that with a few minutes of waiting and a handful of dollars, will allow your tokens to teleport between blockchains.\n\nFurthermore, the liquidity on them is sufficient to guarantee the perfect functioning of operations. Stargate is by far the most popular platform in this regard, to the point of recording a volume of over 220 million dollars in the bridges of the last 30 days involving the BSC.\n\nIt is estimated that the entire cryptographic network during the same period supported a total volume of 349 million dollars across all existing applications\n\nIts dominance is largely due to speculation about an alleged LayerZero airdrop that could be released specifically to Stargate users.\n\nNow let\u2019s see practically how to perform a bridge from BSC to ETH, using the platform just mentioned as a reference.\n\nThe mechanism is identical in any other solution, with the only difference that some cryptos may be available for transfers on one platform rather than another.\n\nOnce we have entered the official Stargate website, we go to the \u201ctransfer\u201d section, select the type of currency we want to transfer, and select the sender and recipient networks.\n\nLet\u2019s enter the total number of tokens to be bridged and click on the \u201ctransfer\u201d button.\n\nAs in the following example, after a few minutes the USDT sent from BSC will be visible on ETH and can be used immediately within this ecosystem.\n\nObviously, like any operation on blockchain, this one also incurs commission costs, which in the case of the bridge from BSC to ETH can reach a few dollars, while from ETH to BSC it could sometimes exceed even more than 20 dollars (it depends a lot on the gas cost on Ethereum).\n\n\n\nThere are actually applications like Sushiswap, which have implemented the so-called \u201ccross-chain swap\u201d, which allow you to simultaneously execute a swap between two tokens while they are being transferred from one chain to another.\n\nWithdrawal of crypto from exchanges as a secure custodial solution for cryptocurrency bridging\n\nAnother method to bridge cryptocurrencies between the BSC and ETH networks is to use centralized exchanges as a support base to deposit funds from one network and withdraw them from the other. This is not a true bridge, but it still represents a very valid alternative solution.\n\nIf, for example, you have some USDT on the BSC on the Metamask wallet and you want to transfer them to ETH, you could make a BEP-20 deposit on an exchange like Binance and then withdraw the same USDT as ERC-20 on Ethereum to the same starting address.\n\nBy doing so, you give up the factors of decentralization and privacy to enjoy some advantages such as increased security.\n\nUsually those who use this bridging option do so because they handle significant volumes and do not want to expose themselves to the risks of third-party non-custodial platform smart contracts.\n\nDecentralized bridges are indeed the most vulnerable web3 environment to cyber attacks par excellence, where the funds of many users have been compromised in recent years.\n\nConsidering that in this niche, in just over 3 years hackers managed to steal about 2.75 billion dollars, which is a little over a third of all thefts that occurred in the entire crypto world.\n\nIn this regard, just a few days ago the Heco Bridge managed by the famous Justin Sun, was hacked for 86.6 million dollars\n\nTransferring your cryptocurrency to CEX minimizes counterparty risk in this type of protocol, relying solely on the reliability of the exchange in question.\n\nIt is also worth noting how this option can solve the potential \u201cproblem\u201d of high gas fees on Ethereum in the case of the bridge from ETH to BSC, significantly reducing commission costs compared to interoperability applications.\n\nThe best exchanges to carry out this type of operation are Binance, Bybit, Okx, Crypto.com, Bitget, Kraken, Kucoin.\n\nBefore making the first deposit, make sure that the platform you are using supports the tokens you want to transfer and the networks you want to rely on."

        "title": "Beyond Ethereum: Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Blockchain Ecosystems - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Sara is steadily working on cryptocurrency evaluations, news, and fluctuations in digital currency prices. She is guest author associated with many cryptocurrencies admin and contributes as an active guide to readers about recent updates on virtual currencies.\n\nOver the past decade, Ethereum has established itself as the leading blockchain platform, revolutionizing the world with its bright concept of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, as the blockchain industry continues to evolve, new and innovative ecosystems are emerging, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. In this article, we will explore the rise of these alternative blockchain ecosystems and shed light on the Ultima ecosystem, which stands out as a prime example of innovation and potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Limitations\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Ethereum\u2019s groundbreaking contributions to the blockchain industry. With its robust smart contract capabilities, Ethereum has enabled the creation of a vast ecosystem of dApps and DeFi protocols. However, Ethereum has faced significant challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and high gas fees. As the demand for dApps and DeFi projects grew, Ethereum\u2019s network congestion became apparent, leading to slower transaction times and exorbitant fees.\n\nThese limitations have impacted the user experience and hindered the scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the switch to staking, while promising in theory, has raised questions about whether it has truly lived up to users\u2019 expectations and the actual rewards it offers.\n\nThe Emergence of New Blockchains\n\nAs Ethereum grapples with its limitations, alternative blockchains have emerged, aiming to provide solutions and compete for market share. Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polkadot are a few examples of these rising stars challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance and aiming to provide solutions to the scalability and cost issues.\n\nHowever, among these alternatives, the Ultima ecosystem has garnered attention for its unique offerings and outstanding features. Ultima is building a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain products and introduces the DeFi-U platform, which aims to revolutionize decentralized finance and provide users with a seamless and efficient experience.\n\nUltima: The Innovative Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nAt the heart of the Ultima ecosystem lies a commitment to innovation and cutting-edge technology. Compared to Ethereum, Ultima boasts faster transaction processing of the Smart Blockchain it is built on, setting new parameters for speed and efficiency. Additionally, the ecosystem offers lower transaction costs, making it more cost-effective for users to engage in various activities.\n\nULTIMA, the native token of the Ultima ecosystem, implements a halving mechanism to increase its scarcity and value. This strategy reduces the rate of new tokens entering the market by half every 10,000,000 blocks, ensuring a controlled supply and preventing inflation. Currently, slightly over 50 ULTIMA tokens are coming off the block daily. In 2024, this number will decrease to 25, and by 2028, the daily supply will reach just 1 token, introducing scarcity and potentially driving up the token\u2019s value over time.\n\nThis scarcity-focused approach encourages early adoption and creates a sense of urgency for participants to engage with the platform and acquire ULTIMA tokens. Early adopters and long-term holders of ULTIMA tokens can benefit from potential price appreciation and access to ecosystem advantages. Ultima has plans to expand the ecosystem with future products such as a crowdfunding platform, marketplace, cryptocurrency debit card, UltimEx cryptocurrency exchange, and Ultima Travel Club. These additions aim to make the Ultima ecosystem comprehensive for its user base, which already exceeds 3 million users worldwide.\n\nUltima\u2019s flagship product, DeFi-U, is a delegated liquidity pool that allows users to activate profit in ULTIMA tokens. The splitting mechanics of rewards distribution offers split licenses for lifelong benefits in ULTIMA tokens through blockchain technology and smart contracts, allowing both experienced and new users to engage directly with blockchain technology. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s complex staking process, splitting simplifies participation, attracting a wider user base and promoting active ecosystem engagement.\n\nWhat\u2019s Wrong with Staking?\n\nEthereum, which initially operated on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin, has since transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism following the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the \u201cMerge.\u201d This update has been eagerly awaited and discussed for a long time because it raised a lot of hopes.\n\nHowever, as time went on, there occurred some challenges associated with staking. One of the main reasons why the tech hasn\u2019t become massively adopted was its complexity, for staking requires users to lock their tokens directly on the blockchain with operators or validators.\n\nStaking tokens can be risky due to factors like slashing and penalties, client software bugs, and unstaking periods. Trustworthiness is crucial when choosing a validator, and different teams should be used to maintain the software. The bear market has negatively impacted public perception of staking, making it essential to choose trustworthy and reliable validators.\n\nWhy Splitting Is Better Than Staking\n\nThe splitting technology offered by Ultima presents several advantages over traditional staking mechanisms, which may make it more appealing to both experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts and newcomers. Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of why splitting could be considered better than staking:\n\nAccessibility and Ease of Use: Traditional staking often requires a certain level of technical knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology. Ultima\u2019s splitting tech is more appealing to both experienced and newcomers. It simplifies the process by allowing users to acquire SPLIT tokens via a license and smart contract, making it more accessible to the average person without technical expertise.\n\nLiquidity Concerns: Staked tokens are often locked up for a certain period, reducing liquidity and limiting users\u2019 ability to respond to market movements. With splitting, daily rewards in ULTIMA tokens are claimable after 24 hours, offering more flexibility and potentially higher liquidity.\n\nPrice Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Staking rewards are typically in the form of the native token, whose value can fluctuate widely. In the case of splitting, the combination of a halving mechanism with a limited supply of ULTIMA tokens is designed to potentially increase token value over time, which could offer a more stable reward system.\n\nLongevity of Rewards: With splitting, users receive daily rewards for the rest of their lives as long as they hold SPLIT tokens in their Smart Wallets. This model provides a clear, long-term benefit structure, whereas staking rewards may vary based on changes in protocol rules or tokenomics.\n\nCommunity Growth and Token Scarcity: The Ultima ecosystem is designed to grow with its community, and as more people use ULTIMA tokens, the market supply decreases due to the halving mechanism and limited token supply. This could potentially drive up prices and make rewards more valuable over time, benefiting early adopters and consistent participants.\n\nExpanding Horizons: Shaping the DeFi Landscape\n\nAs the blockchain space continues to mature, new ecosystems are emerging, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance and offering innovative features and solutions. The rise of innovative blockchain ecosystems, such as Ultima, showcases the potential beyond Ethereum. With its cutting-edge technology, user-centric approach, and unique advantages, Ultima is poised to shape the future of decentralized finance, providing users with a more accessible, secure, and efficient DeFi experience. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, embracing these innovative ecosystems will unlock new opportunities and possibilities for individuals and the broader blockchain community."

        "title": "Ethereum CO2 Emissions Decreased by 99.97% After The Merge - Crypto Mode",
        "content": "The blockchain world witnessed a transformative change with Ethereum\u2019s shift to a more eco-friendly framework. This significant move, known as \u201cthe Merge,\u201d transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake system. The result? A dramatically reduced carbon footprint by roughly 99.97%. That makes Ethereum a leading example in the blockchain space for environmental responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Carbon Footprint Reduction\n\nRecent research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) and the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) shines a light on this groundbreaking development. The study, presented at COP28, emphasizes the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum.\n\nIt was a staggering 27.5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e). This figure puts into perspective the impact of crypto technology on the environment and its potential role in advancing sustainability. Thankfully, it is much lower today, at 2.5 KtCO 2 e.\n\nA key element in this discourse is the concept of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These are non-binding national plans focusing on climate change mitigation and setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The intersection of NDCs and blockchain technology is pivotal. It demonstrates how digital platforms can aid countries in achieving their environmental goals.\n\nEthereum Climate Platform: A Collaborative Effort\n\nThe ECP, established by Allinfra and Consensys, is at the forefront of addressing Ethereum\u2019s environmental impact. Their recent partnership with Earthshot prize winner Boomitra targets mitigating one million tonnes of CO\u2082. This initiative marks a significant effort in addressing Ethereum\u2019s historical carbon emissions. Over the coming years, the ECP plans to drive investment towards rectifying this legacy, utilizing its digital tools and network of carbon market experts.\n\nAnna Lerner, executive director of the ECP, emphasizes the importance of this research. She calls it a wake-up call for the industry to decarbonize influential technologies like blockchain. Lerner stresses the need for blockchain businesses to take responsibility, adopt sustainable practices, and address their carbon emissions.\n\nBill Kentrup, co-founder of Allinfra, reflects on the findings as a significant step forward. He highlights the near-complete decarbonization of the Ethereum ecosystem as an inspiring achievement. Kentrup urges the global tech and business community to join the battle against climate change by supporting genuinely green projects.\n\nThe Future of Sustainable Blockchain And Crypto\n\nSteven Haft, head of global partnerships at Consensys, points out Ethereum\u2019s significant standing in the blockchain world. He views the \u2018greened\u2019 Ethereum and Web3 technology as attractive for climate-focused projects. Haft emphasizes the Ethereum Climate Platform\u2019s commitment to addressing Ethereum\u2019s past environmental impact and using research as a foundation for future sustainability pledges.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake system marks a pivotal moment in the blockchain industry\u2019s journey toward sustainability. A 99.97% reduction in emissions is significant. Current annual emission rates equate to 5 round-trip airplane flights from London to New York. Furthermore, the network is powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy (32% renewables and 16% nuclear). There is still room for improvement, but the overall change is significant."
