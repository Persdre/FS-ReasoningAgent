        "title": "The latest assessment of public Ethereum\u2019s readiness for enterprise usage - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "In the middle of last year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) assessed the readiness of the public Ethereum mainnet for enterprise use cases. It concluded it was ready but with a few caveats. Today the EEA published its latest assessment, reducing its caveats.\n\nLike the previous report, the paper doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the challenges. But it does come across as pretty bullish.\n\nThat said, it surprisingly undersells itself in one important area. It describes the advantages to business as the \u201cstrong ecosystem, security, and decentralization.\u201d The reference to the strong ecosystem is a bit of an understatement. The consumer reach of public blockchain, and Ethereum in particular, is like a magnet for financial services firms seeking global distribution. Private blockchains do fine for institutional usage.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why so many institutions are exploring public blockchain, including SWIFT, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Citi, UBS and and JP Morgan. Asset managers are leading the way with Franklin Templeton\u2019s high profile blockchain money market fund \u2013 although the biggest chunk of that is on Stellar.\n\nOne massive Ethereum accomplishment since the previous assessment was \u201cThe Merge\u201d, Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake (PoS) which addressed the environmental concerns.\n\nNonetheless, the EEA acknowledges that PoS comes with downsides. Businesses are probably a little less concerned about the possibility of greater centralization. But the potential to exclude or reorder transactions (frontrunning) to achieve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is recognized as a challenge for business.\n\nPrivacy and scalability\n\nPrivacy and scalability are two of the biggest issues. The takeup of Layer 2 solutions has grown enormously in the past 18 months, which addresses scalability and costs. However, that also comes with some tradeoffs. One of the biggest criticisms of private blockchains is fragmentation, which is happening because of numerous layer 2 solutions. They also add complexity but, at the same time, provide more choice.\n\nThe one upside is bridges that enable interoperability for layer 2 solutions can be more secure than cross chain bridges, but are still a risk. In 2022 the value lost in hacks was $3.8 billion, according to Chainalysis, with bridges making up the majority.\n\nBeyond layer 2 solutions, scalability will be addressed at the mainnet level with Ethereum\u2019s plans for sharding.\n\n\u201cPrivacy remains a paramount concern, particularly in the context of Ethereum\u2019s application in business and financial systems,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs a result, many opt for private chains, which pose their own set of challenges, including the complexities of maintaining nodes and establishing trust among participants.\u201d However, increasingly privacy is addressed with zero knowledge proofs and other privacy enhancing technologies. Over time their scalability is being addressed.\n\nEY\u2019s Paul Brody did a good job of managing expectations. \u201cThe most consistent thing missing from every analysis is a reasonable sense of timeline,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe blockchain industry is far too big to go back to the days of 100-200% annual growth. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThis is a multi-decade project, and if we want to sustain our enthusiasm and our energy to complete this transformational and valuable task, we need to calibrate our expectations accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe author holds nominal amounts of Ethereum for experimentation."

        "content": "The PBS Foundation is opening applications for an initial $1 million in grants for research and development on Ethereum proposer-builder separation.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s pilot phase drew support from Coinbase, Consensys, Fenbushi Capital, Flashbots, Paradigm, the Uniswap Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nGrants will be disbursed by a council. The council includes representatives from Blocknative, Consensys, the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots, among others. The foundation\u2019s grant lead is Eugene Leventhal from the research group Metagov.\n\nRead more: For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck\n\nFirst proposed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, proposer-builder separation (PBS) is the concept of separating proposers \u2014 which submit transaction bundles to validators on a blockchain \u2014 and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nPBS represents an attempt at decentralization, as the combination of proposing and building gives well-heeled centralized mining pools a competitive advantage.\n\nPBS first went into effect after Ethereum\u2019s Merge to proof-of-stake. Now, the PBS Foundation aims to promote research and infrastructure to address some of the challenges the concept currently faces.\n\nNotably, MEV-boost relays have become centralized since the Merge. Relayers operate between block builders and validators on maximal extractable value (MEV) boosted transactions, selecting blocks with the highest possible fees. Roughly 90% of transactions in the last 500 epochs, or roughly two days, made use of MEV-boost. Of MEV-boost transactions in the past 24 hours, roughly 97% have been handled by five relayers, according to relayscan.\n\nBlocknative, once among those top relayers, discontinued its service in September, citing economic viability concerns. Relayers do not currently collect fees. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs a large relayer, has advocated fee structures outside of public goods funding to incentivize more relayers to join the fray.\n\nA spokesperson for the PBS Foundation said the grant funding could be used to fund relayers, with a particular emphasis on those who introduce novel designs for relaying.\n\nThe funding will also be focused on community and educational materials, data transparency on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and blocks, and research on how PBS can be improved \u2014 or even enshrined \u2014 on both the primary network and on layer-2 networks.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said.

The team aims to release a blog post detailing the fork during the week of Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 giving stakeholders a week to prepare for the update.\n\nDencun upgrade timeline\n\nThe meeting set out a draft timeline for the testing phase of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nFollowing the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, 2024, developers plan to run tests on other networks \u2014 Sepolia on Jan. 31, 2024, and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nThe developers aim to deploy the changes on the mainnet by the end of February 2024 if everything goes smoothly. However, these dates are subject to change based on the results of the testnet forks.\n\nDencun will be Ethereum\u2019s first major upgrade since \u2018Shapella\u2019 earlier this year, which was a significant milestone in itself, enabling staked ether (ETH) withdrawals from the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, a major aspect of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This new process is designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data storage, a move that is expected to reduce fees for Layer 2 rollups and scale the blockchain by increasing space for \u201cblobs\u201d of data.\n\nBy improving data handling capabilities and efficiency, it aims to enhance the performance of rollups and, consequently, the overall throughput and affordability of the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cLayer 3 app-chains\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, the meeting also highlighted a collaboration between Avail and StarkWare. The partnership aims to augment data availability for appchains within the Starknet Layer 2 network. Leveraging Madara, a customizable sequencer, this initiative seeks to develop app-chains that will function as Layer 3 solutions within the Starknet ecosystem.\n\nThese Layer 3 app-chains, powered by the combined efforts of Avail and StarkWare, aim to revolutionize data availability modes, including validium and sovereign rollups. This, in turn, will help optimize transaction processing efficiency and finality, which is crucial for blockchain scalability.\n\nThe developers also touched upon Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. They reiterated their commitment to maintaining Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the space, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to meet the ever-evolving demands of the market.\n\nThe meeting also provided a platform for developers to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Ethereum. From addressing network congestion issues to enhancing user experience, the developers explored a range of topics that are critical to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and its users\u2019 needs.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The Sepolia and Holesky testnet launches are scheduled for January 31 and February 7, 2024.\n\nSo, if no major issues arise, we're looking at the following schedule: \u2013 Goerli: Jan 17, 6:32:00 UTC\n\n\u2013 Sepolia: Jan 30, 22:51:12 UTC\n\n\u2013 Holesky: Feb 7, 11:34:24 UTC \u2026 and then, mainnet \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/JFRt0ZHAi8 \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nAccording to Ethereum protocol support lead Tim Beiko, the dates for the three testnet phases are not yet final. They are thus subject to change if developers encounter major issues during the testnet.\n\nBeiko added that a blog post covering details of the fork will be released within the second week of January 2024 to provide stakeholders with ample time to adjust to the updates.\n\nThe meeting discussed pending issues with the Dencun upgrade. In particular, the developers discussed requirements for implementing \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a process that would enhance Ethereums data storage capacity by using \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nBlobs are a new type of transaction with extra space for data designed to lower Ethereum gas fees by moving rollup data from the expensive EVM layer to the consensus layer.\n\nProto-danksharding limits the number of blobs in each block (16 per block, limited to 128 KB each). This adds about 2 MB of space to each processed block. The proposal for proto-danksharding was first forwarded through EIP-4844.\n\nDevelopers also discussed recent developments for Layer 3 app-chains, particularly the recent partnership between Avail and StarkWare. Avail has partnered with StarkWare to integrate their data-availability solutions for app-chains within the latter\u2019s Layer 2 network. The integration will use StarkWare\u2019s Madara sequencer to build app-chains that can function as Layer 3 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade represents Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade after the Shapella hard fork earlier in April, which introduced staked ether withdrawals."

Should we expect a growth of the stablecoin market on the Ethereum blockchain before witnessing the true cryptocurrency bull run?\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe latest report from Six Degree highlights a significant drop in the supply of stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain from 2022 to date\n\nAccording to the latest report from the on-chain analysis company Six Degree, the supply of stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain has decreased by over 35% since reaching its peak in March 2022.\n\nIn that period, the total supply of fiat-backed stable cryptographic coins on the

Ethereum to fiat currencies, in a continuous downward trend.\n\nOnly at the end of September/beginning of October 2023 did things start to take a different turn, with the total supply of stablecoins on the blockchain starting to grow again but at a very slow pace.\n\nThis trend has not only affected Ethereum but all decentralized networks that support stablecoins, with the only exceptional case represented by Tron which has seen the aforementioned metric increase by 57% from 2022 to date.\n\nLooking more closely at the composition of the Ethereum stable market, we can see that almost half of these tokens are held in so-called \u201cexternal owned accounts\u201d (EOA), which are addresses of private users.\n\nA good 30% is managed by centralized exchanges which represent the main trading platforms for exchanges between stablecoins and bitcoin.\n\nFollowing are other entities that own a significant portion of stable on Ethereum: Bridge, DeFi protocols, and multisignature wallets (which usually represent the wallets of crypto project teams).\n\nIt is very interesting to note how the Six Degree report relates the trend of stablecoin supply on Ethereum with the price performance of Bitcoin in recent years.\n\nIn particular, the focus of attention is on the fact that during the last bull market of 2021, the price growth of Bitcoin was accompanied by an increase in the presence of stablecoins in DeFi on the blockchain in question.\n\nAt the same time, the bearish market that started in 2022 saw a strong contraction of these coins in DeFi, which shortly after reached one of the lowest values in recent years.\n\nThe relationship was only recently interrupted with the latest crypto market rally, in which there was no longer the same interdependence between stablecoins in DeFi on Ethereum.\n\nThis is a positive signal for ETH and for the market as a whole: when the stable sector sees a return to the all-time highs of 2022, we can expect a very strong price pump for the major crypto assets.\n\nTether (USDT) supply growing at the expense of USDC and BUSD\n\nTrying to observe the situation more closely, without focusing exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain stablecoin market, let\u2019s see which coins have contributed the most to the contraction of 2022 just described in the previous paragraph.\n\nIt is immediately noticeable that Tether (USDT), after experiencing a slight decrease in its total supply in mid-2022, immediately recovered all the lost ground, even reaching historical highs in terms of market capitalization for stablecoins.\n\nPaolo Ardoino\u2019s currency is therefore the only exception to this trend.\n\nThe largest growth has been in the Tron network, which currently has 48.8 billion USDT, while on Ethereum the currency has barely managed to recover the 2022 highs at 41 billion USDT.\n\nOther blockchains like BSC, Arbitrum, Solana, etc., capitalize on a small percentage of the total supply of crypto held by Tether.\n\nOn the opposite side, we can clearly see that USDC represents one of the main contributors to the decrease in the total supply of stablecoins on Ethereum.\n\nOn this chain, in fact, the currency still has a deficit of 25.6 billion dollars compared to the historical highs of February 2022.\n\nUnlike USDT, the presence of USDC on Tron is non-existent, and in general, the supply of the stablecoin has not recovered from last year\u2019s sharp decline.\n\nThe hope is that the bearish trend can stabilize and that USDC can attract capital that would likely be poured into DeFi applications, giving the right push for a rise in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nAnother protagonist of the reduction of stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain is BUSD, a resource managed until recently by Binance and issued by Paxos, which a few months ago received a notice from the SEC to cease its activities.\n\nIn particular, Paxos is no longer authorized to issue this type of stablecoin and Binance is obliged to reduce its presence in the market.\n\nDue to these events, the federal agency BUSD has seen a drastic reduction in its market strength, going from 18.19 billion dollars in February 2022 to the current 1.46 billion dollars.\n\nObviously BUSD is destined to disappear."

Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nA Series of Strategic Airdrops\n\nThe remarkable rise in Solana\u2019s user activity is largely attributed to a series of lucrative token airdrops by various protocols on the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network. For instance, the Solana-based oracle network Pyth (PYTH) executed an airdrop of 250 million PYTH tokens, valued at approximately $77 million, to its early adopters on November 20. Additionally, Jito, another Solana-based project, followed suit with an airdrop of tokens worth $225 million on December 7. The anticipation around these airdrops has fueled a significant uptick in network engagement.\n\nJupiter, a leading swap aggregator and DeFi protocol on Solana, has also been a major contributor to this uptrend. The platform\u2019s announcement of an upcoming airdrop of 4 billion JUP tokens scheduled for January has generated considerable excitement. Concurrently, the dog-themed token BONK has seen a staggering 544.4% rally over the past month, further enhancing the network\u2019s activity and attracting more users.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

According to Messari, nearly 60% of Solana\u2019s DEX volume is now channeled through Jupiter, surpassing the volumes of Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. Orca, another DEX on Solana, has emerged as the second-largest DEX in the crypto world, trailing only Uniswap V3.\n\nIn parallel, Solana\u2019s Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market has also witnessed an impressive growth spurt. Sales volume in this sector has escalated by almost 500% in the last 90 days, marking a significant milestone for Solana in the burgeoning NFT space.\n\nImplications and Future Prospects\n\nThe surge in activity on Solana is a testament to the evolving landscape of blockchain technology and user preferences. While Ethereum has long been a dominant player in the blockchain ecosystem, the rapid growth of Solana suggests a diversifying market with increasing opportunities for emerging platforms. This shift could herald a new era in blockchain technology, where innovation, user engagement, and strategic initiatives become key drivers of success.\n\nAs Solana continues to gain momentum, it will be intriguing to watch how it shapes the future of blockchain technology and digital finance. With its growing DeFi and NFT sectors, Solana is positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the blockchain space, challenging the long-standing dominance of Ethereum and potentially reshaping the digital asset market.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s native asset SOL flipped XRP this morning to again become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAfter gaining more than 700% since its market bottomed out at the end of last year, SOL is now valued at nearly $34 billion. XRP and SOL trail only binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThis makes SOL one of the best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies of 2023. XRP, meanwhile, has only made about 80% \u2014 about the same as ether \u2014 but both have underperformed against bitcoin this year.\n\nXRP must still deal with a jury trial in Ripple\u2019s long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission saga. A federal court in July found the firm\u2019s programmatic sales to retail investors through crypto exchanges and other platforms didn\u2019t amount to securities, while direct sales to institutional investors did.\n\nRead more: Judge rules in SEC case vs Ripple\n\nThe trial, set for next spring, should finally determine to what extent Ripple Labs is culpable for flouting US securities laws, after the SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in October. A settlement in the meantime is still possible.\n\nWhile Solana spent most of the third quarter of 2021 \u2014 peak bull market \u2014 ahead of XRP and a top-five coin behind tether, its more recent overperformance can in part be explained by how severely it crashed around the FTX debacle last November.\n\nClick play to watch Solana recover from its crash last year\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was invested heavily in projects across the Solana space, including SOL itself, and the crypto crashed by nearly two-thirds in three days when the market lost faith in cryptocurrencies orbiting the FTX co-founder. BTC and ETH meanwhile took only a 20% hit.\n\nSolana was a top-10 token before FTX\u2019s downfall, worth about half as much as XRP. In the months after, Solana ranked at the tail end of the top 20, behind polkadot (DOT), tron (TRX) and memecoin shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nNever underestimate the power of dog coins\n\nSolana has been busy catching up all year, propelled in part by a commitment from its developers to shake the network\u2019s association with Bankman-Fried, whose entities still hold claim to nearly $2 billion in SOL at current prices to be unlocked over the next few years.\n\nThe network boasts much of the same utility as smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, Avalanche and BNB Chain, albeit with its own unique brand of consensus, technology and tokenomics developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\n\nApps and tokens run atop Solana, including decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSolana\u2019s overall dominance, which measures how much of the entire market is SOL, is at 2.13%, 0.6 percentage points lower than its November 2021 record.\n\nHype around new Solana-centric projects has helped inspire a certain Solanaissance. BONK, the network\u2019s resident dog coin, has seen its price multiply 100 times over the past two months \u2014 even after a healthy 50% correction this week.\n\nRead more: BONK\u2019s price pumped harder around Coinbase listing than any other crypto this year\n\nBONK mania even led to significant markups for Solana-branded smartphones upon realization that each one had been preloaded with 30 million BONK ($550) \u2014 about the same as the retail value of the device.\n\nElsewhere, the liquid staking protocol Jito airdropped $165 million worth of its new token, JTO, to its users earlier this month. Traders pushed the price of JTO higher following the distribution, with the whole process adding about $300 million in market value to the Solana ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet.. BONK and Jito are combining forces to seed Solana users with Christmas cheer\n\nThe anticipation of further airdrops scaled to Solana activity has since helped drive on-chain volumes to yearly highs.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) across its network is also up, now at $1 billion compared to $300 million in September.\n\nAlthough, that jump is mostly attributed to the rising price of SOL; there\u2019s currently 14 million SOL locked on the network right now, one-third less than the 21 million SOL staked at the start of the year, and 25% less than in September.\n\nSolana almost closer than ever to flipping Ethereum\n\nIn any case, now that SOL seems set to stay ahead of XRP, some might wonder how far away it is from eclipsing BNB. The token is the native asset for Binance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain, and Binance users can also use it to cover trading fees and participation in initial coin offerings and the like.\n\nBNB faces its own set of challenges due to Binance\u2019s run-in with US regulators, which has resulted in mammoth fines, a years-long financial surveillance mandate and the exit of co-founder Changpeng Zhao as CEO.\n\nRead more: Binance says the SEC can\u2019t use DOJ plea deals as proof of guilt\n\nTurns out, outside of the last bull market\u2019s peak in late 2021, solana has never been closer to flipping BNB in their shared history. BNB\u2019s market cap is now just 20% more than SOL\u2019s, down drastically from 300% higher only three months ago.\n\nThe gap between Solana and Ethereum is still a long way off completely closing\n\nSolana\u2019s hopes of flipping Ethereum seem far less realistic right now. But there is progress: Ethereum\u2019s market value is now about 700% more than Solana\u2019s, its lowest point since peak bull market in 2021.\n\nETH was worth nearly 40 times more than Solana at the start of the year.\n\nSOL would still need to hit a price equal to more than twice its current all-time high, multiplying eight times to $625, to reach ETH\u2019s current valuation. Ethereum, of course, would have to stagnate the entire time.\n\nSo, if Solana flipping Ethereum were to happen at all, it would likely take multiple bull and bear cycles for Solana to properly narrow the gap.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Brandt, known for his candid opinions, went a step further by shorting Ethereum to $650, labeling it a \u201cpiece of junk.\u201d\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThis negative sentiment toward Ethereum is not isolated. Patrick Riley, Founder and CEO of Reaper Financial, has previously criticized Ethereum, likening it to a \u201cdying horse.\u201d Riley believes that XRP stands to benefit from Ethereum\u2019s perceived weaknesses.\n\nBrandt\u2019s Scathing Remarks on ETH\n\nBrandt, with a following of 707.7K on the X platform, conveyed his critical stance on Ethereum. He highlighted the disparity between Ethereum and Bitcoin, dismissing Ethereum as a store of value. He further criticized Ethereum\u2019s functionality and gas prices, branding it as a \u201cpiece of junk.\u201d Brandt boldly predicted that Ethereum might no longer be listed as an asset within the next decade.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1735433545458520178?s=20\n\nShorting ETH to $650\n\nUndeterred by potential market movements, Brandt followed through with his words by shorting Ethereum. His targets ranged from $1,000 to $650, showcasing his confidence in a significant downturn for the cryptocurrency.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1736725295628276152?s=20\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

The trading volume surged by 29.42%, with $10.45 billion worth of ETH changing hands on crypto exchanges. Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,120 and $2,249 during this period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Metrics\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s performance, it is up by 0.78% in the weekly charts. However, double-digit gains are evident in the monthly and annual charts at 14.3% and 89.8%, respectively. Despite being 54% down from its November 2021 all-time high of $4,891, optimism prevails regarding a potential narrowing of this gap in the coming year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Community Support\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain boasts robust support from the crypto community, primarily due to its flexibility in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Developers favor the platform for its adaptability and continuous efforts to enhance its ecosystem.\n\nAlso Read: US SEC Delays Decision on Multiple Ethereum ETFs, Public Input Invited\n\nPositive Developments in Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to improving its economy is evident through its shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin is actively involved in redesigning the network to boost performance and staking features.\n\nFuture Expectations for Ethereum\n\nDespite recent criticisms and shorting actions, Ethereum is expected to rally alongside Bitcoin next year. This optimism stems from two major upcoming events: the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US and the halving, both of which are anticipated to significantly impact BTC prices.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum finds itself at a crossroads with divergent opinions from industry figures. While Peter Brandt\u2019s bearish stance and shorting activities cast a shadow, Ethereum\u2019s strong community support and ongoing developmental efforts provide a counterbalance. Ethereum is still the biggest altcoin in the world and it\u2019s a go-to layer-1 solution in the industry.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s DeFi DEX Volume Surpasses Ethereum\u2019s For the First Time\n\nSolana (SOL) has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum (ETH) in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume over the past week. According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading. The chain\u2019s leading memecoin, BONK, dominated headlines after its meteoric rise to over a billion-dollar market capitalization, following Binance and Coinbase listings. Another Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat (WIF), has also captured attention, skyrocketing from obscurity to reach $322 million in market cap. BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff urges XRP holders to be concerned about ETHGate, emphasizing how the infamous theory affects XRP price.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum Foundation, has pointed out reasons why XRP community members should care about ETHGate.\n\nThe popular crypto adviser made this known yesterday during an exchange with an XRP holder who goes by the pseudonym XRP_Krnboy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNerayoff Sues StormX Co-Founder\n\nIn his latest tweet, Nerayoff disclosed that he had sued StormX CEO Simon Yu and co-founder of U.S. Blockchain Coalition Arry Yu for colluding with the government in fabricating charges that led to his indictment in 2019.\n\nNerayoff, who has been commenting on ETHGate for months, alleged that Simon and Arry stole his tokens worth millions of dollars when they leveled extortion charges against him.\n\nThe crypto advisor revealed that he has enough evidence, including voice recordings, to show that Simon and Arry offered him more tokens in order to silence him.\n\nWhy XRP Holders Should Care About ETHGate\n\nCommenting on the development, XRP_Krnboy said XRP community members do not care about ETHGate. The X user stated that Ripple needs to settle its lawsuit with the SEC to set the stage for a potential XRP rally.\n\nFurthermore, XRP_Krnboy expressed concern about XRP\u2019s current price, suggesting that it seems stuck around the $0.60 level.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nResponding, Nerayoff highlighted two major reasons why XRP enthusiasts should care about ETHGate. According to Nerayoff, the so-called ETHGate theory is the major reason why XRP is still stuck around $0.60.\n\nIn addition, the former Ethereum advisor stated that XRP holders should be concerned about the corruption happening beyond their tokens if they care about living in a free society.\n\nInvestors in XRP don\u2019t give a shit about #ethgate? You should care because that why $XRP is as you say \u201c$0.6 omg\u201d. More importantly you should care about this level of corruption beyond your tokens if you care about living in a free society. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) December 21, 2023\n\nETHGate Scandal and Debate\n\nFor context, ETHGate is a theory that has gone viral in the crypto space for years. Proponents of the theory alleged that the team behind Ethereum fostered relationships with prominent SEC officials to create a favorable regulatory environment for ETH to the detriment of other crypto assets.\n\nThis relationship, according to critics, prompted former SEC director William Hinman to declare ETH alongside Bitcoin as non-securities in 2018. In his remark, Hinman stated that ETH has become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over the years and should no longer be classified as a security.\n\nOn the contrary, several crypto proponents, including Nerayoff, argued that Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO displayed less decentralization than initial sales of other digital assets.\n\nTo corroborate this claim, former Ethereum core developer Lane Rettig alleged that 70% of ETH supply was distributed during the pre-mine stage.\n\nHe added that only a few individuals purchased a huge percentage of the pre-mine ETH because they participated pseudonymously during the sales. To this day, no one knows the identity of the whales that scooped the huge amounts of pre-mined ETH."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is extending its breakthrough for the year as its record-breaking transaction volume exceeds that of Ethereum (ETH) on key trading platforms.\n\nThe intriguing performance of Solana has placed the cryptocurrency on the radar of most traders. At press time, the digital currency soared as high as 12.23% in the past 24 hours to $87.18. In tandem, Solana\u2019s market capitalization has jumped by more than 12% to $37,245,046,339, as the 24-hour trading volume recorded a 100% jump to $4,455,508,322.\n\nWith the current outlook, Solana has now surpassed XRP in market capitalization, as the latter is now worth just $33,431,974,071.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSolana Outranking Ethereum\n\nAccording to insights from Kaiko Researcher Riyad Carey, Solana\u2019s trading volume on Upbit has surpassed that of Ethereum for 55 consecutive days. The same trend surfaced on MEXC, where Ethereum\u2019s volume has lagged behind Solana\u2019s for 15 days straight.\n\nKraken and Coinbase Global Inc are not left behind, with Solana outpacing Ethereum for 9 days out of the past 14 on the former and 3 of the past 13 days on the latter. This impressive performance has also rubbed off on the differentials in the price of the two assets,\n\nSOL has done more volume than ETH: 9 out of the last 14 days on Kraken\n\n3 out of the last 13 days on Coinbase\n\nThe last 15 days straight on MEXC\n\nThe last 55 days straight on Upbit The @blknoiz06 Effect pic.twitter.com/c4LLsX24ya \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) December 20, 2023\n\nWhile Solana has jumped by 345% in the past 3 months, Ethereum has only managed to grow by 40% within the same period. With the growing debate about Ethereum and Solana, by all metrics, the latter is winning as a high-performance outfit, however, its market capitalization is a fraction of the $270,614,040,135 that Ethereum boasts of.\n\nThe Solana Advantage\n\nAs blockchain networks with established developer ecosystems, it is worth noting that both Ethereum and Solana have robust developmental activity at this time. The shift in embrace, however, is based on sentiments that most traders are nursing at times.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other Ethereum-based memecoins have helped elevate the status of the blockchain in times past, investors are now more gravitating to BONK, the sensational memecoin built on Solana. The debut of an airdrop for BONK and Solana Mobile phone owners has also driven sentiment through the roof in recent times.\n\nBesides the influence of BONK, the fact that all fears related to the liquidation of SOL as a major asset owned by bankrupt FTX Exchange have been allayed is further giving investors the confidence to go all out on the coin. For its ecosystem potential, top firms like VanEck have tipped Solana to hit a high price target of $3,211 before the end of this decade."

        "content": "Having retested the $2,100 level, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, is poised for an upward movement. At the time of reporting, the Ethereum (ETH) price stands at $2,200, with a market capitalization of $264 billion.\n\nEthereum Exchange Outflows\n\nDespite the current ETH price volatility, the Ethereum supply at the exchanges has hit a new low. This is a positive indicator showing that more investors are willing to hold their ETH for the long term.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSantiment, an on-chain data provider, reports that with Ethereum\u2019s market value slightly above $2,170, major exchange wallets are actively transferring coins to smaller wallets or withdrawing them from exchanges altogether. In the past 24 hours, a total of 240,000 ETH has been shifted from these large wallets, representing a 2.99% decrease in the amount of coins held.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that while altcoins are exhibiting strength, it might not be a definitive trend at this point. He notes that Ethereum (ETH) currently lacks momentum, but anticipates a shift in the coming weeks. Van de Poppe predicts a money flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum, leading to a strong performance by altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, potentially coinciding with a peak in Bitcoin dominance.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s trading session, Ethereum made an early attempt at a rally, amidst the ongoing market noise. The $2100 level emerges as a crucial support, having played a significant role in the past. This level, once a resistance point in the broader market, witnessed repeated challenges from an ascending triangle. Short-term pullbacks are expected to find support around this area. Even in the event of a breakdown below $2100, the 50-Day EMA is anticipated to provide substantial support, warranting close attention to this zone.\n\nOn the optimistic side, traders are eyeing the $2500 level as a potential target, with a considerable push expected from market participants aiming to drive Ethereum in that direction. Beyond that, the $2700 level comes into focus. The prevailing trend indicates a scenario where traders consistently seize value during every dip, reflecting an active pursuit of value by the majority of crypto traders.\n\nHowever, a breakdown below the 50-Day EMA could have negative implications for Ethereum. Additionally, the market\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates, particularly in the United States and other bond markets, is noted. Any resurgence in rates is likely to exert pressure on the market, potentially leading to a broader decline in the crypto markets, not limited to Ethereum.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

According to the insights shared, a total of 100,000,000,000,111.11 DOBE tokens and 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO were featured in the token swapping.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nVitalik Buterin on Memecoin Liquidations\n\nOver the years, memecoins looking for relevance in the industry sent some quantity of their token\u2019s supply to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s public wallet address for legitimacy proof.\n\nSoon, this wallet harbored millions of dollars worth of memecoins with no restrictions on how Vitalik could liquidate them.\n\nThe liquidations of DOBE and DOJO mark two of the selloffs signed by Vitalik in recent times.

In a bid to water down the growing speculations surrounding some of his transfers, Vitalik Buterin denied selling some 3,000 ETH in November last year to prove that not all affiliated transactions are best described as liquidation tools.\n\nWhile selloff is the easy explanation for some of these transfers, the movement of funds to affiliated research entities and collaborative partners also forms a major motivation behind some of the Vitalik-linked transfers."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Gas Price Surge: Analyzing Causes and Consequences\n\nOver the past two months, Ethereum has seen a notable increase in gas prices.\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s gas fees can be attributed to several factors, including the launch of the Buterin Cards NFT collection, which caused a 13% spike in fees, and the network\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism through Ethereum 2.0, which historically correlates with demand and activity on the network.\n\nThe spike in gas fees reflects growing demand within the DeFi sector but also leads to network congestion.\n\nEthereum gas prices have experienced a significant surge over the past two months, with the median gas price peaking at over 58.6 Gwei this early December 2023, almost doubling from the previous month and marking the highest point since October this year\u200b\u200b.\n\nMany factors led to this rise. Traditionally, Ethereum network users have been accustomed to paying gas fees. However, recent trends have seen these fees escalate dramatically. In a striking instance last May, one user even incurred an eye-watering $118,600 in ETH for a single transaction, highlighting a significant uptick in gas fees.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nFactors Leading to the Rise in Ethereum Gas Prices\n\nOne of the notable triggers for the recent surge in Ethereum gas fees was the introduction of the Buterin Cards NFT collection on December 1st. This event alone led to a 13% increase in gas fees on the Ethereum network within just three hours, surpassing fees from other significant contributors like Uniswap and Tether\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nMeanwhile, the transition of Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism through Ethereum 2.0 brought about a substantial decrease in gas fees due to a significant reduction in energy consumption by 99.9%. However, gas fees on Ethereum have historically mirrored the demand on the network, with higher activity periods leading to increased fees\u200b\u200b.\n\nA resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum has also contributed to rising gas fees. Platforms like Uniswap experienced a surge in transaction volumes, particularly with meme coins, pushing the block space demand higher and subsequently increasing gas fees\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nImplications of Rising Ethereum Gas Prices\n\nRising gas fees reflect the growing demand for Ethereum\u2019s network, particularly in the DeFi sector. However, this increase in fees can also lead to network congestion, affecting transaction speeds and costs for users.\n\nThe spike in Ethereum\u2019s transaction costs has intensified interest in alternative layer-1 blockchains, such as BNB Chain, Solana, and Cardano. These alternatives are being explored for their lower fees and faster transaction capabilities, although it\u2019s uncertain whether they will substantially impact Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi sector\u200b\u200b.\n\nBut ultimately, increasing gas fees could potentially signal a market rally, which might be beneficial to leading Ethereum-based DeFi platforms. However, tokens like Uniswap (UNI) have seen some stagnation in prices despite the overall increase in transaction volumes and network activity\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum gas prices is a multifaceted issue influenced by factors like NFT launches, the transition to Ethereum 2.0, and increased DeFi activity. While it reflects the growing demand for Ethereum\u2019s network, it also raises concerns about network congestion and prompts users and investors to explore other blockchain platforms. As the landscape of blockchain technology and digital finance continues to evolve, these developments will be important to look at in analyzing the state of the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Investors are sifting through the noise to identify gems that are likely to significantly breakout ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stand out as the most stable investments in a crypto portfolio, select best-performing top altcoins could be the game changer, considering the gains posted by Ethereum Express (ETH), Bonk (BONK) and Stacks (STX).\n\nAlthough the crypto market widely reversed gains accrued last week from Friday through to Monday, the anticipation of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval in January has helped to steady the prices and may explain the 3% increase in market cap to $1.66 trillion, live data by CoinMarketCap shows.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Express Tops Top Altcoins To Buy For 2024\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is slowly catching investor interest, as one of the most viable tokens that could potentially break out this week. Up 8% in the last 24 hours, the crypto powering the network known for faster, safer, and cheaper layer 1 transactions, is trading at $0.0413.\n\nLike other cryptos, Ethereum Express encountered strong headwinds last week, forcing bulls to temporarily abandon the push for the uptrend at $0.043. A correction followed swiftly, as traders closed positions to protect their capital and accrued gains.\n\nThe first tentative support at $0.03 failed to relieve the selling pressure but ETE respected the next crucial level slightly above $0.021. This support area encouraged traders to enter new long positions, boosting Ethereum Express recovery.\n\nA cup and handle pattern drawn on the four-hour chart reveals a potential 71% breakout to $0.07. However, ETE must rise above the neckline resistance at $0.0413 to validate the breakout.\n\nBased on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator a stronger momentum backs the uptrend in ETE. Therefore, traders considering more exposure, could long Ethereum Express as soon as it breaks or successfully retests the neckline resistance.\n\nBonk Pauses Price Discovery, Here\u2019s What Next\n\nInvestors who bought Bonk to speculate on exchange listings on Coinbase and Binance last week have been selling to lock in the profits made. This has continued to weigh down on the meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, with losses extending from a recent all-time high of $0.000035 to $0.000019, down 1.4% in 24 hours.\n\nDespite the meltdown, Bonk upholds a 160% increase in a fortnight and 445% in a month.\n\nThe outlook from the MACD reinforces the bearish theory. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the confluence support created by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) and the purple horizontal ray at $0.00001891 to trigger another buying spree and boost Bonk\u2019s recovery back to the ATH.\n\nIf the downtrend carries on below the highlighted immediate support, traders may want to consider entering short positions in BONK and targeting lower support areas at $0.000016, $0.000013, and the 200 EMA (in purple) at $0.0000109.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Bonk may resume the uptrend quickly if the confluence support holds and a breakout follows above the descending channel. While Bonk is still one of the best crypto performers in December, finding a good entry position is the tricky part.\n\nStacks Price Prediction: Will STX Validate Cup and Handle Breakout?\n\nStacks price extended the up leg on Tuesday with another 1.5% increase in 24 hours in addition to a 22% growth in seven days and an 87% rise in a month. The token native to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most reliable smart contracts layer, allowing developers to build apps is trading at $1.19 after running into resistance at $1.26.\n\nWith a short-term cup and handle likely to lead to another breakout, the headache investors have is finding a suitable entry position. However, if STX breaks above the neckline resistance at $1.19, the next breakout could rise 30% to $1.82.\n\nFor now, the path with the least resistance based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is downwards. Bears have the upper hand, especially with Stacks trading below a broken support \u2014 now resistance at $1.2.\n\nIf declines continue in the handle section of the pattern, traders may want to spot other tentative support areas, starting with the 20 EMA at $1.12, the buyer congestion at $1.1, and the 200 EMA at $0.895.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Solana has seen a 400% growth in user activity in Q4.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors have also seen considerable growth in the past few months.\n\nDaily user activity on Solana [SOL] has seen a notable rise of almost 400% as the last quarter of the year nears its end. This dwarfed the meager 3% increase seen on Ethereum [ETH], on-chain data provider Messari noted in a new report.\n\nAccording to the research firm, the recent surge in new demand for Solana is due to the series of token airdrops completed by some protocols housed within the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network.\n\nFor example, on the 20th of November, the Solana-based oracle network Pyth (PYTH) completed the airdrop of 250 million PYTH tokens worth around $77 million to its early users.\n\nAlso, on the 7th of December, Jito airdropped some of its native tokens worth $225 Million to some of its users on the Solana network.\n\nJupiter, a swap aggregator and one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana, recently announced that its highly anticipated airdrop of 4 billion JUP tokens will take place in January.\n\nApart from the series of airdrops by projects on the chain, the meteoric rise in BONK\u2019s value has contributed to the upswing in Solana\u2019s network activity.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi and NFT ecosystems see growth\n\nExchanging hands at $0.0000209 at press time, the dog-themed token has rallied by 544.4% in the last month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe airdrops have culminated in a 30% growth in SOL\u2019s value in the last month. According to Messari:\n\n\u201cCombined with the recent airdrops and positive price appreciation, these factors have helped make Solana firmly the second-largest chain by DEX volumes, closely rivaling Ethereum for the top spot.\u201d\n\nIn the last month, there has been a significant increase in activity across the DEXes on Solana. AMBCrypto found that the total volume of transactions completed through Solana-based DEXes has grown by 255% in the last 30 days.\n\nAs of the 18th of December, this totaled $871 million, data from Artemis showed.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAccording to Messari:\n\n\u201cNearly 60% of Solana\u2019s DEX volume is driven through DEX aggregator Jupiter, which has eclipsed Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. Jupiter\u2019s trades are routed to underlying DEXs that settle the order, the largest of which has been Orca. Orca is now the second largest DEX in all of crypto, behind Uniswap V3 on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nFurther, Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) vertical has also seen an impressive performance in the past few months. As highlighted in the report, sales volume on the chain has increased by almost 500% in the last 90 days."

        "content": "Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius has sold off $250 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum, in the last 30 days, according to on-chain data.\n\nCrypto sleuth Apes_Prologue reported that Ether accounted for $243 million, or 97%, of the bankrupt firm\u2019s selling activities during the period.\n\nSeparately, blockchain analytical firm Peckshield confirmed that the defunct lender transferred over 10,000 units of ETH, worth approximately $24 million, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and cryptocurrency brokerage platform FalconX during the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Apes_Prologue added that Celsius also dumped over $3 million in stablecoins, $1.3 million of Chainlink\u2019s LINK, and $1.4 million of Pax Gold. Other assets the firm sold include around $150,000 of Polygon\u2019s MATIC and Avalanche\u2019s AVAX tokens, respectively.\n\nWhy is Celsius selling?\n\nJef Breed, the founder of venture capital firm Breed VC, explained that Celsius might be dumping its ETH bag to capitalize MiningCo, a Bitcoin mining company that would be owned by creditors of the failed firm.\n\nBreed suggested that Fahreint (NewCo), the leading bidder in Celsius\u2019 initial bankruptcy auction, encountered regulatory obstacles in executing its plans for Bitcoin mining and Ethereum staking services. Consequently, the bankrupt company shifted its focus to a mining venture overseen by MiningCo.\n\nAs a result, Breed inferred that the firm had to liquidate a portion of its ETH holdings to secure $250 million in fiat capital, a different approach from the initial plan requiring $450 million in liquid cryptocurrency for Fahreint\u2019s proposed strategy.\n\nWhat next for ETH price?\n\nObservers believe that Celsius\u2019s selling activity might have inhibited ETH\u2019s price from soaring recently.\n\nData from CryptoSlate shows that ETH\u2019s price has considerably struggled against other large-cap cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche, whose values have rapidly risen during the last 30 days.\n\nFor context, SOL\u2019s price increased by around 20% during the last seven days, while ETH is up by only 2% during the same period.\n\nHowever, market analysts suggest that \u201cthe selling pressure may be complete and ETH could rip up over the coming months with the spot ETH ETF narrative on the horizon.\u201d ETH is trading for $2230 as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nTLDR\n\nInvestors seek analysis for Ethereum\u2019s price trend as predictions for a $3k surge roll in.\n\nThe altcoin would trigger a bullish round if it passed the $2,320 resistance.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s presale continues its upward movement, offering significant returns.\n\nThe crypto market has had an insane year, with top DeFi projects bouncing from high to low levels on the chart. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, has experienced its fair share of volatility, seemingly kickstarting the altcoin season at some point and now falling towards its support level. These changes have left investors wondering whether the token can still meet certain predictions and hit $3,000 by year-end.\n\nWhile speculations regarding Ethereum\u2019s features have become a major discussion, a new ETH ICO has been making its rounds in the market, drawing attention to its presale. NuggetRush (NUGX) is an upcoming meme-inspired project that is becoming popular for its play-to-earn mechanism. This article explores Ethereum\u2019s price movement to determine whether a $3,000 bet is realistic while discussing the token\u2019s growth potential compared to NuggetRush\u2019s.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): 2023 Predictions Are In\n\nMultiple analysts have dropped their 2023 predictions for top DeFi projects, and Ethereum has bagged a $3,000 prediction before the month\u2019s end. The altcoin has had a bearish 2023 but recently started chasing Bitcoin\u2019s rally, rising to nearly $2,400 before dropping to around the $2,200 mark. Analysts have predicted a significant surge if the token can pass its resistance of $2,320.\n\nA concrete analysis of the ETH price progression would be difficult, as several happenings also point to a bullish outlook. Recent price movements have left investors skeptical that the token could reach its support levels, ranging between $2,240 and $2,200. This aligns with predictions that the altcoin will consolidate and fall below $1,900 in a downtrend.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from the top platform, Spot On Chain, top whales have been selling their Ethereum coins. FTX and Celsius Network, but bankrupt crypto companies, have made significant ETH transactions, moving their tokens to other wallets and taking advantage of the brief price hike to $2,300. FTX deposited 1,593 ETH worth $3.66 million, while Celsius Network transferred 7,500 ETH worth $17.4 million to FalconX.\n\nEthereum\u2019s circulating supply has also dropped to great lows, hitting about 120 million ETH, a significant number for the altcoin. The pivotal movement is in line with EIP-960, a proposal made by Ethereum founder Butterin to set a hard cap on the Ethereum supply to ensure sustainability.\n\nThe community rejected the proposal, picking a flexible supply over a potential surge from scarcity. The different occurrences within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem point to uncertainty, but investors are convinced that the coin can rally to $2,320. If it hits this mark, it\u2019ll be the best crypto investment for 2023, exceeding $2,400 and potentially hitting $3,000 before the year ends.\n\nNuggetRush Is Making P2E Gaming Work For Miners\n\nNuggetRush has been a major consideration for investors seeking fair entry points and significant growth potential. With its GameFi capabilities, the blockchain ICO offers gaming, investment opportunities, and multiple earning ways.\n\nNFTs play a huge role on this platform, representing game characters and having staking capabilities, from which investors can earn a 20% APY. NuggetRush is built on the Ethereum blockchain, promising security and transparency.\n\nThe blockchain ICO launched its resale recently, and nearly 86 million tokens have been bought off the 215 million hard cap. The presale is now in its third round, selling each NUGX token at 0.013 USDT. This round is set to sell off successfully, with less than 23% of the allocated tokens left.\n\nEarly-stage investors who bought at 0.01 USDT in round one are set to claim a 100% increase in their investments when the token lists at 0.02 USDT. Purchasing in its current round offers a 53% increase compared to the 33.8% increase if Ethereum hits $3,000 this year, making it the best crypto investment for significant returns.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nConclusion\n\nAnalysts have predicted Ethereum to surge to $3,000 before 2023, and investors, knowing the market\u2019s volatility, wonder whether it is a realistic prediction. The token is thriving in the crypto market, with its price movements signifying a potential break and a chance for a huge surge.\n\nNUGX continues to attract investors with its revolutionary model, offering GameFi and charitable features. Its successful presale is a great opportunity for investors to claim tokens at discounted rates, and the list price shows the potential for significant returns, far surpassing Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\n*This article was paid.

        "title": "What is Immutable X? Demystifying the Layer 2 solution for NFTs and Web3 gaming - OKX",
        "content": "Entering the list of advanced new blockchain solutions, Immutable X is considered by many a revolutionary Layer 2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain. This new player in non-fungible token (NFT) minting and GameFi stands out for its unparalleled features. It offers gas-free NFT minting and seamless integration into the vast landscape of mainstream gaming.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we explore Immutable X, uncovering its nuances, technological foundations, and influence in the world of blockchain gaming.\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nImmutable X is a Layer 2 scaling solution within the Immutable ecosystem designed for Ethereum (ETH). Its primary focus is on NFT minting and Web3 gaming. Launched by James Ferguson, Robbie Ferguson, and Alex Connolly in Australia in 2018, Immutable X aims to democratize Web3 game development, providing a gateway for millions of gamers globally to seamlessly navigate the complexities of blockchain technology.\n\nImmutable X was a response to the challenges faced by gamers engaging with \"Gods Unchained,\" the world's first NFT trading-card game. The platform set out to address the high trading costs of NFTs within the game, setting the stage for its transformative trajectory. Immutable X has since evolved into a versatile gaming-specific blockchain, prioritizing cost-efficiency, scalability, and rapid transaction processing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nThe technology behind Immutable X\n\nAt the heart of Immutable X's functionality lies the groundbreaking Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-rollup) technology, a Layer 2 scaling solution powered by StarkWare. ZK-rollup technology combines multiple transactions into a single zero-knowledge proof, also known as the zk-STARK proof, on the Immutable network. The transactions are then securely moved as a single unit onto the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts then validate the proof, maintaining transaction details at this layer. This process guarantees near-instant confirmation, all while keeping gas fees minimal.\n\nEmpowering developers with REST APIs and SDKs\n\nImmutable X's REST APIs and software development kits (SDKs) are powerful tools empowering developers within its ecosystem. The REST APIs, or application programming interfaces, provide a streamlined approach to complex blockchain interactions. Through API calls, users can easily create and transfer NFTs without the need for direct interaction with smart contracts. This simplifies the development process, allowing for efficient integration into various platforms, spanning from gaming applications to broader decentralized ecosystems.\n\nAlongside this, SDKs support the seamless incorporation of APIs and crypto wallets into diverse applications. This not only accelerates the development timeline but also enables developers to construct NFT projects, including innovative play-to-earn games, in a matter of hours rather than weeks.\n\nExtending functionality with Immutable zkEVM\n\nImmutable boasts another Layer 2 solution, Immutable zkEVM, incorporating Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM) functionality. Powered by Polygon, Immutable zkEVM allows developers to launch smart contracts on Ethereum's Layer 1 chain and subsequently register them on Immutable. Immutable zkEVM supports effective interoperability, allowing game developers to create experiences that seamlessly interact with other games or platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem. This can broaden access and promote economies of scale.\n\nWhile Immutable X boasts zero gas fees, applying Immutable zkEVM generates minimal gas fees for using Ethereum smart contracts. These fees, although small, are notably negligible compared to the Ethereum main chain.\n\nOffsetting the carbon footprint\n\nImmutable has taken a step towards sustainability through its carbon-neutral approach. Addressing concerns related to the environmental impact of blockchain technology, the platform actively counters the carbon footprint associated with minting and trading NFTs.\n\nImmutable's approach begins by significantly reducing gas usage per NFT trade or mint, diminishing its carbon footprint. Using zero-knowledge proofs, Immutable compresses the information required for NFT transactions, making them more energy-efficient.\n\nGoing a step further, Immutable commits to offsetting the carbon footprint of all NFT transactions on its platform to zero by purchasing carbon credits. This initiative extends to NFT marketplaces and games built on Immutable, making sure the entire ecosystem is carbon-neutral.\n\nImmutable's dedication to sustainability not only aligns with the growing demand for eco-conscious initiatives but also establishes a responsible and ethical standard within the blockchain industry.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using Immutable X?\n\nImmutable X stands out as a top choice for NFT enthusiasts, offering a multitude of compelling benefits. With features like instant trade execution, zero gas fees, a remarkable capacity of up to 9,000 transactions per second (TPS), and a commitment to environmentally friendly practices, the platform delivers a seamless and cost-effective trading experience.\n\nSecurity takes precedence on Immutable X, as it leverages ZK-rollups to establish a secure and tamper-proof environment for NFT ownership and transactions. The platform's integration with the Ethereum ecosystem also enables users to effortlessly engage with various Ethereum-based platforms, services, and tools, fostering a smooth and interconnected experience within the broader Ethereum network.\n\nMeanwhile, the inclusion of extensive APIs and SDKs enriches the overall user experience, empowering developers with robust tools to innovate and create within the Immutable ecosystem.\n\nWho created Immutable?\n\nImmutable, the company behind Immutable X, is steered by a visionary team led by James Ferguson, recognized as a Forbes 30 Under 30 entrepreneur, and supported by his brother Robbie Ferguson. The project boasts investments from prominent crypto VC funds, including Coinbase, Naspers, Nirvana Capital, Apex Capital Partners, Continue Capital, and Galaxy Digital.\n\nWith the Ethereum Merge completed, Immutable may continue its development within the scaling Ethereum ecosystem. Partnerships with Param Labs and Ambrus Studios, along with the launch of a wallet SDK, underline Immutable's commitment to enhancing the developer experience and fostering growth.\n\nImmutable's native utility and governance token: IMX\n\nImmutable's native utility and governance token, IMX, is an ERC-20 token central to the platform. It serves as a cornerstone for transactions, governance, and active participation. With multifaceted functions, IMX is integral to the smooth operation and expansion of the Immutable ecosystem.\n\nTokenomics and distribution\n\nIMX employs a robust tokenomics model designed to align incentives and foster a thriving community. A departure from traditional Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), utility tokens are pre-mined and thoughtfully distributed by the project's team.\n\nAs outlined in the white paper, the maximum total supply of 2 billion IMX tokens is strategically allocated to ecosystem development (51.74%), project development (25%), public sale (5%), private sale (14.26%), and foundation reserve (4%).\n\nUse cases\n\nThe IMX token is intricately woven into the fabric of Immutable, creating an economic system where participants are rewarded for contributing to the network's growth and stability. The community uses IMX to pay transaction fees and access exclusive features or services. Moreover, IMX token holders wield governance power, enabling them to vote on crucial proposals, including reserve token allocation, developer grants, and changes in token supply.\n\nStaking IMX tokens is another rewarding endeavor within the Immutable ecosystem. Participants who choose to stake their IMX holdings receive staking rewards in the form of additional tokens or governance privileges. This mechanism not only encourages long-term commitment but also contributes to the overall security and stability of the network.\n\nThe Immutable ecosystem: Gods Unchained and beyond\n\nAs a dedicated blockchain for NFT trading and gaming experiences, Immutable has strategically positioned itself as a go-to platform for game developers seeking to leverage the potential of blockchain technology. Within the expansive umbrella of games and collectibles, Immutable's ecosystem hosts a rich tapestry of decentralized applications (DApps), creating a fertile ground for innovation and exploration.\n\nWhile \"Gods Unchained\" is considered by many to be the inaugural masterpiece, Immutable's platform is behind numerous other titles.\n\nGuild of Guardians: A roguelite mobile RPG where players build their team of Guardians to battle against the threat of the Dread while earning rewards.\n\nEmber Sword: A social sandbox MMORPG that offers a PVP and PVE player experience while allowing players to have true ownership of their in-game assets.\n\nMomoguro: A captivating storytelling RPG created by 9x Emmy-winning Baobab Studios.\n\nMetalcore: A multiplayer FPS that features mechs, tanks, infantry, and planes.\n\nIlluvium: An open-world RPG adventure game where players hunt and catch creatures to fight in arenas or trade them.\n\nThe support provided by Immutable extends beyond gaming giants, with an open invitation to developers worldwide to explore and contribute to the ecosystem. This inclusive approach fosters a diverse and thriving community, resulting in an ever-expanding collection of games.\n\nWhat's new with Immutable?\n\nIn March 2024, Immutable began dropping teasers on its X account about \"The Main Quest\". After you log into the platform's passport, you'll find a new rewards area. IMX holders have shown much excitement over X, with Immutable gearing up to open its rewards area up for more opportunities.\n\nIn another update, Immutable's Minting API marks a major advancement in the gaming and blockchain sectors. This update effectively tackles key issues that game developers commonly encounter, including complicated technical processes, challenges when managing wallets, and expensive gas fees. The Minting API streamlines and lowers the expense of creating in-game assets on a large scale.\n\nImplementing the Minting API can help support the creation of a new digital economy in games by offering batch processing, cost-effective transactions, and seamless integration with blockchain technology. Additionally, Immutable's promise to cover gas fees until September 2024 underlines its commitment to promoting a more inclusive and financially sustainable gaming ecosystem.\n\nThe final word\n\nAs Immutable solidifies its position in blockchain gaming, many expect the entity to continue to expand and innovate. Immutable is positioned as a transformative force in the gaming industry with a desire to lower barriers for both developers and gamers. The platform's continuous partnerships, technological advancements, and commitment to sustainability underscore its dedication to evolving alongside the ever-changing blockchain landscape."

        "content": "Use of the experimental data files called inscriptions was supposed to be a fad.\n\nThese inscriptions are clogging up networks leading to huge transaction fee spikes.\n\nSome blockchain purists want them to be treated as spam.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 inscriptions are out of control.\n\nThese experimental data files were supposed to be a passing fad when they emerged in early 2023 with the introduction of a protocol called Ordinals.\n\nBut now the use of inscriptions has opened another gambling playground for the rapacious crypto degen crowd.\n\nDespite being dismissed by Bitcoin purists like Jimmy Song and condemned by longtime developer Luke Dashjr, their allure is greater than ever.\n\nThe total market size for Bitcoin inscription tokens has grown to $1.5 billion.\n\nBitcoin Cats\n\nORDI, the biggest of the lot, accounts for the bulk of this valuation with a market capitalisation of $1 billion, making it the fourth largest crypto meme coin behind staples such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nThis week, crypto degens ploughed $106 million in Ether and other tokens into Bitcoin Cats, a so-called NFT game which hasn\u2019t even been created but is based on the Ordinals inscription hype.\n\nThe development further demonstrates the increasing appetite for exposure to this burgeoning crypto market among investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis trend wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\n\nPanned by many Bitcoin purists, some like Song in May even jibed that the Ordinals minting craze would eventually run out of steam.\n\nSeven months on and the opposite is proving to be the case. The Bitcoin Cats raise, which ended on Tuesday, was oversubscribed 150 times indicating the massive appetite for high-risk crypto ventures.\n\nThese guys raised $80M for a \"Bitcoins Cat\" game that is definitely not running on Bitcoin, and it's a reskin of pokemon with some random unity demos.\n\n\n\nLmaooo\n\n\n\nIt's Pixelmon all over again, but this time the exit liquidity is chinese grannies who love ordinals https://t.co/OOhBMJ2UOe pic.twitter.com/V0GO6iWvK7 \u2014 Wazz (@WazzCrypto) December 19, 2023\n\nThese guys raised $80M for a \"Bitcoins Cat\" game that is definitely not running on Bitcoin, and it's a reskin of pokemon with some random unity demos.\n\n\n\nLmaooo\n\n\n\nIt's Pixelmon all over again, but this time the exit liquidity is chinese grannies who love ordinals https://t.co/OOhBMJ2UOe pic.twitter.com/V0GO6iWvK7 \u2014 Wazz (@WazzCrypto) December 19, 2023\n\nBitcoin Cats\u2019 pitch to investors was that their investments would grant them access to the game\u2019s NFT collection. Investors will receive this NFT in exchange for staking their share of the project\u2019s native 1CAT tokens.\n\nInscriptions allow users to emulate Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality on Bitcoin. This meant users could tap embedded data such as image and audio files to create NFTs like Bored Apes and meme coins similar to Shiba Inu on Bitcoin.\n\nThis used to be a virtually impossible feat because Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain software does not have native support for smart contracts necessary to create NFTs and tokens.\n\nPivot to other blockchains\n\nInscriptions started out as a Bitcoin-only trend and rightly so because, unlike Bitcoin, other major blockchains have native smart contract functionality.\n\nDevelopers can easily create and deploy tokens \u2014 both fungible like Shiba Inu and non-fungible like Bored Apes on blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum among others.\n\nDespite this, some developers have deployed Bitcoin-style inscriptions on these blockchains.\n\nRather than creating tokens using smart contracts, these developers are inscribing data for meme coins on a blockchain transaction field called CALLDATA, an optional data string that is sent along with transactions on these networks.\n\nWhy do they do so?\n\nBecause it is cheaper than storing the same data on a smart contract as is the norm for creating tokens or NFTs on these blockchains.\n\nStress test\n\nDespite being cheaper, there is a major downside to this type of token deployment.\n\nThe data can be spammed \u2014 sent repeatedly \u2014 since it doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money to transmit on the network. As a result, many blockchains have experienced significant transaction loads in the past week.\n\nThe uptick in transaction count has proven to be a major stress test for these affected blockchains, as was the case for Bitcoin in May, leading to a degraded user experience.\n\nGas fees, or transactions costs on blockchains, have spiked, even on networks like Avalanche that are supposed to be cheaper alternatives to Ethereum.\n\nAvalanche gas fees surge to absurd levels. (@Junko__Suzuki) (@junko__suzuki/@junko__suzuki)\n\nUsers spent over $1.2 million for gas fees in total to inscribe data on Avalanche on Monday, an activity that was virtually nonexistent on the chain only a few days ago.\n\nSuch is the extent of the strain caused by these inscriptions that they even caused Arbitrum to go offline for over two hours on December 15. Inscriptions accounted for over 90% of all transactions on Arbitrum in the two hours before the chain halt, according to a Dune data dashboard created by pseudonymous blockchain analyst Hildobby.\n\nPolygon leads the way with 161 million inscriptions, followed by BNB Chain and Avalanche with 78 million and 66 million respectively. Despite hosting more than twice the number of inscriptions on Avalanche, transaction fees on Polygon did not exceed $0.10, according to the network\u2019s founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\nHighest number of inscriptions on @0xPolygon POS, 161m.\n\n\n\nMore than 2X the amount of inscriptions on the second ranked chain for inscriptions.\n\n\n\nFun part, afaik the gas fees still stayed under 10 cents, i heard horror stories that on somechains it went to as high as $400.

Longtime Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr has been vocal about his opposition to inscriptions, calling them a vulnerability in Bitcoin.\n\nSome critics even said Ordinals were \u201cdestroying lives\u201d earlier in the year, condemning the practice for making Bitcoin expensive to use in places like El Salvador.\n\nAn unknown Bitcoin purist even reported Ordinals as a vulnerability to the US government.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Solana price is up 550% since early June, defying negativity around the security label imposed by the SEC.\n\nSOL could rise 20% to the $100 psychological level before the close of 2023 if Bitcoin price builds support above $44,200.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated if the purported Ethereum killer records a weekly candlestick close below the $51.63 support.\n\nSolana (SOL) price has been on a tear, standing among the biggest gainers among the crypto top ten. This is despite regulatory FUD, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled SOL a security during its market-wide clampdown against cryptocurrency exchanges. As reported, the hard pump has seen the purported Ethereum (ETH) killer unseat Ripple (XRP) to be the fifth cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAlso Read: Solana, XRP and Cardano receive $16 million weekly inflows as Bitcoin sees outflows\n\nSolana and altcoins could fly if Bitcoin builds support above $44,200\n\nSolana (SOL) price does not show any signs of stopping, pumping hard to outperform its peers. It comes as the Solana ecosystem continues to present itself as a better hub over Ethereum, despite Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko binning the narrative that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, while new projects and airdrops provide tailwinds for Solana price, one analyst @ShadyTheWizard explains that Bitcoin price showing strength is critical to Solana and altcoins rallying. In his opinion, \u201cAs long as BTC can build support above 44.2k, everything will continue to fly.\u201d\n\nSOL/USDT 1-week chart, BTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nSolana price outlook as SOL looks unstoppable\n\nSolana price continues with a bold uptrend, recording pronounced higher highs for the past three months. Judging from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the bulls are still interested, evidenced by its inclination to the north despite SOL being massively overbought.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in the positive territory to show the bulls are in the lead, accentuated by its inclination to the north to show this was the direction with the least resistance.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Solana price extend to tag the $92.76 resistance level. Further north, SOL could extend a neck higher to tag the $100.00 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Solana price could foray into the weekly supply zone stretching between $104.70 and $136.90. To confirm the continuation of the trend, SOL must record a weekly candlestick close above the midline of this order block at $120.83.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, a rejection from the immediate barricade at $92.76 could send Solana price south, losing the $67.26 support level. An extended fall could see SOL test the $51.63 buyer congestion level. A weekly candlestick close below this level would invalidate the prevailing bullish thesis.\n\nIn the dire case, the Solana price could extend even lower to tag the support floor at $12.80, with such a move constituting an 85% drop below current levels."

        "content": "Stablecoin issuer \u2013 Tether \u2013 has placed six wallets on a blacklist, comprising five on the Ethereum network and one on Tron. The latest move reflects Tether\u2019s increased proactive approach to blocking addresses.\n\nAccording to ChainArgos, a blockchain intelligence firm, there are a few questionable transactions associated with the Ethereum addresses, potentially related to the Finiko pyramid scheme that is said to have swindled about $95 million from Russian investors.\n\nHowever, aside from this, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything unusual.\n\nThe Tron address, in contrast, shows minimal activity, featuring a lone incoming transfer of approximately $7,000 in USDT from Bitfinex, ChainArgos said in an update on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Tether has blacklisted addresses tied to illicit entities.\n\nTether first started freezing funds after a 2017 security breach where an external attacker pilfered $30 million worth of USDT from the company. Since that incident, Tether has blacklisted more than 960 Ethereum addresses.\n\nIn October, Tether revealed the freezing of 32 accounts holding approximately $874 million, which were identified as having ties to unlawful activities in Israel and Ukraine.\n\nNotably, the stablecoin issuer collaborated with the National Bureau for Counter-Terror Financing of Israel (NBCTF) to actively address the use of crypto in funding terrorism and warfare.\n\nTether also claimed to have cooperated with law enforcement agencies in cases related to Ukraine.\n\nIn April, Tether received significant backlash for blacklisting an address that drained Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots for $25 million. The decentralization advocates said the move sets a bad precedent for the space."

        "title": "10 Top Performing Canadian Mutual Funds in 2023 - Morningstar.ca",
        "content": "For broad market investors, 2023 was a volatile year. The Morningstar Canada Index in 2023 rose around 7.64% year to date, as of Dec 11th \u2013 faring much worse than the Morningstar Global Markets index, which was up 16.85%.\n\nWhile much has been made of the run of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 stocks which have accounted for much of this year\u2019s market gains, the true winner this year has been Bitcoin, which has risen to over US$ 41,000 (As of Dec 11) from US$16,613 at the start of the year. Ethereum also had a volatile year, up to US$ 2185 from US$ 1200 at the start of the year. As a result, most of the top performing funds of the year have been in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here\u2019s the list:\n\nInvestors should remember, though, that cryptocurrencies as an asset class are fraught. \"The eye-dazzling returns of crypto assets over 2023 should not be considered without broader context. Recall that an investor who took a position in Bitcoin at the peak of the market (unfortunately, many did) ramping up to the tail end of 2021 is still sitting on a significant loss despite this year's crypto rally. Investors who have shorter time horizons or generally lower risk tolerances would be well served to proceed with extreme caution around volatile asset classes like this, at the risk of not being able to reach their financial goals,\" points out Morningstar Canada\u2019s director of investment research Ian Tam.\n\nTop Performing Canadian Mutual Funds in 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the traditional funds on this list have a technology focus, which is not surprising as it was the top performing sector year to date and only saw real weakness in Q3. Investors should be cautious when interpreting the results of bitcoin. The asset class has been known to be highly volatile but has performed well this year, particularly so far this quarter,\u201d said Danielle LeClair, Morningstar Canada\u2019s director of manager research.\n\nOf the funds on the list that are NOT in cryptocurrencies, two earn a Morningstar Medalist Rating \u2013 the BMO ARK Innovation Fund, which earns a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Neutral, and the BMO Nasdaq 100 Equity Series F which earns a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Bronze.\n\nAccording to Morningstar\u2019s manager research team, The BMO ARK Innovation fund portfolio maintains a cost advantage over competitors, priced within the least expensive fee quintile among peers. The strategy\u2019s management team earns a Below Average People Pillar rating. The strategy merits a Below Average Process Pillar rating.\n\n\u201cPortfolio manager Cathie Wood lacks a robust approach to understanding or mitigating the portfolio\u2019s risks and instead relies on her instincts, which haven\u2019t proven effective. The firm, which has no risk-management personnel and vaguely defined risk controls, views the subject almost exclusively through the lens of its bottom-up stock research. But this provides little visibility into the portfolio\u2019s aggregate risk exposures, which can make or break a fund\u2019s returns during one market environment or another. The firm is poorly positioned to prepare and react. The firm\u2019s large ownership stakes in many of its portfolio companies amplifies the challenge of selling them without pressuring their stock prices\u2014yet another unique downside risk of this strategy,\u201d says analyst Robby Greengold.\n\nOn BMO Nasdaq 100, Morningstar\u2019s manager research team says the portfolio maintains a sizable cost advantage over competitors, priced within the lowest fee quintile among peers. The strategy\u2019s management team earns an Average People Pillar rating. The strategy merits a Below Average Process Pillar rating. The strategy's parent organization earns the firm an Average Parent Pillar rating.\n\n\u201cThe companies that shape the bulk of this portfolio receive lofty valuations that reflect their promise. They tend to prioritize growth by reinvesting most of their profits into research and development. So, while this is not a growth fund by design, the portfolio backs into a growth tilt that mirrors the Russell 1000 Growth Index. A 100-stock portfolio and market-cap weighting make this a large-minded, top-heavy portfolio. Its average holding was nearly 50% larger than the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s from May 2018 through April 2023. And over that span, the 10 largest holdings constituted 49%-59% of the portfolio. Piling into the market\u2019s hardest hitters has paid off over the past 15 years, but broad diversification is more attractive in the long run,\u201d analyst Ryan Jackson says.\n\nWhy Mutual Fund Fees Matter\n\nFund fees are expressed on an annual basis but are typically charged monthly or quarterly. For most funds, fees are charged regardless of how the investment manager performs. Assuming an overall cost of 2% to own a fund, if in one year a fund returns 6%, you\u2019ll receive roughly 4% for that year. However, if the fund loses 6%, you lose 8% after fees.\n\n\u201cThough perhaps not financially impactful in a single year, over time the effects of fees are substantial. In dollar terms, a $1000 invested in the index in 1998 results in a portfolio value of $4,500 after 20 years if there were no fees, but only $3000 if a fee of 2% was charged. Put in percentage terms, after 10 years, the impact of a 2% fee results in a difference of 18% less wealth when compared to no fees. After 20 years, that gap balloons to 33%,\u201d explains Tam.\n\nBottom line is, you need to be diligent in monitoring the fees you\u2019re being charged, because the fees you pay are detrimental to the amount of wealth you will end up with.\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk To view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.
