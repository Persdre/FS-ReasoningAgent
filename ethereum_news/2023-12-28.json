        "title": "Buterin proposes 'security through simplicity' to lighten Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The proposal aims to balance the network's decentralization and scalability.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a new proposal that seeks to reduce the required number of signatures from validators to streamline the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nAccording to Buterin, the proposal aims to make Ethereum\u2019s consensus implementation \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter\u201d by reducing the signature requirement per slot from roughly 28,000 to just 8,192 signatures.\n\nTo date, Ethereum has roughly 895,000 validators, with each validator being required to stake 32 ether (ETH) and become activated within the network. Ethereum does this to maintain decentralization and open access for more participants to help with staking, but this also results in more load on the network because of processing requirements.\n\n\u201cThe signature aggregation system feels reasonable at first glance, but in reality it creates systemic complexity that bleeds out all over the place,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWith Buterin\u2019s proposal, the signature load for future upgrades would be predictable and limited, simplifying protocol and infrastructure development efforts. However, this also means that Ethereum\u2019s network load could still be increased through hard forks.\n\nButerin points out that such a system opens up compromises, limiting quantum security, complicated upgrades, and an apparent reliance on zero-knowledge proofs to manage scale.\n\nButerin believes that his proposal will simplify the proof-of-stake design and allow for a \u201clarge amount of technical simplification.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2026] instead of relying on cryptographers to create magic bullets (or magic bulletproofs) to make an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot possible, I propose that we make a philosophical pivot: move away from having such an expectation in the first place,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder stated.\n\nThe proposal provides three approaches to enable the reduction of required signatures: a shift to prioritizing reliance on decentralized staking pools, a two-tier system that provides options for \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating validator subsets through committees.\n\nThe first approach suggests that Ethereum could discard direct access to the consensus layer in favor of using decentralized staking pools exclusively, raising deposit minimums but capping pool-related penalties to avoid over-reliance on operators.\n\nIn the second method, a two-tiered approach creates heavy-stake validators specifically assigned to finalize blocks. This is then supplemented by a lighter security layer that has no minimum thresholds to participate.\n\nThe third approach proposes a set construction that is proportional to a validator\u2019s stake weight and rotates participants dynamically.\n\nButerin notes that the third approach effectively decouples weight for incentive purposes (validator rewards) from stake weight for consensus purposes. This means that each validator\u2019s reward within the committee (based on an agreed-upon rotation) should be the same, keeping average rewards proportional to the balance.\n\n\u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown: it can be raised in the future through hard forks, but only when developers are confident that technology has improved enough to be able to handle a larger number of signatures-per-slot with the same level of ease,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe main tradeoff is between a significant reduction in validator participation per slot and increased technical feasibility and flexibility. The proposal aims to balance the network\u2019s decentralization and scalability, but its critics argue that the changes it carries may diverge from Ethereum\u2019s core philosophy.\n\nWhile the purpose of improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability with a leaner signature scheme may appear to be well-meaning, commentators on Vitalik\u2019s proposal have raised concerns about possible security flaws due to the reduced complexity, which may open new attack vectors if any of the three approaches are implemented. To this end, Buterin responded that streamlining the protocol design offers \u201csecurity through simplicity\u201d while enhancing the network\u2019s resilience against state-level attacks."

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more \u2018Cypherpunk\u2019 hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBlast, an upcoming Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the creator of leading NFT marketplace Blur, has now pulled in more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of deposits from users vying to earn yield and points towards an upcoming token airdrop.\n\nSome $1.13 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been deposited into the Blast bridge as of this writing, according to both the official website and DeFiLlama, making it the 23rd largest protocol by total value locked according to the latter resource. Over 86,000 users have contributed funds thus far.\n\nAccording to Blast, users are earning about a 4% annual return on deposited Ethereum (ETH) and 5% on stablecoins. Furthermore, they\u2019re earning \u201cBlast Points,\u201d which will play into their respective share of the upcoming BLAST token airdrop.\n\nAccording to the Blast website, the airdrop is set for May 2024.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlast aims to make an impact in the crowded Ethereum scaling market\u2014which includes networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base\u2014by incentivizing users with both native yield on staked cryptocurrency along with a share of tokens via airdrops. Crypto protocols use airdrops to give out tokens to early users and contributors, typically aiding in decentralized governance as well.\n\nPulling in users with the allure of token rewards is the same strategy that worked wonders for Blur, which dethroned one-time leader OpenSea to become the leading NFT marketplace in February. Blur has airdropped more than $800 million worth of BLUR tokens to NFT traders in 2023 across two waves, based on the peak value of the token, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBoth Blast and Blur were founded by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, and both were backed by prominent crypto venture capital firm Paradigm. However, Blast\u2019s rollout has been controversial\u2014even for its backers.\n\nUsers are depositing cryptocurrency into a bridge that does not currently connect to the actual Blast network that\u2019s in development, and funds cannot be withdrawn until February 2024. The overt emphasis on earning yield and rewards before the network is even live has apparently rubbed some crypto users the wrong way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late November, just days after Blast was revealed to the world, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson wrote that the firm believed that the \u201cannouncement crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast and Pacman did not respond to the comments. However, in advance of Robinson\u2019s tweet, Pacman wrote that Paradigm had not been involved in Blast\u2019s go-to-market rollout, and that the VC firm\u2014which co-led Blast\u2019s $20 million raise\u2014had already asked the Blast team to make some changes.\n\nHe added that Paradigm\u2019s suggestions were \u201cunder active consideration,\u201d but that it would ultimately be Blast\u2019s call.\n\nIn December, Robinson tweeted that Paradigm had worked with Blast to develop a \u201cnew time-locked upgrade system,\u201d which he said would \u201cset a better precedent for future projects who may try to emulate them.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "In a new controversial proposal, Vitalik Buterin suggests decreasing the number of PoS validators from nearly 1 million to just 8,192 to reduce complexity.\n\nIn a new proposal released on Dec. 27, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a plan to dramatically simplify Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) system to reduce complexity and expand the design possibilities.\n\nThe current PoS system attempts to support decentralization by allowing many validators \u2014 currently almost 900,000. However, Buterin argues that this creates significant complexity, sacrifices, and constraints while still not fully achieving the goal of accessibility for small-scale stakes due to the 32 ETH minimum requirement.\n\nInstead, Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures per slot to just 8,192 from the current plan of over 1.7 million. This would enable major simplifications across Ethereum, make it much easier to transition to quantum resistance, and retain a cost for attacks between 1-2 million ETH \u2014 which Buterin suggested is high enough:\n\nEven a cost of attack of 1-2 million ETH should be totally sufficient. Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nDeveloper Micah Zoltu commented on the proposal, noting that this attack cost may be insufficient. According to him, numerous actors dispone this kind of resources and may turn against the protocol sooner or later:\n\nThere are many governments around the world who spend that much on one missile, or one plane. We should be designing systems resilient to state attackers who are willing to spend money to ruin your day. While 1-2 [million] ETH may be enough to deter them from attacking, we have evidence that they will spend far more than this to achieve their goals, and many governments do appear to be heading in the direction of \u201cdestroy crypto\u201d as one of their goals. Of course, I cannot say that 9 [million] ETH is enough either, or maybe both are in fact more than enough! However, I don\u2019t think it is as obvious as you imply that we can safely reduce the security budget. Lindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things, because everything will be fine right up until it isn\u2019t, then it is all very, very bad all of a sudden. Micah Zoltu\n\nThe last part of the statement refers to the Lindy Effect, the theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so things that have been around for a long time are more likely to stick around longer.\n\nIn this context, when Zoltu states, \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things,\u201d he argues that just because Ethereum\u2019s high level of security has been sufficient so far, it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to be sufficient.\n\nButerin outlines three potential approaches to make this reduced signature scheme work: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, using a two-tiered system with lighter and heavier staking requirements, or rotating participation across slots to retain accountability.\n\nThe proposal has garnered commentary from developers like Zoltu, who questioned whether the reduced 1-2 million ETH attack cost would be sufficient to deter state-level attackers. Buterin acknowledged this was a fair critique, and the optimal cost remains unclear.\n\nThe coming debate around this and other PoS proposals will likely be as vibrant as ever in the Ethereum community."

        "content": "Ethereum has been upstaged by one of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction count.\n\nZkSync\u2019s transaction spike has resulted in lower fees.\n\nDevelopment is positive step for Ethereum's scalability.\n\nEthereum has been knocked off its perch, at least when it comes to the monthly number of transactions.\n\nZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has managed to process more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, according to data from L2Beat, a portal that tracks data for such buzzy blockchains.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a feat because it is the first time Ethereum has been surpassed by any of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction numbers.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains like zkSync help scale the blockchain with increased speed while relying on the mainnet\u2019s security.\n\n30-day transaction count for Ethereum and its layer-2s. Source: L2Beat\n\nIt\u2019s also significant that the transaction spike has not resulted in higher fees on zkSync. Instead, fees have dipped 44% within the same period, data from blockchain analytics portal growthepie shows.\n\nIt currently costs about $0.13 to use the network to send tokens while it is $2 on the Ethereum mainnet. More complicated transactions like token swaps cost even higher, as much as $35 as of the time of reporting.\n\nThis fee decline supports the expectation that zkSync should become cheaper to use as it scales.\n\nZkSync\u2019s run to the top of the ladder has come amid a boom in inscriptions on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInscriptions are data files for applications like NFTs and meme coins embedded on blockchains in a way that is supposed to be cheaper than using smart contracts.\n\nThey first emerged on Bitcoin but have now become a trend on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in zkSync, as measured by \"total value locked\"\n\nTransaction-spamming associated with the inscriptions trend has become a stress test for blockchains like zkSync and Arbitrum with the latter going offline on December 15.\n\nThe milestone also comes after zkSync had a minor hiccup on Christmas. Block production was paused amid a temporary network outage for the blockchain.\n\nThe developers behind zkSync said the problem was due to a bug in the chain\u2019s server and promised a full post-mortem of the incident. Some security researchers say the issue may have involved the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer.\n\nZkSync uses a Sequencer to verify, organise, and bundle transactions to Ethereum for finality. Layer 2 Sequencers have been prone to faults in the past with Arbitrum, a zkSync suffering a similar fate in June.\n\nApart from Inscriptions, zkSync\u2019s transaction count also has a prominent airdrop footprint. Matter Labs has been mum about the possibility of an airdrop, but that has not stopped DeFi users from piling into the chain in hopes of a potential airdrop win.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "ZkSync: L2 privacy surpasses Ethereum blockchain - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "ZkSync, a layer-2 blockchain developed by provider Matter Labs and focused on scalability and privacy, has surpassed the Ethereum mainnet for the first time in terms of number of transactions executed.\n\nIn the last 30 days, Zksync has recorded a total of 34.7 million transactions compared to Ethereum\u2019s 34.2 million.\n\nThis is mainly due to the new trend of inscriptions, which after targeting the Bitcoin network, is now expanding within the EVM chains sector.\n\nWe will see if the attention on this type of digital products will remain high even in 2024.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nZkSync, a privacy and scalability-focused rollup, outperforms the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the trend of inscriptions\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup ZkSync, which focuses its efforts on optimizing scalability and privacy, has managed to outperform the Ethereum blockchain, which it relies on as a second-layer solution.\n\nIn the last 30 days, according to L2Beat data, there have been a total of 34.7 million transactions on ZkSync, while on its main network there have been 34.2 million transactions, resulting in a positive difference of approximately half a million transactions.\n\nWith this record, L2 ranks first in the EVM network ranking that has recently recorded the most tx, ahead of competitors Arbitrum, Optimism, DyDx v3, Base, and ImmutableX.\n\n\n\nThese data are justified by the recent introduction and diffusion of \u201cinscriptions\u201d, which is a metadata registration feature originating from Bitcoin, on all networks that support the Ethereum virtual machine, including the vast Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nRegistrations allow you to obtain alternative NFT to the classic resources generated through smart contracts, adding information such as text, images, videos, and even additional code within the ID of a transaction, all without losing the advantages of privacy and security.\n\nThis, although it may seem more cumbersome and sometimes even obsolete, allows you to save fees when it comes to including complex data within a smart contract and therefore is preferred by developers and users.\n\nThe data from L2Beat shows that the zkSync blockchain recorded its largest increase in monthly transactions on December 16th.\n\nIt was then that the synchronization registration was launched on the network and accounted for 4.6 million out of the 5.3 million transactions on that day alone, according to Dune\u2019s data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nIt is rare for an L2 network to surpass its main network in on-chain metrics, but given the interest and development that has been revolving within the Ethereum rollup sector lately, and the increasingly captivating narrative of inscriptions, it is possible that in the future these opportunities will become more frequent.\n\nThe ZkSync Cryptographic Ecosystem\n\nThis is not the first time that the layer-2 blockchain Zksync has made headlines, having become the protagonist of several records in the last year, thanks above all to a growing cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup solution was launched in March and has immediately succeeded in scaling the Ethereum mainnet, without compromising the security and privacy of the infrastructure.\n\nIn a short time, it has established itself as one of the leading players in the EVM chain sector, reaching a significantly high Total Value Locked.\n\nSpecifically, as of today ZkSync has a TVL of 581 million dollars, second only to Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s optimistic rollup versions, which have locked values exceeding one billion dollars, and to competitors Metis and Base.\n\nIt is not excluded that the cryptographic solution of Matter Labs will be able to further climb the rankings in the coming months, reaching the top 3 of the most used L2s in the world, especially if a gas token is launched to support its growth.\n\nLooking closer at the composition of this blockchain, we see that the protocols that have contributed the most to its growth are mostly DEX, which allow on-chain cryptocurrency exchange through an AMM (Automated Market Maker) platform.\n\nAmong these, the favorites of DeFi users have been ZKSwap, SyncSwap, Mute.io, Maverick, Velocore, Space.Fi, IziSwap, Pancakeswap, and ZkSwap Finance.\n\nOverall, DEXs on Zksync encompass the majority of TVL managed on the network, channeled into a multitude of decentralized pools that allow for the free exchange of cryptographic resources.\n\nThe category that has had the most impact on the success of ZkSync is the Lending platforms such as Reactor Fusion, Zero Lend, and ZkLend.\n\nFinally, we find decentralized applications for derivative trading such as Derivio, Holdstation, Satori, Rollup Finance, and Fulcrom.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to consider the boost of on-chain activities that has been given thanks to the narrative of crypto airdrops, which have encouraged Ethereum rollup users to prefer this blockchain precisely because of the possibility of a reward for its early adopters.\n\nWith $458 million raised in funding from external investors, Zksync promises to carry out one of the largest airdrops in the history of the blockchain world.\n\nThis factor, together with the new trend of inscriptions, could bring the L2 network to another level, where imagination still cannot reach."

        "title": "What is a spot ETH ETF: how does a spot Ethereum ETF work? - OKX",
        "content": "Following the excitement of the 2024 arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs, we're seeing increased speculation about what crypto-themed exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be next. Chief among these rumors is how a spot Ether (ETH) ETF might be next given its popularity among institutions and retail traders. The crypto space didn't need to wait long for an answer.\n\nSpeculation around a possible spot ETH ETF rose towards mid-2024, with commentators debating the percentage likelihood that such a product would get the green light during the year. Optimism rose and fell, until a sudden acceleration in the process. The week of May 20, 2024 saw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) request that all exchanges pursuing a Spot ETH ETF update their fillings immediately. Just days later on May 24, the commission approved key 19b-4 regulatory filings, clearing a path towards full approval. With the SEC's latest announcement to give spot ETH ETFs the go-ahead to start trading, all bets are off as we could possibly see another wave of mass adoption similar to the one witnessed with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat does this all mean, and what happens next? From understanding what a spot ETF is to highlighting the pros and cons of trading a spot Ether ETF, here's everything you'll need to know when it comes to navigating the volatility surrounding the spot Ether ETF announcement.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nConceived in 2013, Ethereum is a popular decentralized blockchain platform with smart contract utility. It revolutionized the crypto world by introducing self-governing smart contracts, allowing users to create and execute automated agreements. Ethereum's ecosystem thrives on the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, which acts as a fee for transactions and powers a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps) like DeFi lending platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFT). These DApps operate without a central authority, opening up new possibilities across various fields.\n\nWhy is Ethereum so popular?\n\nAmong the various altcoins in the crypto space, Ethereum shines as a particularly captivating ecosystem for both retail and institutional crypto traders. Given its decade of growth and influence within the crypto space, Ethereum has certainly stood the test of time as it stands shoulders above other altcoins that were conceived in the early 2010s. As the first platform to pull off smart contracts without a hitch, Ethereum has achieved numerous feats that include introducing the first-ever NFT standard in 2018 and making a full transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (PoS) as part of the Ethereum Merge. These milestones combined with the fervent Ethereum community and extensive number of DApps in the Ethereum ecosystem make Ethereum a powerhouse in the crypto space.\n\nNow that we understand what Ethereum is and why it's so popular, let's dive into the fundamentals of a spot ETH ETF.\n\nWhat is a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAlso known as a physically-backed Ether ETF, the spot ETH ETF resembles traditional exchange-traded funds, where institutions managing the ETF commit to purchasing ETH and holding ETH in their reserves. The ETF is then listed on a traditional stock exchange and issues shares representing ownership of the ETF. This effectively means traders gain exposure to the underlying ETH held in the institution's reserves when trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nOne key thing to take note of when trading the spot ETH ETF is that owning shares of a spot ETH ETF doesn't directly grant ownership of individual ETH tokens held by the institution. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings, not the Ether itself. Additionally, while institutions hold the underlying ETH, they may use various strategies to manage it, such as lending it out or using it for staking, to potentially generate additional returns for the ETF.\n\nWho is the spot ETH ETF for?\n\nMany believe that the spot ETH ETF will be perfect for TradFi traders who are used to trading stocks and ETFs on traditional brokerages. While directly trading Ether has its charm, it's not for everyone given the inaccessibility and numerous barriers to entry that cryptocurrencies are known for. That's where spot ETH ETFs come in. As setting up wallets, navigating exchanges, and managing private keys can sometimes feel alien and complex, spot ETH ETFs will ease traders who are more familiar with TradFi in gaining exposure to ETH. By trading spot ETH ETFs, traders with little to no experience in crypto can gain convenient exposure to ETH's price movements without needing a cryptocurrency wallet or dealing with the intricacies of directly buying and storing ETH.\n\nHow does a spot ETH ETF work?\n\nConfused about how a spot ETH ETF works? Think of the spot ETH ETF as a pool where traders contribute funds to buy ETH. This pool then tracks the price of Ether by holding the coins directly. When the price of Ethereum rises, the value of the ETF shares goes up proportionally, and vice versa. This is distinct from ETH futures-based ETFs, which track ETH's price through derivatives like ETH futures without holding the underlying asset.\n\nTo keep pace with the constantly fluctuating price of ETH, the ETF manager works behind the scenes to monitor the market and adjust the ETF's ETH holdings as needed. This typically involves creation and redemption units, which are large blocks of shares exchanged for the underlying Ether. This delicate balancing act aims to ensure your ETF shares accurately reflect the real-time market value of Ethereum, though slight differences can occur due to factors like trading costs and rebalancing schedules.\n\nAdvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nLowering the barrier to entry to gaining crypto exposure\n\nAs mentioned above, crypto can be hard to get into because of the numerous points for potential friction that'll deter anyone new to crypto trading. This can range from fumbling during the Know Your Customer process to choosing the right spot pair to trade the crypto you want. With the spot ETH ETF, traders who already have trading accounts with established TradFi brokerages can simply look up the ticker for the spot ETH ETF and trade it as they normally would with any other forex pair or stock.\n\nBeing open to institutional traders\n\nWith a spot ETH ETF, trading ETH becomes even more accessible from an institutional perspective. As institutions like pension funds and asset managers may have specific regulations that prevent them from trading Ether and other coins directly, smart money has long been barred off from gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. With a spot ETH ETF, they might have a better chance of being allowed to trade it as it's an SEC-approved trading vehicle.\n\nNew ways to trade ETH\n\nOn top of traders buying and selling shares of spot ETH ETFs, traders can also consider alternative methods of trading spot ETH ETF shares. This can range from short-selling it to the downside if they're intending to hedge their overall portfolio or are bearish about Ether to executing options strategies like covered calls to generate additional gains on their spot ETH ETF holdings. Such alternatives will inject a fresh amount of liquidity into the crypto market as more traders gain exposure to Ether through trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nDisadvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nETF expense ratios\n\nFor those new to trading ETFs, one thing to take note of is expense ratios, which measures how much of a fund's assets are used for administrative and other operating expenses. While the exact ratio is yet to be known since the spot ETH ETF hasn't yet reached full approval at the time of writing, we can take Bitcoin futures ETFs for reference. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has an expense ratio of 0.95%. This is considerably higher compared to other ETFs and mutual funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.03%. As this is an annualized fee that compounds over the length of time that traders hold the ETF, overall gains earned from trading the spot ETH ETF will definitely be impacted.\n\nETH ownership\n\nAs previously mentioned, share traders technically don't own the Ether since it's managed by the spot ETH ETF manager, who could potentially be lending out or staking the ETH for extra yield. This brings into question concerns of true ownership, since \"not your keys, not your coins\" is a mantra that many crypto natives swear by and could be a major concern if the ETF liquidates its assets and closes down the line. Judging by the recent amendment made by Fidelity's ETH ETF application, this might be the case should their version of spot ETH ETFs get approved.\n\nThe limitation of regular trading hours\n\nCrypto markets are famous for being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about spot ETH ETFs, whose shares are subject to the regular trading hours of when a typical stock market opens and closes. Due to this limitation, traders could potentially miss out on potential opportunities during times when the stock market is closed.\n\nWhen were spot ETH ETFs approved?\n\nThe flurry of activity during late May 2024 suggested earlier this year that a spot ETH ETF approval is imminent. This was hinted at by institutions like BlackRock and ARK Invest who officially filed for spot ETH ETF approvals.\n\nHowever, the investment management firms, alongside other applicants including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, made amendments to their spot Ether ETF applications to remove plans for staking. The amendment was expected, as regulators may claim that staking blurs the lines between a digital asset and a security.\n\nOn Thursday 23 May, 2024, the SEC approved firms' 19b-4 regulatory filings following a remarkable turnaround for the spot ETH ETF's prospects. Although significant, this development is by no means the final hurdle. Next up, regulators must clear the S-1 filings made by prospective ETF issuers before the fund can be made available to traders. That process could take a further few weeks or months, with an exact timeframe not yet given.\n\nOfficial spot ETH ETF approval\n\nThankfully, the dust seems to have settled as 23 July, 2024 marks the official day when spot Ether ETFs go live for trading. The total list of spot ETH ETF issuers include BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco. If you've previously traded spot Bitcoin ETFs, you'll likely find some of these names familiar. Planning to trade these spot ETH ETFs? One thing to note is that each issuer has its own set of related fees and fee waivers, so if you're intending to hold them for the long haul, it'd make sense to keep the fees in mind so they don't eat into your overall gains.\n\nLooking ahead, Standard Chartered has announced that a spot Ether ETF approval might send ETH prices rallying to $8,000 by the end of 2024 and skyrocketing to $14,000 by 2025. According to their analysts, this prediction comes in light of high-profile names like Fidelity and Blackrock that pursued spot Ether ETF approvals, and the Dencun upgrade that makes Ethereum transactions more affordable overall.\n\nShould you buy Ether instead?\n\nAlthough spot ETH ETF shares may offer convenience that's considered useful for traders, the truth is that owning spot ETH ETF shares differs greatly from owning Ether directly. That raises the question \u2014 why not just buy ETH itself? To dissect this question further, it's important to consider your priorities and goals as a trader. If you're a trader that's inexperienced with trading crypto and simply want exposure to Ethereum, trading spot ETH ETF shares may be perfect for you. However, if you're a trader that prioritizes ownership and freedom to trade at whatever timing, then the spot ETH ETF might not be suitable for you.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nSpot Ether ETFs offer a compelling bridge between the allure of Ethereum and the familiarity of TradFi. The availability of a spot Ether ETF as an option for traders represents a significant step forward in making Ethereum accessible to a wider audience. By simplifying access to crypto and allowing for diversification of trading portfolios, the spot ETH ETF opens the world of crypto to a whole new audience. Although trading shares of the spot ETH ETF comes with its own set of risks and disadvantages, it's undoubtedly popular among traders with specific trading preferences and could be the catalyst needed to create a spike in demand for crypto ETFs.\n\nKeen to give trading Ether directly a go?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has taken to the Twitter/X social media network to share his view on the enormous all-time high he expects the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to reach. He has not named any definitive time frames for this surge, though, and just stated that this is a questions of \u201cwhen, not if\u201d.\n\nDavis bets on Ethereum ultimately reaching a mind-blowing $10,000 price tag. To achieve that price milestone, Ethereum would have to showcase a whopping 321.52% from its current price level - $2,370.\n\nEthereum reaches new milestones\n\nAs reported by the popular on-chain data aggregator Santiment, Ethereum has been moving towards a new record recently, along with the flagship digital currency Bitcoin. Per recent tweet, Ethereum is now within 1.6% of the highest value since May 11 last year. As for Bitcoin, BTC is within 2.9% of the highest value since April 6 last year. Both highs were reached by these two largest cryptocurrencies at the start of December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, top 10 exchange wallets continue to move Ethereum, according to an earlier tweet published by Santiment as they are withdrawing their ETH into smaller blockchain addresses from centralized crypto exchanges or are moving Ethereum away from CEXs entirely. About two weeks ago, a massive 240,000 ETH was transferred from exchanges. This massive amount of ETH is evaluated at an impressive $569,347,200 at the time of this writing.\n\nGalaxy Digital dumps tonnes of Ethereum\n\nAs reported by U.Today, approximately a week ago, a major cryptocurrency market player, Galaxy Digital investment fund created and spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz transferred 11,200 Ethereum to the Binance exchange with an apparent goal to sell it. At that time, this ETH lump was worth roughly $24.3 million.\n\nHowever, it was not the only Ethereum transfer made by Novogratz\u2019s company recently. Blockchain sleuth @OnchainDataNerd stated that until that day, Galaxy Digital had deposited 31,437 ETH in total to various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMike Novogratz himself is an early Ethereum investor. In one of his interviews, Novogratz stated that he had bought 500,000 ETH from Vitalik Buterin right after the ICO, before Ether began trading on exchanges and was worth less than $1. He was the first even Wall Street buyer of Ethereum back then."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Shares New Ethereum Vision - U.Today",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Signature Reduction - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Signature Reduction Zach Anderson Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures for validators in the PoS system to simplify the system, address technical issues, and enhance network security.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, recently proposed a significant change to the Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The core of his proposal is to reduce the number of signatures that validators must process. Currently, Ethereum's PoS mechanism involves around 895,000 validators processing approximately 28,000 signatures per slot, which results in a heavy load on the network\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Need for Change: Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency\n\nThis high number of validators and the associated signature load come with major technical downsides. It limits quantum resistance, complicates forking, and challenges scaling signatures through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the high minimum of 32 ETH for becoming a validator remains prohibitive for many, limiting widespread participation\u200b\u200b.\n\nButerin suggests that reducing the signature requirement to about 8,192 per slot, down from the current 28,000, would offer several benefits. It would simplify the consensus mechanism, make the blockchain more quantum-resistant, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH), a mechanism to enforce good behavior among validators\u200b\u200b.\n\nExploring Alternative Approaches: Decentralized Staking Pools and More\n\nButerin outlined three potential approaches for this change:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: This method involves increasing the minimum ether required for staking, encouraging smaller validators to form pools. This shift would reduce the number of individual validators\u200b\u200b. Dual-Layer Staking System: A 'heavy' layer would require a higher ETH stake (4,096 ETH) for participation in finalization processes, while a 'light' layer would have no minimum requirement, creating a balance between security and accessibility\u200b\u200b. Rotating Validator Set: This approach would involve a rotating set of 4,096 validators for each slot, adjusting the set during each slot to ensure network safety\u200b\u200b.\n\nAddressing Security Concerns\n\nButerin also pointed out the limitations of the committee-based security model used in other blockchains. This model, which randomly selects a group of validators for each slot, lacks accountability in the event of a 51% attack. Ethereum's current system, which imposes severe penalties for such attacks, is effective but might be excessively punitive. A balanced solution maintaining high slashable Ethereum while making concessions on validator accountability is needed\u200b\u200b.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Unveils Signature Solutions: Simplifying PoS Complexity - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has presented three potential solutions to address what he identifies as a looming systemic complexity within Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a detailed post on the Ethereum Research forum, Buterin highlighted the challenges posed by the increasing number of signatures required for validators to keep the network operational.\n\nThe heart of the problem lies in the extensive workload placed on validators, who are essential for maintaining the network\u2019s functionality. As the number of validators continues to grow, the burden of generating signatures essential for proper network operation escalates, putting a strain on the system. Upcoming upgrades are expected to exacerbate this issue by significantly increasing signature requirements.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin Unveils Signature Solutions: Simplifying PoS Complexity 3\n\nButerin\u2019s Fixes: Simplifying Ethereum\u2019s PoS\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed solutions revolve around the common goal of reducing the required signatures to 8,192 per slot in the Ethereum blockchain. Each solution introduces a distinct approach to tackle the complexity associated with the current PoS design.\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: One approach involves the establishment of decentralized staking pools. By increasing the minimum amount of ether required to run a validator, individual validators are encouraged to collaborate and pool their resources. This would distribute the workload and alleviate the strain on the system.\n\nTwo-Tiered Staking: The second proposed solution suggests implementing two layers of stakers with different requirements. A \u201cheavy\u201d layer with higher requirements would participate in finalization, while a \u201clight\u201d layer with lighter requirements adds an additional layer of security to the block finalization process.\n\nRotating Participation: The third solution introduces a rotating set of participants, where a random group of validators is selected for each slot. While this would diversify the workload and reduce the overall number of required signatures, Buterin acknowledged the added complexity associated with this approach.\n\nAccording to the blog post, Buterin emphasized the current challenges posed by Ethereum\u2019s commitment to supporting a high number of validators for the sake of decentralization. The immense number of required signatures per slot creates technical challenges, including intricate attestation propagation mechanisms and potential quantum resistance issues.\n\nTo address these challenges, Buterin suggests moving away from the expectation of an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot. He proposes a philosophical pivot to expand the PoS design space, simplify technical implementations, enhance security, and tackle quantum resistance issues effectively.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also explored the drawbacks of a committee-based approach used by some blockchains, emphasizing the importance of accountability in Ethereum\u2019s current system.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal aims to establish a clear expectation of 8,192 signatures per slot, providing technical implementers and the Ethereum community with a more predictable future. The decision on which solution to adopt will involve careful consideration of trade-offs, particularly regarding liquid staking and other related issues.\n\nRelated Reading | Tim Draper Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $250,000 In 2024 Amid Enthusiasm And Regulatory Anticipation"

        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with Ethereum (ETH) standing out as a pioneer in the field of proof of stake.\n\nRecently, ETH has recorded an increase of 6.77%, a positive signal for investors and industry enthusiasts.\n\nThis development can largely be attributed to the proposal by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, to simplify the proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of the platform.\n\nThe problem of complexity in Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the intrinsic systemic complexity of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Buterin has identified a critical node: the management of digital signatures. Validators, responsible for the network\u2019s operation, must produce a high number of digital signatures.\n\nThis process, already burdensome, becomes even more burdensome with the increase of validators, leading to system overload.\n\nFuture implementations could even further intensify the signing requirements. The challenge is therefore not only to maintain, but also to optimize efficiency in a constantly growing ecosystem.\n\nAddressing this issue is crucial to ensure the long-term scalability and sustainability of Ethereum.\n\nThe solution proposed by Buterin aims to simplify the process without sacrificing the security and integrity of the network.\n\nButerin\u2019s three proposals to simplify the process\n\nButerin outlined three possible solutions at the Ethereum research forum on December 27th. The common focus of the proposals is to reduce the number of signatures required per slot to 8,192 in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDecentralized staking pools: The first solution proposes the introduction of decentralized staking pools. This would involve increasing the minimum amount of ether required to run a validator, encouraging operators to collaborate and pool their resources. This approach could not only lighten the workload of individual validators but also promote an atmosphere of cooperation and mutualism within the Ethereum network. two levels of stakers: The second solution involves creating two levels of stakers: one with more demanding requirements and the other with lighter requirements. These two levels would be treated differently in the block finalization process. This structure could provide greater flexibility and accessibility for different types of participants in the network, balancing security and inclusivity. Rotating participants: Finally, the third proposal suggests the adoption of a system of rotating participants, where a random set of validators is selected for each slot. This system would distribute the workload and reduce the total number of signatures, but it would add complexity to the system. This method could improve fairness and decentralization, ensuring a more even distribution of responsibilities and rewards among participants.\n\nConclusion\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal represents a significant step towards a more efficient and effective implementation of the PoS mechanism in Ethereum.\n\nBy reducing the complexity and workload of validators, Ethereum could achieve greater scalability and security. It is clear that the future of Ethereum, with its transition to the proof of stake model, still holds many innovations and potential improvements.\n\nIn addition, this evolution highlights Ethereum\u2019s ongoing commitment to finding solutions that not only improve network performance, but also contribute to greater decentralization and democracy in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for a leaner and more robust system could prove crucial in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry, marking an era of new possibilities and applications."

        "title": "Ethereum's Path to Efficiency: Vitalik Buterin's Proposal for a Lighter PoS System - Coinnounce",
        "content": "Innovative Steps Towards a Streamlined Ethereum\n\nEthereum's co-founder Vitalik Buterin has put forth a groundbreaking proposal aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. This proposal, which centers on making the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism both simpler and lighter, could be a game-changer in blockchain technology.\n\nReducing the Burden: A Shift in Validator Signatures\n\nOn December 28, Buterin introduced a strategy to reduce the number of signatures required from validators. This reduction is expected to significantly lighten the load on the Ethereum network. The current system supports a vast number of validators \u2014 approximately 895,000 \u2014 in an effort to achieve decentralization and facilitate broader participation in staking.\n\nHowever, this high number of validators leads to considerable technical challenges. The network is tasked with processing around 28,000 signatures per slot, which Buterin describes as an excessively high load.\n\nAddressing Technical Challenges and Participation Issues\n\nButerin highlighted several compromises that come with supporting such a load, including limited quantum resistance, complex forking processes, and the need to scale signatures through sophisticated methods like zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the current system falls short of its goal to enable widespread participation due to the high minimum stake required to become a validator.\n\nProposing a Balanced Solution\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin suggests a moderate approach, reducing the number of signatures per slot to approximately 8,192 from the existing 28,000. This change would lead to significant technical simplifications, enhance quantum resistance, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH). Slashable ETH is a critical mechanism for encouraging proper validator behavior.\n\nButerin proposed three potential methods to achieve this goal: fully decentralized staking pools, a two-tiered staking system with both 'heavy' and 'light' options, and a rotating participation model with accountable committees.\n\nAnticipating a Manageable Future Load\n\nThe primary benefit of Buterin's proposal is the establishment of a predictable and manageable future signature load. This foresight would greatly simplify protocol and infrastructure development. \"The future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown,\" Buterin stated, adding that the signature load could be increased in the future through hard forks, but only when technological advancements can support a larger number of signatures-per-slot efficiently.\n\nButerin's Caution Against Overextension\n\nIn May, Buterin had cautioned against overstretching Ethereum's consensus mechanism beyond its primary functions of block validation and network security. This new proposal is in line with his vision of a streamlined, efficient blockchain that remains true to its core purposes."

This kind of behavior is expected before a major event that can have a considerable impact on the price action, and in the crypto market\u2019s case, it is the upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price sees another bout of growth\n\nEthereum price trading at $2,433 recently breached a crucial resistance level marked at $2,334. This price point is key to a historically known bullish pattern called the inverse head and shoulder formation.\n\nThe Head and shoulder formation generally signals a bearish outcome, but this pattern does the opposite. Inverse head and shoulders is a reversal pattern that is formed by three consecutive lows along with two intermediate highs. The first and third lows are called shoulders, located approximately at the same level above the second low \u2013 the head. Another important line is the one drawn along the intermediate highs \u2013 the neckline.\n\nThe pattern is completed only when the right shoulder rises above the neckline, suggesting that further rallying will be akin to the height of the head.\n\nIn the case of ETH, the height of the head marks a $218 growth, placing the target at $218 above $2,334. This brings the expected rise to $2,551, marking a 9.3% growth. Since, on the 8-hour chart, Ethereum price has already satisfied the pattern with the breach of the neckline, there is room for further growth.\n\nETH/USD 8-hour chart\n\nTrading at $2,433, ETH could still rise by another 5% before reaching the target price, breaching which would set the altcoin up for an increase to $3,000.\n\nPrice indicators, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are both exhibiting room for bullishness.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nHowever, a failed breach of the target price could bring ETH back down to $2,400, which could happen if short-term traders look for profit-taking as well, invalidating the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently outlined a trio of potential solutions to address a critical complexity issue in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. His proposals, targeting the burgeoning challenge of managing digital signatures within the Ethereum network, were detailed in a post on the Ethereum Research forum. Buterin focuses on streamlining the process to require only 8,192 signatures per slot, simplifying and lightening the network\u2019s load.\n\nVitalik Buterin Unveils Two-Tier Staking System Idea\n\nThe first approach Vitalik Buterin suggests involves the transformation of staking pools. By increasing the minimum ether required to run a validator, smaller validator operations would need to combine their resources. This consolidation aims to reduce the overall number of validators, thereby lessening the signature workload.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis solution is about scaling down the number of participants and fostering a more collaborative and resource-shared environment within the Ethereum network. While compelling in its simplicity, this method raises questions about the impact on smaller validators and the potential centralization of power among larger staking pools.\n\nButerin\u2019s second proposal introduces a two-tier staking system. This novel approach distinguishes between stakers with varying responsibilities and requirements. The two layers of stakers would be integrated differently in the block finalization process, with one layer shouldering heavier requirements and the other operating under lighter ones.\n\nThis bifurcation could create a more balanced system, where responsibilities and rewards are aligned with the capabilities and commitments of different stakers. However, this solution also introduces complexity in managing these two distinct groups and ensuring fair and effective participation from both.\n\nNew Ethereum Model Aims to Reduce Signatures\n\nThe final solution put forth by Buterin involves a rotating system of validators. In this model, a random set of validators would be selected for each slot, distributing the workload more evenly across the network. While this approach could effectively reduce the number of signatures needed, it introduces new complexities.\n\nThe random selection process must ensure fairness and transparency while maintaining network security and efficiency. This solution balances reducing the signature burden and maintaining a diverse and decentralized pool of validators.\n\nEach of these proposed solutions by Buterin comes with its advantages and challenges. The central theme in all three is the balancing act between reducing the signature workload and maintaining the decentralized ethos of the Ethereum network.\n\nRead Also: Ether Poised to Outshine Bitcoin in 2024, ETC Group Report Predicts\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Shares Thoughts On The Current State Of Web3 | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\u201d the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin has expressed his thoughts on the current state of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Founder Voices Concerns Over Faded Web3 Vision\n\nIn a blog post published on December 28, Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin reflected on his past experiences from a decade ago where he witnessed Bitcoin\u2019s steady adoption and integration into daily life activities. In this reflection, Buterin highlighted the transformative vision he visualizes of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I bring these memories up is that they remind me of a deeper vision underlying crypto: we are not here to just create isolated tools and games, but rather build holistically toward a more free and open society and economy, where the different parts \u2013 technological, social and economic \u2013 fit into each other,\u201d Buterin wrote in the blog post.\n\nWhile maintaining a positive perspective of the Web3 ecosystem, Buterin acknowledged that the vision for the Web3 space has become somewhat diminished. He noted that the vision had begun fading into the background since 2017.\n\nThe Ethereum founder highlighted several reasons for his statement, with the foremost factor being the rise of transaction fees, which he identified as the number one culprit for the fading Web3 vision.\n\nButerin explained that when the cost of writing to the chain was $0.001 or $0.1, many individuals would actively engage with blockchains. However, as transaction fees rise to $100, a specific audience, the degen gamblers remain willing to pay the substantial cost.\n\nButerin pointed out that when degen gamblers become the predominant users of the chain, it alters the perception of the public and adversely affects the internal culture of the crypto space.\n\nHe also revealed that \u201cthere is a large ideological rift where significant parts of the non-blockchain decentralization community see the crypto world as a distraction, and not as a kindred spirit and a powerful ally. In many countries, people do use cryptocurrency to send and save money, but they often do this through centralized means.\u201d\n\nETH price at $2,372 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCypherpunk Future Achievable Amid 2023 Development\n\nIn his blog post, Buterin highlighted several positive developments made in 2023 that could facilitate the development of a cypherpunk future for the Web3 space.\n\nSome of these developments include the existence of Blockchain Rollups which are special Layer-2 blockchains that process transactions off-chain. Buterin also noted the expansion of second-generation privacy solutions like Railway and Nocturne, alongside advancements in Zero Knowledge Proofs, a powerful tool used for enhancing privacy and security.\n\nConcluding his list of positive developments within the Web3 space in 2023, Buterin affirmed that these changes would create a great opportunity for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHe stated that the developments would \u201cmake at least a part of the Ethereum ecosystem actually be the permissionless, decentralized, censorship-resistant, open source ecosystem that we originally came to build.\u201d\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko blew up Crypto X with a recent admission when he noted that the protocol is now already an \u201cEthereum L2 with the Wormhole Eigenlayer.\u201d\n\nLightning the Solana versus Ethereum Rivalry\n\nThough the shared X post from Anatoly Yakovenko is a technology-based communication, it has a major but subtle aim to lighten the ongoing rivalry between Solana and its bigger rival, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the Solana co-founder, a major overlap exists between some of the validators operating decentralized applications that exist as a connecting bridge between both protocols.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge overlap between solana validators and Lido eth L1 operators and wormhole operators. They are all effectively under heavy \u201cre-staking\u201d incentives not to withhold data or mess with the state root between the chains,\u201d his post reads.\n\nWhile Yakovenko\u2019s initial post on the subject was shared on December 25, media reports failed to see the initial ironic intention behind the post. By all means, Solana is bigger as a protocol when compared to the next capitalized Ethereum L2, Polygon and it has a thriving ecosystem that will undoubtedly prevent it from staying under the shadows of Ethereum.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been a lot of controversial community talks between members of the Solana and Ethereum communities in which some of the former try to elevate their technologies over the latter. This narrative was deepened as Solana started flipping Ethereum in key performance metrics.\n\nYakovenko has time and again tried to caution the community against such narratives and this latest post might be another way to show both can co-exist.\n\nEqual Ecosystem Criticism\n\nWithin the space of 2 weeks, the duo of Ethereum and Solana have faced intense criticism from some market analysts who took out time to highlight the flaws of both protocols.\n\nPeter Brandt recently took on Ethereum, noting that he has shorted the coin as he believes it is on its way to a low of $650. He based his bearish assumptions on the fact that Ethereum is unfriendly to use as a result of expensive network or gas fees. Solana on the other hand got its first major critic in Fred Krueger who said many of the innovations being pushed out by the protocol are \u201cpure science fiction.\u201d\n\nWhile neither of the blockchain protocols is perfect, Yakovenko\u2019s post is an indication that both can truly exist together with more benefit to the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of cryptocurrency. Although it is generally deemed a volatile investment market, many show interest in purchasing crypto due to higher rates of return. Heading towards a new year, investors are actively seeking opportunities to enhance their portfolios and earn greater returns on investment. Ahead of 2024, experts have already shared their predictions about cryptocurrency. Here's what they are saying: Representational Image\n\nBinance to lose its No.1 position for spot trading\n\nFollowing the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX in November last year, Binance saw a boost in its trading value. However, according to New York-based investment management company VanEck, 2024 is expected to be a bearish year for Binance.\n\nAccording to their X, formerly Twitter post, \u201cBinance will lose the #1 position for spot trading, with competitors like OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Bitget contending for leadership. Coinbase's futures market may exceed $1 billion daily volume as regulated index inclusion becomes key.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: IRS tax bracket changes in 2024 may result in bigger paychecks, what are they?\n\nSurge in Ethereum revenue\n\nEthereum still remains one of the most popular crypto choices for investors. According to the 2024 crypto predictions by Bitwise on X, Ethereum will rake in more than 2.5 times its current revenue. According to the post shared by Ryan Rasmussen on the platform, \u201cEthereum revenue will more than 2x to $5b as users flock to crypto applications. In 2023, users will pay ~$2.3b in fees to use Ethereum. We think that will at least 2x in 2024, making Ethereum one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms in the world.\u201d\n\nCoinbase to double in revenue\n\nCoinbase is an American publicly traded company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. It is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States in terms of trading volume. Experts believe that its revenue will nearly double in numbers.\n\nAccording to Ryan Rasmussen, \u201cCoinbase\u2019s revenue will double, beating Wall Street expectations by at least 10x. Historically, Coinbase's trading volumes surge in bull markets, and we expect the same to happen again. Plus, they\u2019ve launched a wide range of new products that are showing traction.\u201d\n\nBitcoin may value a quarter of a million dollars\n\nTo date, Bitcoin reigns as one of the most popular and hefty cryptos. In 2024, its value is expected to reach a quarter of a million dollars, according to experts. Venture capitalist Tim Draper said in an interview with Coin Bureau, \u201cI would say that my number $250,000 will probably come pretty soon, so I\u2019ll stick with $250,000 \u2026 I actually think that if it hits $250,000, it\u2019ll go way past it.\u201d\n\nAnother expert on X, formerly Twitter, claimed the same. The Bitcoin Therapist's tweet reads, \u201cWith everything on the table coming in 2024, it\u2019s hard to imagine Bitcoin under $250,000. Everyone in this space knows that this is the greatest opportunity of a lifetime. For everyone else, they\u2019ll get Bitcoin at the price they deserve.\u201d"

        "content": "Fri 29 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nWith its SOL token back well above 100 dollars, Solana marks a resounding comeback and positions itself as a formidable opponent to Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Let\u2019s dissect the mechanisms of this resurgence.\n\nDoes Solana\u2019s Shadow Loom Over the Realm of Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana bets everything on speed. Its blockchain can process 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a mere 15 for Ethereum. A considerable advantage for attracting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2021, this argument captivated the masses. SOL surged spectacularly, from $1 in January to $260 in November. Its proponents even announced that Solana was on track to overtake Ethereum in the smart contracts market.\n\nHowever, the FTX debacle changed the game. The crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2018s platform, closely linked to Solana, sent SOL below $10. The blockchain also faced criticism for its technical vulnerabilities. Its future seemed uncertain.\n\nA Spectacular Comeback\n\nYet, the tide began to turn at the start of 2023. SOL rebounded sharply to $20 after the FTX collapse, and then surpassed $100 in mid-February.\n\nSeveral factors explain this rebound. On one hand, investors are returning to cryptocurrencies after difficult months. On the other hand, new projects are emerging on Solana, attracted by its low transaction fees.\n\nTrading volumes are surging, fueled by risky speculation. Last weekend, Solana even overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of spot transaction volume in SOL/USDT, reaching an impressive $1.037 billion on Binance.\n\nDoes this spectacular comeback mean that Solana is threatening the dominance of Ethereum? Not yet. With 29 billion dollars of assets locked, Vitalik Buterin\u2018s blockchain remains well ahead. Solana is worth 15 times less, at 1.5 billion according to data from DefiLlama, despite its rapid growth.\n\nNevertheless, this contender poses a serious threat. Solana continues to attract projects thanks to its low fees and record speed. If it overcomes its stability issues, it could continue to gain market share from Ethereum in the coming years. Their rivalry promises to be thrilling.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has shown impressive performance this year, with significant growth in price and market capitalization, making it one of the top digital currencies in the market.\n\nFuture growth potential for SOL hinges on factors like technology adoption, overcoming past network issues, regulatory developments, and potential strategic partnerships, which could enhance its market value and utility.\n\nDespite its progress, SOL\u2019s market cap is still behind major players like Ethereum, but it has surpassed them in certain metrics like trading volume and NFT sales volume in recent times.\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Progress Even More Next Year?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has been a top performer this year, with its price reaching almost $125 earlier this week. The token has skyrocketed by over 1,000% since January 1, while its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $50 billion mark and is currently standing at around $48 billion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThis uptrend has made SOL the fourth-largest digital currency in the entire market, outpacing Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nIn the following lines we will take a deeper dive and check whether the asset\u2019s progress could continue next year with SOL becoming the biggest alternative coin in the realm.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a scenario is not out of the cards but hinges on on multiple elements. One major factor is the possible adoption of the asset\u2019s technology and network. Solana is known for its low costs and fast transaction speed, which makes it a preferred ecosystem for decentralized applications.\n\nThe AI-powered chatbot also estimated that SOL\u2019s future success depends on coping with some issues that have caused reputational damage to the blockchain protocol in the past. Recall that Solana has experienced numerous network outages in the last few years.\n\nRegulatory development was also outlined as a vital factor. According to ChatGPT, the implementation of favorable rules in the crypto industry could have a positive impact on SOL.\n\nLast but not least, the chatbot pointed out possible partnerships that the blockchain entity might strike up with prominent organizations. Such strategic collaborations could enhance SOL\u2019s utility and adoption, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nDespite its rapid recent progress, SOL\u2019s market capitalization is still far from Ethereum\u2019s (almost $270 billion) and the one of USDT ($91 billion), meaning it has a long way to go before being throned as the largest altcoin.\n\nSolana has Already Surpassed Ethereum in These Metrics\n\nIt is worth noting that Solana has performed better than its rival for the top \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 in some aspects. According to DefiLlama, trading volume on Solana has surged above $1.3 billion in the past few days. For the most part of the month, Ethereum was lagging behind.\n\nSolana has also performed quite well in the non-fungible token space, registering an NFT sales volume of over $88 million in the last week. Ethereum has fallen behind with approximately $74 million for the same period.\n\nWhat is more, Solana flipped Ethereum in terms of search volumes on Google, which is a testament to the growing interest in the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "The Ethereum co-founder praised Arbitrum for becoming a stage 1 rollup.\n\nARB\u2019s price increased by 22% in 24 hours, indicating a drive toward $2.\n\nA few hours after Vitalik Buterin gave Arbitrum [ARB] a good mark for being the only stage 1 rollup, the price of its native token jumped by 22%. Buterin, who is the co-founder of Ethereum [ETH], had a conversation about the L2 on Warpcast.\n\nAccording to him, Arbitrum\u2019s move to stage 1 means that the project has become the first L2 to inch toward real decentralization.\n\nBeing a stage 1 rollup means Arbitrum has met the five requirements of becoming completely decentralized. One of these conditions includes allowing users to exit without the help of permission operators.\n\nAnother is having a complete fraud-proof system in place.\n\nFor context, a fraud-proof enables on-chain scalability while acting as protection against incorrect state transitions. In his statement, Buterin noted that he would be glad if other rollups could get to stage 1 by 2024.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy we have one unambiguously stage 1 rollup (and a couple more very-close-to-stage-1 rollups) this year. Real decentralization. Let\u2019s get to ten stage 1 rollups, and some degree of sequencer decentralization, in the next year.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto observed the chart shared by the Ethereum co-founder. According to the details, showed that the OP Mainnet, zkSyncn Era, and Base were at stage zero.\n\nThis implies that the projects were only left with one requirement to become a stage 1 rollup.\n\nHow did ARB react?\n\nAt press time, ARB\u2019s price was $1.59. Also, the price increase would be a relief to ARB holders who have had to endure an encouraging price action since the Arbitrum Foundation AirDrop to early users.\n\nThough ARB is 86% down from its launch price, the 76.45% 90-day increase implies that the token could be on its way to a new high. One other factor driving ARB\u2019s movement is ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH had broken out and its value was changing hands around $2,389.\n\nFurthermore, Arbitrum\u2019s fundamentals as an Ethereum L2 mean that there is a high chance that the ARB strongly correlates with ETH. On the derivative end of the market, AMBCrypto considered the ARB\u2019s Open Interest.\n\nUsing Coinglass data, the Open Interest had increased by 29% in the last 24 hours. Open Interest is the number of outstanding futures contracts linked to a cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen the Open Interest increases, it implies a rise in open long/short positions. However, a decline in the Open Interest suggests a drop in liquidity allocated to contracts.\n\nRead Arbitrum\u2019s [ARB] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nConsidering the price action, the rise in Open Interest might trigger a continuation of the uptrend. So, it is not out of place to project a rise to $2 for ARB. However, market participants would need to watch out for ETH\u2019s price action.\n\nShould ETH slow down its momentum, ARB might do the same. At the same time, if ETH runs in the $2,500 direction, then ARB might breach the $2 mark."

        "title": "Crypto Analyst Predicts Big Moves For Shiba Inu And PEPE, Here\u2019s The Trigger | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The prices of Shiba Inu and PEPE, although there has been movement in both of these assets, have not performed as well as expected. This could be attributed to the muted performance that Ethereum, the parent network of both assets, have put on recently, and thus, they have followed in its footsteps. However, as Ethereum begins to see better upside, things could change for both of these assets according to one analyst.\n\nWatch Out For Shiba Inu As Ethereum Begins To Break Out\n\nEthereum has started moving up again and is currently trading above $2,400 at the time of this writing. Naturally, crypto investors expect its ecosystem tokens to follow the same path, and one of those is Shiba Inu, as pseudonymous crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo explains.\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), the analyst shares their expectations for the Shiba Inu price going forward. Crypto Kaleo warns investors to keep an eye out for the Shiba Inu price especially as Ethereum begins another uptrend.\n\nThe crypto analyst expects good movement in price, possibly something that could rival its 2021 movement. Kaleo points out that the SHIB price is currently still trading in a base range of $0.00001, and this is a level that the price has maintained for almost one week now.\n\nGiven that the crypto\u2019s price has stayed in this range for so long, Kaleo expects a good thing if the price is able to break out of this range. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see another god candle similar to October \u201921 when it finally breaks out of this base range,\u201d Kaleo said.\n\nAlso a reminder to not sleep on $SHIB as $ETH starts to break out. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see another god candle similar to October \u201921 when it finally breaks out of this base range. pic.twitter.com/jRYYW6gcjq \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) December 28, 2023\n\nSHIB price above $0.00001 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nPEPE Expected To Follow The Same Path\n\nAs the Ethereum price recovers, Shiba Inu is not the only cryptocurrency that is expected to do well. Another coin that the crypto analyst points out is poised for good things during this time as well is the PEPE meme coin.\n\nPEPE has also been on a rather slow path over the last few months despite the fact that the Bitcoin price has been going up. There have been more dips than pumps, but Kaleo expects that this could change quickly as the pump commences.\n\nKaleo compared the expected movement to what happened with Solana (SOL) and BONK. The BONK price had risen drastically as the SOL price pumped. In the same vein, the crypto analyst expects the meme coin to reach a new all-time high as the Ethereum price begins to move as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there when it happens,\u201d Kaleo explains.\n\nThe same way $BONK printed new ATHs vs $SOL when it broke out, I see $PEPE printing new ATHs vs $ETH as it starts to move. It\u2019ll be one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there when it happens. pic.twitter.com/cvSPd9bxSt \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) December 27, 2023\n\nFeatured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "To help Ethereum\u2019s scalability, layer-2 blockchains, or a blockchain on top of a blockchain, are born. And among the layer-2 blockchains for Ethereum is zkSync.\n\n(Read more: Ultimate Guide to Solana Airdrops 2023 \u2013 2024 and 10 Potential Crypto Airdrops to Watch Out For in 2024)\n\n(Also read: Solana Airdrop Checker Tool Guide To Check If Your Wallet is Eligible and BONKbot Telegram Bot Guide: Fastest Way to Buy and Sell Solana Coins)\n\nzkSync Introduction\n\nzkSyync tags itself as a trustless protocol for scalable, low-cost payments on Ethereum. As a layer-2 blockchain for Ethereum, it offers EVM projects high-speed, low-cost transactions while utilizing Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cWhile security is our paramount priority, user and developer experience are central to zkSync design. We obsessively seek out improvements that eliminate friction and complexity in order to make zkSync the most enjoyable platform on Ethereum, for both end-users and builders,\u201d its website read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its whitepaper, zkSync developers highly emphasized the network\u2019s advantages over other layer 2 blockchains\u2014security and usability. It is because, according to them, zkRollup, the technology behind zkSync, does not require operational activity to keep its user\u2019s funds safe:\n\n\u201cFor example, users can go offline for a year, then come back and be sure to safely withdraw their assets without any external help\u2014even if zkRollup validators were long gone. At our current stage of development, we encourage users to monitor the chain for upgrades and withdraw if they disagree with upcoming changes\u2014in the future, upgrades will require a strict opt-in.\u201d\n\nzkSync Features\n\nzkSync\u2019s main target is dApp developers. The layer 2 blockchain offers:\n\nHello World: A set of zkSync Era development toolboxes for building a full dApp.\n\nInteracting with zkSync Era: A set of modules and lessons to learn the essentials of interacting with zkSync Era, utilizing zkSync SDKs, and connecting to the network via Metamask.\n\nUseful Addresses: A comprehensive list of essential addresses for building on zkSync.\n\nAside from these features, developers can also use zkSync to:\n\nSend an L1 to L2 transaction through the zkSync Era smart contracts.\n\nSend an L2 to L1 message via sending arbitrary-length messages from zkSync Era to Ethereum, and then handling the received message on Ethereum with an L1 smart contract.\n\nTransfer a token on L2.\n\nVerify contracts with its Hardhat plugin.\n\nMeanwhile, non-developer web3 natives can still use the zkSync transfer, as it also aggregates and supports several platforms and offers it on its website as:\n\nA native bridge to transfer tokens from Era to Ethereum or other networks. Just choose the native bridges offered by zkSync, connect your wallet, and type in the derided amount to be bridged.\n\nA platform to bridge tokens from centralized exchanges. Just choose the list of CEXs supported by zkSync and transfer the assets to the wallet connected to the platform.\n\nA fiat on-ramp service. Just choose an om-ramp app, connect your wallet, and directly buy crypto using a credit card, bank transfers, and other payment methods.\n\nBlock Explorers. Explore transactions, blocks, batches, contracts, and much more information about zkSync chains. Just choose the supported explorers, and search the information needed using its address.\n\nzkSync Airdrop Guide\n\nzkSync supports $ETH and all the ERC20 tokens. However, it still does not have its own utility token that should be used for paying for the transactions on the platform, instead, it is using Ethereum gas for its fees.\n\nThus, its community is speculating that once its own native token, a major airdrop will happen.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this potential airdrop is just mere community speculation, and zkSync developers are yet to confirm or announce it, especially on whether they will really launch a token or implement a points system instead.\n\nBut to be safe, the community is encouraging users to continue using the platform\u2014whether as a developer for building dApps or as a crypto native for using it as a bridge.\n\nThis article is published on BitPinas: zkSync Guide and Possible Airdrop Strategy\n\nDisclaimer:"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Three Ways To Simplify Ethereum Staking Features - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA - Ethereum, one of the largest crypto platforms in the world, is in the process of transitioning from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This change aims to increase efficiency, security and scalability of the Ethereum network, which is currently facing problems such as high transaction fees, large energy consumption, and network bottlenecks.\n\nHowever, the switch to PoS also poses new challenges, mainly related to digital signature management, which is proof that validators have participated in the block validation process. In PoS, validators are entities that deposit a number of ether, Ethereum cryptocurrencies, for the right to validate blocks and get rewards.\n\nThe number of signatures required for each slot, which is the time interval in which one block is created, currently stands at 262,144, which makes the validation process very complex and burdens the network.\n\nTo address this issue, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, recently proposed three potential solutions in a post on the Ethereum Research forum. These three solutions aim to simplify the validation process by reducing the number of necessary signatures to just 8,192 per slot, thereby simplifying and reducing network loads.\n\nChanges In Staking Pool Structure\n\nThe first solution proposed by Buterin is to change the staking pool structure, namely the validator group that combines their resources to increase validation opportunities and share rewards.\n\nFor additional information, the PoS mechanism allows staking, namely storing crypto assets at a certain time in the network. Staker will act as a validator. For its role in securing the network, stakers will be rewarded in the form of crypto assets.\n\nButerin suggests increasing the minimum number of ether required to run the validator, so small validators must join the staking pool to keep participating. Thus, the total number of validators will decrease, and so will the number of signatures.\n\nStaker Distribution\n\nThe second solution proposed by Buterin is to implement a two-tier staking system, which is to differentiate between stakers with different responsibilities and requirements. These two levels of stakers are the main stakers and secondary stakers. Stakers are the parties who stake ETH.\n\nThe main staker has heavier requirements, such as depositing more ether, running more advanced hardware, and signing more blocks. Secondary stakers have milder requirements, such as depositing less ether, running simpler hardware, and signing fewer blocks.\n\nThese two staker levels will be integrated differently in the block finalization process, namely a process in which the blocks are permanently confirmed and cannot be canceled. The main staker will be responsible for the finalization of the main block, which occurs every 64 slots or about 12 minutes. The secondary staker will be responsible for the finalization of the secondary block, which occurs every slot or about 12 seconds as reported by Coingape.\n\nThis separation can create a more balanced system, where responsibility and rewards are in line with different staker capabilities and commitments. The main staker will get a bigger reward, but also take a greater risk if they make a mistake or cheat. The secondary staker will get a smaller reward, but also take a smaller risk. However, this solution also introduces complexity in managing these two staker levels and ensures fair and effective participation of both.\n\nRandomly Voted Validator Elections\n\nThe final solution proposed by Buterin is to use a rotating validator system, which is to randomly select a group of validators for each slot, thus distributing workload more evenly across the network. Thus, no validator has to sign all blocks, but only a fraction of them. This can reduce the number of necessary signatures, and also improve network security by preventing attacks against specific validators.\n\nHowever, this solution also introduces a new complexity, namely a random selection process that must ensure justice and transparency while maintaining network security and efficiency. This solution also requires good coordination between different validators, and considering the possibility of inactive or dishonest validators.\n\nEach solution proposed by Buterin has its own advantages and challenges. Buterin admits that there are no perfect solutions, and that each solution requires further testing and evaluation before it is implemented.\n\nButerin also stressed that these solutions are not only relevant to Ethereum, but also to other crypto networks that use or intend to use PoS as their consensus mechanism. PoS is considered an alternative that is more environmentally friendly and more democratic than PoW (proof-of-work), which requires a lot of energy and tends to benefit miners who have more powerful hardware.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "title": "StarkNet Crypto Airdrop: How to be eligible for STRK Airdrop? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "If you\u2019re into airdrops, Starknet is a must-check for one of the most promising airdrops in 2023. Its parent company, StarkWare, has received a whopping $273 million in funding and is currently valued at $8 billion. This season seems to be full of crypto airdrops. We have already published two potential airdrops: Scroll Name Service (SNS) and DeBank\n\nStarknet is now live on its Mainnet, and the tasks for the airdrop are pretty straightforward. You can complete them in just about 20 minutes, depending on how quickly you move. So, let\u2019s take a look at this StarkNet airdrop article in more detail.\n\nStarkNet stands out as a Layer 2 network developed by StarkWare to enhance the scalability of the Ethereum network through Validity Rollups (or Zk Rollups). As highlighted on its website, StarkNet empowers decentralized applications (dapps) to attain unlimited scalability for both transactions and computation, all while benefiting from the robust security features of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nA key component of their offering is StarkEx, which has gained substantial social validation, as evidenced by its impressive clientele. The permissioned solution serves as the hosting platform for notable clients such as ImmutableX, dYdX, Sorare, ApeX, and Immutable, showcasing the widespread adoption and trust within the industry.\n\nWhat is $STRK Token?\n\nThe deployment of the StarkNet token ($STRK) took place on the Ethereum mainnet on November 16, 2022. Despite being deployed, the tokens are not currently available for sale. Notably, the StarkWare team has maintained a high level of transparency regarding the launch, distribution, and allocation plan of the token.\n\nThis information is derived from a blog post on the Medium platform authored by StarkWare, where they detail their approach and plans for the StarkNet token.\n\nHas the $STRK Airdrop Been Confirmed?\n\nOn December 8, 2023, Starknet officially announced a 1.8 billion $STRK token airdrop. Despite the confirmation, there is no specified timeline provided. While there\u2019s still an opportunity to participate in the Starknet airdrop, it remains uncertain whether the snapshot has already been taken. Although there might be a risk of it being too late, akin to Solana airdrops, you can explore the possibility of participating in airdrops offered by popular Starknet decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nHow to be eligible for Starknet Airdrop?\n\nStarknet is currently operating on its mainnet, providing numerous opportunities to engage with applications that may make you eligible for an airdrop. The process involves bridging funds and engaging with well-known Starknet decentralized applications (dApps), such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT marketplaces. It\u2019s a straightforward process, and here are what I consider the most beneficial tasks for maximizing your chances in this potential airdrop:\n\nCreate a MetaMask Wallet\n\nFor this guide, we\u2019ll require two wallets, beginning with MetaMask. If you haven\u2019t installed it yet, visit the Metamask website to create your wallet. Then, add some Ethereum to it.\n\nCreate a Starknet Wallet\n\nStarknet does not operate on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so using MetaMask, which is designed for the EVM, is not suitable for most Starknet applications. To interact effectively, you\u2019ll need a specialized Starknet wallet. The top two options for this purpose are Argent and Braavos.\n\nVisit https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/ or https://braavos.app/\n\nSet up your wallet on the same browser/device as your MetaMask\n\nBridge ETH to Starknet\n\nBridging to Starknet: Exploring the Pathways\n\nDifferent Bridges for Starknet:\n\nStarkgate Bridge\n\nOrbiter Finance Bridge\n\nLayerSwap\n\nNow it\u2019s time to transfer some ETH to Starknet using the native bridge, StarkGate. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit https://starkgate.starknet.io\n\n2. Connect both your MetaMask and Starknet Wallet.\n\n3. Initiate the process to bridge ETH to StarkGate. Ensure you send enough ETH to cover the gas fees. Transaction costs on Starknet typically range from $0.50 to $3.00.\n\n4. You have the option to bridge ETH directly from the Ethereum Mainnet. Alternatively, if you want to minimize gas fees, you can also bridge the ETH mentioned with the help of the above-mentioned bridges.\n\nUtilize the foremost decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Starknet\n\nNow that we have money on Starknet, let\u2019s use some popular apps. Decentralized exchanges are an easy way to do things on the blockchain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for to get airdrops. According to DeFi Llama, here are the biggest decentralized exchanges on Starknet:\n\nEkubo\n\nMySwap\n\nJediswap\n\n10kswap\n\nHead to these decentralized exchanges (DEXs), connect your wallet, and exchange tokens on each platform. You have the flexibility to swap any token and any amount, as many times as you like. Additionally, consider adding liquidity to the pools and withdrawing it.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accumulate at least 5-10 transactions in your wallet or even more, providing a solid beginning. For optimal airdrop rewards, return every 30 days or more and perform similar tasks.\n\nAnticipating the STARK Airdrop: Unveiling the Plans for 2024\n\nThe STARK Airdrop is on the horizon, with an impressive allocation of 900 million STRK tokens for transparent distribution across various programs. This implies multiple airdrops, emphasizing a focus on long-term engagement with the network.\n\nThe timeframe is expected to be lengthy, so don\u2019t expect the 900 million STRK tokens to be ready for an airdrop next week. This approach encourages sustained engagement with the blockchain.\n\n900M STRK for \u201cUser Rebates\u201d\n\n50M for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi\u201d\n\nThe allocation of 900 million STRK tokens for \u201cUser Rebates\u201d suggests a potential refund for ETH spent on gas fees by users. Another 50 million is allocated for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi,\u201d with direct, indirect, and retroactive incentivization in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Protocols are expected to receive tokens, and Yield Farming on Starknet will commence.\n\nTimeframe and Outlook: Q1 2024 and Beyond\n\nThe research phase is nearing completion, and execution and deployment are scheduled for Q1 2024. This provides a clear timeline, especially for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi,\u201d indicating that STRK yield farming will likely begin early next year.\n\nDevelopers and Dapps: Anticipating New Announcements\n\nSubject to Terms & Conditions: Possible Exclusions\n\nFor developers and decentralized applications (Dapps), there are imminent announcements. A formal announcement is expected next week. It\u2019s noted that certain terms and conditions may apply, potentially including exclusions for the USA."
