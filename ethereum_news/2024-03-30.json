        "title": "MetaMask's parent company ConsenSys urges SEC to approve Ethereum spot ETF - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "According to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum would be much more expensive and time-consuming than Bitcoin\n\nShare this article\n\nConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, has submitted a public comment letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advocating for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The letter highlights the robust security features of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, specifically addressing concerns about potential fraud and manipulation within the network.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for public comments , issued on March 8, seeks insights into whether Ethereum\u2019s PoS could present unique security challenges. ConsenSys responded with a comprehensive argument, asserting that Ethereum\u2019s PoS surpasses the security benchmarks established by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW), which has already been the basis for approved Bitcoin-based ETFs.\n\nAccording to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum is more expensive than attacking Bitcoin. Plus, an attack on Ethereum would also be much slower. Researchers estimate it could take nearly six months to gain control of the network, while an attack on Bitcoin potentially happens faster.\n\n\u201cThe total cost to attack on Ethereum would be nearly $34.39 billion (at December 2023 ether prices), and it would take nearly six months.20 The total cost to attack on Bitcoin, consisting mostly of the cost of computer hardware and electricity, would range from just under $5 billion to a little over $20 billion and could be waged more or less immediately. This makes Ethereum significantly more costly to attack than Bitcoin for the particular scenario addressed by the researchers,\u201d wrote ConsenSys.\n\nConsenSys additionally outlined several key advantages of Ethereum\u2019s PoS, including faster block finality, a distributed and randomized validation process, higher network attack costs, and slashing penalties for validators who breach protocol rules. These features, combined with Ethereum\u2019s environmental efficiency and transparent, decentralized community, provide a strong case for the network\u2019s resilience against fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe letter concludes with a call to the SEC to acknowledge the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed those of Bitcoin-based ETPs.\n\n\u201cThere is no justifiable reason to deny the listing and trading of the iShares Ethereum Trust based on concerns over ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. We urge the Commission to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs previously approved by the Commission,\u201d stated ConsenSys.\n\nLast month, Coinbase sent a comment letter to the SEC in support of spot Ethereum ETFs . Coinbase\u2019s main claim in the letter is that Ethereum (ETH) is not a security and that Ethereum\u2019s PoS system effectively manages the network and mitigates risks. The firm also cited the recent approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a strong precedent for approving a similar product for Ethereum."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nConsensys, a prominent player in the blockchain and Web3 software space, has submitted a compelling argument to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging it to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design and grant approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsensys' argument for Ethereum ETF approval\n\nIn their comment letter to the SEC, Consensys addresses concerns raised by the Commission regarding Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the potential for fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn Consensys\u2019 response to the regulatory body, it maintains that the SEC's scrutiny and concerns are \u201cwholly without merit\u201d given that Bitcoin-based ETFs have already been approved for trading by the SEC. They maintain that the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation mechanisms present in Ethereum's PoS are more robust and surpass the resilience of Bitcoin's PoW consensus model against tampering.\n\nThe comment letter highlighted key reasons the SEC should go ahead and grant approval. Consensys insisted that Ethereum's transition to PoS enables provable transaction finality, ensuring that blocks are irreversibly confirmed in a shorter time frame compared to PoW systems.\n\nIts PoS model involves segregated roles for block validators, which prevents concentrated control. This, it claims, mitigates the risk of manipulation and adds an extra layer of security. The other consideration about its classification was also addressed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who believes that an Ether-based spot ETF could still be launched even if Ethereum ends up being labeled a security.\n\nContrasting Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance with Bitcoin's\n\nThe Web3 software company says Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is higher than Bitcoin's. It asserts that Ethereum\u2019s mechanism of penalizing validators who violate protocol rules by slashing their stakes serves as a deterrent against malicious behavior. Additionally, Ethereum's PoS model is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than Bitcoin's PoW.\n\nConsensys makes a passionate appeal to the regulatory body ahead of the possible approval by stating, \u201cWe urge the SEC to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs that have previously been approved by the SEC.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Ethereum ETF is being constantly delayed by the SEC, stakeholders anticipate a decision in the coming months. Regardless, Ethereum continues to gain traction as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a price of $3,502.43."

        "content": "Ethereum price trades inside the $3,054 to $4,095 range on the four-hour chart.\n\nA sweep of the sell-side liquidity seems likely before ETH attempts to move $4,000.\n\nIn some cases, ETH could sweep the rang high at $4,095.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks ready for an ascent, at least from a breakout traders\u2019 perspective. But this isn\u2019t always the case as market makers or smart money tends to collect liquidity in the opposite direction first. So, eager ETH bulls need to exercise patience.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Retail watches from the sidelines with a bias for shorts\n\nEthereum price likely to trap impatient traders\n\nEthereum price set up a range, extending from $3,054 to $4,095 during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. Currently ETH is has triggered a quick ascent above the aforementioned range\u2019s midpoint at $3,574.\n\nWhile this volatile move might be alluring to trade, investors need to exercise caution. In crypto, the initial breakout is often undone by quick corrections. The aim of such a move is to collect the liquidity below key levels. In this case, ETH has produced higher highs since forming the range low on March 20.\n\nHence, a breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived, i.e., a correction might ensue soon. A sweep of $3,461 could be a good place to enter longs, provided Bitcoin (BTC) is also done with its short-term liquidity collection. In such a case, ETH is most likely to rally higher, overcome the $3,658 hurdle and eye a retest of the $4,000 psychological level. Resting, $95 above this level is the range high at $4,095, which could also be tagged if the buying pressure is high.\n\nAlso read: Crypto traders bet $2.4M on spot Ether ETF approval results\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the contrary, if Bitcoin price fails to recover after short-term liquidity run, it will most likely take altcoins down with it. In such a case, Ethereum price could sweep the range low at $3,054. A flip of the said level into a resistance level would invalidate the bullish thesis for ETH and confirm the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis development could lead to Ethereum price crashing nearly 2% and tagging the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin wants rollups to hit stage one decentralization by year-end\n\n(This story was corrected on April 1 at 06:10 GMT to say that the $4,095 level could be revisited if there is high buying pressure, not selling pressure.)"

        "title": "Why Major Cryptocurrencies Soared This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "From strong bitcoin ETF inflows to anticipation of next month's bitcoin halving event, major cryptocurrencies continued their multimonth run higher this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied this week amid multiple potential catalysts including strong net inflows into bitcoin ETFs, notable new registration filings for spot Ether ETFs, and an anticipated \"bitcoin halving\" event in early April.\n\nWhen all was said and done as of the close of Friday's regular session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.01%) was up 9.7% on the week, while Ethereum (ETH -2.25%) had gained 5.1%. So-called memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE -6.36%) and Shiba Inu (SHIB -8.22%) also soared 41.2% and 16.5%, respectively, this week.\n\nOn Bitcoin ETF inflows, new spot ETH ETF filings\n\nThe price of Bitcoin eclipsed $71,000 several times this week -- a week after falling below $63,000 -- before settling to trade around $69,500 as of this writing. The world's most prominent cryptocurrency was bolstered in part by huge net inflows into bitcoin ETFs exceeding $243.4 million on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB 1.50%) singlehandedly registered net inflows of $200.7 million, becoming the third bitcoin ETF to cross the $200 million mark since the the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 13 bitcoin ETFs back in January.\n\nBitcoin, for its part, has enjoyed an incredible rally dating back to October 2023, which came after months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nFor perspective, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage -- as opposed to requiring investors to set up separate crypto trading accounts with a crypto-specific firm. So ETFs are a much more accessible medium for anyone who wants to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. The SEC's approvals have stood out vote of confidence from a government agency in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment option.\n\nSome investors have also speculated more recently that Etherium ETF approvals could be on the way in the coming months, further bolstering crypto investment options for retail traders. On Wednesday, Fidelity Investments filed a Form S-1 Registration statement for its own spot ETH ETF. Asset Management firm Bitwise followed suit with its own registration statement filing for a similar spot Ether ETF on Thursday.\n\nOn the bitcoin halving event\n\nMeanwhile, crypto investors are eagerly awaiting a so-called bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April -- the fourth such event in bitcoin's history, with previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 -- where bitcoin miners' reward for solving complex transactions is effectively cut in half to limit the rate at which new bitcoin are introduced into the system until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Bitcoin's price has previously skyrocketed following each of the first three bitcoin halving events, so investors have naturally speculated a similar rally could occur next month.\n\nThe halving event is similar in some ways to a stock split, where a company may reduce its per-share price but commensurately increase the number of shares issued. Splits are a zero-sum event, of course, considering the value of the underlying business remains the same. But many retail investors tend to believe the lower post-split stock price is more attractive. Multiple cryptocurrency market pundits have argued that this halving event should further spur adoption of bitcoin while also limiting supply -- effectively keeping the price of bitcoin high.\n\n\"The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term,\" Azteco Chief Marketing Officer David Bailey wrote this week. \"As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.\"\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that the price of bitcoin will rally on the heels of this halving in the near term. But it's hardly surprising to see crypto traders embracing the positivity leading up to the event."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is detailing when he believes Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins could outpace Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 321,000 YouTube subscribers that the altcoin market is setting up for a massive rally \u2013 with the ETH/BTC pair as its proxy.\n\n\u201cStill seems like the market is building for those mega 37x potential returns for altcoins. [ETH/BTC] is a bit of a proxy for the altcoin pump.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pizzino, if history repeats itself and ETH/BTC behaves the same way it did the last time Bitcoin hit its 2021 cycle peak, traders can expect a breakout of the pair sometime in the coming months. Pizzino\u2019s chart indicates that it could be in May or June.\n\n\u201cThe point here is: [we had a] new Bitcoin all-time high month, the following month was down and then ETH went on a pretty significant run from there.\n\nSo if things are similar to last time, maybe this is the move down because Bitcoin is pushing to new all-time highs, it\u2019s taking the show, then you see another red month here as Bitcoin continues on, and then a reversal here for ETH.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05145 BTC ($3,616) at time of writing.\n\nPizzino goes on to say that the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) will likely go through a similar process.\n\n\u201cSame sort of thing for Solana\u2026\n\nJust looking back at the previous cycle, [Solana was a much] weaker crypto at the time, [it is] now a lot stronger than what it was back then, but you can see also with the Bitcoin new all-time high price around November (2021), it still went lower even against [the] USD at that time, but then that was the time to skyrocket, so we\u2019re in a similar sort of period now where Bitcoin\u2019s gotten into its new all-time high.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $196 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This trend is viewed as a bullish indicator, hinting at potential upward movements in Ethereum\u2019s price in the foreseeable future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts have been expecting the Ethereum price rally to continue to $4,000 and further to hit its all-time high of $5,000 by the year-end. On the other hand, there have been mixed opinions regarding the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF with big players like Bitwise staying optimistic about the SEC approval by mid-May 2024.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum initiated a downward correction, dipping below the $3,550 mark. After retesting the $3,450 support level, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s movement, bullish momentum emerged. The price formed a low near $3,459 before rebounding.\n\nA notable development occurred with a breach above the $3,520 resistance area. Bulls propelled the price above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward swing from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low. Additionally, the ETH price broke a crucial bearish trend line, marked by resistance at $3,540 on the ETH/USD hourly chart.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading above $3,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Looking ahead, immediate resistance looms near the $3,600 level, with the first major obstacle residing at around $3,630. This level coincides with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low.\n\nOn the upside, the next major resistance is at $3,680, crossing which will open the gates for a further rally to $4,000. On the downside, the first major support is at $3,480 dropping under which could open further gates at the $3,250 level.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum showcased a bullish market structure on the 12-hour chart.\n\nKey retracement levels have been defended thus far, but a retest can\u2019t be ruled out yet.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] continued to trade within the short-term range. They have a bullish bias on the higher timeframe price charts, and whales were accumulating both assets at a rapid pace.\n\nA recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that this accumulation could continue for some more time. Bitcoin has high amounts of liquidity close by, which could hinder attempts to break out in either direction.\n\nBitcoin saw stalled momentum and buying pressure\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement levels plotted for the rally from $50.5k to $73.7k showed that the 50% retracement level was tested as support in mid-March.\n\nIt saw a decent reaction and Bitcoin was trading at $50k at press time.\n\nYet, the RSI on the 12-hour chart was only at 57, which signaled bullish momentum but not notable strength.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow was at +0.01 and would need to climb above +0.05 to show significant capital inflow.\n\nThe market structure on the 12-hour chart was bullish. A BTC that falls below $60.7 would flip the market structure bearishly.\n\nThe liquidation levels heatmap showed a significant concentration in the $74k-$74.8k zone. To the south, the $60k-$60.7k also has an intense number of liquidation levels.\n\nCloser to current prices, the band of liquidity at $68.2k was also expected to play a role.\n\nA move above $72k is a cause for celebration for Bitcoin bulls, but expect multiple tries before prices break past the $75k region.\n\nEthereum climbs to the LTF resistance \u2014 will it break out soon?\n\nEthereum also saw its momentum stall out over the past two weeks. Its 12-hour RSI showed a reading of 54, which signaled bullishness.\n\nIts market structure was also bullish, and the 78.6% retracement level saw a good reaction from the buyers.\n\nHowever, despite the buying volume in the past ten days, the OBV could not embark on an uptrend. It has sunk almost as low as the January highs, even though the price of ETH is close to 40% higher.\n\nThis lack of demand meant Ethereum bulls could take time to catch their breath before attempting the next rally. At press time, it faced some short-term resistance at $3680.\n\nCoinalyze metrics noted the steep selling pressure in the spot markets in March. The spot CVD trended downward this month and only recently flattened out from the southward spiral.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nThe Open Interest has climbed considerably from the 17th of March. It has risen from $9 billion to $10.31 billion, while Ethereum jumped from $3.2k to $3.6k.\n\nThis outlined some bullish conviction amongst speculators in the Futures market.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have cooled down substantially since hitting $73,000 and $4,000, respectively, with a good number of holders taking solid profits. That makes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales flush with capital to throw around for the next bull run. One of the hottest investment opportunities that has been receiving major inflows is DeeStream (DST). DeeStream\u2019s presale is being tipped as the next 50x opportunity, and a good number of early adopters have been Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales. Here\u2019s why.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin (BTC) Cools Down as Investors Consolidate\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reached an all time high of $73,737 earlier this month; however, since then, a massive spate of sell offs ultimately cooled off the rally. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $60,000 a couple of times since, but has bounced back pretty well each time it did. As of March 28th, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $70,766, still keeping a majority of holders in profit as the token enters a consolidation phase. Other Bitcoin (BTC) holders, meanwhile, are rotating profits into DeeStream (DST) to extract even bigger gains in the next bull cycle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Follows Suit After Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum (ETH), trading at $3,552 as of March 28th, is up 2.38% as of press time from the last 7 days after bottoming out at $3,302.25. Nevertheless, Ethereum (ETH) has been in an uptrend over the past 2 weeks, trading at a small increase. Ethereum (ETH) has retraced in a major way since hitting $4,000 earlier this month. Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) traders are taking profits and reallocating them into DeeStream (DST).\n\nDeeStream (DST) Presale Stage 2 Debuts Amid Major Intrigue\n\nThe world is welcoming the first and only blockchain based streaming powerhouse looking to disrupt the live streaming industry with its unique decentralized approach to the format.

DeeStream (DST) creates an inclusive, secure, and community driven space that encourages communication between streamers and their audience creating a strictly better decentralized alternative to YouTube.\n\nIt is no surprise why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are joining the DeeStream (DST) presale with tokens available at just $0.055. Crypto fans are eagerly buying in, eager to invest in this innovative platform. With over 16,500 registered users and over 3,100 presale investors (and counting), these numbers are likely to grow as DST continues to gain attention in the crypto market.\n\nMany investors are eager to participate in DeeStream\u2019s (DST) revenue sharing model.

The protocol also offers a dollar-denominated savings instrument called \u201cthe Internet Bond.\u201d\n\nExplains the project\u2019s whitepaper,\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Internet Bond\u2019 will combine yield derived from staked Ethereum as well as the funding and basis spread from perpetual and futures\u2019 markets, to create the first on-chain crypto-native \u2018bond\u2019 that can function as a dollar-denominated savings instrument for users in permitted jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nBetween March 30th and April 2nd, Binance users can stake BNB as well as the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD) into separate pools to farm ENA. The exchange then plans to list the asset on April 2nd.\n\nBinance will attach a seed tag to ENA, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they\u2019re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The anticipation surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF has intensified as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delves into Ethereum\u2019s security status. Meanwhile, this move has dampened the market sentiment lately, with the market participants anticipating a delay in Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nNotably, amid concerns of a potential delay in approval, blockchain firm Consensys steps forward, urging the SEC to recognize Ethereum\u2019s advanced safeguards.\n\nadvertisement\n\nConsensys Advocates For Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nIn a bid to bolster the case for an Ethereum ETF, Consensys has submitted a comment letter to the SEC, emphasizing the robust security measures inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design. The letter, shared on Consensys, addresses the SEC\u2019s inquiry into Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and its susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn addition, Consensys contends that Ethereum\u2019s PoS implementation not only meets but exceeds the security standards established by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model, which has already garnered SEC approval for related Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). Besides, the company highlights several key features of Ethereum\u2019s PoS model, including faster block finality, distributed validation processes, and slashing penalties for protocol violations.\n\nMeanwhile, the letter emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s resilience against attacks, citing research that demonstrates the significantly higher cost of compromising Ethereum\u2019s network compared to Bitcoin\u2019s. Furthermore, Consensys underscores the environmental benefits of Ethereum\u2019s PoS, which consumes substantially less energy than Bitcoin\u2019s PoW.\n\nAlso Read: Aptos Network Buzz, Activity Surge Reflects in 48% Price Surge\n\nDriving Progress in Regulatory Clarity\n\nConsensys\u2019 proactive stance in advocating for Ethereum ETF approval reflects its commitment to advancing the adoption of blockchain technology. By engaging in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies like the SEC, Consensys aims to pave the way for broader accessibility to decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications.\n\nMeanwhile, as the SEC evaluates the comments provided by Consensys and other stakeholders, the outcome of the deliberations will impact the crypto market on a broader scale. In other words, the outcome will not only impact the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s market but also set precedents for future regulatory decisions in the crypto space.\n\nIn navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation, collaborative efforts between industry players and regulatory authorities are crucial to fostering innovation while ensuring investor protection. However, despite Consensys\u2019s push, the Ethereum price was down 1.84% and traded at $3,503.43 during writing.\n\nThe trading volume of the second-largest crypto also dropped 7.55% over the last 24 hours to $12.79 billion. Notably, the ETH price saw a high of $3,575.59 and a low of $3,475.73 in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Whale Dumps 140 Mln DOGE As Price Takes Bearish Turn, What\u2019s Next?\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "Whale transactions worth over $100,000 rose significantly in March.\n\nThe optimism could be flowing from CFTC labelling ETH as a commodity.\n\nDespite critical events like the Dencun Upgrade, Ethereum [ETH] underperformed in March, with just a marginal increase of 0.79% over the 30-day period. The second-largest cryptocurrency faced strong resistance at the $4,000 mark, dropping to $3.500 as of this writing.\n\nBut the slump didn\u2019t deter large investors of the coin, who continued to add Ethereum exposure to their portfolios.\n\nWhales trust ETH to go big\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, whale transactions worth over $100,000 rose significantly throughout the month. These transactions resulted in a sharp increase in small whale wallets which typically hold between 1,000 \u2013 10,000 coins.\n\nThis nature of accumulation is known as \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d The strategy involves buying assets during temporary price drops to benefit from potential future price increases.\n\nDriven by research and business acumen, this plan is usually adopted for fundamentally-strong assets with long-term growth potential.\n\nThe level of bullishness was also reflected in the increasing long exposure in the derivatives markets. As per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data, about 72% of total whale positions on crypto exchange Binance were betting on ETH to rise.\n\nWhales\u2019 bullish strategy seemed to have been picked up by the broader market. The general mood was one of \u201cGreed\u201d as per the Fear and Greed Index. Typically, such sentiments lead to FOMO, drawing in more investors and adding to the buying pressure.\n\nBut what was motivating whales to be bullish on ETH?\n\nChances of spot ETF approval improving?\n\nIn recent weeks, a lot of pessimism had set in surrounding the approval of Ether spot ETFs. The odds were getting lowered due to increasing possibility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deeming Ether as a security.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, U.S. derivatives market regulator, Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) referred ETH as a commodity in the recent KuCoin lawsuit.\n\nThis could have rekindled investors\u2019 hopes that an Ether spot ETF would eventually see the light of day. If approved, spot ETFs have the potential to do for ETH what Bitcoin has been witnessing since mid-January."

The neutral candle confirmation formation with long wicks reflects no dominance from buyers or sellers toward these assets.

This horizontal level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level indicating a healthy retracement phase for Ether to recuperate its bullish momentum.\n\nFurthermore, a positive turnaround uplifted the coin\u2019s market value by 20% to challenge resistance at $3700. Amid the current market uncertainty, the ETH price is wavering below this overhead resistance to currently trade at $3530.\n\nHowever, this consolidation in the 4-hour chart revealed the formation of a bullish reversal pattern called inverted head and shoulder.

Doing so will provide buyers with suitable support to prolong its recovery trend to $4300.\n\nOn a contrary note, a breakdown below the support at $3460 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The ETH price above the key EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the near-term trend as bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope wavering around 50% indicates an uncertain market sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

This surge is complemented by impressive weekly and monthly gains, boasting increases of over 13% and 19%, respectively.\n\nDespite regulatory scrutiny, Ethereum remains robust, with experts like Captain Faibik showing a bullish outlook. Such resilience solidifies Ethereum\u2019s position as a reliable option for crypto investors, balancing innovation with regulatory compliance.\n\nMantle (MNT) Investors: Collaborative Resilience\n\nMantle has strategically leveraged collaborations, notably with Merchant Moe, resulting in an 8.90% price spike.

This innovative approach enables BlockDAG to achieve a processing capability of 10 blocks per second, with aspirations to surpass 30 blocks per second. Such enhanced processing speed allows miners with reasonable hash rates to mine continuously on a single block, improving mining efficiency and consistency.\n\nDistinguished by its hybrid consensus mechanism, BlockDAG addresses significant challenges within decentralized networks, enhancing transaction security and efficiency compared to traditional Proof-of-Work models. Leveraging DAG technology, BlockDAG eliminates orphan blocks, boosts throughput, and resolves decentralization dilemmas without compromising security, accessibility, or scalability.\n\nAs BlockDAG aims to redefine everyday crypto transactions and enterprise-level DeFi protocols, its presale has raised over $10.5 million and sold over 5.7 billion coins, showcasing its unique standing in the crypto realm.\n\nA Leap Towards BlockDAG\n\nBlockDAG presents an unparalleled opportunity to participate in a mineable network poised for substantial growth and offering a 5000X ROI potential.
