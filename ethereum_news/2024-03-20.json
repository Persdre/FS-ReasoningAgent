        "title": "SEC probing crypto companies in Ethereum investigation as hopes for ETF dim - Fortune",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is waging an energetic legal campaign to classify Ethereum, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, as a security, according to U.S. companies that have received subpoenas related to an investigation. The news delivers a further blow to the crypto industry\u2019s hopes the agency will approve applications by BlackRock and others for an Ethereum ETF following the SEC\u2019s approval of a series of Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Ethereum investigation involves demanding companies furnish any documents and financial records they may have regarding their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit group that oversees the governance and development of the blockchain by the same name.\n\nAccording to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena request, the SEC\u2019s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began shortly after the blockchain\u2019s shift to a new governance model known as \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d in September 2022. Another person at a separate company that received a subpoena described it as narrow and focused on the Ethereum Foundation, and said they received the subpoena in the last few weeks.\n\nThat proof-of-stake event moved the blockchain away from the energy-intensive model used by Bitcoin in favor of one that relies on a trusted network of validators\u2014and provided the SEC with a new pretext to attempt to define Ethereum as a security, according to people at three different companies familiar with the subpoenas. The people asked Fortune not to identify identify them or their firms for fear of retaliation by the agency\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, whom one described as \u201cvindictive.\u201d\n\nThe existence of an investigation into the Ethereum Foundation was reported on Wednesday by CoinDesk, which cited an update to the group\u2019s Github code repository that reportedly provided evidence of a probe by an unknown state agency.\n\n\u201cThe SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation,\u201d the agency said in response to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nA push to label Ethereum a security\n\nThe news of the subpoenas comes as the SEC and the Biden administration pursue an aggressive campaign to cut down the crypto industry, which they characterize as lawless. This campaign, however, has been frustrated at times by the vague legal status of cryptocurrencies, which has led to a series of court battles over whether the SEC even has jurisdiction over the industry.\n\nThis critical question of jurisdiction turns on whether a given cryptocurrency is a security, an issue that has not definitively been addressed by courts. While there is a consensus Bitcoin is instead a commodity, under the supervision of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, Gensler has signaled his agency regards the vast majority of other cryptocurrencies as securities that must be registered with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC has made this case in recent court cases, except when it comes to Ethereum, whose legal status is even murkier. The security status of Ether has long been a point of contention for the agency. Speaking at a conference in 2018, then-Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman said that Ether did not resemble a security. Emails published as part of the Ripple trial revealed that SEC staff deliberated on how clear to make the assertion and that one official wanted to say that the agency did \u201cnot\u2026see a need to regulate Ether.\u201d\n\nThat changed under Gensler, who took over the agency in 2021, and following Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake the following year.\n\nAt that time, Gensler said that any crypto assets produced by blockchains that use a proof-of-stake model could resemble investment contracts and therefore be classified as securities, although he was not speaking about any specific coin. In March 2023, he once again suggested that proof-of-stake tokens could be regulated as securities, although he\u2019s since declined to comment specifically on Ethereum, including at SEC oversight hearings at the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe issue grew more complicated in October after the SEC approved nine ETFs that tracked the Ether futures market, which is overseen by the CFTC, suggesting the view Ether is a commodity. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has said on several occasions that his agency views Ether as a commodity.\n\nBut last month, the controversial crypto firm Prometheum, which has the approval to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer, announced its intention to offer custody services for Ethereum as a security under SEC oversight, once again adding uncertainty to Ether\u2019s regulatory status. One of the recipients of the recent subpoena speculated that Gensler has sought to use Prometheum as a Trojan Horse to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe recent race by major financial firms including Fidelity and BlackRock to gain approval for a spot Ether ETF has brought the issue into the spotlight, with all signs pointing to the SEC rejecting the applications by their May deadline. Bloomberg analysts have pointed out that agency staff have not gone back and forth with issuers on details about the potential, as they did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved in January.\n\nA potential declaration that Ether is a security could throw the process into further doubt, especially as it would raise questions over the CFTC\u2019s supervision of Ether futures markets."

        "title": "SEC Investigating Ethereum Foundation Regarding Proof-of-Stake Transition: Report - Unchained",
        "content": "Fortune reported on Wednesday that the SEC may have had its sights on the Ethereum Foundation since as early as 2022, while CoinDesk wrote that the Foundation faces an inquiry from an unnamed government agency.\n\nThe SEC may be looking into whether Ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake model makes it more of a security, according to Fortune.\n\nTwo reports on Wednesday have ignited conversations about the potential investigation of the Ethereum Foundation by regulatory authorities, notably the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe first report, published by Coindesk, highlighted the removal of certain confidentiality language from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website in February 2024. The language, which is usually included to subtly indicate that a project had not received requests for information from any authorities, read:\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed. Stiftung Ethereum will publicly disclose any sort of inquiry from government agencies that falls outside the scope of regular business operations.\u201d\n\nThis language was removed in February, though news of its removal only began to circulate on Wednesday.\n\nSoon after, a second, more explosive report published by Fortune suggested the SEC had begun investigating the Ethereum Foundation shortly after Ethereum migrated to its current proof-of-stake model. This model, which rewards users for staking tokens and allows for participation in governance votes based on token holdings, may resemble traditional securities to the extent that the regulator may attempt to regulate it as such.\n\nFortune\u2019s report revealed that the SEC began probing the Ethereum Foundation shortly after its blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake. This information, sourced from individuals at companies who received subpoenas, suggests a focused interest from the SEC on how Ethereum\u2019s new governance model could influence its classification, possibly as a security. These individuals, who requested anonymity due to concerns over retaliation, hinted at an energetic approach from the SEC to redefine Ethereum\u2019s legal status.\n\nThe price of ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, fell almost 6% following the publication of the two reports on Wednesday late morning ET, but it has since recovered, according to CoinGecko. Ether was recently trading at $3,387, up 1.5% over the last hour.\n\nCommunity Responses\n\nThe latest developments have sparked widespread speculation within the crypto community, although opinions vary on their significance. Some community members and observers have downplayed the potential impact of these investigations, suggesting that regulatory scrutiny of major cryptocurrency foundations is not uncommon.\n\nAmong those downplaying the seriousness of the news was Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director for cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center, who questioned on X the substance of Fortune\u2019s report and suggested that the crypto industry is overreacting. Meanwhile, others view the SEC\u2019s actions as a continuation of its aggressive posture towards the crypto industry, potentially impacting the approval odds for spot Ethereum ETF applications, which analysts have recently been reducing.\n\nRead More: Bloomberg ETF Analysts Now Predict SEC Will Reject Spot Ether ETFs in May\n\nIs Ethereum a Security?\n\nAt the heart of the apparent investigation lies the complex legal status of Ethereum as either a commodity or a security. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has remained ambiguous on Ethereum\u2019s status in spite of a willingness to declare other tokens securities in a variety of legal actions. Still others point to Gensler\u2019s own shifting position in this regard, frequently highlighting his apparently contradictory statements regarding ETH\u2019s status as a security during his time as a professor at MIT.\n\nToday\u2019s reporting suggests that may have changed in September 2022, when Ethereum successfully completed its transition to a proof-of-stake model. This move was part of Ethereum\u2019s broader strategy to enhance efficiency and reduce its environmental footprint. However, it also introduced new complications on the regulatory front. Gensler has argued since then that U.S. securities laws are much more applicable to proof-of-stake blockchains since they allow holders to participate in governance votes and earn yield from their staked tokens.\n\nThe apparent investigation also comes at a critical time when major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied to launch Ethereum ETFs. The SEC\u2019s actions have dampened hopes for the approval of these ETFs, with Bloomberg analysts predicting a rejection of spot Ether ETFs in May. This skepticism stems from the lack of engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers, a stark contrast to the flurry of dialogue observed prior to spot Bitcoin ETFs being approved.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the crypto community remains watchful of the SEC\u2019s actions and their potential impacts on Ethereum\u2019s future developments and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit at the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem, is reportedly under investigation by an undisclosed \u201cstate authority.\u201d\n\nThe investigation was disclosed Feb. 26 on the group\u2019s GitHub repository, CoinDesk reported Wednesday (March 20).\n\nA commit on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub repository, showing a change made to its website, said \u201cwe have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation did not immediately reply to PYMNTS\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe inquiry comes at a pivotal time for Ethereum and its native asset, ETH, as U.S. investment firms are looking to offer it as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to the CoinDesk report.\n\nSimultaneously, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly examining whether ETH should be classified as a security, a development that could have far-reaching implications for Ethereum and the wider crypto industry, the report said.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s website previously stated that it had never been contacted by any agency in a manner that required non-disclosure, a statement that was removed at the time of the Feb. 26 update to the website\u2019s GitHub repository, per the report. The specifics of the inquiry and the identity of the authority have not been disclosed.\n\nAn SEC investigation into ETH\u2019s classification leading to ETH being deemed a security could have consequences for Ethereum, ETH ETF applications, and the cryptocurrency market at large, according to the report.\n\nThe specific reasons for the inquiry remain unknown, but it is possible that a Swiss regulator may have issued a document request to the Ethereum Foundation, possibly in collaboration with the SEC, the report said, citing its interview with an unnamed attorney. The timing of the inquiry could be related to the SEC\u2019s upcoming deadline on May 23, indicating increased activity and investigations by regulatory authorities.\n\nThe SEC approved bitcoin as an ETF in January after years of opposition to the idea of an ETF that invests in bitcoin. While that approval was heralded by figures throughout the cryptocurrency industry, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stressed that the approval applies only to bitcoin and should not be seen as an indication that the regulator is ready to approve other listed securities.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

        "content": "Last night BlackRock elaborated on its plans for its first digital fund on the Ethereum blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), a money market fund that aims to offer a stable $1 value. It also confirmed it invested in tokenization partner Securitize, which is acting as transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize,\u201d said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s Head of Digital Assets.\n\nThe BlackRock statement added that \u201cTokenization remains a key focus of BlackRock\u2019s digital asset strategy.\u201d\n\nTokens are available to eligible accredited investors as this is a Rule 506(c) issuance. Transfers can only take place between pre-approved investors, although that can happen 24/7/365. Round-the-clock trading is a key advantage and opens up 24/7 indirect access to Treasury markets.\n\nBNY Mellon is the custodian of the underlying assets, fund administrator and provides interoperability between digital and traditional markets. That latter point reinforces that this fund may target not only the crypto crowd but also institutions looking for 24/7 access.\n\nBUIDL\u2019s assets will include cash, US Treasuries and repurchase agreements. In BlackRock\u2019s words, this allows \u201cinvestors to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain.\u201d That\u2019s something that most stablecoins don\u2019t provide, including USDC, where BlackRock manages the reserves. However, USDC can be used in any denomination, whereas initially the minimum BUIDL investment is $5 million, illustrating a different target audience. Per its recent SEC filing, that figure could come down to $100,000.\n\nTokenized securities and regulations\n\nWhile the role of Securitize as the transfer agent may seem like a throwback, it\u2019s a regulatory requirement. So far the SEC has required regulated issuers to keep traditional book entry records, which are the definitive record of ownership. That includes the likes of Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, which has more than $300 million in assets under management (AUM).\n\nGiven Securitize has experience and is both a regulated transfer agent, has tokenized feeder funds for KKR and Hamilton Lane, and operates an Alternative Trading System (ATS), it ticks all the boxes. One little piece of trivia \u2013 years ago, Securitize acquired a company called BUIDL, a Japanese blockchain development firm.\n\nFor the BUIDL token, several options are available regarding custody of the tokens. These include Anchorage Digital Bank, BitGo, Coinbase, Fireblocks, and others. All the firms are startups, highlighting the pressing need for incumbent custodians in the tokenized asset space. Their absence is due to the SEC accounting rule SAB 121, which makes it prohibitive for incumbent banks to provide crypto-asset custody at scale."

        "content": "While the campaign aims to reduce transaction fees, critics have noted that such a change may negatively affect network performance.\n\nShare this article\n\nA group of Ethereum core developers has launched a new initiative called \u201cpump the gas\u201d to increase the blockchain network\u2019s gas limit from 30 million to 40 million, with the goal of reducing transaction fees on layer 1 by 15% to 33%.\n\nCore Ethereum developer Eric Connor and former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO Mariano Conti unveiled the \u201cpump the gas\u201d website on March 20, calling on solo stakers, client teams, pools, and community members to support the initiative.\n\n\u201cRaising the gas block limit 33% gives Layer 1 Ethereum the ability to process 33% more transaction load in a day,\u201d the developer group claimed.\n\nThe Ethereum gas limit, which refers to the maximum amount of gas spent on executing transactions or smart contracts in each block, has remained at 30 million since August 2021. Gas is the technical term in Ethereum smart contracts which refers to the fee required (in gwei, a unit of Ether) to complete a transaction or execute a smart contract call.\n\nGas limits are standardized and set to ensure that block sizes are maintained at a level that will not overload or congest the Ethereum network, affecting its performance and synchronization. Based on specific parameters, validators can also dynamically adjust the gas limit as blocks are produced.\n\nThe direct effect of increasing gas limits is more space for transactions on each block. Theoretically, increasing the gas limit creates a correlational increase on a network\u2019s throughput and capacity. The downside, though, is that the load on hardware is also increased, opening the risk of network spam and external attacks.\n\nHistorically, the gas limit has steadily increased as the Ethereum network grew. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted earlier in January that the three-year period since August 2021 was the longest that the limit has not been raised. Buterin thus suggested a raise to 40 million back in January, dovetailing with similar calls that have been gaining momentum in recent months.\n\nThe Pump the Gas website also notes that data blobs, introduced in the Dencun upgrade with EIP-4844, significantly reduced L2 transaction fees, but this was not replicated in L1 transaction fees. Ethereum developers behind the campaign believe that a combination of blobs and a 33% increase in the gas limit to 40 million would help scale both L1 and L2 networks.\n\nVarious opposing figures have raised concerns about the potential impact of the proposed raise on the size of the blockchain state, such as Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden, who said that access to (and modification of) the blockchain state would gradually slow down over time. This argument over the concept of \u201cstate growth\u201d is also echoed by former Ethereum chief decentralization officer Evan Van Ness, who believes that raising the gas limit should be done carefully, citing the lateral effects of EIP-4844 on block size."

The high-stakes challenges just kept coming at the community from every angle.\n\nIt started off with Bitcoin hitting a fresh new all-time high of around $73,000 last Thursday. The community was euphoric, dreaming of life-changing riches as the OG coin blasted through resistance like it was nothing.\n\nSource: BTC price page\n\nBut then, brutal reality struck. BTC retraced all the way back down to $63,000 as an aggressive sell-off neutralized the epic rally in a heartbeat.\n\nAs the market was trying to process the price chaos, a major drama erupted on another front. Trezor - one of the most trusted names in the crypto security game - got its social media account compromised. Their X account was used to shill a fake \"TRZR\" token sale in what felt like a cruelly personalized variation of the Red Light/Green Light game.\n\nAnd just when we thought things couldn\u2019t get worse, the SEC made a move (well, not really!). Those awaiting rulings on the proposed ETH ETF applications got slammed as the SEC elected to kick those all-important decisions down the road yet again with delays.\n\nIn the midst of this password-pocalypse, the crypto news cycle kept on spinning with more major players making power moves. So let\u2019s round up the top crypto stories!\n\nHere's a TLDR of the top headlines:\n\nLet\u2019s get into the details of each of these stories!\n\nWe Hope You Didn\u2019t Fall for TRZR\u2026\n\nYesterday, things went south in the world of wallets - and it all started with one of the most trusted names in the hardware wallet game.\n\nOn March 19th, none other than Trezor, the cryptocurrency hardware wallet firm that's sold over 2 million devices worldwide, fell victim to a major security breach. And trust us, it wasn't pretty.\n\nAccording to reports, Trezor's official account on the bird app was hacked in what's suspected to be a SIM-swap attack. And once the attackers had control, they wasted no time in pushing an elaborate crypto scam.\n\nThe compromised account started promoting a fake token presale for \"TRZR\" token on the Solana blockchain.\n\nHow much money did its followers lose? Did Trezor make any official announcement following the incident? Read the full story!\n\nAnother Big Move by BlackRock\n\nThe world's largest asset manager has just filed with the SEC to launch a tokenized asset fund. And we're not talking about some small-time operation here \u2013 this is a big move from one of the most influential players in the finance game.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the filing, BlackRock's new fund will be called the \"BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund,\" and it'll be registered in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBut here is the problem - if you want to get in on the action, you better have some serious cash to throw around because the minimum investment is $100,000.\n\nOn the bright side, if approved, we will probably see trillions pouring into tokenization and RWAs soon! Read the full story!\n\n$100M Web3 Gaming Fund?\n\nAnother day, another blockchain gaming investment fund, right? \ud83e\udd71\n\nThis time it's Immutable, Polygon Labs, and VC firm King River Capital teaming up to launch a $100 million \"Inevitable Games Fund.\" Sounds impressive on paper, but what's in it for the average crypto degen?\n\nThey've already secured backing from big names like Abu Dhabi's Alpha Wave Ventures and Mike Arrington's family office. Moreover, the fund has its hands in a few buzzy gaming projects like Pixelmon and Guild of Guardians.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's just another VC money pit...unless there's something truly game-changing in store.\n\nMaybe this trio has cracked the code on delivering an actual fun and worthwhile Web3 gaming experience? One that doesn't feel like a cash grab or tech demo, but an innovative blend of gaming and crypto that hasn't been seen before? Read the full story!\n\nMatter Labs Makes Moves\n\nIt's time to talk about a power move in the world of layer-2 scaling solutions and institutional finance.\n\nMatter Labs has teamed up with the digital asset bigwigs over at Sygnum Bank to tokenize $50 million of their treasury reserves. That's right \u2013 Fifty. Million. Dollars.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This tokenization extravaganza isn't just some random crypto flexing. Nope, these funds are being tokenized onto the very blockchain that Matter Labs built \u2013 zkSync itself.\n\nNow, for those of you who aren't familiar with the world of traditional finance (or \"Trad-Fi,\" as we like to call it), these tokenized funds will represent Matter Labs' investment into the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund. And we're not just talking about some fly-by-night operation here \u2013 this Fidelity fund is an open-ended money market behemoth.\n\nFeels like RWA and tokenization are in line to be the next big trend to follow. Read the full story!\n\nSEC and ETH ETFs\n\nThe SEC has decided to keep us all in suspense a little while longer by delaying its ruling on the proposed spot ETH ETFs from Hashdex and ARK 21Shares.\n\nAccording to the SEC's announcement on March 19th, the final decision on these ETH ETF applications has been pushed back to late May, leaving the crypto community on the edge of their seats for at least another couple of months.\n\nIt seems that the market analysts over at Bloomberg are starting to lose faith in the prospect of these ETFs getting the green light. Yep, you read that right \u2013 even the seasoned experts are starting to doubt the SEC's willingness to play ball.\n\nWeren\u2019t Bloomberg analysts too optimistic about ETH ETF approval in May? What happened? What did they say? Read the full story!\n\nPopular Game Developer Goes Web3\n\nThe masterminds behind iconic franchises like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts are diving headfirst into blockchain gaming. And they're not just dipping their toes in the water \u2013 Square Enix has formed a partnership with HyperPlay, a Web3 games platform built on blockchain.\n\nThis collaboration isn't just a handshake deal \u2013 Square Enix made an undisclosed investment in HyperPlay, with the goal of expanding and scaling the platform's game store offerings.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, Square Enix is also set to launch \"SYMBIOGENESIS,\" an art experience based on the popular cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask, on the HyperPlay storefront.

One of the most exciting and perhaps underappreciated aspects of blockchain technology is that it has enabled a new business model \u2013 what we call the protocol economy. A blockchain, in its simplest form, is a secure digital ledger that, without the use or need of intermediaries, records new activity to its ledger in exchange for a fee while adhering to its protocol (rules for how the process works).

        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem's recent Dencun upgrade and the prospects of an Ether ETF coincide with the mysterious probe.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit organization working for central to the Ethereum ecosystem, is currently under investigation by an unnamed \u201cstate authority,\u201d according to a recent update on the group\u2019s GitHub repository. However, further details on the scope of the investigation and the reasons behind it remain undisclosed.\n\nA GitHub commit logged on February 26, 2024, on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s repository revealed that the organization received a voluntary enquiry \u201cfrom a state authority\u201d that included a confidentiality requirement. The issue was first raised by an investigative report conducted by the crypto media platform CoinDesk.\n\nThe report from CoinDesk refers to a lawyer familiar with the situation, whose statements speculate that a Swiss regulator may have served a document request to the Ethereum Foundation. The same lawyer also extended the speculation by saying that the request in question may also point to a collaboration between the named entity (ostensibly, the Swiss government, in this case) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s fair to say the Ethereum Foundation is not the only entity that they are seeking information from,\u201d the lawyer said, implying that other overseas entities might have received a similar method of scrutiny based on documentary requests.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time of significant technological changes for Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. Following its initial coin offering in 2015, Ethereum recently implemented the Dencun upgrade, designed to reduce transaction costs for users of Ethereum-based layer-2 platforms.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the SEC is also currently evaluating multiple applications for an Ether ETF, with a final deadline for some applications approaching on May 23. However, analysts following the process have expressed skepticism about the likelihood of approval, citing a lack of engagement between applicants and SEC officials.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed. Stiftung Ethereum will publicly disclose any sort of inquiry from government agencies that falls outside the scope of regular business operations,\u201d says a disclosure on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nThis statement is a warrant canary, and it has since been removed from the website, coinciding with the aforementioned GitHub commit.\n\nBy definition, a warrant canary is a form of text or visual warning that companies include on their websites to indicate they have never been served with a secret government subpoena or document request. The removal of the canary suggests that the Ethereum Foundation may have received such a request without explicitly stating so.\n\nThe SEC recently requested for public comment on proof of stake, the consensus algorithm employed by Ethereum and other blockchains.\n\nUPDATE: According to a report from Fortune, the SEC is pursuing an \u201cenergetic legal campaign\u201d to classify Ethereum as a security, confirming the investigation\u2019s links to the US government."

The number of daily active addresses on Solana has more than doubled from around 600,000 on Jan. 1, 2024 to more than 1.4 million on March 18.\n\nSome Solana-based memecoin projects that have already conducted presales, including SMOLE and MOONKE, have delayed their token roll outs as a result of Solana\u2019s congestion. \u201cTo keep everything fully transparent, with the current congestion of the Solana network we are going to bullishly delay our launch,\u201d the MOONKE team wrote on X Tuesday.\n\nTesting Performance\n\n\u201cThe Solana network has been experiencing extremely high usage which has tested components of the network \u2014 specifically the implementation of priority fees and the transaction scheduler, both of which play important roles in block optimization,\u201d the Solana Foundation wrote in a blog post on March 15.\n\nTom Wan, who works in strategy and business development at the parent company of crypto asset manager 21Shares, noted on X that the percentage of failed transactions on Solana has recently increased to 72%, although a large majority of these appear to be related to bots that are spamming the network because of the new token opportunities.\n\nRead More: Solana at 4, Memecoins Help Drive Network to All-Time High in Market Cap Post FTX Collapse\n\nMert Mumtaz, the CEO of the Solana-based developer firm, Helius, also indicated that Solana is facing challenges in performance from all this memecoin activity. In a private message to Unchained on X, he acknowledged the presence of bugs and said that improvements are \u201ccoming soon\u201d to address Solana\u2019s challenges. Despite this, Mumtaz highlighted Solana\u2019s performance compared to Ethereum\u2019s rollups, noting that \u201cWe\u2019re able to do about 20x more TPS [transactions per second] than all [Ethereum] rollups combined currently (so roughly 2,000 tps).\u201d\n\nQiao Wang, founding partner of crypto accelerator AllianceDAO, wrote on X this week that \u201cSolana right at this moment is similar to the Ethereum 2017 ICO era.\u201d He cited the demand among Solana users to trade memecoins and \u201can increasing demand for SOL to participate in those imos (initial meme offerings).\u201d\n\nAngel investor Eberle noted that one similarity is how businesses aiding the launch of memecoins are mirroring firms that facilitated ICOs back in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a bunch of people excited to speculate to try to get rich quick, again. We\u2019re seeing businesses pop up in support of the memecoin ecosystem just like we saw the \u2018ICO experts\u2019 pop up back then,\u201d Eberle wrote in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nRead More: Crypto Enthusiasts Raise Nearly $690,000 to Put Dogwifhat Meme on Las Vegas Sphere\n\nOne such ICO business in 2017 was Ambisafe, a company that was founded in 2015 to help people and institutions with fundraising and capital management. In the same vein, Blockchain App Factory is now providing services to support people and entities rolling out new memecoins on the Solana blockchain.\n\nSolving Problems Versus Producing Speculative Riches\n\nWhile both memecoins on Solana in 2024 and ICOs on Ethereum in 2017 have attracted lots of attention and massive amounts of liquidity, crypto users have criticized both for their emphasis on get-rich-quick schemes. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see billion-dollar-cap memecoins overshadow hardworking teams building legit products to advance this industry,\u201d wrote Ki Young Ju, founder of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, on X this week.\n\nEven though memecoins can show flashes of creativity and humor, Eberle noted that \u201cwe have to find more ways to lead with the power of blockchains to solve problems in new ways vs. speculative get rich opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs Ju noted, \u201ceasy money can\u2019t drive industry-wide progress, as shown by the 2018 ICO burst.\u201d"

And Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer said that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201dWall Street, traditional finance just started ingesting this giant thing called Bitcoin,\u201d Matt Hougan, CIO at the asset manager, said on a panel Tuesday at the Digital Asset Summit in London. \u201cWe need another eight or nine months of digesting Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHougan said on X after the event that his comments are controversial as hype for an Ethereum ETF lingers.\n\nVanEck is the first Ethereum ETF application on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s pile. The regulator is due to decide the outcome of the application on May 23.\n\nHougan\u2019s surprising take comes as market participants look to Ethereum after Bitcoin became the fastest-growing ETF sector since the SEC approved them in January.\n\nWith $65 billion in trading volumes this month, Bitcoin\u2019s inflows have shattered expectations, bringing in $12 billion.\n\nBut hopes for its Ethereum counterpart are dwindling: Bloomberg Intelligence analysts this month lowered their odds of a May approval to just 35%.\n\n\u2018Good for the industry\u2019\n\nIf the SEC does push back that deadline to December \u201cthat will be a net good for the crypto industry and ultimately, for ETH ETF flows,\u201d Hougan said at the event.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December vs. if they launch in May,\u201d he added on X.\n\n\u201cI tend to agree,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart wrote in an X repost of Hougan.\n\nSeyffart reiterated his bearishness for a May 23 nod: \u201cThe SEC hasn\u2019t engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics,\u201d unlike its approach to its Bitcoin ETF counterparts.\n\nBitwise doesn\u2019t have an active spot Ethereum ETF filing before the SEC.\n\nDifferent this time\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, said on X that one key difference between the Ethereum and Bitcoin applications is that the SEC doesn\u2019t face the legal pressure it did with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn August, a court victory by Grayscale against the agency \u201cbasically forced it\u201d to approve the ETFs, Chervinsky wrote.\n\nAdding to the pressure: A letter drafted last week by two US senators urged the SEC not to approve any other crypto-based exchange-traded products.\n\nThe letter shows \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said.\n\nHe added that that pressure is now part of why he and his colleagues are pessimistic that Ether ETFs will be approved.\n\nPossible BlackRock withdrawal\n\nChervinsky earlier this month cited \u201cpolitical blowback\u201d suffered by the SEC surrounding spot Bitcoin ETF approvals as a sign the agency may ask BlackRock and other Ether ETF applicants to withdraw their applications.\n\nBlackRock and the SEC have a \u201ccollaborative relationship,\u201d so BlackRock may withdraw its Ethereum application, Chervinsky said.\n\n\u201cI bet they will,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an email to DL News, BlackRock declined to comment on its active filings with the SEC.\n\nTyler Pearson is a markets correspondent at DL News based out of Alberta, Canada.

        "content": "The US SEC has delayed the approval process for several highly anticipated Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), recent regulatory filings show.\n\nThe delays affect proposals from investment firms, including VanEck, Ark Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale \u2014 which has added a staking component to its ETH ETF application along with Fidelity \u2014 sparking discussions about the future of crypto ETFs in the US.\n\nLower odds of approval\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who has been closely monitoring the developments, expressed a shift from his previously cautiously optimistic outlook regarding the approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHe noted that the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement on Ethereum-specific issues contrasts sharply with their approach to Bitcoin ETFs in the previous fall, dampening hopes for a positive outcome by the crucial May 23 deadline.\n\nSimilarly, Eric Balchunas recently pointed out that the absence of bullish signs and sources that were present before the Bitcoin ETF approvals significantly reduces the chances of a favorable decision for Ethereum ETFs, estimating the odds at 35%.\n\nThe conversation extended beyond the ETF delays, touching upon the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Some suggested the SEC might insist on a court order before approving Ethereum ETFs, citing potential differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of their designation.\n\nHowever, Seyffart disagreed with the notion that Ethereum could be classified as a security, a designation that could fundamentally impact its regulatory treatment.\n\nThe discussion also ventured into the realm of potential outcomes and strategies. Seyffart speculated about the future of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum futures product and its implications for potential legal challenges against the SEC\u2019s decisions.\n\nStaking in ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, both Fidelity and Grayscale have added amendments to their Ethereum ETF applications to include a staking component.\n\nStaking, a fundamental aspect of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, involves the locking up of digital assets to support the network\u2019s security and functionality, offering participants rewards in the form of additional crypto.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s proposal, like Fidelity\u2019s, allows the ETF to allocate part of its holdings to staking through selected providers, potentially including affiliates. The move is designed to explore the income generation possibilities within a regulated financial framework, with the ETF expected to receive ether tokens as network rewards, which could be considered income for the fund.\n\nHowever, this addition arrives amid increased scrutiny from US lawmakers, who have recently urged the SEC to halt the approval of new crypto-related ETFs due to concerns over investor risks.\n\nAs the May 23 deadline approaches, the crypto community remains on edge, awaiting further developments.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 2:25 am UTC on Mar. 20, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is down 6.6% over the past 24 hours.

However, the SEC\u2019s stance on the status of ether as an asset is markedly different from its view on bitcoin.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has stated on a number of occasions that bitcoin is the only digital asset that can be considered a commodity, and \u201ceverything other than bitcoin\u201d could be classified as a security.\n\nIn April, Gensler avoided giving a direct response to a question from House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry on whether Ethereum was a security or a commodity."

However, the Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC) battle to classify Ethereum as a security may spoil the fun.\n\nBUIDL to debut on Ethereum\n\nEthereum has been rising in the past 24 hours after BlackRock announced its decision to launch its first blockchain-based tokenized fund, BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), on the Layer One chain.\n\n\"BUIDL will offer investors important benefits by enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on blockchain,\" as stated on Business Wire. The announcement said this would \u201cexpand investors' on-chain offerings, provide instantaneous and transparent settlement, and allow for transfers across platforms.\u201d\n\nBUIDL aims to maintain a $1 peg per token as the fund would invest 100% of its underlying assets in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchasable agreements. Investors who subscribe to the fund will earn yields paid as new tokens to their wallets at the end of every month.\n\nBank of New York Mellon will serve as custodian and administrator for BUDL's underlying assets, while Securitize will serve as the tokenization platform and transfer agent. BlackRock's partnership with Securitize also includes an investment into the latter to solidify bonds. Other key infrastructure providers for the fund include Coinbase, Fireblocks, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, and BitGo.\n\nThis comes a few months after the SEC's Bitcoin spot ETF approval saw BlackRock debuting their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Additionally, BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, said in a recent interview, \"I believe the next step will be tokenization of financial assets...tokenization of securities.\"\n\nRead more: Ethereum faces steep correction as whales opt for profit-taking\n\nETH price growth faces fierce battle from the SEC\n\nAfter the announcement, some analysts in the crypto community speculated that this was a potential igniter to spark real-world assets (RWA) narrative growth. The real world assets category has recorded huge gains in the last 24 hours according to data from Coingecko.\n\nTop real world assets\n\nBut more importantly, Ethereum reaped gains of about 11% in the last 24 hours following BlackRock's update and currently trades at $3,566.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis follows the latest update on the spot ETH ETF, which saw the SEC issue subpoenas to three US companies dealing with ETH transactions, according to Fortune. Speculations are that the subpoenas are related to an investigation aimed at classifying Ethereum as a security. The investigation is said to be based on the 2022 timeline when Ethereum transitioned to proof of stake.\n\nThis would hurt any chances of the commission approving a spot Ether ETF, potentially causing a drop in Ethereum's price. Furthermore, the Ethereum Foundation acknowledged it has been receiving inquiries from \"state authority,\" which many believe to be the SEC.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation subpoenae threatens ETH ETF approval odds\n\nHowever, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, has defended Ethereum in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that \"ETH is a commodity, not a security,\" as confirmed by several federal courts and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He cited instances where senior SEC officials, including Gary Gensler, had said ETH isn't a security before he became SEC Chair.\n\n\"The SEC has no good reason to deny the ETH ETP applications. And we hope they won't try to invent one by questioning the long established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed\", he further expressed."

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > SEC investigating Ethereum Foundation in bid to declare ETH a security\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nCracks are appearing in the Ethereum Foundation following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing the group ahead of plans to label the ETH token an unregistered security.\n\nOn March 20, sharp-eyed observers noticed a small but significant change in the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub repository that was made on February 26. Gone from the site was a block of text declaring that the Foundation \u201chas never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not be disclosed.\u201d\n\nThe change was made by developer Pablo Pettinari, whose description of the revision stated that the change was necessary due to the Foundation having \u201creceived a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.\u201d A \u2018warrant canary\u2019 was also quietly removed from the Foundation site, indicating that it had been served with a subpoena or other secret government request.\n\nFortune subsequently reported that the SEC had served subpoenas on multiple companies seeking financial records and other documentation regarding their dealings with the Foundation. One of these companies told Fortune that the SEC had launched a probe into the Foundation following the Ethereum network\u2019s September 2022 transition\n\nfrom a consensus mechanism based on proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nPoS requires Ethereum transaction validators to post a \u2018stake\u2019 of 32 ETH tokens, a sum worth around US$51,000 at the time (currently worth over US$100,000), making it a prohibitive barrier for most ETH holders to clear. The net result of this shift was that a handful of ETH whales\u2014including many Foundation insiders who claimed large portions of the ETH distributed via the network\u2019s controversial pre-mine\u2014are now reaping most of the rewards for keeping the network humming.\n\nFortune claimed that individuals at three companies that received SEC subpoenas said that the shift to PoS had offered the agency \u2018a new pretext\u2019 to define ETH as a security. This isn\u2019t much of a revelation: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler commented at the time that entities offering PoS-based \u2018staking services\u2019 represented \u201canother indicia that under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nGensler wasn\u2019t alone in making this observation. In March 2023, the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office filed charges against the KuCoin exchange for failing to register as a securities broker-dealer. The NYAG called the complaint \u201cone of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security.\u201d\n\nThe NYAG explained that \u201cETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH \u2026 [Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin] and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the functionality and price of ETH.\u201d\n\nPrior to the network\u2019s launch, Buterin himself stated publicly that \u201cif you\u2019re investing in Ethereum, I would say you\u2019re investing in the team and community.\u201d More recently, former Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff offered evidence showing that Ethereum Foundation members understood from the start that ETH was a security.\n\nNerayoff released emails showing Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin asking lawyers for a legal opinion that would leave insiders \u201cwell insulated from criminal liability regarding securities laws.\u201d This acknowledgment of ETH\u2019s security status helps explain why Lubin and other insiders did such a full-court press on Gensler\u2019s predecessor, William Hinman, who in June 2018 controversially declared that ETH was originally a security but then \u201cbecome something other than a security.\u201d\n\n(g)ETF(*cked)\n\nThe SEC has yet to comment publicly on the Fortune report other than to say it doesn\u2019t comment on possible investigations, whether they exist or not. The ETH token suffered a momentary plunge as the story broke, but has since recovered its losses and then some.\n\nRegardless, the Ethereum community is up in arms over the mounting suspicion that the SEC wants to label ETH a security in order to justify the SEC\u2019s refusal to authorize new ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Rightly or wrongly, the launch of multiple BTC-based ETFs in January has been credited with that token\u2019s otherwise unwarranted spike in fiat value, and ETH holders want to artificially pump their own bags in the same fashion.\n\nFoundation members decided they wanted in on the ETF spoils once they learned that their developer counterparts at BTC Core had been promised a share of the profits\u2014anywhere from 5-10% for a decade\u2014by at least two of the BTC ETF issuers.\n\nSo far, the SEC has refused to play ball, using all the procedural options at their disposal to avoid having to issue a formal decision on any of the multiple ETH ETF applications. Just this week, the SEC told an ETF applicant to cool their heels while asking the public to submit further comments.\n\nThe SEC has until May 23 to issue a decision one way or the other, but the reported lack of communication between the SEC and applicants regarding the finer points of their paperwork has been taken as a sign that ETH won\u2019t be getting the BTC treatment.\n\nLabeling ETH a security could set up a regulatory turf war between the SEC and the\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which currently regulates ETH-based futures contracts. One year ago, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam told Congress that \u201cwe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d\n\nThis interagency slap-fight could provoke Congress to finally set some firm boundaries between the two regulators when it comes to digital assets. But given the current Congress appears infinitely more interested in performative stunts than actually legislating, don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone focuses on the ETF question, there is also the possibility that Gensler will use whatever information he may have gleaned via the SEC\u2019s subpoenas to file a complaint against the Ethereum Foundation, Buterin, Lubin and countless others connected with that centralized mothership.\n\nIt\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t plenty of options\u2014in terms of both the number of targets and the type of charges\u2014to choose from.\n\nWatch: Digital currency regulation and the role of BSV blockchain"

        "content": "Ethereum faces a perfect storm of uncertainty as a confidential investigation by an unknown state authority coincides with the SEC's ongoing efforts to classify Ether (ETH) as a security.\n\nAccording to a Coindesk report on Wednesday, the Zug, Switzerland based Ethereum Foundation recently confirmed they received a confidential inquiry from a yet-to-be-identified \"state authority.\" This information came to light in late February 2024 through a commit on the Ethereum Foundation's GitHub repository.\n\nWhile the foundation hasn't disclosed the source, speculation swirls around a potential probe by a Swiss regulator or, more pointedly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exact nature and focus of the investigation also remain shrouded in mystery, though the timing coincides with an upcoming deadline for the SEC on deciding about ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's website previously stated they had never been contacted by any agency requiring confidentiality. This statement has since been removed.\n\nPending ETF approvals\n\nAccording to a Fortune report, released after the Coindesk article, the SEC is particularly interested in Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model in September 2022. This shift could be a key factor in their attempt to classify ETH as a security.\n\nSuch a classification would have far-reaching consequences for Ethereum's regulatory landscape, as stricter regulations could be imposed, impacting the entire Ethereum ecosystem. It could also impact the fate of ETH ETFs, as the SEC's stance on ETH as a security throws a major hurdle in the approval process for pending Ethereum ETF applications. Delays or even rejections are now a distinct possibility.\n\nA cloud of uncertainly now hangs over Ethererum. An ETH security classification could lead to tighter regulations, potentially impacting the price and overall market performance of the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the status of pending ETH ETF applications is likely to remain on hold or face outright rejection until the investigation concludes.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Using the Ethereum blockchain has become really expensive recently, with fees for sending Ethereum from one wallet to another reaching up to $2 and fees for swapping tokens within the network surging to over $50 when the network is congested. The problems of surging gas fees and scalability were solved in two ways:\n\n\n\n\n\nBy developing Layer-2 solutions for the Ethereum network\n\nBy launching projects that would offer the same functionality but without the most hurting problems.\n\n\n\nNow, there are over 45 L solutions for the Ethereum blockchain , and over 35 such solutions are in development. The Dencun upgrade allowed for a reduction in the Ethereum fees and resolved the issue of network congestion by allowing L2 solutions to keep some transactions off-chain and bundle transactions before sending them to the Ethereum mainnet. And only the most important transactions would be processed on the Ethereum blockchain. Ephemeral data blobs are also introduced, which are the storage units where intermediate results during transaction processing are stored.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these solutions, the problems of scalability and high fees will be resolved.\n\nLet\u2019s see whether it really worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after the upgrade, the fees on the layer-2 solutions dropped drastically. Here, you can have a look at the changes in fees for the main L2 networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first part, the one with fees, has worked out. It is still not completely clear whether the second part has developed as expected, but we will learn about it soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, with it, it is expected that these developments will allow Layer2 solutions and the main network to benefit in the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some experts warn that the introduction of blobs may have impacted the fees positively for a short time. In the long term, when Layer2 networks start competing for blobs, fees may rise again. Only the time will show how correct these forecasts are.\n\nBut what about the so-called Ethereum killers? How will this upgrade impact them?\n\nEthereum Killers: How Do They Work and How the Dencun Upgrade Will Impact Them\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum killers - this is the name for projects that compete with Ethereum. While offering the same or similar functionality as Ethereum, all those projects use different technologies that allow them to overcome Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with some history.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Ethereum killers bragged about using a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and its variations. But after the Merge upgrade on September 15, 2022, the Ethereum network moved to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which reduced energy consumption by more than 99%.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people expected that this would end with at least some of the \u201cEthereum killers\u201d - at least with those who couldn\u2019t offer anything but their environmentally-friendly approach. However, reducing energy consumption didn\u2019t solve the issues of scalability and high gas fees. On the contrary, gas fees surged. Thus, eventually, none of the so-called Ethereum killers was impacted seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to the recent upgrade.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade solved two main problems that the Ethereum network used to face: high gas fees and scalability issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that those Ethereum killers who relied only on faster transaction processing speed and low gas fees could indeed be impacted heavily. I doubt that projects running on such Ethereum killer blockchains will switch to the Ethereum network, but in the future, developers will prefer an established network, which Ethereum is, rather than networks that used to be competitors but lost their competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some networks offer something completely different along with Ethereum\u2019s set. Here they are, and this is why they will survive.\n\nPolkadot\n\nPolkadot is focused on something that is very important for Web3 - interoperability. It allows for the connecting of several blockchains and interchanging data between them without compromising security. Interoperability is essential for the future of Web3, and thus, the demand for Polkadot will be growing.\n\nSolana\n\nIt is cheap, fast, and backed by some major financial players such as JPMorgan and a venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz. The first two benefits of the Dencun upgrade have been added, and the last ones are raising concerns about the network\u2019s centralization. Even though thanks to the financial support and already high adoption level, Solana may stay around for a while, I believe its importance will decline over time.\n\nCardano\n\nIt is a nice project with a lot of developer activity. However, its competitive benefits, such as eco-friendliness, low fees, and fast transactions, are not there anymore. Although many people love it, and thus it may survive just because many developers pick it based on personal preferences.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is an important milestone not only for the Ethereum network but also for the entire world of crypto and blockchain. Its impact is still to be assessed, but for sure, many changes are coming.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Why the SEC Shouldn\u2019t Classify ETH as a Security - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Recent reporting from CoinDesk and Fortune suggests the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to classify ether {{ETH}}, the native token of the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, as a security. The move would undoubtedly have severe repercussions for the entire crypto industry, including derailing plans for an spot ETH exchange-traded fund.\n\nThis is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nCiting several unnamed sources, Fortune reported that the SEC has subpoenaed several U.S. companies for documents related to their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that organized the launch of the eponymous blockchain and is based in Switzerland. Apparently, the probe began shortly after the Merge event that introduced ether staking in 2022.\n\nSee also: What Happens if Ether Is a Security?\n\nShortly after Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake upgrade, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that proof-of-stake chains, which pay users token rewards for locking up their coins as a security model, resemble investment contracts and could be classified as securities \u2014 though he did not mention ETH by name.\n\nHe has, however, launched lawsuits against a number of U.S.-based and international crypto exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken and Binance on the grounds that they were selling securities to U.S. investors without the appropriate registrations. These include assets like Cardano\u2019s {{ADA}} and Solana\u2019s {{SOL}}.\n\nETH has never been named outright as a security in an SEC enforcement action, a point that strikes crypto attorney Ignacio Ferrer-Bonsoms as contradictory. In a recent blog, Ferrer-Bonsoms compared Ethereum to Cardano to argue that if the SEC considers one to fall afoul of securities laws then it must consider the other the same way.\n\nBoth the Ethereum Foundation and Cardano Foundation raised millions via token sales to fund network development ($18.3 million in bitcoin versus $62 million, respectively); both govern their respective networks through foundations based in Zug, Switzerland; and both allocated tokens to their founders and foundations.\n\nMoreover, both foundations contribute work specifically to increase the value of their tokens. Ferrer-Bonsoms noted Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, introduced in the EIP-1559 upgrade in August 2021, that made the network (sometimes) deflationary. \u201cIn this way, investors may perceive the token as an investment with expectations of value appreciation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIndeed, unlike bitcoin {{BTC}}, the only cryptocurrency that is hands-down a commodity under U.S. law, members of Ethereum\u2019s founding team are still highly active in the industry. Vitalik Buterin, despite announcing a soft retirement on his 30th birthday, regularly introduces new ideas for Ethereum tools and influences the network\u2019s roadmap while Joseph Lubin oversees the influential Etheruem incubator ConsenSys.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: How Much ETH Does Joe Lubin Hold? | Opinion\n\nAnd while technically there is a Bitcoin Foundation, it has almost no influence and does not pay salaries for Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nThe case against classification\n\nThat said, not everyone agrees that Ethereum is a security. Most importantly, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC\u2019s smaller sister agency, has for years allowed ETH futures trading, implying that it is a commodity. And, in the CFTC\u2019s lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried, the agency outright said ETH is a commodity (alongside BTC and {{USDT}}.\n\nIndeed, the SEC\u2019s unilateral determination that ETH is a security would have severe repercussions for U.S. businesses and investors that already interact or rely on Ethereum, including major exchanges like CME Group and Cboe Global Exchange that trade millions of dollars of ETH futures per day.\n\nThe best argument that ETH isn\u2019t a security is that it hasn\u2019t been up to now and changing status would have harsh impacts. It\u2019s \u201cthe whole \u2018you can't just arbitrarily change your mind and damage people for hundreds of billions of dollars after a decade\u2019 and also by the way the CFTC will likely fight back\u201d argument, Austin Campbell, a Columbia Business School assistant professor, told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\nBrian Quintenz, a former CFTC commission and now head of policy at a16z Crypto, echoed this point on X, saying that when the SEC approved ETH futures ETFs to trade on its regulated security exchanges in October 2023 (months after the Merge), \"it explicitly acknowledged the status of the underlying, ETH, as being a non-security and outside of its jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"It will be interesting to watch what, if any, excuse the SEC uses if it were to delay or deny an ETH ETF given it has already informed the market on ETH being outside its jurisdiction,\" Quintenz added. It's worth noting that the news comes a day after the SEC was hit with unprecedented court sanctions for its \"gross abuse of power\" in a lawsuit it brought against the crypto company DEBT Box.\n\nBrian Frye, the Spears-Gilbert Professor of Law at the University of Kentucky, said the best reason against classifying ETH as a security \u201cis that ETH looks more like BTC than any other token.\u201d He added that \u201cthe SEC has repeatedly said it considers BTC a commodity, rather than a security ... primarily because of the lack of centralized control.\u201d\n\nSee also: Coinbase Tried to Rein in a Renegade SEC | Opinion\n\nThe existence of the Ethereum Foundation casts a shadow of a doubt on that argument, Frye admitted. However, it is undeniable there are thousands of stakeholders in Ethereum beyond the founding corporation. In some areas even, Ethereum could be considered more decentralized than Bitcoin \u2014 including the number of applications running on it and developer count.\n\nFurther, IntotheBlock found that, as of six months ago, there are more than double the number of long term ETH holders (73.5 million) than bitcoin (33.61 million). There are 5,370 addresses holding between 1,000-10,000 ETH but only 1,920 addresses with between 1,000-10,000 BTC.\n\nNone of this may matter considering Gensler\u2019s apparent warpath against crypto, an industry he sees as rife with fraud and financial abuses. The ironic thing is nearly everyone in crypto wishes Gensler would spend his time prosecuting actual crime, rather than harassing legitimate business or attacking decentralized protocols.\n\nFrye sees this apparent overreach as potentially Gensler\u2019s undoing. \u201cThe SEC is getting too far out over its skis and is liable to crash. It's relying on Howey, which provides an extremely broad definition of \u2018security\u2019 and consequently gives the SEC very broad regulatory authority,\u201d he said, referring to one of the tests the agency uses to define \u201cinvestment contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Supreme Court can change Howey. And, the more aggressively the SEC regulates, the more likely a case will go to SCOTUS. As soon as one gets there, the Supreme Court is likely to \u2018clarify\u2019 Howey by narrowing it.\u201d"

Notably, the wallet also received 500,000 unshETHing_Token (USH) and 10,000 Realio Network (RIO) tokens, which hold respective values of $13,400 and $12,300. The asset manager's wallet also received significant amounts of Mog Coin (Mog) and notable NFTs like Chungos and KaijuKingz. The wallet now holds at least $40,000 worth of memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe BlackRock wallet initially made a $200 USDC deposit on March 5, followed by a $10 test deposit on March 15. Shortly after, a deposit of $99,999,960 was recorded. BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, has undergone a notable shift in his stance on Bitcoin and the blockchain industry. Previously, he referred to Bitcoin as an \"index of money laundering\" in 2017. However, Fink recently expressed his belief that the future involves the tokenization of all financial assets on a single general ledger.\n\nThe BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, tickered as \"BUIDL,\" will enable eligible investors to earn U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the fund through Securitize Markets, LLC."

The technology is built within three key pillars: decentralized rollup technology, optimistic zkEVM integration, and modular design. Developers building on Morph have access to tools to help transition from the earliest stages of building up through a potential token listing.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first layer-2 on Ethereum to launch with a decentralized sequencer, meaning multiple entities or nodes can participate in the sequencing process, meaning the opportunity for any single node to manipulate transaction order is significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cThe existing L2 market is focused solely on short-term gains to be able to win the next casino round, rather than building for sustainable success. At Morph, we proudly help developers to create dApps that can truly make a long-term difference and win over a mainstream user base,\u201d cofounder and COO Azeem Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe company plans to use the fresh capital on hiring, marketing to bolster its visibility within the L2 ecosystem, and refining its technical infrastructure. Additional investors include Pantera, The Spartan Group, and MEXC, with a further $1 million raised in an angel round. Bitget, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, is an original investor in Morph and plans to continue playing a role in the Morph ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe believe Morph\u2019s technology can be exactly what developers in the consumer vertical need to pave the way for wider mainstream adoption,\u201d Paul Veradittakit, a managing partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHeralded by Ethereum developers as the technical milestone they\u2019d been \u201cdreaming of,\u201d last week\u2019s Dencun upgrade was supposed to forever alter the Ethereum ecosystem\u2014by making transactions on its layer-2 networks exponentially cheaper and thus more accessible.\n\nOne week later, how do things stand?\n\nOn the whole, Dencun has delivered exactly as promised. Across layer-2 networks that have already integrated the software update, gas fees have plummeted to unprecedented lows, in most cases by over 90%.\n\nAt writing, median transaction fees on layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Starknet, Optimism, and Optimism-based chains Base and Zora have all fallen to one cent or below, according to data from Dune and Ethereum analytics platform Grow The Pie. That\u2019s a 91% to 95% drop in cost for each of those networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2 hours ago, @arbitrum's gas fee dropped by another 80%. Now you only need 0.000004 ETH (about $0.01) to complete a transaction on this chain. This is fucking insane man! https://t.co/GgEv4AbGbz pic.twitter.com/2DNZlcLjmN \u2014 Larvandweb3.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Larvandweb3) March 19, 2024\n\nDay by day, those costs continue to fall\u2014from one cent down to mere fractions of a penny.\n\nEnabling Dencun\u2019s near-elimination of gas fees is a novel data storage solution called proto-danksharding, which is powered by blobs. Blobs allow layer-2 data to be stored on-chain for a temporary period of about a month, as opposed to forever\u2014the only previously available option.\n\nGm to 4844, welcome to @Optimism & @base Swaps now costing 1/10 of a cent Modularity scales. pic.twitter.com/CcZPshm836 \u2014 AureliusBTC (@AureliusBTC) March 14, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDencun\u2019s drastic reduction of on-chain fees has impacted not just ETH transfers and token swaps, but also heftier NFT-related transactions.\n\nOn Zora\u2014a layer 2 network built by the homonymous NFT minting platform\u2014the most common transactions are (expectedly) NFT transfers. Nonetheless, the median transaction cost on the network is currently 9/10ths of a penny.\n\nCompare those minuscule figures with the Ethereum mainnet, where an NFT sale currently costs $72 on average, per Etherscan. Just weeks ago, due to network clogs, that cost neared $400 per NFT transfer.\n\nThis is huge Reducing transaction fees and confirmation times on Layer 2 will open up so many more use cases for crypto. We're finally getting scalability. https://t.co/X7K3TzkMno \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) March 14, 2024\n\nNot all layer-2 networks are quite there yet, however. Some are taking a bit longer to integrate Dencun-related updates across their settlement contracts. Polygon, for instance, has yet to see its gas fees fully drop off; mean transaction costs on the network are currently hovering around $0.72. Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman previously told Decrypt that he expects all layer-2s, including Polygon, will be fully integrated with Dencun within a month or two.\n\nWhile the impact of Dencun is clearly already substantial, some critics outside the Ethereum ecosystem\u2014and even developers within it\u2014have noted that transaction costs are likely to rise with increasing network traffic.\n\nWhile blob-enabled L2 gas prices are very cheap right now, we can expect them to increase a bit over time as demand for blobs increases. This is expected behavior & is why 4844 is only the beginning - blobs are an evolving primitive & are part of the wider danksharding roadmap. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) March 14, 2024\n\nAnd yet, most layer-2s with slashed gas fees have already seen dramatic increases in network activity. Daily transaction volume has more than doubled on Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and Zora in the week since the upgrade; on Starknet, it has almost tripled. Gas fees on all those networks are still currently one cent or less on average.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany L2 developers hope that such sustained drops will prompt a fundamental shift in how users engage with Ethereum\u2014moving the bulk of routine transactions onto L2s, and away from the costly mainnet.\n\nBut recent gains of layer 2s don\u2019t appear to be at L1\u2019s detriment\u2014at least not yet. Traffic on the Ethereum mainnet remains consistent with figures from the past year, according to Etherscan; in fact, it\u2019s slightly up since last week.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Solana is now the top smart-contract blockchain by trading volume, surpassing Ethereum, according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nThe volume of tokens trading on Solana-based decentralized exchanges, aka DEXs, climbed by 67% to $21.3 billion over seven days, whereas volume on Ethereum-based equivalent exchanges rose by just 3% to $19.4 billion. Likewise, the number of daily active addresses on Solana has also spiked, rising from 400,000 to 600,000 in January to February to roughly 1.25 million on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA lot of the surge we\u2019ve seen in Solana DEX trading volumes will likely come from the memecoin wave that we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks,\u201d Martin Lee, a data analyst at Nansen, told Fortune.\n\nSpeculative buzz around Solana-based memecoins dogwifwhat (WIF), bonk (BONK), book of meme (BOME), MAGA (TRUMP), and slerf (SLERF) is partially behind Solana\u2019s recent successes. On March 13, 2,300 Solana memecoins were minted in one hour, meanwhile stablecoins on Solana reached a multiyear high of $2.80 billion.\n\nIn the last 1 hour, 2,500 Solana memecoins were created. \u2014 Ram Ahluwalia CFA, Lumida (@ramahluwalia) March 13, 2024\n\nThe speculative frenzy behind Solana\u2019s memecoins has been catalyzed by a trend called \u201cpresales\u201d whereby tokens are sold before officially launching. A buyer sends funds to a crypto address and receives the set number of tokens at a later date. Some estimate that over $100 million worth of tokens were sent to various memecoin presales over the weekend, mainly on the Solana blockchain, CoinDesk reported.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bastion of memecoins attracting users with the lure of outsized returns: Speculation on these are likely currently driving an influx of users, but I\u2019m hopeful that new entrants will stick around,\u201d Philip Forte, founder and CEO of Elixir, told Fortune.\n\nThe hype of presales has grown with the success of BOME. Last week, its creator took to X to offer a presale, and the result was that early investors turned a few hundred dollars into hundreds of thousands over a few days. Meanwhile, BOME\u2019s market capitalization soared from zero to $1.6 billion in a few days, with over $100 million in daily trading volume, CoinDesk reported.\n\nThis BOME presale meta is the worst thing to happen in this space in a while https://t.co/06cOaB48W7 \u2014 Franz (@Franz_0x) March 17, 2024\n\nBut the presale frenzy has drawn criticism from some on-chain watchers, with one X user posting: \u201c2 years later and everyone is right back to bidding ponzis. People can do what they want with their money but sending money to a \u2018memecoin presale\u2019 that has a 99.9% chance of rugging is actually just dumb as hell.\u201d (BOME prices did drop after its launch, about 50% at the week\u2019s start\u2014steeper than a wider market correction.)\n\n\u201cThe reason Solana is able to capture all the memecoin volume as opposed to ETH L2s is because Solana\u2019s transactions fees have been historically much lower,\u201d Pat Doyle, Blockchain Researcher at Amberdata, told Fortune. \u201cThis makes investing in the speculative memecoins much more attractive as you don\u2019t have a larger percentage of your transfer consumed by fees.\u201d\n\nDoyle added: \u201cLooking at this from a broader view, the memecoin craze is showing the ability for Solana to handle high volume and throughput.\u201d\n\nAnd, to be fair, many investors had an eye on Solana before the latest memecoin boom: The blockchain\u2019s native token SOL\u2014though down about 8% today, to $168\u2014is up almost 70% in 2024.\n\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, told Fortune in a statement that although the company expects some of the new users associated with the memecoin blitz to exit, \"We see this as a catalyst for a wave of new users to discover the usability and power of the Solana network\u2014and stay for the long term.\""

The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL, is designed to offer qualified investors a new way to earn US dollar yields through subscriptions via Securitize Markets, LLC.\n\nAccording to on-chain data , BUIDL was initially seeded with $100 million USDC after BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch it on March 15.\n\nCommenting on the launch, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, said that it is a critical milestone in the company\u2019s digital assets strategy.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy,\u201d Mitchnick stated. \u201cWe are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.\u201d\n\nThe tokenization of BUIDL allows for the issuance and trading of fund shares on the blockchain, offering benefits such as immediate settlement and enhanced liquidity, thus broadening the appeal to a more global investor base, as noted in the press release. BNY Mellon will facilitate the fund\u2019s interoperability between digital and traditional financial markets.\n\nCarlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, lauded the initiative. He said:\n\n\u201cTokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today\u2019s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.\u201d\n\nThe fund targets a stable token value of $1, distributing dividends as new tokens monthly. Its assets are entirely allocated to cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. will manage the fund, with BNY Mellon acting as custodian and administrator. Securitize will oversee tokenization and act as the transfer agent. The fund\u2019s initial minimum investment is set at $5 million, and it will issue shares under specific SEC rules.\n\nThe fund\u2019s ecosystem includes key players, including Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, alongside BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. as the investment manager, and Bank of New York Mellon as custodian and administrator. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been appointed as auditor.\n\nFurthermore, BlackRock\u2019s strategic investment in Securitize signifies a deep commitment to exploring digital asset solutions, with Joseph Chalom, BlackRock\u2019s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, joining Securitize\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nFor years, financial institutions have been exploring ways to harness blockchain technology to achieve tokenization of real-world assets. BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, is not part of those skeptical; he has repeatedly expressed his bullish outlook on the future of tokenization.\n\nIn a January interview with CNBC, Fink outlined a two-step vision for the future of financial markets. The first step, he said, has been realized with the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The second step, according to Fink, is \u201cthe token digitalization of the assets.\u201d He said that ETFs are key steps toward tokenization .\n\nBlackRock is currently pursuing regulatory approval for its spot Ethereum ETF filing, alongside other asset management giants like ARK Invest and VanEck. The SEC has a deadline of May 23 to make a decision on these applications."

We advise that Coinbase Wallet customers wait for congestion to resolve before submitting transactions on the Base network.\"\n\nFollowing the initial publication of this story, Coinbase representatives sent the following statement to Decrypt:\n\n\"Due to high network traffic on the Base network, transaction fees increased over the last 24 hours. Some user transactions that were submitted with lower fees may be stuck in a 'pending' state. If possible, users with pending transactions should cancel their transaction and resubmit with the latest estimated gas fee. If you are unable to cancel your pending transaction, the transaction will complete once traffic subsides. Rest assured, your funds are safe. Pending transactions will process once fees reduce. The Coinbase Wallet team is working on implementing a transaction cancellation feature, and will provide an update once available.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBase transactions have spiked dramatically in recent days following last week's launch of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, which promised to cut transaction fees on layer-2 scaling networks. Indeed, Base\u2014which is based on Optimism's scaling tech\u2014has seen a dramatic decrease in fees, falling by 90% or more alongside some other networks.\n\nPublic blockchain data curated by Dune shows a sizable leap on transaction volume on Base, rising from a daily average of about 400,000 daily transactions before the Dencun upgrade to a million or more each of the last several days. Base hit a new daily transaction record of 2.12 million on Saturday.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details."

Image: Tradingview\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, has also experienced a significant surge, with a price increase of roughly 7% to its current price of just over $3,400.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMemecoins have also reacted positively to the overall rebound. Floki, the third best-performing token, has seen a growth of 26.92% to its current price of $0.000227. Bonk, while being the \"worst\" performer among the memecoins, still experienced a substantial 11.97% growth to its current price of $0.00002355.\n\nThe overall crypto market capitalization has grown from $2.36 trillion to $2.53 trillion in the last 24 days, with trading volume fluctuating above the $150 billion mark during most of the time, a high historical threshold that reflects how hot the crypto market is among traders right now.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a tool that measures investor sentiment and emotions, currently indicates a state of extreme greed among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This suggests a high level of optimism and risk-taking appetite in the market, which could be contributing to the current rally.\n\nThe positive trend extends beyond the cryptocurrency market, with the overall stock markets also showing signs of recovery. The Fear and Greed sentiment index indicates a state of extreme greed, a recovery from last week's \"greed\" status. Most of the largest global indices are in the green, with the exception of China and Brazil, which are slightly down.\n\nIn the U,S, the S&P 500 is up +0.6%, the Nasdaq spiked 0.78%, and the Russell 2000 is up +1.23%.

        "content": "Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nOn Monday, March 18, Ethereum native token ETH dropped closer to $3,200 as challenges caused by government regulation harmed the market. Based on reliable sources, the expected ETH spot ETFs will likely not be approved by the SEC in May again.\n\nHowever, despite this news and the negative sentiment it has caused, the price is gradually recovering now. 06:38 ETH is above $3,500, indicating a 24-hour increase of more than 6%. This suggests there\u2019s still confidence and demand in the market for Ethereum.\n\nBut, considering the SEC\u2019s power and influence on crypto assets, can ETH\u2019s price reach $4,000 by Q2? Read on to find out.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strength Against SEC Scrutiny\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the SEC considers Ethereum a security, just like they did with XRP. This could make trading Ethereum harder in the U.S., with more rules and paperwork.\n\nAlso, businesses using Ethereum might have to deal with stock-like regulations, making things tricky.\n\nIf Ethereum becomes a security, it might be delisted on some exchanges or might move to platforms for securities. This news could make investors nervous and cause them to sell, causing the price to drop. Already, Ethereum\u2019s price reacted to these ideas, showing ups and downs.\n\nBut some known persons in the space are defending the digital, saying it\u2019s not a security. Coinbase\u2019s CLO, Paul Grewal, shared some information regarding the Ethereum issue via the X platform.\n\nEx. A. Senior SEC officials have said ETH is not a security, see e.g. SEC Director of Corporation Finance Hinman\u2019s statement https://t.co/efXqCx4iyw 3/10 \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 20, 2024\n\nThe legal officer asserted that millions of U.S. citizens have held this coin since its launch in 2015. Therefore, it will be hard to classify this coin as security. Instead, Grewal said, \u201cETH is a commodity.\u201d Further, he added a restricted document where an SEC senior officer said the coin is not a security.\n\nGiven the evidence in Grewal\u2019s hand, it may be hard for the SEC to win any legal battles with Ethereum. Apart from Grewal, Anatoly Yakovenko, the cofounder of Solana, also supported Ethereum. Taking to the X platform a few hours after Grewal\u2019s post, he said,\n\nIf the state is against Ethereum, then I am against the state.\n\nIf the state is against ethereum then I am against the state \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8| bip-420 (@aeyakovenko) March 21, 2024\n\nCrypto enthusiasts should understand that even if the SEC imposes limits, people outside the U.S. could still trade Ethereum. Also, considering the current price gains, investors are seemingly not worried about the SEC problems.\n\nEthereum Token Price Analysis: Bulls on the Rise\n\nRecent news about plans to call Ethereum a \u201csecurity\u201d caused its price to dip. But the chart below shows green candles climbing back up, suggesting a recovery from that bearish mood.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is still above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) lines. That\u2019s like a big thumbs-up from the market, indicating confidence in the coin\u2019s potential. The red bars in the MACD are getting fainter. This means the bearish vibe is fading, making room for a more positive outlook.\n\nNow, the RSI is hanging out at 51. It\u2019s in the middle ground. Not too overbought, not too oversold. This suggests there\u2019s still room for growth without things getting too crazy.\n\nPlus, the price is heading toward the moving average line of the Bolinger Band indicator. It could signal a bullish trend if the bulls keep pushing and breaking through that level. So, should investors buy Ethereum now or hold off?\n\nBased on this analysis, things are looking up. The indicators are showing positive signs, and if the momentum keeps going, it could be an excellent time to buy in. But remember, nothing is guaranteed in the crypto market. So, trade with caution.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s another gem flying under the radar, promising potential gains. Investors scared of the SEC\u2019s influence should consider this low-cap project before it starts mooning.\n\nEthereum Alternative Smog Set for Binance Listing \u2013 Time to Bag?\n\n>>>Visit Smog Token<<<\n\nSince Smog was introduced into the Solana ecosystem, it has been on a bullish ride, surging more than 1339%. This significant surge is because the project has a clear purpose, and a lot of exciting stuff is planned for the future.\n\nAlso, there have been rumors that Binance will soon list the coin on its platform.\n\nAlso, there\u2019ll be potential token burning that will reduce the number of tokens in circulation. Further, prominent YouTubers like Jacon Bury and Matthew Perry have announced the coin has the potential to be the next 100x crypto in the Solana ecosystem. All these have created excitement within the community, causing the token price to climb.\n\nWhy Should You ADD Smog to Your Portfolio?\n\nFirstly, SMOG\u2019s small market capitalization and cool dragon theme make it stand out. It\u2019s not just another cryptocurrency; it\u2019s got personality. Plus, the potential listing on Binance could mean big things for its value. This March, it shot up from $0.16 to $0.25, 56% in just one day.\n\nThis kind of growth has caught the eye of big investors, and they\u2019re now making hefty purchases. Secondly, SMOG has a strong community behind it, which means stability and support for a coin\u2019s value.\n\nEven though it\u2019s still new, it already has over 50,000 holders and a thriving social media presence, with 34,000 Twitter followers and over 17,000 members in its Telegram group.\n\nLastly, SMOG is currently doing airdrop campaigns and teaming up with partners like Zealy for fun quests. This will keep holders interested and encourage them to stick around for the long term.\n\nOverall, SMOG\u2019s combination of growth potential, community strength, and innovative engagement tactics makes it worth considering for those looking to diversify their altcoin holdings.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly pursuing a legal campaign to classify Ethereum as a security. Indeed, Fortune reports a plethora of US companies were subpoenaed related to an ongoing investigation into ETH.\n\nThe development further threatens the industry-wide hope of the SEC to approve a Spot Ethereum ETF this year. The agency had issued approval for 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, but the current legal action appears to undermine Ethereum\u2019s chances.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC pursuing legal campaign to classify Ethereum as a security. March 20, 2024\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Launches Digital Asset Fund Backed by $100M on Ethereum\n\nSEC Seeking Security Classification for Ethereum\n\nSince the start of 2024, the digital asset market has performed impressively well. Although this week has seen the price correct, Bitcoin has led gains across the board. The asset itself reached a new all-time high of $73,000 this month through increased institutional investment.\n\nAlthough many had hoped ETH would benefit from similar action, that appears unlikely to happen now. According to a report from Fortune, the SEC is pursuing a legal campaign to classify Ethereum as a Security. Specifically, the agency has issued subpoenas to US companies as they investigate the asset.\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Foundation is Under Investigation by State Authority\n\nAccording to the report, the SEC is seeking \u201cdocuments and financial records that they may have regarding their dealings with the Etheruem Foundation,\u201d a non-profit group that supports Etheruem and is based in Switzerland. Moreover, the report notes investigations into the Ethereum Foundation began as far back as September of 2022 when it transitioned to a proof-of-stake governance model.\n\nThe report noted another source received a subpoena within the last several weeks. The initial investigation was reported by CoinDesk but has not received confirmation from the Ethereum Foundation. In a comment to Fortune, the SEC said it \u201cdoes not comment on the existence or nonexistence of possible investigation.\u201d"

This is similar to what they have been trying to do with another cryptocurrency you already know, XRP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a crypto asset is tagged as a security, it means it might be subject to strict trading regulations. For retail traders, this could mean more paperwork and limitations on buying and selling Ethereum in the U.S. Companies dealing with Ethereum might have to follow rules that apply to stocks and bonds, which could make things complex.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s nature as a decentralized blockchain makes enforcing these potential regulations a tough task, especially globally. Even if the SEC puts restrictions in place, people outside the U.S. could still trade Ethereum freely. This includes U.S. citizens, who might find ways to continue trading despite the hurdles.\n\nTechnically, being considered a security affects how Ethereum gets listed on exchanges and what kind of investors can get involved. This can lead to some exchanges delisting ETH or moving it to a platform that handles securities. This kind of news can cause uncertainty and lead to price drops, as investors might get nervous and sell their holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, Ethereum's price has shown some reaction to these developments, with a noticeable surge in volatility, which is not surprising considering the most recent severe market correction. Ethereum's case is particularly delicate given the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Many investors expected Ethereum to be the next asset in line for receiving an ETF.\n\nIf Ethereum is marked a security, it would not mean the end for ETH trading. It could, however, introduce far more complexity and barriers that could affect its growth negatively. Anyway, it is too early to call it an end, as Ethereum has all the potential in the world to recover and beat the SEC in a potential court case."

That makes it the second-largest CryptoPunks sale ever whether measured in ETH and USD.\n\nThe sale comes just weeks after another Alien Punk (#3100) sold for 4,500 ETH, which was worth $16.03 million worth at the time of the transaction on March 3.

        "content": "In the trendy world of cryptocurrencies, the greatest levels of hype and anticipation have often been reserved for initial coin offerings (ICOs), the crowdsourced fundraising sales used to launch new tokens, coins, and services. ICOs have come to be seen as a significant risk for the everyday investor.\n\nThey are highly speculative since few ICOs go on to see the tokens they launch meet with real success\u2014and many ICOs are actually fraudulent and are scrutinized heavily by regulators. Nonetheless, investors continue to watch the ICO space closely for the next big opportunity, and some ICO projects materialize. Below, you'll read about some of the biggest ICO events in history according to the amount fundraised or the return on investment (ROI).\n\nKey Takeaways An initial coin offering (ICO) is a fundraising method used by cryptocurrency and blockchain startups.\n\nThe startup develops a new cryptocurrency token with specific functions or utilities within its planned ecosystem. These tokens might provide access to a platform, voting rights in governance decisions, or a stake in the project's future value.\n\nThe success of an ICO is most commonly measured by the amount of money raised during the token sale, regardless of the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nOther investors measure the success of an ICO by the cryptocurrency token's return on investment (ROI) since it was purchased during the sale, taking into account the price.\n\nICOs by Amount Raised\n\nEOS\n\nBlock.one is a private Hong Kong-based blockchain company founded in 2017 by Brendan Blumer and Dan Larimer. Block.one conducted an ICO from June 26, 2017, to June 1, 2018, that raised $4.1 billion to create EOS, a blockchain platform with a native cryptocurrency of the same name, EOS. Block.one marketed EOS as a solution to some of the limitations of earlier blockchains, such as high transaction fees, slow processing speed, and a lack of network scalability.\n\nThe EOS ICO holds the record for the largest ICO ever and represented nearly a quarter of the entire ICO boom of the era in which it launched. Over 1 billion EOS tokens were sold, purchased using Ethereum's ether cryptocurrency (ETH), and distributed over 350 weekly periods, each lasting five days. The EOS ICO was conducted through a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe EOS blockchain was launched on June 14, 2018, shortly after the ICO was completed. The EOS cryptocurrency can be used for paying EOS transaction fees, staking for block producer elections, and participating in decentralized applications (dApps) built on the EOS blockchain.\n\nTelegram\n\nThe Telegram Open Network (TON) ICO raised over $1.7 billion in 2018. The ICO sought to build a fast, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain specifically for a decentralized application associated with the Telegram messaging app. Although it faced legal hurdles and technical delays, the launch of the TON mainnet in early 2020 sparked renewed interest in the project and its potential impact on the future of messaging and communication. However, the effort was terminated in mid-2020 after the SEC filed charges and won a lawsuit against Telegram for selling non-registered securities.\n\nTezos\n\nThe Tezos Foundation conducted the Tezos ICO from July 1 to 13, 2017. The ICO raised $232 million, primarily in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The funds raised were to be used to develop the Tezos blockchain platform and XTZ cryptocurrency, a project aiming to achieve high scalability, security, and self-governance through an on-chain amendment process. The fundraising structure was unique, employing \"non-refundable donations\" instead of traditional token sales. This led to some controversy, with some participants seeing them as investments rather than donations.\n\nFilecoin\n\nFilecoin, a non-profit organization, secured a staggering $233 million in 2017 when it sold its cryptocurrency token FIL through an ICO. The Filecoin project introduced decentralized storage solutions, a critical infrastructure component for Web3, and offered token holders the potential to earn from providing storage space under a sustainable economic model.\n\nPolkadot\n\nThe open-source blockchain project Polkadot successfully raised $145 million in 2017 to focus on building a blockchain that could provide interoperability between different blockchains. The Polkadot protocol and its cryptocurrency token DOT, which was eventually launched, allow seamless communication and data transfer across independent blockchains. Polkadot is seen as a key solution for blockchain fragmentation and fostering a diverse ecosystem.\n\nICOs by Return on Investment\n\nEther (ETH)\n\nEther, the native token for Ethereum, remains the second-largest digital currency by market cap as of March 2024. While Bitcoin is a blockchain and cryptocurrency, Ethereum is a blockchain designed to be a platform for decentralized applications to be built on. Its native token, ether, is used on the blockchain to pay for transactions and as collateral for honest blockchain work. Ether can also be used as a payment method, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nAt the ICO, ether sold for 2,000 ETH per 1 BTC, and the token's market value was $3,496 on March 21, 2024, providing a hefty ROI for the lucky investors who bought in during the ICO.\n\nNEO (NEO)\n\nNEO (NEO) is a Chinese open-source blockchain project that has gone by several different names in its short history. One of the most common is not an official name, however, but rather a nickname\u2014China\u2019s Ethereum. NEO gained this distinction by utilizing smart contract applications and decentralized commerce.\n\n\n\nThe company had a massive ICO thanks in no small part to support from the Chinese government, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and other major companies. From an initial token price of just over $0.03 to an all-time high price of roughly $180, NEO investors who timed their investments right stood to make an incredible amount of money. On March 21, 2024, NEO traded about $14.83.\n\nAlias (ALIAS)\n\nAlias (ALIAS), formerly known as Spectrecoin, launched in November 2016 as a purported privacy-focused cryptocurrency. One of the touted features of the coin is that it can be sent and received around the world with complete anonymity.\n\n\n\nAlias seeks to push the boundaries of what governments around the world are willing to tolerate from digital currencies, but it has not yet broken through to the mainstream. Nonetheless, an investment of $0.001 per token in late 2016 during the ICO would have been worth close to $0.15 in September 2021, making it one of the highest returning ICO tokens at one time. On March 21, 2024, ALIAS had a market price of $0.01341.\n\nArk (ARK)\n\nArk (ARK) is designed to be as efficient as possible. The digital currency platform allows for the quick integration of other cryptocurrencies into its own blockchain. With a global focus and a commitment to decentralization, Ark seems to have been destined for success.\n\nThe initial token price was $0.04 during the ICO. At its highest levels, one Ark token climbed to nearly $11, but traded at $1.12, on March 21, 2024.\n\nStratis (STRAX)\n\nStratis is another cryptocurrency that has not yet made it big into the world of leading digital currencies. The company, based in the U.K., prides itself on having a platform that is compatible with various programming languages, allowing businesses the ability to create and design custom applications easily.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) was a prominent supporter of the Stratis ICO, and that led to major success. The project raised nearly 1,000 BTC over a period of five weeks, and individuals paid just $0.01 per token. On March 21, 2024, the cryptocurrency traded for $1.50.\n\nAre ICOs and IPOs the Same Thing? An IPO, or initial public offering, is when a company's stocks are first offered to the public for trading. It is a long and regulated process for a company to \"go public\" through an IPO. In the past, ICOs were not as regulated, but the Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on the practice and began requiring that ICOs that meet the criteria to be securities must be registered and approved.\n\nAre ICOs Subject to Investor Regulations and Protections? If an ICO token satisfies all four criteria of the Howey Test, it is likely considered a security and subject to securities regulations. This means the ICO must comply with relevant registration and disclosure requirements, offering significant investor protection.\n\nHow Does the Amount Raised by an ICO Differ From the Token's Market Cap and ROI? Unlike return on investment (ROI), measuring how much money an ICO raised alone doesn't account for inflation or changes in market value over time. A cryptocurrency token's market capitalization measures the total value of all outstanding tokens issued by the project at the quoted open market price, often at the current timeframe. Cryptocurrency tokens can be sold during ICOs at variable prices to different investors at the discretion of the token issuer.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile success is subjective, it is largely agreed upon that the most impactful ICOs have launched an actual cryptocurrency and raised billions of dollars in capital to fund the ecosystem development of some of the most widely used blockchains.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland that supports the Ethereum ecosystem, has come under investigation by unnamed state authorities, according to a report by CoinDesk. The news has sparked concern among investors and traders, as the details surrounding the investigation remain scarce, with little information on its purpose or overall breadth.\n\nFollowing the investigation announcement, the price of Ethereum experienced a slight dip. However, following the recent surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum has also witnessed a significant surge, currently trading at $3,564.58, representing a 10.9% increase over the past 24 hours. The 24-hour trading range for ETH has been between $3,190.11 and $3,551.57.\n\nAlso read: Polygon Tests Symmetrical Triangle: MATIC to Reach $1 This Weekend?\n\nHow will Ethereum perform this weekend?\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for the upcoming weekend. Changelly\u2019s analysis predicts that ETH will reach a minimum price of $3,379 and a maximum price of $3,403.\n\nThe investigation into the Ethereum Foundation comes at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering whether to classify ETH as a security. This scrutiny has raised concerns about the potential impact on the approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAlso read: Ripple Slumps Amidst Market Crash: Can XRP Hit $0.7 This Weekend?\n\nThe current market sentiment and Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to surpass $70,000 have dampened the likelihood of ETH surpassing the $4,000 mark this weekend. Despite these challenges, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum\u2019s robust ecosystem, which hosts a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continues to drive innovation and adoption in the blockchain industry. The recent Dencun upgrade, which aimed to enhance the network\u2019s functionality and performance, has also brought attention to Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development and potential for growth.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Forecasted To Reach 4 Cents: Here\u2019s When\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the upgrade, ETH\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and its community of developers and users continues to expand.

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana and Their Meme Coins Bounce Back - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana and Ethereum, homes to some of the biggest and most popular meme coins, have both posted gains in the past day.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL has increased by 10% and ETH by 6% compared to this time yesterday. That puts Solana at $189.98 and ETH at $3,541 at the time of writing.\n\nThe 7-day comparison tells a very different story, though. ETH is currently 10% lower than it was this time last week, when it was still basking in the afterglow of devs having rolled out the Dencun upgrade on mainnet. The upgrade was much-anticipated because the impact it will have on fees and transaction times on Ethereum Layer-2 networks. But the realization of those benefits has so far been gradual.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the same period, SOL has gained 10.2% since this time last Thursday. And as is usually the case, what's good for the underlying network has also been good for many of the tokens that trade on it. In this case, that means a bunch of meme coins are seeing a resurgence.\n\nFloki Inu (FLOKI) is leading the pack, having posted a 27% gain since this time yesterday. But at $0.0002297, it's still trading 19% lower than it was last week. Last week's crypto market rally was enough to push the Ethereum-based meme coin towards its all-time high. But it fell just shy of surpassing $0.0003365, which the Shiba Inu-themed coin last saw in November 2021.\n\nFLOKI AND TOKENFI TO BE THE OFFICIAL CRYPTO PARTNER FOR WORLD TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP IN SOUTH KOREA, SET TO REACH HALF A BILLION PEOPLE#Floki and #TokenFi are making waves in the sports world by becoming the Official Cryptocurrency Partner for one of the largest World Table\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OxkXkzjcvh \u2014 FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) March 21, 2024\n\nThe latest for FLOKI is that it has again been named one of the official crypto partners for the World Table Tennis Championship in South Korea.\n\nFloki is a play-to-earn cryptocurrency that originated as a meme coin based on Elon Musk\u2019s dog. It has since evolved into a fully functioning Web3 ecosystem with NFTs, a metaverse, DeFi, and prepaid Floki Visa and Mastercard gift cards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and PepeCoin (PEPE), have picked up double-digit gains since yesterday. At the time of writing, the DOGE price has reached $0.154 up 15% over the past 24 hours. And PEPE, an Ethereum meme coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme, has seen its price increase by 12% since Wednesday.\n\nBoth of the meme coins tend to follow Bitcoin and the rest of the broader market. But their meme status means that they're a lot more volatile than most assets. In fact, the vast majority of meme coins die young because it's incredibly difficult to find staying power in a category that relies so heavily on trader sentiment.\n\nAnd on Solana, it's Dogwifhat (WIF) that now has its Shiba Inu-themed competitor, BONK, thoroughly beat. WIF, whose community last week succeeded in raising money to put its picture on The Sphere in Las Vegas, has gained 15.5% since yesterday. It's currently trading for $2.39, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "$4.27 million ETH liquidations occurred over the last 24 hours in the DeFi sector.\n\nTraders turned bearish as IV grew.\n\nOver the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] has fallen tremendously coinciding with the correction in Bitcoin\u2019s[BTC] price.\n\nBulls get punished\n\nBased on Parsec\u2019s data, DeFi saw over $5.4 million in collateral liquidated within the last 24 hours, with $4.27 million tied to ETH. Should ETH plummet to $3,008, an additional $24 million in collateral could face liquidation.\n\nOn-chain derivatives exchanges such as GMX, Kwenta, and Polynomial triggered liquidations totaling more than $52 million during the same period.\n\nThe recent surge in collateral liquidations, especially those associated with Ethereum carries significant implications for the price stability of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs large volumes of collateral are liquidated, it exacerbates the already heightened price volatility within the Ethereum market. This increased volatility can trigger a cascade of sell-offs as liquidated assets are offloaded, further driving down ETH prices.\n\nConsequently, investors and traders may become increasingly cautious and hesitant to engage with Ethereum, fearing further price declines.\n\nAdditionally, the negative sentiment resulting from the visible liquidations may undermine confidence in ETH, leading to prolonged periods of price suppression.\n\nThis volatility, coupled with the visibility of large-scale liquidations, may erode market sentiment surrounding Ethereum, undermining confidence in the platform\u2019s stability and resilience.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum network may experience congestion during periods of high volatility and increased liquidations, resulting in higher transaction fees and slower processing times.\n\nThe congestion also could deter users from engaging with Ethereum-based applications and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, limiting the platform\u2019s growth and adoption.\n\nHowever, the put-to-call ratio for ETH increased, indicating that traders were turning bearish towards ETH.\n\nMore uncertainty on the way?\n\nOne of the reasons for the same would be the rising Implied Volatility(IV) for ETH. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of ETH\u2019s data revealed that the IV for ETH had surged significantly.\n\nThis signals increased price volatility, making it challenging for investors to accurately predict price movements. This can potentially result in higher trading costs and increased risk exposure.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nMoreover, elevated IV leads to higher option premiums, making it more expensive for traders to buy options contracts which reduces potential profitability.\n\nThis can deter investors from entering or maintaining positions in Ethereum, leading to reduced investor confidence and downward pressure on prices. At press time ETH was trading at $3,250.73 and its price had grown by $3,250.73 in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the Ethereum Foundation and companies doing business with the nonprofit, according to a new report from Fortune Wednesday. And that\u2019s very bad news for crypto enthusiasts who were hopeful that spot Ether ETFs, which would make it easier for investors to invest in the cryptocurrency without holding it personally, would be approved by regulators soon.\n\nThe news comes after CoinDesk first noticed on Wednesday that the Ethereum Foundation had recently included a note on Github about being investigated by an unnamed \u201cstate authority.\u201d The spokesperson for the SEC told Gizmodo via email on Wednesday that, \u201cThe SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the SEC\u2019s apparent investigation, according to people who spoke with Fortune, is to classify Ethereum as a security. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has previously said Bitcoin isn\u2019t a security but should be classified as a commodity while suggesting practically all other crypto coins are securities.\n\nFrom Fortune:\n\nAccording to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena request, the SEC\u2019s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began shortly after the blockchain\u2019s shift to a new governance model known as \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d in September of 2022.\n\nThat proof-of-stake event moved the blockchain away from the energy-intensive model used by Bitcoin in favor of one that relies on a trusted network of validators\u2014and provided the SEC with a new pretext to attempt to define Ethereum as a security, according to people at three different companies familiar with the subpoenas. The people asked Fortune not identify to identify them or their firms for fear of retaliation by the agency\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, who one described as \u201cvindictive.\u201d\n\nWhy does it matter if Ethereum is a security? That means Ethereum and the exchanges that trade it will be subject to tighter enforcement from the SEC.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has ticked down roughly 14% over the past five days though it\u2019s still up 98% in the past six months. The crypto coin was trading at roughly $1,600 in late September.\n\nEthereum was created in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin after he rather famously became frustrated that his favorite World of Warcraft character\u2019s capabilities were degraded. To Buterin, that was when he \u201crealized what horrors centralized services can bring,\u201d leading him to create an ostensibly decentralized crypto coin.\n\nButerin is estimated to be worth about $400 million, according to Forbes, down from about $1.4 billion in 2021."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said Thursday that the amount of \"usage\" he\u2019s seen from layer-2 networks following last week\u2019s milestone Dencun upgrade has been lower than expected.\n\nIn response to a question submitted by Rug Radio at ETH Taipei on Thursday, Buterin hedged when asked whether Dencun\u2019s implementation has been better than he expected.\n\n\u201cIt depends what you mean by better,\u201d the prominent crypto developer replied.\n\nButerin proceeded to laud Ethereum\u2019s developers for implementing the update \u201cflawlessly,\u201d before reflecting on what he considered to be Dencun\u2019s lackluster contribution to network traffic on layer-2 networks since going live last Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe amount of usage is interestingly low, right?\u201d Buterin said.\n\nDencun introduced blobs, a novel data storage solution that\u2014via a process called proto-danksharding\u2014now allows layer-2 data to be stored on-chain for a temporary period of about a month (instead of forever), drastically reducing layer-2 gas fees to near-zero.\n\nButerin said Thursday that Ethereum core developers had hoped, going into Dencun, that layer-2 networks would use three blobs on average per block; current levels are about 67% lower than that target.\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not that layer-2 networks have dropped off in traffic since Dencun; on the contrary, most of them have more than doubled in transaction volume since last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTraffic reached such highs on Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 network Base yesterday that transactions on Coinbase.com and Coinbase Wallet began failing intermittently yesterday. This morning, gas fees on Base suddenly spiked to about a third of pre-Dencun levels, after trading bots flooded the network in a meme coin-related frenzy.\n\n1/ Transaction costs on Base spiked today. The cause appears to be increased activity from trading bots willing to pay high priority fees. As a result, Base has been more expensive to transact on today than other L2s that use blobs. pic.twitter.com/smjsd1lcNl \u2014 Kofi (@0xKofi) March 21, 2024\n\nNonetheless, Buterin and other Ethereum stakeholders appear to have expected even greater spikes in layer-2 traffic, given Dencun\u2019s dramatic lowering of L2 gas fees\u2014especially at a time when gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet are spiking to levels intolerable for many retail users.\n\nMarius Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum core developer, said it might be too early to assess the success of blobs, as some layer-2 networks have yet to integrate Dencun.\n\n\u201cNot all L2s have switched to blobs yet,\u201d Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. \u201cIt means that L2s have lots of room to grow.\u201d\n\nPolygon, for example, has yet to fully update to Dencun. Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman previously told Decrypt that he expects all layer-2s, including Polygon, to be fully integrated with Dencun within a month or two.\n\nVan Der Wijden also said that a silver lining of relatively low blob usage on layer-2s so far has been the rock-bottom gas fees that such traffic has permitted. Rising demand for blob space will likely increase layer-2 transaction costs, though to what degree is yet to be seen.\n\nIn Taipei on Thursday, Vitalik Buterin echoed that sentiment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI do think it is good for present-day rollups that [transaction costs] are very cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Ethereum creator emphasized he\u2019s more excited about blob usage eventually meeting his expectations.\n\n\u201cDefinitely looking forward to usage going up over the next few months,\u201d he added.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Discover SCENE\n\nXai, the gaming-centric Ethereum network built on Arbitrum scaling technology, could add a heap of games by year\u2019s end thanks to a new collaboration with a prominent indie gaming curator called The MIX.\n\nThe MIX, or The Media Indie Exchange, says that it could launch more than 100 games on the layer-3 Xai network before the end of 2024 and that we should see the first of those games live within 60 days. No games have been confirmed yet, however, as they will be announced individually.\n\n\u201cWe already have a number of games confirmed and a large pipeline of games that we expect to confirm in the short term,\u201d The MIX owner and co-founder Justin Woodward told Decrypt\u2019s GG. \u201cBy the end of the year, we anticipate deploying at least dozens, if not over 100, games to Xai through this partnership.\u201d\n\nOver the last 12 years, The MIX has served as connective tissue between indie game developers, publishers, and the media, presenting curated gaming showcases and developing content around such events. With those connections in place and having shown hundreds of games via its events, The MIX now aims to onboard some of those creators to Web3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn many cases, it appears that the games coming via The MIX will be completed \u201cWeb2\u201d games that can be adapted for the blockchain market via Xai\u2019s software development kit (SDK)\u2014though the company will also help facilitate crypto games being built from scratch for Xai.\n\n\u201cXai offers an SDK that simplifies the process for Web2 games and their users to access the advantages of Web3 through a straightforward implementation,\u201d said Woodward. \u201cMany games will utilize this technology, which is completely abstracted from the user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cA smaller group of games are building Web3 foundations from the start,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be exciting to see the creativity of indie game developers experimenting with Web3 tech.\u201d\n\nWoodward said that the Xai implementation in upcoming games could bear a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to how game publisher Valve has allowed players on the Steam platform to buy and sell in-game items in Web2 games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. But unlike in traditional games, players won't be locked to a certain storefront or marketplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUltimately, it's up to the game developers to determine how they utilize it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe MIX lives in the traditional gaming space, albeit aligned more with indie creators than major publishing giants. Even so, there\u2019s been plenty of skepticism around crypto games in the Web2 world. On the other hand, game studios are reeling from mass layoffs, and the industry is in disarray. Are game developers coming around to crypto distribution channels?\n\n\u201cThere will continue to be some pushback,\u201d Woodward admitted, \u201cbut developers have been more responsive to Xai because the Web3 elements are pushed behind the scenes and don't affect the user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's also important to acknowledge how Web3 has helped indie game developers bootstrap community,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen examining Xai's socials, it's clear they have built a rabid community ready to play games by leveraging their technology. This presents an opportunity for indie game developers to connect with and grow their audience. Blockchain is merely a technological component.\u201d\n\nThe MIX is currently holding an event at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in collaboration with gaming content studio Kinda Funny.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Breaking: Ethereum Foundation Under Investigation By A State Authority - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is reportedly under investigation by a State Authority, a new update disclosed through the protocol\u2019s GitHub repository.\n\nThe Unclear Inquiry Into Ethereum Foundation\n\nAccording to the GitHub update, the disclosure of the inquiry was made weeks ago, marking the first time any State Authority will be issuing such a probe into the Ethereum blockchain developer.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThis commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality,\u201d said Pablo Pettinari, one of the core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in a commit on February 26.\n\nThe GitHub commit showed the removal of contact, another bizarre trend that negates its core tenets of transparency. The inquiry also led to the removal of a canary that represented the Ethereum network from the foundation\u2019s website. Per the Wayback Machine data, this canary feature and its associated text were present in January.\n\nThe community has been thrown into undue speculation following the breaking of the inquiry. With the Ethereum Foundation currently not sharing additional details about the probe, any potential fallout in the long term will go a long way in helping stakeholders understand what the core challenge is.\n\nEthereum remains a controversial digital currency as it relates to its security classification. Through a series of intricate events, there are allegations of a likely conflict of interest with Jay Clayton, the former Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who filed a lawsuit against XRP days before leaving office.\n\nMany in the community postulated that this lawsuit was directed at XRP to stump competition, however, there is no evidence at the moment to connect this with the current State Authority inquiry.\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum recorded a knee-jerk reaction to the news, there is stability in the market at the moment. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has recorded a 0.82% uptick with its price pegged at $3,316.02. To complement this rare bullish twist, the coin\u2019s trading volume is up 8.45% to $34,886,760,871.\n\nCrypto Entities and Federal Probes\n\nJust as the Ethereum Foundation is facing a probe by a State Authority, other crypto-based entities have had their fair share of related probes in recent times.\n\nBinance was under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) for years, a probe that ended in a settlement last year. The settlement, which is worth about $4.3 billion in monetary terms, was regarded as one of the largest scores by the DoJ, FinCEN, and CFTC at the time. It also led to the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao from the company.\n\nBesides this historic event, other platforms including Coinbase Global Inc. remain in a tight legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over some of its offerings.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rallies 10%, Why Close Above $3,550 Is The Key - TradingView",
        "content": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave from the $3,050 zone. ETH is up over 10% and is now struggling to clear the $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum started a decent recovery wave from the $3,050 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if it settles above the $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Starts Recovery\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $3,350 and $3,200 levels, like Bitcoin. ETH even declined below the $3,150 support level before the bulls appeared. It tested the $3,050 zone.\n\nA low was formed at $3,059 and the price is moving higher. There was a strong recovery wave above the $3,350 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low.\n\nThere was also a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,520 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,550 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,675, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,820 level. If there is a move above the $3,820 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,380 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,320 zone. The next key support could be the $3,220 zone. A clear move below the $3,220 support might send the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,380\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,550"

        "title": "Solana surpasses Ethereum on DEX - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "It is not the first time it happens, but the fact that the volume of trades on decentralized exchanges on Solana has exceeded that of DEX on Ethereum always makes headlines.\n\nEthereum not only has existed since 2015, but has been dominating the world of DeFi uncontested for years now.\n\nSolana instead landed on the crypto markets just under four years ago, but has transaction fees that are far lower.\n\nSolana\u2019s Overtake on Ethereum\n\nIt should be noted, however, that in terms of key metrics Solana has not yet surpassed Ethereum.\n\nBy market capitalization SOL (the native cryptocurrency of Solana) is around 75 billion dollars, just surpassed by BNB with 78. ETH, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is still on another level, with 386 billion dollars.\n\nFor TVL (Total Value Locked on DeFi protocols), Ethereum surpasses everyone with its 46 billion dollars, with Solana in fourth place with only 3.7 billion, surpassed also by Tron as well as BSC. However, the majority of TVL on Tron is due to USDT, while in the Solana ecosystem it is due to DEX.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the overtaking occurred precisely on decentralized exchanges, especially in terms of daily trading volumes.\n\nMoreover, even among DEXs, Uniswap still dominates in terms of TVL, although now a portion of its trading volumes does not occur on Ethereum but on layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nUsing as a reference the trading volumes per chain, in the last seven days Solana has exceeded 21 billion dollars, while Ethereum stopped at 19.\n\nHowever, it should be added that there have been more than 6 billion dollars in trading on Arbitrum, so overall the Ethereum ecosystem with its layer-2 still surpasses the Solana ecosystem.\n\nNote that in third place in this ranking there is BSC, with 12 billion, and in fourth place Avalanche with 4.\n\nThe reason for the overtaking\n\nThere are two reasons that have led to this overtaking.\n\nThe first, simply, is the much lower fees on transactions.\n\nIn fact, it is no coincidence that the fifth chain by trading volume on DEXs is Arbitrum, the main layer-2 solution for Ethereum that enables transactions at very low costs.\n\nSolana still has lower costs, so it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s the preferred chain at the moment.\n\nHowever, there was another reason behind this boom.\n\nThe boom of memecoins played an important role.\n\nMany memecoins are now being launched on low-cost chains, such as Solana or even Base. Moreover, anyone can list their new token on a decentralized exchange, so DEXs are the ideal place to launch new memecoins.\n\nIt was a real boom, with some truly colossal proportions.\n\nIn the last 1 hour, 2,500 Solana memecoins were created. \u2014 Ram Ahluwalia CFA, Lumida (@ramahluwalia) March 13, 2024\n\nNow that the temporary boom of memecoins seems to be fading, it is possible that Ethereum will return to dominate this ranking, even though Arbitrum has now become a strong competitor.\n\nThe historical volumes\n\nHowever, the situation changes if historical volumes are taken into consideration.\n\nOn a monthly basis, in March Ethereum still dominates with over 51 billion dollars so far, while Solana is at about 45.\n\nIn February, even BSC had surpassed Solana, with 25 billion dollars compared to 22.\n\nIn January, for example, Arbitrum had almost caught up with Solana, both at 22 billion, so it is evident that the overtaking of the last week is due to a perhaps temporary boom, largely driven by memecoins.\n\nIn November 2021, at the peak of the bubble, DEXs on Ethereum recorded a record of $107 billion in monthly trading volumes, followed by $74 billion on BSC.\n\nThey were numbers far superior to the current ones, so it seems that there is still room for growth for DEX. At that time Solana didn\u2019t even make it into the top 10, so in just over three years it has come a long way.\n\nEven Arbitrum has grown a lot, because back then it was under 4 billion, while in the first 20 days of March 2024 it is already over 18.\n\nThe prices of SOL (Solana) and ETH (Ethereum)\n\nInterestingly, both ETH and SOL are currently priced 34% below their all-time high.\n\nHowever, in the last seven days ETH is losing 20%, while SOL is gaining 12%. Also since the beginning of the year SOL is performing better, with a +68% compared to the +42% of ETH.\n\nThe key point to understand these differences actually lies in the bear market of 2022/2023.\n\nETH in 2022 has dropped less, and in 2023 it immediately recovered together with BTC.\n\nInstead SOL lost much more in 2022, and especially in 2023 it recovered only in October, when the entire crypto market restarted.\n\nAlthough in some ways it may seem that Solana is challenging Ethereum, in reality for now it is still the latter that dominates, even on DEX (especially thanks to its second layer)."

        "content": "The Solana community, led by co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, is backing Ethereum and taking a stand against the U.S. SEC amid push to categorize Ether (ETH) as a security.\n\nSolana Stands Against SEC\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s co-founder, has opposed the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) underground moves against Ethereum. According to disclosures by The Crypto Basic, the SEC is initiating a campaign to potentially classify ETH as security.\n\nInsiders familiar with the situation have revealed that the SEC has demanded financial records and other documents from U.S. firms that have had a deal with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the regulator has not officially remarked on this development at press time. Yet, the disclosure has sparked various reactions among prominent figures in the crypto community, including Yakovenko of Solana.\n\nYakovenko voiced opposition to ETH\u2019s potential classification as security, stating:\n\n\u201cIf the state is against Ethereum, then I am against the state.\u201d\n\nIf the state is against ethereum then I am against the state \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) March 21, 2024\n\n\u201cThis is the energy we need in this space,\u201d remarked X user Yuge on the Solana founder\u2019s remark.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSolana Could be Next after ETH\n\nFurthermore, some Community members pointed out that despite Ethereum being an adversary to Solana, it was right to stand in solidarity with ETH. They see safeguarding the space from detrimental classification as outweighing any internal competition within the industry.\n\nFor instance, another commenter stated, \u201cETH maximalists may be idiots. But they are our idiots,\u201d echoing the rivalry among members of various crypto communities.\n\nAdditionally, some believe that Solana could be next in line if the SEC\u2019s move against Ethereum succeeds.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the SEC has already tagged Solana as security. This classification occurred within the context of a lawsuit against the Binance exchange last June.\n\nHowever, unlike its approach with XRP in previous years, the SEC has not lodged a formal complaint against other tokens categorized as securities alongside Solana.\n\nUS Politician Reacts\n\nNonetheless, considering the regulator\u2019s history with Ethereum founders, the SEC\u2019s alleged move to classify ETH as a security has surprised many. U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry highlighted that the move contradicts the assessment of the CFTC and the SEC\u2019s previous actions.\n\nReports indicate @GaryGensler is moving to unilaterally classify #ETH as a security. This is contrary to the @CFTC's assessment and the @SECgov's prior actions. Congress decides the SEC's jurisdiction and budget, Chair Gensler doesn't get to make it up as he goes along. https://t.co/83DUkCjMVA \u2014 Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) March 20, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, some ETH critics like attorney Steven Nerayoff, renowned in the XRP community for his contribution to ETHGate, suggest the SEC\u2019s move is justifiable. According to him:\n\n\u201cThe truth behind Ethereum and the SEC\u2019s involvement is dark. It is about time we shine a light on the extensive corruption intertwining Ethereum and our government.\u201d"
