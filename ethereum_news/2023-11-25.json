        "title": "Ethereum stakers \u2018terrified\u2019 of slashing. Company coalition looks to make it nearly impossible - DLNews",
        "content": "Slashing is a constant concern for Ethereum staking providers.\n\nCompany Cubist wants to use abstraction to prevent accidental slashing.\n\nDoing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nBitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, encountered a serious problem earlier this month \u2014 a problem that unsettles other Ethereum stakers as well.\n\nIts newly deployed Ethereum validators \u2014 software that helps process transactions and secure the network in return for newly minted Ether \u2014 began getting \u201cslashed,\u201d a term that refers to taking some Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish the correct data to the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the course of almost two hours, nearly 100 of the firm\u2019s validators were knocked offline and fined one Ether each \u2014 an almost $200,000 loss at current prices \u2014 for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nBitcoin Suisse did not immediately return DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nWhile slashing exists to punish people who try to attack or cheat Ethereum\u2019s validation system, it more commonly happens because of code bugs or human error.\n\nSince Ethereum started allowing users to stake in 2020, validators on the network have been slashed 400 times, per beaconcha.in data.\n\nWhile the financial damage caused by slashing on Ethereum has historically been much smaller than the losses from hacks or DeFi protocol bugs, many crypto security researchers worry that an event where thousands of validators are simultaneously slashed is a serious risk.\n\nAnd as the Ether staking market swelled to over $57 billion this year, that risk has only become more troubling.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBitcoin Suisse is not the only Ethereum staking provider to suffer from slashing recently. In October, 20 Ethereum validators controlled by Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol with over $18.5 billion of deposits, were slashed, resulting in a $30,000 hit. That incident was not the first time Lido\u2019s validators were slashed this year.\n\nLido's deposits climbed higher over the past year as Ethereum staking popularity soared\n\n\u201cEven very sophisticated experienced validator operators are still getting slashed,\u201d Ann Stefan, co-founder and COO of Cubist, a blockchain key management platform, told DL News in an interview.\n\n\u201cHaving best practices in place can really help prevent the incidence of these types of things from happening,\u201d Stefan said.\n\nBecause slashing can occur so easily, the fear of it happening is palpable among staking providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all terrified of this,\u201d Fraser Brown, co-founder and CTO of Cubist, told DL News. \u201cThe way people get slashed in practice most of the time is they just make mistakes with their infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCubist has teamed up with 16 other crypto firms and protocols including Redacted, Swell, and EigenLayer to form the Secure Staking Alliance, a cross-industry partnership with the goal of making crypto staking more secure.\n\nWithin the alliance, Cubist is trying to solve the problem of slashing once and for all by making it almost impossible for stakers to be slashed accidentally.\n\nBut doing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nSlashing serves an important purpose by protecting Ethereum from attack. But the stringent security comes with a downside \u2014 it\u2019s easy for honest stakers to be slashed if they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with this tension where the fundamental security mechanism of Ethereum is actually the fundamental insecurity mechanism for validator node operators,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSolving slashing\n\nCubist\u2019s solution to accidental slashing is to create a layer of abstraction that validators must go through to sign off on the data they send to the Ethereum network.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum are very similar to databases where the current state must follow on from the previous state. If a validator tries to publish an incorrect state it gets slashed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a database. The problem is databases are actually kind of hard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a whole bunch of validators, you have to have a global scalable database for every validator key. That\u2019s something you can get wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Cubist proposes is that all validator clients must send messages to another piece of software \u2014 which Brown refers to as a \u201csky key\u201d \u2014 that is better equipped to make sure the validator\u2019s messages contain the correct data.\n\nAccording to Brown, as long as the sky key has serious slashing protection, the validators that rely on it will also be safe.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get all the hard database stuff right once and then all requests just go through that key,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTo make sure multiple validators aren\u2019t relying on the same abstracted key, Cubist deploys a separate instance for each validator. \u201cIf you have 100 validators there are 100 keys in the sky. One for each,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBeyond Ethereum staking\n\nWhile Cubist\u2019s slashing solution is most relevant to Ethereum, the most popular proof of stake blockchain, it is also relevant to other areas of staking.\n\nOne area which has previously drawn concern from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is restaking \u2014 an upcoming blockchain feature that will allow users to double-stake their Ether on other protocols and blockchains.\n\nCubist has signed partnerships with both EigenLayer and Babylon \u2014 two restaking protocols \u2014 specifically to focus on protecting their ecosystems from slashing.\n\nAccording to Stefan, protocols like these all have unique slashing conditions, which presents an additional layer of complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important to have anti-slashers in place on these risk taking protocols,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while Stefan and Brown say they are confident in Cubist\u2019s anti-slashing standards, they are also mindful of the risk of having all stakers rely on only their specific implementations.\n\n\u201cThe standards are not saying, \u2018You must use this setup, you must use this hardware,\u2019\u201d Stefan said. The message is, she added, here\u2019s how to set up your infrastructure if you want to have the best chance of not messing up.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards\u2014but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast\u2019s launch to task, attributing his comments to \u201cwe at Paradigm,\u201d suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cThat said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers \u201cnative yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,\u201d letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like \u201crewards\u201d ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024\u2014bringing Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama\u2014the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast\u2014but the Blast network isn\u2019t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry\u2019s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were \u201ca number of misunderstandings\u201d around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm\u2014which was one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round\u2014had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to \u201cmake changes\u201d to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren\u2019t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm\u2019s behalf to try and advocate for \u201cbest practices\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Evaluating Blast\u2019s Rapid Ascent and Emerging Challenges in DeFi\n\nBlast, a Layer 2 Ethereum solution, achieves a notable milestone with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $300 million.\n\nThe platform\u2019s rapid growth is marked by its unique yield generation model, but faces significant challenges in governance, security, and liquidity.\n\nRegulatory uncertainties and potential technical vulnerabilities in Blast\u2019s architecture present further complexities in its development.\n\nAs the decentralized finance (DeFi) market continues to grow, Blast, a new entrant in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) solutions, has recently garnered attention by reaching a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $300 million. This feat marks a significant step in the Ethereum ecosystem, showcasing the growing interest in L2 solutions.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nWhat Sets Blast Apart?\n\nBlast sets itself apart not only with its speed and efficiency but also through its unique design, which incentivizes user participation. Users can earn yields on transferred ether and accumulate BLAST points, which are part of a reward program. This design has contributed significantly to the platform\u2019s attractiveness and rapid accumulation of funds\u200b.\n\nDespite this impressive growth, Blast faces significant challenges, including concerns about opaque governance and restrictions on withdrawals. The platform is currently in an invite-only status, and the mainnet launch is scheduled for February 2024, meaning withdrawals or on-chain activities are restricted until then\u200b\u200b. Over $19 million in ether has been staked on Lido through Blast, and another $3 million is allocated to Maker, highlighting the platform\u2019s diverse investment strategies\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe project, spearheaded by @PacmanBlur, co-founder of the NFT marketplace Blur, aims to extend the Blur ecosystem. This expansion not only provides users with the opportunity to earn yields on idle assets but also focuses on enhancing the technical infrastructure necessary for sophisticated NFT products\u200b\u200b. The positive market response, including a 12% surge in BLUR prices following Blast\u2019s launch, indicates significant investor interest\u200b\u200b.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nOpaque Governance Structure for Blast Adds Complexities\n\nThe governance structure of Blast also adds another layer of complexity. Control over the platform is vested in a multi-sig contract managed by five anonymous signers. This lack of transparency in governance raises concerns about accountability and trust, particularly in a market where user confidence is critical. Moreover, the absence of features such as a testnet, transaction capabilities, bridges, rollbacks, and sending transaction data to Ethereum further complicates the scenario.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Blast\u2019s architecture has been scrutinized for potential security vulnerabilities. Concerns have been raised about the \u201cenable transition\u201d function and the \u201cmainnetBridge\u201d contract, which, in theory, could allow unrestricted access to all staked ETH and DAI. This presents a significant threat to the security of investors\u2019 assets.\n\nBlast Gets Institutional Interest, Ranks High Among Other L2 Solutions\n\nThe regulatory aspect of Blast and similar projects have also been a topic of discussion among legal experts. The crypto sector has long grappled with the inconsistent application of securities laws. Legal figures have expressed concerns over the disparity in the treatment of various crypto projects, particularly those that might be perceived as publicly marketing securities, including in the U.S. While these concerns do not directly reference Blast, they highlight the challenges in navigating the regulatory landscape for emerging DeFi solutions.\n\nDespite these challenges, the introduction of Blast\u2019s native yield model and its significant achievement in TVL signify a notable advancement in the Layer 2 space. The project, supported by a $20 million investment from entities like Paradigm and Standard Crypto, now ranks sixth among Layer 2 solutions by TVL.\n\nMarc Zeller from Aave has commented on Blast\u2019s situation, noting the significant amount of TVL in Blast\u2019s multisig compared to other ecosystems. His observations underscore the impact of Blast on the broader crypto market, while also hinting at potential issues within the space.\n\nAs Blast navigates rapid growth amidst these emerging challenges, it serves as an example of the broader DeFi landscape\u2014highlighting opportunities for innovation and growth while also emphasizing the need for careful consideration of the associated risks and regulatory uncertainties. This dual aspect of opportunity and challenge in the world of DeFi and cryptocurrency remains a pivotal theme as the market continues to evolve.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of IOG and Cardano, billionaire Charles Hoskinson, who took part in the creation of Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and several other individuals, has commented on Buterin's recent ideas about how to improve the centralized Ethereum staking. Cardano founder's comment about Buterin's ideas was pretty sarcastic, though.\n\nButerin wants to redesign Ethereum staking, Hoskinson reacts\n\nIn a recent interview of Vitalik Buterin in Turkey, where he answered questions from the local community, he talked about the Ethereum road map. In particular, Buterin touched on the topic of Ethereum staking as he said that \"there is something to be done about staking centralization.\"\n\nIn particular, he mentioned current issues with multiple staking pools and \"solo staking being hard,\" summarizing that these issues and others about it are \"not really healthy.\" Buterin is considering introducing a redesign to the staking system on his blockchain. As one of the possible solutions here, the Ethereum frontman is considering the UTxO approach, which is based on unspent transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson's sarcastic reaction to that was, \"No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Buterin has spoken about the need to redesign the staking system of Ethereum. Earlier this year, Hoskinson and the Cardano army have several times criticized him for admitting certain inconveniences that the staking system adopted by Ethereum bears and slammed Buterin for considering introducing features that Cardano had implemented already to make ADA staking easier for its users.\n\nWhales stocking up on ETH in big way\n\nAccording to prominent whale transactions tracking platform Whale Alert, over the past 30 hours, several massive chunks of Ethereum have been withdrawn from three major crypto exchanges: Bitfinex, Binance and Coincheck.\n\nAnonymous whales have removed 50,000 ETH, 15,000 and 33,330 ETH from these platforms to their cold wallets, respectively. These lumps of Ethereum are evaluated at a massive $105,740,324, $31,138,359 and $68,795,390.\n\nBesides, another anonymous wallet withdrew 1,498 ETH worth $3.13 million earlier today from Binance, while ETH traded at $2,089. Per @OnchainDataNerd blockchain sleuth account, within the past couple of days, this whale has accumulated 4,770 ETH in total, paying $2,079 per coin on average.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that currently, whales are going on a big Ethereum buying spree. He shared a chart showing that within the last nine days, big ETH holders have been accumulating large amounts of ETH for the first time in the past nine months. He considers this to be a bullish signal for the second-largest crypto."

        "content": "A new player has entered the crypto scene with enticing features and good potential. That player is Meme Moguls (MGLS). The token which is just in the presale stage has surpassed the performance of great giants like Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shows Sell Signal, Says Ali Martinez\n\nEthereum (ETH) started this week on a bullish note rising above the $2,000 mark as high as $2,128. Unfortunately, Ethereum\u2019s price has dipped to $2,000. Currently, various indicators suggest the likelihood of further declines in the coming days.\n\nEven crypto traders like Ali Martinez share this opinion. According to Ali, Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTD Sequential\u201d indicator is signaling a sell on the three-day Ethereum price chart. This comes as the asset tests a significant resistance range ranging from $2,000 to $2,150.\n\nThe analyst pointed at a possible price dump to $1,700. Currently, the price of Ethereum is showing mixed sentiment. It had dropped 2% on the daily chart while holding on to gains of 6.5% and 27.3% on the weekly and monthly Ethereum chart.\n\nRipple (XRP) Loses Gains After Recent XRP ETF Rumour\n\nRipple holders\u2019 positive outlook has grown immensely since Ripple\u2019s partial win against the US SEC in July. Ripple\u2019s price increased by over 80% and reached the $0.8 level. Unfortunately, the bearish market led to high selling pressure as Ripple cryptocurrency lost its gains.\n\nThe Ripple crypto dropped as low as $0.5 before picking pace during the Uptober market rally. So far, Ripple coin\u2019s November performance has been poor compared to other cryptocurrencies. Per CoinMarketCap, Ripple XRP price has dipped 3.4% to $0.6387.\n\nBoth its market cap and trading volume have dropped significantly, due to the recent fake BlackRock XRP ETF Trust filing. Still, Ripple\u2019s technical indicators point towards a price recovery in the coming months to the $0.7 region.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS), Bringing New Utility To the Meme Coin Sector\n\nWhile Ethereum and XRP are losing gains, meme coins continue to take over the crypto space. The meme-based asset industry has gained significant recognition in recent years. According to Statistics, the meme coin sector has a market capitalization of over $17.5 billion.\n\nThe interesting part is that these meme coins have little to no utility. In response to this, Meme Moguls has emerged as a solution, as it seeks to launch a meme-backed stock market. The project\u2019s objective is to unite the meme industry to foster a community for meme coin enthusiasts.\n\nUsers will gain access to memes-backed assets. The ecosystem will also encompass a wide range of services, all drawing inspiration from memes. A metaverse platform named Mogul Land will be introduced. This will enable meme traders to interact and mine tokens to enhance their returns.\n\nAnalysts have predicted significant growth for the MGLS token. Currently, Meme lovers have the opportunity to buy MGLS tokens at just $0.0019. Market experts are optimistic about the project and foresee a 1,000% increase in the coming months. Plus, joining the presale gives you a chance to earn up to $10,000 in giveaways at the end of the presale stage.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "title": "BLAST: Ethereum\u2019s new layer-2 with a planned crypto airdrop - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we introduce a new layer-2 of Ethereum that is scheduled to release an airdrop in May 2024: we are talking about Blast, an infrastructure that looks to be the first to offer native yield for crypto such as ETH and stablecoin.\n\nTo date, the chain has not yet been launched and it is, in fact, impossible to bridging funds within it.\n\nHowever, we can deposit ETH in a multi-signature wallet that will, on the one hand, guarantee us a yield from here to the coming months, and on the other hand, give us the opportunity to participate in airdrop.\n\nParadigm and Standard Crypto, two well-known investment signatures in the crypto world, have funded the project with $20 million given its potential that could completely revolutionize the Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what it is all about and find out how to get airdrop.\n\nBLAST: Ethereum\u2019s first layer-2 offering native yield of ETH and stablecoin\n\nBlast is a new layer-2 ZK from Ethereum of the optimistic rollup type, which promises its users yields that beat dollar inflation simply by holding tokens on the crypto network, as well as offering an airdrop-style rewards campaign.\n\nIn detail, Blast presents itself as the first compatible EVM infrastructure capable of granting native ETH and stablecoin yields.\n\nBasically, those who hold a balance of these cryptos within the L2 passively get interest that is generated by going to Lido staking and MakerDAO, in a fully automated way and without the need for external actions.\n\nIt should also be noted that the project team has planned to donate the entire proceeds of fees recorded on the chain to all decentralized application developers, so as to incentivize the development of successful products.\n\nAt this time the chain is still under development, with the mainnet being launched in February and airdrops being unlocked about 2 months later.\n\nFor now, one cannot in fact bridging crypto within it but only deposit ETH and other stables at a multi-signature wallet that is a real safe for early adopters of the project.\n\nThere appears to be no testnet or mainnet readiness phases.\n\nWell-known crypto investment signatures Paradigm and Standard Crypto have been personally present at Blast\u2019s funding, leading a $20 million round.\n\nOther companies and private entities participated in the development of the project: these include names such as eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, and Jeff Lo.\n\nGiven the presence of major players on this list, who have funded infrastructure that has released voluminous airdrops in the past, we expect the same to happen for Blast.\n\nOn the other hand, the names of the team for the new rollup are not yet known: all we know is that they come from prestigious institutions such as the FAANG, Yale, MIT, Nanyang Technological University, Seoul National University, and that they have worked for some popular web3 and DeFi protocols particularly active on Ethereum and Solana.\n\nThe premise for Blast seems to be respectable: given the backgound of the project and the next-generation architecture of the chain we could easily see this layer-2 compete with the major players in the cryptographic industry in the coming years.\n\nLet us not forget, however, that to date Blast has created NOTHING yet: being too optimistic about a premature product could turn out to be a completely wrong approach such that it leads to an overstated interpretation of reality.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nHow to participate in BLAST\u2019s crypto airdrop\n\nTo participate in Blast\u2019s crypto airdrop, the first thing to do is to retrieve an invitation code because access to the platform in its \u201cearly access\u201d phase is limited.\n\nThe easiest way to find one is to search for it on X by selecting the keywords \u201cBlast code\u201d in the search bar and scrolling through the various user posts and browsing through the comments.\n\nThere are many invitation codes available because to maximize airdrop, the community tries to invite as many users as possible to join their \u201cteam.\u201d\n\nOnce we get a valid code, all we have to do is deposit ETH, stETH or stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, USDT.\n\nBe careful because these funds will remain locked until February 2024, at which time the Blast mainnet will be realized.\n\nIn return we will get an annualized yield of about 4-5%, as well as points that will entitle us to collect airdrop.\n\nThe rewards program is organized in the same style as Friend.Tech, which includes gamified elements within it to provide a \u201cfun\u201d investment experience.\n\nIf you plan to lock your funds into Blast to participate in the airdrop, the advice is to deposit crypto worth at least $1,000.\n\nIn just 48 hours since its launch, this platform has raised about $230 million from a total of more than 37,000 users. Understand for yourself that the competition here is very high, hence allocating a few hundred dollars to the project may not bring the desired results.\n\nThen consider that just for fees on Ethereum we will spend a minimum of $15-20 between deposit and withdrawal.\n\nImmediately after making your first deposit you can start sharing your invitation code within the network of contacts you are part of (before depositing you do not get an invitation code).\n\nThe more crypto deposited by individuals who sign up with your code, the more points you can get and consequently the larger the final airdrop.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, share codes initially only with those you know have the financial readiness to deposit substantial amounts of ETH or stablecoin ( codes only limited at first).\n\nAs you move forward with your score you will reach a level where you can share your code endlessly, and hence only at that point will it become a wise idea to spam it everywhere on all existing social media.\n\nTo get to that point your team (you and everyone you invited) will have to deposit at least 20 ETH. You can view your progress through a dedicated airdrop leaderboard.\n\nThe logic of the invitations follows somewhat the same ponzinomics concepts typical of projects that incentivize sharing and engagement among communities.\n\nBlur and other projects also exhibit similar lineaments, where the greater the contribution of your lines the greater your personal gain.\n\nTo be honest, this system does not represent the absolute best system for launching an airdrop and may prove inconvenient for some if you are not part of a close crypto degen community.\n\nAlso, the fact that a multi-signature wallet with 3 out of 5 signatures needed to approve transactions is handling the treasury of deposits does not reassure and still raises many questions about what to do.\n\nIn any case, it is worth mentioning that as backers on Blast there are renowned names who have collaborated on other projects in the past that have released very high value airdrops, sometimes even exceeding $10,000.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that blocking one\u2019s funds for Blast airdrop presents its own not insignificant risks, but at the same time the whole thing could turn out to be extremely profitable in the future."

Since Nov. 21, 2022, they have amassed 30.3% additional coins and now control 52% of Ethereum's circulating supply.\n\nFurthermore, 94,700 new ETH wallets were created on Nov. 21, the largest number since July.\n\nETH was down 1.22% in the last 24 hours to $2,076 at the time of writing. On Nov. 24, bulls drove the price of Ethereum to a high of $2,134 before falling. If this level is breached, ETH might begin a northward march toward $2,200, perhaps opening the door for a rise to $3,400.\n\nThis optimistic outlook will be rendered meaningless in the near term if the price falls below the critical support level of $1,900.\n\nEthereum Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum developer Tim Beiko shared a brief recap of the ACDE call held earlier this week. Developers have agreed to launch Devnet 12 next week, given that Devnet 11 is mostly stable, except for a minor peering issue between ETHJS and Lodestar.\n\nDevelopers also decided that once Dencun is live on Goerli, all client teams and EF DevOps will shut down their validators three months after Goerli or one month after the mainnet has been upgraded.\n\nWhile anybody can run a validator on Goerli, no one can \"sunset\" the network; validators account for the large bulk of the stake and have historically been the most dependable."

        "title": "How to transfer cryptocurrencies from Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains: native bridge and external protocols - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we look at how to transfer crypto assets from the Polygon ZkEVM network, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solution, to other blockchains using the native bridge platform and other third-party applications.\n\nNative bridging involves depositing ETH or other cryptocurrencies compulsorily from the Ethereum network to the Polygon rollup network.\n\nWith external protocols, on the other hand, we can freely go through other chains performing transactions almost always faster and cheaper, but at the cost of less data security.\n\nThe latter, in fact, add increased counterparty risk because we are going to entrust an entity not controlled by Polygon with the task of transferring assets from one network to another.\n\nHence, which is the best option to choose? Let\u2019s look at it below.\n\nWhat is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is an Ethereum layer-2 of the ZK-rollup type that offers fast, cheap and secure transactions.\n\nZero-knowledge technology is combined with the robustness of Ethereum to achieve a highly efficient network with a focus on stability and EVM compatibility.\n\nTransactions executed on the zk network pass through Ethereum, but are confirmed off-chain to allow high throughput at low cost.\n\nDevelopers of protocols built on the Polygon-branded layer-2 have an advantage over the rest of the blockchain landscape because they can boast of the Ethereum virtual machine compatibility factor that allows for maximum interoperability between parties.\n\nOn the bridge front, this factor allows users to easily transfer assets from one chain to another without special arrangements. The same goes for those who want to migrate their dapp without having to entirely rewrite the code with different languages.\n\nThe cryptographic asset used as a gas token in the network is currently ETH, but not in the future this privilege is expected to pass to POL (ex-MATIC) upon completion of its integration process.\n\nThe Polygon ZkEVM infrastructure was launched in March 2023 and can already count on a locked-in value within it of about $100 million.\n\nThe next-generation chain was created with the intention of meeting the growing demand for decentralized applications and users in the Web3 world, and it has already achieved its small success by ranking within the top10 rollups for TVL according to L2Beat.\n\nIf you would like to discuss this further, all of Polygon ZKEVM\u2019s core principles and the ecosystem roadmap version 2.0 roadmap were published in a recent Polygon Labs blog post\n\n1/ Our vision for Polygon is simple: to build the Value Layer of the Internet.\n\n\n\nThe Internet allows anyone to create and exchange information. The Value Layer allows anyone to create, exchange, and program value.\n\n\n\nEnter Polygon 2.0: a blueprint to build the ultimate Value Layer. pic.twitter.com/9eYSr3H1L5 \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) June 12, 2023\n\nPolygon Bridge: native cross-chain transfer between Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains\n\nThe first way to transfer crypto from Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains is to use the decentralized infrastructure\u2019s native bridge.\n\nIn fact, the Polygon team has provided its own platform to allow users to deposit ETH and other assets within the new network, without going through external applications.\n\nAs anticipated, the native bridge only supports the Ethereum blockchain and hence only allows cross-chain operations of ERC-20 tokens, such as ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI, MATIC, AAVE, LINK, WBTC, etc.\n\nAll this results in significantly above-average fees and waiting time costs compared to other more scalable L2s and L1s.\n\nIn any case, this is the safest and most efficient solution to land on the Polygon ZkEVM and the one definitely to be preferred in case large volumes move.\n\nThe Polygon Bridge is available from this site: to use it simply connect your non-custodial wallet (Metamask, TrustWallet, Zerion, Rainbow), select the token you want to transfer, select the quantity and click on \u201cstart bridging.\u201d\n\nThe transaction requires confirmation of the smart contract and payment of a fee of about $10-12 according to current gas prices on Ethereum.\n\nTo withdraw funds from the ZK network, the process is essentially the same, with the only catch being that the networks must be reversed for transfer using the appropriate symbol in the center of the bridge.\n\nOther third-party bridges\n\nAs mentioned, there are also several third-party bridges that serve as alternative platforms for moving our crypto to and from the Polygon ZkEVM network.\n\nThese bridges offer the ability to go through different infrastructures choosing the one most convenient for our operation, often paying lower fees and with minimal waiting times.\n\nHence, unlike the Polygon Bridge, here we can enjoy the wide choice offered by the blockchain landscape such as Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Starknet, ZkSync, Linea, Immutable, Polygon chain, Avalanche, Base, and many others.\n\nOf course, this advantage is offset with a downside: all these third-party services in fact, although they are a faster and more immediate option in cross-chain exchanges, present far higher structural risks than native bridges.\n\nBy using them you are automatically going to entrust your assets to services that have nothing to do with Polygon and Ethereum, and that may have flaws on the security front. You are essentially going to increase counterparty risk.\n\nPeople usually choose these more flexible solutions when they want to bridging small amounts .\n\nAmong the most well-known and reliable third-party protocols in this field are Orbiter Finance, Layerswap, XY Finance, and Celer Bridge.\n\nEach has small peculiarities such as supporting a specific chain, allowing transfers with a particular token, or integrating support for transfers from CEX.\n\nEither way, they all work similarly to the native bridge: to use you then need to connect your wallet, select a coin to transfer, type in the amount, and click the button to start the transaction\n\nYou can find references to these platforms, and other niche services, directly on the Polygon Bridge page under \u201cThird.Party Bridges.\u201d"

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano network and former Ethereum developer, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his view on Ethereum\u2019s approach to blockchain innovations that the Cardano team is already developing.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn November 24, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was interviewed by DeFi and NFT platform Defiant in Turkey, where he discussed the Ethereum roadmap and proposed redesigning Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) staking system to promote healthier mining and staking pools, thereby enhancing decentralization.\n\nDuring the interview, Buterin talked about adopting the UTXO approach, which relies on unspent transactions to address the network\u2019s challenges. Notably, this model is different from Ethereum\u2019s current account-based system and is used by some blockchains, such as Cardano and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is UTXO?\n\nThe Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed. This model provides users with enhanced control over their financial transactions, especially crucial for issues like preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nBy allowing users to specify and understand exactly who they are receiving funds from, the UTXO model aims to bring a higher degree of traceability and security to financial transactions, a level of control and transparency that is increasingly important in our digital age.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s and Community Response\n\nIn response to Buterin\u2019s interview, the crypto community pointed out that this solution is similar to the approach Cardano has already taken with its staking system. Hoskinson also responded to the interview by tweeting a notably sarcastic remark. He wrote:\n\n\u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d\n\nUpon seeing Hoskinson\u2019s tweet, a user in the community criticized him saying he was \u201cfueling hostilities\u201d. The Cardano founder replied that his tweet bore no negative feelings but rather an expression of his confusion. He added:\n\n\u201cI am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over team E. V is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation.\u201d\n\nHoskinson\u2019s recent criticism of Ethereum\u2019s staking system is not the first. Earlier this year, he stated that he was at a \u201closs for words\u2019 regarding a statement by Buterin on ETH staking."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market begins to show signs of a new bull run, investors should look for opportunities to position themselves advantageously. This current positivity in the crypto market signals a pivotal moment for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. Here are 5 altcoins to consider for the long term. While some altcoins with 100x potential might be risky, the below presents more established projects.\n\nWhat Are Altcoins?\n\nAltcoins, short for \u201calternative coins,\u201d refer to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They have emerged as a significant sector within the cryptocurrency market, offering diverse functionalities ranging from smart contracts and decentralized applications (like Ethereum) to the more recent meme-inspired coins such as Dogecoin and ApeMax. Altcoins are not just about creating digital currencies; they often aim to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin or explore new possibilities with blockchain technology.\n\nAre Altcoins Good to Buy?\n\nInvesting in altcoins can be a strategic addition to any investment portfolio. The reason is their potential for high returns. While they carry higher risks compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the potential rewards can be substantial. Some altcoins have been known to yield returns exceeding 100x, especially if invested in at the right time. This high-reward potential makes them an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nCan Altcoins Really Deliver 100x Returns?\n\nThe possibility of achieving over 100x returns with altcoins is a topic of much interest among investors. While such high returns are not guaranteed and come with significant risk, the timing of the investment plays a crucial role. Investing in altcoins during their early stages or before a predicted bull run in the crypto market can potentially lead to substantial gains. However, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved.\n\nWhere to Buy Altcoins \u2013 Good Crypto Exchange\n\nFor those interested in purchasing altcoins, various platforms offer access to these cryptocurrencies. Bitget stands out as a reliable option. It provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced traders to navigate and make transactions. To get started with Bitget, you need to create an account, complete the necessary KYC procedures, and then you can begin trading a variety of altcoins available on the platform."
