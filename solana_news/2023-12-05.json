        "content": "The latest episode of \u2018Family Guy', the animated sitcom, features a mention of Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Season 22, episode 8 shows Meg Griffin receiving therapy, only to be told by her therapist that payment must be in either Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Ethereum.\n\nThe episode portrays the therapist in a state of panic, both accepting and refusing Ethereum and urging immediate payment due to the volatile market with the line. \u201cNot Ethereum\u2014Wait, wait, no, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t anymore.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that prominent gaming influencer FaZe Banks loves crypto. Now, he\u2019s buying more.\n\nRichard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson is the CEO and co-founder of esports organization and lifestyle brand FaZe Clan. The gamer took to Instagram this week to report his latest crypto purchases and double down on his pro-crypto stance amidst a broader gaming industry where crypto remains a controversial topic.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be my typical normie homie and call me asking for plays a year from now when the mainstream media and your mom [are] talking about crypto again,\u201d Banks urged his 2.8 million Instagram followers Tuesday along with a note of Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,300, a yearly high.\n\n\u201cExpose yourself now,\u201d Banks continued in a post evangelizing crypto and arguing that potential buyers should look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBTC is the safest, ETH is about as safe with slightly more upside in my opinion. My personal favorite. A large percentage of my net worth is in Ethereum,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that in his view, Solana is the \u201criskiest\u201d of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cMy money is definitely where my mouth is on this one. Buy it and leave it alone. Chill,\u201d he added.\n\nLike many financial assets and purchases, though, it\u2019s important to note that buying or trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk\u2014and fans should be careful not to take financial advice from influencers or celebrities they follow online. It's often not clear what an influencers motivations may be in promoting a cryptocurrency, NFT project, or any financial asset.\n\nBanks also claimed that he recently spent $200,000 on four altcoins: Prime, Pepe, Mog, and Clouds, the last of which has not yet been officially released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrime is the sci-fi NFT card game Parallel\u2019s official token, Pepe is a frog-inspired meme coin which recently rose to a $666 million market cap, and Mog is a meme coin that\u2019s been swirling on Twitter among fans who have paired it with memes of people and animals wearing a specific pair of colorfully-tinted glasses. Clouds is an upcoming token from the Endless Clouds crypto startup that is developing the Treeverse gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThese are the first real plays I\u2019ve made since the big market crash,\u201d Banks said, who over the summer also hopped onto the \u201cSocialFi\u201d trend and made over $70,000 by signing up for Friend.tech.\n\nBanks did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment on his latest crypto purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that FaZe Clan\u2019s newly-appointed CEO has been in crypto for years now. Back in 2021, Banks was accused of allegedly pumping and dumping an altcoin he promoted, BankSocial.\n\nAnd a quick glimpse at a wallet connected to Banks called \u201cBanksfucks\u201d currently holds some NFTs from Azuki\u2019s collections, two Bored Apes, four Mutant Ape NFTs, a staggering 72 Otherdeed NFTs for Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse game, two Clone X NFTs, and one Doodles NFT, among others. He has also recently boasted of CryptoPunks holdings.\n\nWhile Banks is a crypto and NFT enthusiast, not everyone in FaZe Clan shares this view. The org\u2019s only current female member, Kalei Renay, previously told Decrypt in an interview at TwitchCon that she isn\u2019t a fan of NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs a community, everybody hates NFTs,\u201d FaZe Kalei said of gamers. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, do whatever, but I don\u2019t care for NFTs. I don\u2019t do crypto, I don\u2019t do any of that. I stay so far away from it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Bitcoin price could flip $43,860 into a support floor, bringing the $50,000 psychological level into view.\n\nEthereum price could climb 7% to the $2,500 level as bulls show determination.\n\nRipple price could extend 10% north as bulls make a comeback in the XRP market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains steadfast on the higher timeframe, amid news that spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) discussions are now at the technical stage of approval. Specifically, talks with Spot BTC ETF issuers have advanced to key technical details, with Reuters indicating that it could signal a shift toward a potential approval.\n\nAlso Read: This is the level to beat as Bitcoin eyes $50,000 next\n\nBitcoin price could overcome $43,860\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting the $43,860 critical support, marking the midline of a weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A decisive candlestick close above this mean threshold on the weekly timeframe would confirm the continuation of the primary trend, flipping the supply barrier into a bullish breaker and using it as the springboard for a race to the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, indicating momentum continues to rise. Meanwhile, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remain in positive territory, flashing green to show that bulls are leading the BTC market. These bolster the case to the upside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, Bitcoin price could face a rejection, deflecting south to lose the support offered by the $40,000 psychological level. In a worse case, the fall could extend to the $30,000 psychological level, with a weekly candlestick close below this level invalidating the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hits $44,000 as Coinbase CEO speculates BTC could be key to extending Western civilization\n\nEthereum price could climb 7%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action remains bullish since mid-October, consolidating within an ascending parallel channel.

The ensuing selling pressure could see ETH dwindle to lose the $2,147 support.\n\nEthereum price could then extend a leg down, converting the midline of the April 18 supply zone extending from $2,049 to $2,107 from a resistance area into a support area by breaking and closing below its midline at $2,075. A daily candlestick close below this level would not only invalidate the bullish thesis but also confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support"

        "content": "Binance has expanded its free trading options for the spot and margin trading pairs of the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin pairing with six digital assets, including BNB, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, according to a Dec. 5 statement.\n\nBinance users will see zero maker and taker fees for these pairs starting Dec. 8 for an undisclosed period. The exchange explained that the free trading option would exclude these pairs from BNB fee discounts, rebates, and other adjustments.\n\nHowever, the firm stated that it \u201creserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk account registrations, as well as trades that display attributes of self-dealing or market manipulation.\u201d\n\nBinance is actively pushing FDUSD.\n\nThe free transaction promotion is part of Binance\u2019s ongoing efforts to encourage its users to use the FDUSD stablecoin.\n\nLast week, the crypto platform said it would phase out support for Binance USD (BUSD) by Dec. 15. Binance urged users to convert their BUSD holdings into the new stablecoin before the end of the year, saying it would end BUSD withdrawals by Dec. 31 and that BUSD balances would be automatically converted to FDUSD.\n\nBinance\u2019s decision relates to the BUSD stablecoin\u2019s regulatory issues. Earlier in the year, the BUSD issuer, Paxos, suspended the stablecoin issuance following scrutiny from U.S. regulators. At the time, the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which classified the stablecoin as a security.\n\nWhile Binance and Paxos have vehemently rejected this classification, the crypto community promptly deserted the stablecoin, with its circulating supply dropping to less than $2 billion as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nConcurrently, Binance has been heavily pushing FDUSD as a viable alternative, introducing new products for the digital asset and incentivizing its use. However, FDUSD\u2019s circulating supply remains less than 1 billion and is only available on less than five crypto exchanges.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining stocks surging, analysts and even legacy banks like JPMorgan Chase are increasingly bullish on the sector\u2019s prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum-based project Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is nearing $5 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), thanks to the buzz around its innovative Stake-to-Mine model.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Sector \u2013 A Brief Overview\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using specialized computers to solve complex math problems that validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn return, miners earn BTC as a reward \u2013 providing an incentive to continue mining.\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining was possible on regular home computers.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin network has grown, mining has become increasingly competitive, spurring an arms race in mining hardware development.\n\nThe introduction of ASIC mining rigs has enabled industrial-scale Bitcoin mining operations, helping the mining sector balloon to a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by large firms.\n\nAlthough the sector\u2019s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, recent innovations have begun to focus on boosting efficiency in a greener way.\n\nMoreover, these concerns have led to the exploration of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power in BTC mining operations.\n\nAccording to a report from Industry Research Co., the entire crypto-mining market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2028.\n\nAnalysts & JPMorgan Bullish on Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nSeveral analysts, and even huge financial institutions like JPMorgan, are growing increasingly optimistic about the prospects of companies that operate in the crypto mining space.\n\nCleanSpark ($CLSK), in particular, has attracted bullish praise recently.\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan called CleanSpark its \u201ctop pick\u201d among mining stocks, citing its \u201cscale, growth potential, power costs & relative value.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, crypto analyst UltraXBT expressed confidence in CleanSpark at current levels, claiming it\u2019s a \u201c$25 stock that is currently identifying as a $4.50 stock.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ThoughtfulTrade on Twitter noted that a Bitcoin breakout above $46,000 could spur the price of mining stocks like CleanSpark to soar even higher.\n\nWith BTC mining profitability improving due to the crypto market\u2019s recovery, firms like CleanSpark that leverage low-cost power stand to capitalize.\n\nMoreover, the upbeat outlook from JPMorgan and analysts reflects the growing optimism around the Bitcoin mining space in general.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Platform Introduces Innovative Stake-to-Mine Model & Raises $4.8 Million\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining stocks like CleanSpark offer indirect exposure to crypto prices, a new altcoin project called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) aims to reinvent mining rewards through staking.\n\nThe Ethereum-based Stake-to-Mine protocol allows users to earn regular BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than purchasing expensive hardware.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol works by distributing \u201cmining credits\u201d to those who stake BTCMTX, which can be exchanged for cloud mining power.\n\nIn turn, this democratizes access to BTC mining by lowering the barriers to entry \u2013 meaning anyone can get involved.\n\nThe Stake-to-Mine mechanism also enables considerable staking yields, with current APYs exceeding 120%.\n\nUltimately, by reinventing mining rewards and making hash power more accessible, Bitcoin Minetrix has the potential to transform the crypto-mining space.\n\nOn the back of strong interest surrounding its unique value proposition, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team recently launched a presale for BTCMTX.\n\nThe presale aims to raise funds to develop and scale the Stake-to-Mine platform further.\n\nMore than $4.8 million has already been raised from eager investors, with BTCMTX tokens available to buy for $0.012 each.\n\nOnce the presale concludes, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on leading centralized exchanges, enabling seamless trading for speculative investors.\n\nWith strong presale momentum and backing from high-profile names like VoskCoin, BTCMTX seems poised to make a splash when public trading begins.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX), Which Has The Best Utility? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The crypto market is heating up as altcoins are taking turns to pump. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX) are currently being discussed as the next big cryptocurrencies to experience a surge in value. While the former two have been around for a while, Pullix is a new player set to change the trading game. But which among these three alts has the best utility for investors and traders?\n\nPLX Token: Integrating Utility with Pullix\u2019s Trading Innovation\n\nPullix is building a decentralized trading exchange that promises to tackle the common issues experienced by traders, such as high fees, lack of transparency, and slow transaction speeds. The platform will utilize blockchain technology to provide all traders with a secure and decentralized environment.\n\nBlockchain technology enables Pullix to have a transparent and auditable trading system, eliminating the need for middlemen and reducing transaction fees. It also allows users to trade anonymously across all markets, providing traders maximum security and privacy.\n\nPullix directly links its native cryptocurrency to the trading platform\u2019s performance and offers tangible benefits to its users. For example, PLX token holders receive regular passive income payments, access to exclusive rewards, and other benefits depending on the staked amount.\n\nThe token burn mechanism for Pullix\u2019s PLX token aims to stabilize and potentially increase the token\u2019s value. This is achieved by allocating a portion of the platform\u2019s daily profits to purchase and permanently remove (burn) 50% of these tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply.\n\nThe remaining 50% rewards users for staking their PLX, incentivizing long-term holding and active participation in the Pullix ecosystem. This deflationary approach is designed to align the platform\u2019s interests with those of its users and investors.\n\nThis innovative approach makes the PLX token not just a medium of exchange but a key player in the Pullix ecosystem. As Pullix\u2019s trading platform gains popularity, the value of PLX is expected to increase, making it an attractive investment for traders.\n\nAnd with Pullix at the start of its journey, investors can get in early and reap the benefits as the platform gains momentum. Someare already recognizing this opportunity and snapping up PLX tokens for $0.04 before the price rises in subsequent stages.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Backbone of Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum (ETH) has surged from $1,500 to $2,245 in under a month as investors continue to show confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. The $2,100 price mark has acted as resistance since May 2022, and traders expect a huge pump once this level is breached.\n\nEthereum is the cryptocurrency with the most utility in the market. It is not only a store of value but also the foundation for various decentralized applications (DApps). There are lending platforms, games, and even decentralized exchanges built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum faces competition from the likes of Solana and Radix, which offer lower fees and faster speeds. The upcoming EIP-4844 procotol upgrade is expected to solve the scalability issue, helping Ethereum maintain its dominance as the number one platform for DApps.\n\nInstitutional investors are now taking notice of Ethereum, with spot Ethereum ETF applications sent to the SEC for approval. Should these be approved, we could see an influx of institutional funds into the market, leading Ethereum to the coveted $10,000 price point.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\u2019s Potential New Use Case\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) took the crypto world by storm in early 2021 as Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 tweeted favorably about the memecoin. While Dogecoin has no real utility, it has a strong community, making it a popular choice for sending low-cost transactions.\n\nHowever, Dogecoin may soon have another use case \u2014 as an accepted currency on X (Twitter) for tipping. Elon Musk still has the Dogecoin logo in his Twitter bio and hinted that this integration could be coming soon.\n\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine Mission One is set to carry a physical Dogecoin token to the moon, marking a symbolic journey for Dogecoin. This move could garner more attention from mainstream media and potentially lead to retail investors flocking to buy Dogecoin as FOMO sets in.\n\nThe Dogecoin chart shows that there have been numerous attempts to break the $0.10 \u2013 $0.11 resistance area. A successful close above this level can open up room for further upsides, potentially seeing Dogecoin reach $0.20 during Q1 of 2024.\n\nFor more information about Pullix, visit the links below:\n\nSite: https://pullix.io/\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/pullixmarkets\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ether vs Ethereum: The Key Behind Crypto Development - INDODAX",
        "content": "In discussions about the world of crypto assets, the role of Ether (ETH) and blockchain platform, Ethereum is very important and needs to be understood. Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes computer programs known as smart contracts.\n\nIt has a native crypto asset called Ether (ETH), which is the crypto asset with the second largest market capitalization after Bitcoin. However, Ether is a crypto asset and a \u201cgas fee,\u201d enabling various decentralized transactions and applications or Decentralized Applications (dApps) to operate within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs a blockchain platform, Ethereum is known to have created the foundation for major innovation in the crypto world. By understanding the differences and relationships between Ether and Ethereum, we can avoid any misunderstandings that may arise. This means that Ether is not just a digital coin but also a key element that drives the economy on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSo, to understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether, see the complete review below!\n\nWhat is Ether (ETH)?\n\nIt is important to know that the Ethereum blockchain is one of the oldest and most widely used blockchain networks. Ether, which functions as a gas fee, has become one of the leading cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin in terms of market value.\n\nAs explained at the beginning of this article, Ether is a native coin or native asset used in the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate transactions throughout its ecosystem. Every transaction in the Ethereum ecosystem requires payment of a computing fee (gas fee) to the miners who carry out the transaction computation. This payment is made using Ether.\n\nThese gas fees increase with the computational complexity required. For example, the shipping costs of ERC-20 tokens are higher than sending ETH because sending ERC-20 tokens uses interaction and computing on smart contracts while sending ETH does not involve such a process.\n\nETH has various uses as a digital asset and for carrying out various transactions in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Please note that Ethereum has become one of the most widely used blockchain platforms for building dApps, along with its ability to support more programs than Bitcoin.\n\nAs a crypto asset, ETH has an important role as gas fees are paid to run computations on various applications developed on the Ethereum platform. This makes ETH one of the second largest crypto assets after Bitcoin when viewed from market value.\n\nWhen it was first traded, the value of one Ethereum coin was around $2.83 or around IDR 41,035. However, in June 2021, the price of ETH jumped to $2,578 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 36,822,218. ETH\u2019s highest price peak occurred in November 2021, reaching $4,620. However, in December 2022, the price of Ethereum will decrease to $1,225 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 19,264,748.\n\nSo, if you are interested in buying ETH, you can purchase through a trusted crypto buying and selling application, namely INDODAX. As a platform, INDODAX has been officially registered as a Physical Crypto Asset Trader under the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (BAPPEBTI) so that security is guaranteed. You can download the INDODAX application to buy ETH.\n\nThe Role of Ether in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIt is important to understand that Ether (ETH) is important in the Ethereum ecosystem and is used for various purposes on the network. One of Ether\u2019s main roles in the Ethereum ecosystem is as a digital asset.\n\nInitially, Ether was created as a digital asset for use on the Ethereum network. Most transactions and smart contracts are carried out using Ether. In this case, users can send and receive Ether within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEther\u2019s other main role is to pay transaction fees. Every time someone sends Ether or performs a function within a smart contract, they have to pay a transaction fee. These fees are known as \u201cgas,\u201d which is necessary to ensure that the Ethereum network runs efficiently and prevents network abuse.\n\nThe gas is a unit of measurement for measuring how much computing power is needed to complete a task on the Ethereum network. Smart contract transactions/execution require gas, and transaction fees are calculated based on the amount of gas used.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining network security. Miners who process transactions and secure the network will receive rewards in the form of Ether for their efforts. This also provides incentives for miners to maintain network reliability and security.\n\nApart from that, Ether is also used as a store of value in the network\u2019s decision-making process to create tokens and to run smart contracts on the Ethereum network. For example, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are often created using Ether as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out smart contracts.\n\nEthereum Ecosystem: Beyond Ether\n\nAs previously explained, smart contract technology on Ethereum drives new innovations in financial transactions. The following are several examples of smart contract implementation that are currently underway including:\n\n1. Stablecoins\n\nCrypto asset prices are often very volatile. Stablecoins , which utilizes smart contract technology, also solves this problem. The value of stablecoins is held to the value of non-digital assets, such as the rupiah and US dollar, to maintain their stability.\n\nSome well-known stablecoins maintain stability by guaranteeing a 1:1 rate with the original currency and being convertible to that currency. For example, Rupiah Token (IDRT), a crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain, has a value equivalent to the rupiah. IDRT creates a digital representation of rupiah by generating tokens in proportion to the amount of rupiah deposited by the user and sending them to the user\u2019s Ethereum wallet.\n\nApart from IDRT, another example of a stablecoin, namely USD Coin (USDC), is designed to have the same value as the US dollar. The existence of stablecoins makes it easier for users to transfer value to various places around the world in a short time. Stablecoins also provide the stability needed in the crypto ecosystem and connect traditional financial infrastructure with the blockchain world.\n\n2. Borrow and Borrow on Ethereum\n\nSmart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain also enables the development of crypto asset lending and lending applications. For example, AAVE and Compound are decentralized lending and lending Apps (dApps) based in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith AAVE and Compound, users can deposit crypto assets to earn interest or borrow other crypto assets. Using these two applications requires an Ethereum wallet and a certain amount of funds in the form of ETH or ERC-20 tokens. With AAVE and Compound, anyone can be involved in asset lending and lending activities without relying on banks or traditional financial institutions.\n\n3. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are applications that facilitate token exchange using smart contract technology. One example of a very popular DEX built on Ethereum is Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n\nThrough DEXs, users can exchange ETH for ERC-20 tokens or vice versa and exchange between ERC-20 tokens. As long as it follows the ERC-20 token standard, various types of tokens can be exchanged using DEXs.\n\nThe Connection Between the Two\n\nEther (ETH) and Ethereum are interrelated concepts, but they have different roles in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain platform allowing developers to create and run dApps. On the other hand, Ether is a crypto asset used on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember that Ethereum is designed to support smart contracts, programming codes that can execute certain tasks when specified conditions are met. Ether is used as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out these operations, including executing smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is also used as an incentive for miners (or validators in the context of Ethereum 2.0), which helps keep the network decentralized and secure. Miners will receive Ether in exchange for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nEther is also used as a digital asset to carry out transactions within the Ethereum network. Every time someone sends Ether, it automatically reflects a transfer of value within the Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, when someone runs or interacts with smart contracts, he must pay transaction fees in the form of Ether. This helps prevent network abuse and ensures that people who use network resources pay for that use.\n\nEthereum and Ether complement each other. Ether itself is essential to maintaining the functionality of the Ethereum network. Without Ether, executing transactions, implementing smart contracts, or ensuring network security would be impossible. The existence of Ether itself supports the Ethereum ecosystem by providing incentives for developers to create decentralized applications and for miners (validators) to keep the network safe and decentralized.\n\nHistory and Evolution\n\nThe history of Ether and Ethereum is known to have reflected a long journey towards the development of blockchain technology and the growth of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Referring to its history, Ethereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. It was an evolution of the idea to expand Bitcoin\u2019s functionality by enabling smart contracts.\n\nThe funding for Ethereum development was obtained through an initial public offering (ICO) in 2014, where Ether (ETH) was first sold to investors. Furthermore, Ethereum was launched on July 30, 2015, with the launch of the first block, or \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d\n\nAs time passes, Ethereum 2.0 aims to move away from consensus Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which began to be developed to increase network scalability and efficiency. The first phases of Ethereum 2.0 are launched, and the transition towards PoS begins.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Ethereum as a new blockchain platform and raising funds through ICOs is known to have played an important role in forming the modern crypto ecosystem. One of the important events that shaped their role in the crypto industry was when an attack occurred on Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO). In 2016, an attack on the DAO on Ethereum led to a massive theft of Ether.\n\nTo overcome the consequences of the DAO attack, the Ethereum community decided to carry out a hard fork, then created Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate blockchain chains. Ultimately, efforts to improve network performance and security through Ethereum 2.0 and the transition to PoS are important steps in Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nThe Importance of Maintaining Both\n\nIt should be emphasized that Ether is the driving force in the Ethereum ecosystem. By maintaining its sustainability, Ether continues to support the execution of transactions and smart contracts on the network. This is important for maintaining blockchain functionality and allowing various decentralized applications to run. Apart from that, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining the resilience of the Ethereum network. Through incentives for miners (or validators in Ethereum 2.0), Ether ensures that the network remains secure, distributed, and resistant to attacks.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum powered by Ether also plays a key role in driving innovation in Decentralized Finance(DeFi). Ether\u2019s sustainability supports liquidity, collateral, and smart contract functionality that is the foundation for various DeFi projects, from loans to exchanges to other protocols.\n\nEthereum, which can run smart contracts, is known to have paved the way for various use cases, including finance, logistics, digital identity, and many others. Therefore, maintaining Ether is key to ensuring that innovation continues to develop in various sectors. On the other hand, Ethereum has also become the main platform for DeFi projects. The growth of DeFi is also one of the main factors driving wider crypto adoption, as it provides a decentralized alternative to traditional financial services.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Ether and Ethereum play an important role in forming and maintaining the crypto ecosystem. Ether\u2019s sustainability supports transactions, network security, and innovation within Ethereum, while Ethereum, as a platform, continues to drive the growth and broader adoption of blockchain technology. Both are interdependent and play an important role in driving the evolution of the global crypto ecosystem.\n\nRecent Trends and Future Projections\n\nThe latest trends in Ether and Ethereum can be seen from the development of Ethereum 2.0 and PoS. Development of Ethereum 2.0 itself continues, with a focus on implementing PoS to increase network efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, the DeFi sector continues to be a major trend within the Ethereum ecosystem, with the growth of projects such as lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity mining.\n\nThen, there are also Layer-2 scalability solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, which gained popularity to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges, enabling faster transactions and lower fees. Meanwhile, regarding future projections for Ether and Ethereum, with the continued development of Ethereum 2.0, future projections involve a swap from PoW to PoS, which is expected to increase network speed and efficiency.\n\nOn the other hand, the DeFi sector is also expected to continue to develop with more innovations, such as introducing more complex financial products, growing lending and borrowing protocols, and cross-chain solutions to increase interoperability. Ultimately, if Ethereum 2.0 successfully addresses scalability and transaction cost issues, then Ethereum will have the potential to play a role in revitalizing the global financial system, opening the door to greater financial inclusion and decentralized financial solutions.\n\nIntegrating blockchain and smart contracts on Ethereum could also bring major benefits to various industries, from supply chains to insurance, with the potential to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.\n\nBuy Ethereum on INDODAX\n\nSo, now you understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether.\n\nNext, if you want to buy Ethereum (ETH), you can do it at INDODAX. The following is a guide to buying Ethereum on INDODAX that you need to know:\n\nFirst, log in to your INDODAX account.\n\nThen, make a deposit (if the balance is still empty).\n\nContinue by visiting the INDODAX market, then search for Ethereum on the INDODAX market.\n\nNext, look for the trade column and enter the desired Ethereum price and balance amount. You can use the Instant method or the Limit method.\n\nAlternatively, you can immediately place a sell order at the price you determine after you have Ethereum. Make sure that the price is profitable.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ether functions as a digital asset within the Ethereum network, allowing transactions and payment of network operational fees (gas). In addition, Ether also provides incentives for miners (or validators) to keep the network secure via PoW or PoS.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum provides a platform for running smart contracts that allow the creation and execution of programming code without third-party intermediation. Ethereum is the basis for a growing DeFi ecosystem and various dApps that create decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services.\n\nUnderstanding Ether and Ethereum is important to understand the functionality and usability of the crypto ecosystem. A deep understanding of Ether and Ethereum is necessary to participate effectively in the crypto ecosystem and recognize the transformational potential they can bring to various sectors and industries in the future."

        "content": "Ita\u00fa Unibanco, the largest private bank in Brazil, has launched its crypto trading service to provide its clients with additional trading options, as reported by Reuters on December 4,\n\nGuto Antunes, Head of Digital Assets at Ita\u00fa, said that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the initial offerings. The bank also plans to add more crypto assets in the future in compliance with the country\u2019s regulatory requirements.\n\nKeypoints\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco, Brazil\u2019s largest private bank, has launched a crypto trading service for Bitcoin and Ethereum. More assets may be added later.\n\nAs a custodian, Ita\u00fa will hold and safekeep customers\u2019 crypto assets. Customers can\u2019t yet deposit/withdraw to external wallets.\n\nIta\u00fa has partnered with other major Brazilian banks on a central bank digital currency initiative called Drex.\n\nCrypto adoption is surging across Latin America, with Brazil as a top global crypto market. This is attracting companies like OKX to expand locally.\n\nBanks globally are exploring tokenization to improve efficiencies. JPMorgan\u2019s JPM Coin processes $1 billion in bank transactions daily, with expectations to reach $10 billion soon.\n\nBrazil Is A Massive Crypto Market\n\nAs a custodian agency, Ita\u00fa Unibanco provides the holding and safekeeping of customers\u2019 crypto assets, in addition to offering exposures to crypto trading. Antunes alternatively noted that customers can\u2019t deposit and withdraw assets to an external wallet at the initial phase.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that when you keep your money in the bank account, you will have the guarantee of Itau\u2019s balance sheet as security for the amounts invested,\u201d Antunes added.\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco has reportedly joined forces with other major institutions like BTG Pactual and Santander Brasil, to facilitate the national digital currency initiative Drex. Established in 2020 and officially launched in 2023, Drex is Brazilian central bank\u2019s project to explore the feasibility of central bank digital currency (CBCD).\n\nOther banks in Brazil like BTG Pactual and Nubank previously introduced their trading platforms that allow customers to diversify their portfolio. Nubank now offers 14 crypto options on its Nubank Cripto platform. The bank had also issued its own token Nucoin to foster loyalty programs and streamline client\u2019s access to digital assets.\n\nLike Nubank, BTG Pactual launched its crypto trading platform Mynt in late 2022. The bank initially focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum with future plans to release additional options for customers.\n\nCrypto adoption is one of the largest trends in Latin America, with Brazil leading the wave. As a top global crypto market, the country has attracted a number of industry figures to expand their local operations, including OKX.\n\nIn November, the crypto firm announced the launch of its crypto exchange integrated with Web3 wallet with exclusive focus on the Brazilian market. There may be more developments coming from the market.\n\nBanks Gear Toward Tokenization\n\nTokenization has become a hot trend among financial and banking institutions. Tokenization can streamline various financial processes, such as payments, settlements, and trade finance.\n\nBanks can potentially reduce the need for intermediaries, minimize transaction times, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The transparency of blockchain technology also contributes to reducing fraud and errors.\n\nJPMorgan announced last week its bank-backed token JPM Coin would be ready for interbank transactions. The blockchain token recently debuted on Partior, a multi-bank system backed by JPMorgan, DBS Bank, Temasek and Standard Chartered. Partior aims to enable quick multi-currency transactions across its members.\n\nAlthough the Singapore-based project is already operational, details about its inner workings and usage numbers remain unclear. According to Ledger Insights, DBS Bank is active on the platform, but other banks have yet to adopt it.\n\nJPMorgan secured a major position, surpassing other US-based banks that still need permission to deploy this solution. This came after the bank received a no-objection letter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for Partior\u2019s use case in May.\n\nThe inclusion of JPM Coin in Partior could potentially boost usage, given the scale and significance of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain token, which has a near-ubiquitous presence in banking markets. In October, Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan\u2019s Global Head of Payments, announced that the token was facilitating transactions worth $1 billion per day.\n\nIn November, Umar Farooq, JPMorgan\u2019s Head of Global Financial Institutions Payments, expressed expectations of these numbers soaring. He claimed that the network could achieve $10 billion in daily transactions within the next year or two."
