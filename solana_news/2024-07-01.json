        "title": "Ethereum Products Face $61M Outflows, While Solana Sees $1.6M Inflows Amid Broader Crypto Market Decline - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investment products as a whole saw outflows of $30 million over the past week, with Ethereum-focused products seeing their largest outflows in nearly two years over the same period after investors moved $61 million off of these products.\n\nThat\u2019s according to CoinShares\u2019 Digital Asset Fund Flows weekly report, which details cryptocurrency investment products saw their third consecutive weekly outflows over the past week, with most product providers seeing minor inflows that were offset by larger outflows from Grayscale.\n\nTrading volumes, the firm\u2019s report adds, rose 43% week-on-week to $6.2 billion, while remaining below the $14.2 billion weekly average seen so far this year. While Bitcoin investment products saw $10 million in weekly inflows, Ethereum-focused products saw massive outflows of $60.7 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum rival Solana saw $1.6 million in inflows, while Litecoin saw $1.4 million and XRP $300,000, below Chainlink\u2019s $600,000 inflows. Products offering exposure to multiple digital assets saw $17.9 million in inflows.\n\nAs report, crypto trading firm GSR has taken a long position on the smart contract platform Solana citing its \u201csuperior technology,\u201d and suggesting its \u201clikely just a matter of time\u201d before Solana gets a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading in the United States.\n\nIn a recently published note GSR highlighted Solana\u2019s features including its Proof-of-History mechanism and its \u201cultra-cheap transaction costs\u201d and \u201cwide array of decentralized applications,\u201d as well as its \u201cbustling user and developer communities.\u201d It touted the release of innovations like token extensions over its technology which the firm said \u201cprovides a sustainable competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nThe firm acknowledged that Solana\u2019s focus on speed and security may come at the expense of some decentralization, but added it believes this trade-off will become less significant as hardware costs decline.\n\nGSR\u2019s bullishness on Solana coincides with a political twist. The firm suggests that former President Trump\u2019s recent support for the cryptocurrency industry, coupled with a potential softening stance from Democrats in a tight election year, could pave the way for a more favorable regulatory environment. This, in turn, could accelerate the approval of spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 report also details that blockchain-related equities suffered outflows of $545 million this year, a figure that represents 19% of assets under management.\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."

        "title": "Lido Takes Initial Step to Decentralize Ethereum Node Operator Set Amid SEC Allegations - Unchained",
        "content": "Monday saw the debut of Lido\u2019s Community Staking Module on the Holesky test network, which aims to allow new entities, including solo stakers, to become node operators without needing permission from its DAO.\n\nLido jumpstarted the liquid staking ecosystem in 2020 by introducing its flagship product, stETH, a rebasing token representing a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nAs it faces allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, liquid staking leader Lido is preparing to become more decentralized by taking a step toward integrating a more diverse set of Ethereum node operators, such as solo stakers, the \u201cgold standard\u201d for staking, per the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nOn Monday, a Lido initiative called Community Staking Module, which is expected to allow permissionless entry for node operators, activated on the Holesky test network, according to a governance post in Lido\u2019s forums by Dmitry Gusakov, the tech leader of Lido\u2019s community staking product.\n\nThe move comes days after the SEC implied in a lawsuit against Ethereum software provider Consensys that Lido\u2019s liquid staking token, stETH, is an unregistered security. Staked ETH, aka stETH, represents a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their staking rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nLido\u2019s stETH has a market cap of $33 billion, making the liquid staking provider the leading DeFi protocol by total value locked. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard by crypto analyst Hildobby, Lido commands a 29% share of the total 33.3 million staked ETH.\n\nThe advent of Lido\u2019s community staking module marks a change to the protocol that first introduced liquid staking in 2020, because Lido on Ethereum has had a curated and permissioned validator set since its inception, in which those interested in acting as a node operator for Lido had to be vetted by the Lido DAO.\n\nPermissioned and Restricted Since Inception\n\nUnlike its competitor Rocket Pool, before a node operator can conduct validator operations for Lido, governance has to vote on whether to include a prospective address into Lido\u2019s active set of node operators. At presstime, Lido has 39 node operators, which includes the likes of P2P.org, Chorus One, and Consensys.\n\nThe initiative centered on permissionless entry allows \u201cany node operator \u2013 and especially community stakers, from solo stakers, to groups of friends, to amateur operators \u2013 to operate validators by providing an ETH-based bond (security collateral),\u201d according to its documentation.\n\nThe new community module is expected to make solo staking more accessible through its inclusion of several features such as a low bond for node operators as well as smoothed rewards from Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and maximum extractable value.\n\nLido becomes less centralized by making its node operator set permissionless. During the lifecycle of a crypto project, a protocol will typically start with heavy elements of centralization, ranging from core developers holding control over the direction of the project, sometimes in the form of fundraising to delaying a protocol\u2019s token generation event that aims to introduce governance mechanisms for those in the community.\n\nEventually, founders and core members of a protocol would introduce decentralization initiatives, such as implementing onchain voting processes or making node operation permissionless such as the case with Lido.\n\nSEC\u2019s Focus on Consensys and Lido\n\nAlthough, like most DeFi projects, Lido has had a roadmap to decentralization for a while, the initiative comes several days after the SEC charged Consensys for offering and selling unregistered securities, namely Lido and Rocket Pool\u2019s liquid staking tokens, through Metamask, a crypto wallet where people can stake and swap cryptocurrencies.\n\nConsensys, which is also a node operator for Lido, \u201chas offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who created and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets,\u201d the SEC\u2019s press release states.\n\nRead More: Could the SEC Have a Case Against Liquid Staking Protocols?\n\nThe complaint calls Lido and Rocket Pool issuers of unregistered securities, alleging that their staking programs \u201care each offered and sold as investment contracts and, therefore, securities.\u201d\n\nFollowing the prongs of the so-called Howey test, which, since a 1946 court case, has been the legal measure to determine whether an investment is a securities offering, the agency said these liquid staking tokens meet the criteria.\n\nIn its press release it said, the buyers of LSTs \u201cmake an investment of ETH in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits from the managerial efforts of Lido and Rocket Pool, respectively.\u201d However, neither Lido nor Rocket Pool has filed registrations to offer these securities with the SEC.\n\nWith the fourth prong of the Howey test being \u201cthe managerial efforts of others,\u201d crypto projects have sought to be decentralized enough that such a third party could not be easily named.\n\nWhen Unchained reached out to the founders and key members of Lido in May for commentary on whether the SEC took action against the liquid staking provider or contacted them about stETH, Unchained did not receive a response. According to a snapshot vote taken in Aug. 2022, Eric Hill, who goes by @Rotorless on X, is Lido\u2019s head of legal and general counsel. However, when Unchained contacted Hill for commentary, he said he did not hold that position anymore and wasn\u2019t \u201cthe right person to talk to.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Consensys, when Unchained highlighted SEC\u2019s claims that stETH is an unregistered security, Lido marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen said, \u201cWe\u2019re on it,\u201d but did not provide additional insights.\n\nLDO, the governance token for Lido, has decreased 6.3% in the past 24 hours and 19.7% over the last 30 days to trade at $1.92, making its market cap stand at $1.7 billion, per CoinGecko.\n\nUPDATE (July 3, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET): Added clarification on the timeline for Lido\u2019s plan to make the process to become a node validator permissionless, as well as the way Lido founders and key members responded to queries about regulatory issues when Unchained reached out to them in May."

        "content": "May marked a historic month for the crypto market after the SEC finally greenlit Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After years of relentless pushback and tireless advocacy from pro-crypto activists, this approval presented a golden opportunity to market Ethereum in ways that have not been previously anticipated.\n\nThe timing of this approval couldn\u2019t be better. It comes at a moment when global financial markets are increasingly open to on-chain investments, such as the $11.7 billion capital inflow to Bitcoin ETFs since January 2024. This article explores how the Ethereum community can leverage these new circumstances to position ETH as a leading global investment vehicle.\n\nETH Enters the Commodity Market\n\nWith the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs, ETH is now effectively recognized as a commodity.

Investment giants like BlackRock and VanEck, which have already established sizable positions in Bitcoin ETFs, are now setting their sights on ETH.\n\nThis week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I\u2019ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we\u2019ve always known it to be. I\u2019m proud to be on team @Coinbase, the trusted partner and custodian for many of the issuers who had 19b-4\u2019s approved tonight. pic.twitter.com/nz1HHFbBSQ \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) May 23, 2024\n\nFresh coverage of these new narratives by mainstream media is primed to catapult Ethereum out of its crypto-native niche. Already, ETH is becoming a mainstay in major business news outlets, even as political leaders like Donald Trump have utilized the Ethereum network to launch projects.\n\nGone are the days when Ethereum market sentiment was determined solely by the attention span of crypto communities. We now face a future where Ethereum will be the subject of wider discussion as more attention settles on ETH as the most exciting crypto commodity.\n\nInvesting in the \"World Computer\"\n\nThe massive capital influx into Bitcoin following the BTC ETF approval on January 11, 2024, set a precedent that Ethereum is certain to follow. While Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, Ethereum offers something uniquely compelling\u2014it powers a decentralized \u201cWorld Computer.\u201d\n\nBitcoin, by design, is primarily a digital currency meant for value exchange. Ethereum, on the other hand, introduced a new era of decentralized and secure networks powered by ETH, the world\u2019s first programmable crypto.\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts have advanced computing technology's capabilities, enabling applications in sectors ranging from encryption and trading to data verification and digital wallets. As I often tell people, \"If fiat was a horse, Bitcoin is a train, and Ethereum is an airplane.\"\n\nIn marketing ETH, the Ethereum community should bring these superior traits to the forefront by emphasizing that it is the real key to unlocking real-world applications of crypto technology.\n\nHunter + Dog S1 are timeless. https://t.co/tJ82Ly5dtW \u2014 CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) May 31, 2024\n\nEthereum Is Reshaping Global Industries\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts are actively reshaping both traditional and digital industries. In finance, Ethereum has pioneered the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which now boasts a market cap of $104.55 billion. We could also discuss how the millennia-old real estate market is being disrupted by the concept of tokenization Tokenization Tokenization represents the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, i.e. token, which bears no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. In essence, the rights to the ownership of an asset are converted into a digital token. Tokenization can be used to own an entire unit of an asset. For example, one token that represents the ownership of a piece of real estate or to split ownership of a single unity of an asset such as 200,000 tokens, each one represen Tokenization represents the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, i.e. token, which bears no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.

Additionally, smart contracts are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence by enabling decentralized AI computing.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the diverse applications of smart contracts highlight ETH\u2019s utility, making it a highly sought-after crypto commodity over Bitcoin and even conventional commodities with limited use cases.\n\nScaling Hurdles with Ethereum\n\nL2 networks, one of Ethereum\u2019s biggest criticisms has been its scalability issues. The processing speed and usage costs of the Layer 1 Ethereum network have resulted in challenges to its widespread adoption despite the versatility of smart contract technology. However, the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks, such as Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync, has mitigated these issues.\n\nThese L2 networks, all powered by the native ETH token, enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, enabling the type of growth discussed earlier. They operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its efficiency by handling transactions off the main chain before settling them on the main network layer.\n\nThis reduces congestion and lowers costs without compromising on security or decentralization, making Ethereum more accessible and user-friendly.\n\nEther ETF Approved: Why Investing in Ether is Much More Sensible than Bitcoin in 5 Points\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83e\uddf5\n\n\n\n1. Ether is Much Scarcer and Even Deflationary Compared to Bitcoin \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain do not go directly to miners (validators,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1xDgWp8KD0 \u2014 tobbykitty.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@TobbyKitty) May 24, 2024\n\nThis adaptability ensures that Ethereum remains relevant as new technologies emerge. Perhaps this is Ethereum's strongest selling point in the post-ETF era: ETH\u2019s ability to efficiently scale while retaining Bitcoin's core crypto values, along with its unique added benefits, makes it a formidable contender in the crypto commodity space.\n\nIf the ETF approval was a validation of ETH\u2019s maturity as an asset class, then it is time to remind the world why Ethereum has made it this far."

The SEC's filing claims that since January 2023, Consensys has engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities via its crypto asset staking programs and acted as an unregistered broker through its MetaMask Staking service, allegedly collecting over $250 million in fees.\n\nIn April, Consensys preemptively sued the SEC after receiving notice of the agency's intention to sue over MetaMask\u2019s staking programs. The firm claimed that the SEC had secretly considered Ethereum to be a security for over a year and was quietly assembling a broader case against the crypto asset. Earlier this month, Consensys announced that it had been informed by the SEC that the regulator was closing its case against Ethereum, a development that was celebrated within the crypto industry.\n\nIn the SEC's lawsuit, the agency highlights Consensys's facilitation of ETH staking via third-party services like Lido and Rocket Pool through MetaMask. The SEC argues that these staking programs are offered and sold as investment contracts, and therefore, should be classified as securities.\n\nThis lawsuit emerges during a turbulent period for the SEC and crypto regulation. Earlier on Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority struck down the \"Chevron doctrine,\" a critical piece of American law that had allowed federal agencies, including the SEC, considerable latitude to interpret their regulatory powers. Consensys appeared to reference this Supreme Court decision, forcefully asserting that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate crypto products like MetaMask."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin suggests ways to speed up Ethereum transaction confirmations - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested ways to help the blockchain improve its transaction confirmation times.\n\nButerin, in a June 30 blog post, explained that Ethereum\u2019s Gasper consensus mechanism uses a slot-and-epoch architecture that contains certain complexities, like bug interactions and a 12.8-minute confirmation time, that makes it \u201cmore and more uncomfortable\u201d for user experiences.\n\nSo, he highlighted some of the \u201cpractical options\u201d Ethereum has to improve its user experience further.\n\nSSF\n\nButerin stated that the single-slot finality (SSF) mechanism is similar to the Tendermint consensus, as it allows the finalization of blocks as soon as they are produced.\n\nHowever, unlike the Tendermint consensus, Ethereum will keep the \u201cinactivity leak\u201d mechanism to allow chains to remain functional even if a third of the validators go offline. Buterin added that the single-slot finality mechanism also has its faults. Notably, all Ethereum stakers must publish two messages every 12 seconds, overloading the chain.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin furthered that while there are ideas to mitigate this issue, users may still have to wait 5-20 seconds. He wrote:\n\n\u201cThere are clever ideas for how to mitigate this, including the very recent Orbit SSF proposal. But even still, while this improves UX significantly by making \u2018finality\u2019 come faster, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that users need to wait 5-20 seconds.\u201d\n\nRollup preconfirmations\n\nRollup preconfirmations aim to improve Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) solutions. These solutions process transactions with the same security as the Ethereum base layer (L1) but on a larger scale.\n\nRollups confirm transactions much faster than the current 5-20 seconds, targeting latencies of hundreds of milliseconds. This method divides responsibilities \u2014 the L1 network remains stable, censorship-resistant, and reliable, while the L2s offer faster transaction times and address user needs directly.\n\nTo achieve faster confirmations, L2s create decentralized sequencing networks. These networks have smaller groups of validators who quickly sign off on blocks, often within milliseconds, and commit them to the blockchain.\n\nHowever, validators must ensure their commitments are consistent and trustworthy. If a validator signs conflicting blocks, they risk losing their deposits.\n\nBased preconfirmations\n\nBased preconfirmations leverage Ethereum proposers\u2019 advanced capabilities, driven by Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) prospects.\n\nThe concept involves establishing a standardized protocol where users can pay an extra fee for immediate assurance that their transaction will be included in the upcoming block. This service, known as preconfirmations-as-a-service, would assure users of swift transaction confirmation.\n\nProposers who fail to fulfill their commitment or breach the agreement face penalties (slashing). Buterin noted that this framework will apply to L1 transactions and extend to L2 solutions. By treating all L2 blocks as L1 transactions, the preconfirmation mechanism ensures accelerated confirmations throughout the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin noted that Ethereum implementing SSF and rollup or based preconfirmations could significantly reduce transaction confirmation times.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that this would return to the initial \u201cepoch-and-slot architecture\u201d the blockchain was trying to ditch. He stated:\n\n\u201cThere is a deep philosophical reason why epoch-and-slot architectures seem to be so hard to avoid: it inherently takes less time to come to approximate agreement on something, than to come to maximally-hardened \u2018economic finality\u2019 agreement on it.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the network developers explore other options that are not as tightly interwoven as Gasper.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Set For Explosive 30% Surge As ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Ethere\u00adum (ETH) is generating considerable\u00ad excitement as the\u00ad U.S. edges closer to approving spot ETFs. Analysts pre\u00addict substantial capital inflows into these ETFs, potentially driving ETH price\u00ads higher. This optimism is bolstered by re\u00adcent technical analyses pointing to a bullish tre\u00adnd for Ethereum.\n\nRenowne\u00add analyst Ali Martinez recently e\u00adxamined Ethereum\u2019s 3-day chart, re\u00advealing insightful data. Martinez highlighted the\u00ad TD Sequential indicator, known for pinpointing market turning points, which flashe\u00add a buy signal for Ethereum. This signal suggests a possible\u00ad rebound for ETH, indicating a short-term bullish outlook.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 5\n\nThe TD Se\u00adquential indicator is respecte\u00add for identifying trend exhaustion points. A marke\u00add 9 buy signal typically precedes price\u00ad recovery or trend re\u00adversal. Martinez interpre\u00adts this signal as a precursor to a rebound following a period of downward price\u00ad movements. Historically, such signals have be\u00aden followed by a consolidation or a reve\u00adrsal.\n\nMartinez\u2019s analysis indicates that Ethere\u00adum might see a corrective\u00ad upward move. The rece\u00adnt price action shows Ethereum trading downward, with occasional upward spike\u00ads. The \u20189\u2019 buy signal suggests a potential pause\u00ad in the bearish trend, possibly le\u00adading to a brief rally. This aligns with historical behaviors observe\u00add after such signals.\n\nBullish Breakout Suggests Ethereum Price Surge\n\nAnother notable\u00ad analyst, ZAYK Charts, presents a bullish scenario for Ethe\u00adreum. ZAYK identified a falling we\u00addge on the ETH/USDT 12-hour chart. This bullish pattern ofte\u00adn reverse downtrend, sugge\u00adsting a potential upward breakout. The chart illustrate\u00ads ETH consolidating within converging trend lines ove\u00adr the past months.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 6\n\nZAYK\u2019s analysis shows that the breakout from the\u00ad falling wedge is complete\u00ad, indicating a shift in market sentiment. This te\u00adchnical pattern\u2019s confirmation suggests a bullish wave, with 20-30% price\u00ad increase projections. Following this bre\u00adakout, Ethereum\u2019s target price\u00ad range is optimistic and promising.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,484.66, showing a 3.38% increase\u00ad and a 53.58% rise in trading volume within a day. This positive price\u00ad action indicates potential further upside\u00ads. The price is encounte\u00adring resistance around the $3,500 mark, with significant barrie\u00adrs at the $3,520 and $3,550 levels. A close\u00ad above $3,550 could propel Ether towards the\u00ad $3,650 resistance.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 7\n\nFurther re\u00adsistance is near $3,720, and an upside bre\u00adak above this level could drive\u00ad the price higher, pote\u00adntially reaching $3,880. However, a downside correction might start if Ethe\u00adreum fails to clear the $3,550 re\u00adsistance. Initial support is ne\u00adar $3,480, with significant support at the $3,440 zone.\n\nA move be\u00adlow the $3,420 support might push the price towards $3,350. Furthe\u00adr losses could decrease\u00ad the price to $3,320 in the short te\u00adrm. Overall, technical indicators and market se\u00adntiment suggest Ethere\u00adum is poised for a potential price surge\u00ad, supported by expecte\u00add ETF approvals and bullish technical patterns.\n\nRelated Readings | Solana (SOL) Faces 16% Value Drop, Yet Bullish Predictions Drive Hope Amidst Decline"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales appear to be igniting a potential sell-off today, as nearly $70 million worth of the cryptocurrency was transferred to Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This movement has sparked concerns among ETH traders about a possible market downturn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported two big transactions early this morning. The first tweet revealed that 9,999 ETH, worth around $34.3 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly thereafter, Whale Alert tweeted again to disclose that another 7,413 ETH, worth around $25.4 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance.\n\nThese transactions amount to a total of 17,412 ETH, equivalent to approximately $69.86 million at current market prices. Such large transfers to an exchange typically signal an impending sell-off, as whales \u2014 large holders of cryptocurrency \u2014 often move their assets to exchanges when they intend to sell.\n\nBroader market impact\n\nThe news of these substantial transfers has already had a palpable effect on the market. Ethereum\u2019s price has shown increased volatility following the alerts, with traders closely monitoring Binance for any signs of large-scale selling activity. The potential sell-off by these whales could exert downward pressure on the ETH price, impacting the broader market as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorically, significant movements by whale accounts have led to notable price fluctuations. When large amounts of cryptocurrency are sold off, it can trigger a domino effect, causing other traders to panic and sell their holdings, further driving down the price.\n\nAs of writing this article, the Ethereum price is $3,447.60. It has fallen 0.30% in the last 24 hours. However, the ETH price is down 8.94% over the past 30 days thanks to the ongoing bearish phase on the broader market. While the ultimate impact on Ethereum\u2019s price remains to be seen, the movement of such large amounts of ETH to an exchange is a signal that cannot be ignored."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is primed to mount a comeback against Bitcoin this month after underperforming its sibling cryptocurrency since the start of the year, according to K33 Research.\n\nOn the one hand, the leading smart contract platform is poised to receive its first US-listed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in July, inviting a tidal wave of new institutional demand into ETH. Meanwhile, Bitcoin holders are awaiting a 141,686 BTC ($8.8 billion) distribution from defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox\u2014a looming tsunami of potential sell pressure now ten years in the making.\n\n\u201cThe chickens of 2014 have come home to roost,\u201d wrote K33 Research in a Tuesday market update. \u201cWe expect net selling pressure to burden Bitcoin in an otherwise dry summer market, widening the chop suey range until rosier days arise as the leaves turn orange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the crypto market has lost much of its bullish momentum since April, K33 maintains that Ethereum ETFs will absorb between 0.75% and 1% of all ETH in circulation within their first five months on the market. Though the ETF launch could spark a \u201csell the news\u201d event for ETH in the short term (much like Bitcoin ETFs in January), the firm says ETH\u2019s \u201cpositive supply dynamics\u201d will afford it \u201crelative strength\u201d over the next several months.\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate,\u201d continued K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde, \u201cand I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched down to 0.046 By May 24. That\u2019s when surprise news broke that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs, taking the ratio back up to 0.055 today.\n\nIndicators suggest that positive sentiment around both ETH and BTC is returning to form\u2014particularly in the futures market.\n\nBitcoin futures premiums on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are back to trading in double digits at 10.9%, according to the report. As for Ethereum, the newly launched VolatilityShares 2x leveraged ETH ETF now holds 33,700 ETH ($114 million) equivalent exposure after just 15 trading days, showing that CME traders want long-leveraged exposure to ETH right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new ETF\u2019s popularity has helped push CME ETH open interest back towards all-time highs, currently sitting at 372,000 ETH ($1.26 billion). K33 Research said such high interest signals intent to make directional trades around ETH before the ETFs go live \u2013 though the direction of those trades remains unclear.\n\n\u201cThe soft funding rates suggest that the directional expectations are balanced, with neither bullish nor bearish positioning dominating \u2013 highlighting the uncertain market outlook and lack of consensus as ETH ETF launches are nearing,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\n\nMegaLabs, the primary development team behind a novel Ethereum scaling protocol designed for unprecedented speed, has raised $20 million in seed funding.\n\nCoinDesk reported that the recent round, led by Dragonfly Capital, attracted diverse investors, including Figment Capital, Folius Ventures, Robot Ventures, Big Brain Holding, and Tangent. The investment also garnered support from notable figures such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, EigenLayer creator Sreeram Kannan, and Hasu from Flashbots.\n\nThe newly acquired capital will be directed towards the development of the MegaETH protocol, with plans to launch a testnet in the coming months.\n\nMegaETH distinguishes itself as a \u201creal-time blockchain,\u201d emphasising transaction processing speed. The protocol aims to achieve an impressive throughput of 100,000 transactions per second with millisecond-level responsiveness.\n\nYilong Li, co-founder of MegaLabs, explained the concept in an interview with CoinDesk: \u201cWe define a real-time blockchain to be a blockchain that can process transactions as soon as they arrive. Then you produce the resulting outputs at a very high frequency.\u201d\n\nThe protocol\u2019s scaling capabilities derive from two key innovations:\n\n1. A heterogeneous blockchain architecture that enhances performance by allowing network nodes with varying hardware configurations to specialise in specific tasks.\n\n2. A hyper-optimised EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution environment that maximises throughput, minimises latency, and pushes resource efficiency to hardware limits.\n\nThe development of MegaETH was partially inspired by Vitalik Buterin\u2019s 2021 blog post, \u201cEndgame,\u201d which addressed Ethereum scaling challenges. He expressed his support for the project, stating, \u201cCreating hyper-scalable EVM implementations is a key prerequisite for truly scaling Ethereum. I am excited to see brilliant developers taking on this challenge.\u201d\n\nThis significant funding round and the ambitious goals of MegaETH highlight the ongoing efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem to address scalability issues and push the boundaries of blockchain technology performance.\n\nOverview of the broader blockchain funding landscape\n\nThe MegaLabs funding round was part of a significant week for venture capital in the blockchain space. According to data from Crypto Fundraiser, 23 startups secured over $154 million in funding, surpassing the previous week\u2019s total by almost $91 million. The number of funded projects increased by 10 from the previous week.\n\nHighlights of notable funding rounds\n\nConduit: Leading the pack, Conduit raised $37 million in a Series A round co-led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures. Other participants included Robot Ventures, Credibly Neutral, Coinbase Ventures, Bankless Ventures, and several angel investors. The funds will be used to develop customisable blockchain-based products like rollups, enhancing the accessibility of on-chain computing. Ora: This blockchain project, focusing on integrating AI into decentralised applications, secured $20 million from investors, including Polychain, HF0, and Hashkey Capital. Ora aims to develop technology for tokenising AI models and enhance decentralised AI within the Ethereum ecosystem. Their innovative optimistic machine learning (opML) technology underpins their flagship product, opp/ai, which combines optimistic systems and zero-knowledge technology for secure and efficient on-chain machine learning with privacy-preserving features.\n\nThese developments, alongside MegaLabs\u2019 funding, underscore the continued investor interest in blockchain infrastructure and scaling solutions. They also highlight the growing intersection of blockchain technology with other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence.\n\n(Photo by Kanchanara)\n\nSee also: US Treasury finalises crypto tax reporting rule, legal challenges for Binance continue\n\nWant to learn about the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence?

        "content": "Galaxy Digital head of asset management Steve Kurz said the SEC could approve a spot Ethereum ETF before the end of July and described prospects for other crypto ETFs.\n\nOn July 2, Kurz told Bloomberg that he expects approvals in \u201cweeks, not days\u201d and within the month.\n\nKurz said Galaxy has worked with the SEC on applications for months and noted the firm\u2019s upcoming spot Ethereum ETF is similar to its existing spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). Galaxy created both funds in partnership with the investment management firm Invesco.\n\nKurz said:\n\n\u201cWe know the plumbing, we know the process\u2026 The SEC is engaged.\u201d\n\nPossibility of more crypto ETFs\n\nKurz also expressed optimism about approvals for other spot crypto ETFs beyond Ethereum. He said that legislation, including laws defining securities, is necessary and that he believes the process will occur even if Joe Biden remains president.\n\nKurz cited Bitcoin ETF performance as a sign of demand, stating:\n\n\u201cPeople want this. Retail wants this, investors want this.\u201d\n\nTwo firms recently proposed ETFs for Solana (SOL). Kurz said that although Galaxy has high exposure to Solana and is the blockchain\u2019s largest validator, broad legislation permitting new crypto ETFs is more important than an ETF focused on any single crypto.\n\nHe also believes that a Solana CME futures market is a prerequisite for a Solana spot ETF. No SOL futures market currently exists.\n\nPredictions in line with Balchunas\n\nGalaxy\u2019s expectations are in line with the latest predictions from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who expects spot Ethereum ETFs to launch shortly after July 8.\n\nBalchunas said the SEC has asked spot Ethereum ETF issuers to amend their S-1 registration forms by July 8. The agency may seek further amendments.\n\nBalchunas previously predicted the funds would launch by July 2.\n\nOn May 23, the SEC approved 19-b4 rule changes that allow exchanges to list and trade each fund. However, those approvals did not permit asset managers to issue funds.\n\nAsset managers now await approval of their S-1 and S-3 registration funds, which will finally allow them to launch their Ethereum ETFs for trading.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Its revenue comes from the fees users pay to use the platform.\n\nIt has benefited from the memecoin trading frenzy that has dominated crypto in the first half of the year, especially on Solana, the network of choice for 85% of all new tokens traded on decentralised exchanges in 2024.\n\nPump.fun is popular because it doesn\u2019t require coding to create memecoins and it is a secure platform that tries to prevent \u201cearly rugs.\u201d\n\nEarly rugs are instances where token creators remove liquidity soon after launching a token, leaving investors in the lurch.\n\nDespite suffering a $2 million hack in May, pump.fun has helped memecoins creators deploy more than 1.2 million tokens since its inception in January. The protocol has produced $51.3 million in revenue so far.\n\nMemecoins are a big crypto sector valued at $51.5 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. Major memecoins include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nMeme-inspired tokens used to be animal-themed or based on popular internet memes but have now expanded to include celebrity-based tokens.\n\nCelebrity-based tokens are often marred by controversy and could become the subject of future enforcement action by US regulators.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has criticised the celebrity memecoin culture and said creators should focus on projects that offer \u201csome kind of public good,\u201d rather than enriching early adopters.\n\nThere are even tokens based on US political figures whose price movements often mirror political sentiments.\n\nShort memecoins\n\nMost memecoins are available only for spot trading. Exceptions include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Brett, tokens whose market sizes are large enough for leveraged trading on several centralised exchanges.\n\nBut that will change soon, according to MarginFi, a Solana-based platform that will introduce a protocol called mrgnswap to allow traders to place long or short bets on memecoins with leverage.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert at Bloomberg is moving his estimated date for the approval of spot market Ethereum (ETH) ETFs following recent comments made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a new thread on the social media platform X, Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says that spot ETH ETFs likely won\u2019t be greenlit until after the July 4th holiday weekend, which extends to the 8th, since many SEC staff members will be on break until then.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think we [are] gonna have to push back our over/under till after [the] holiday. Sounds like SEC took extra time to get back to people this week (although again, very light tweaks) and from what I hear, next week is dead because holiday = July 8th. The process resumes and soon after that they\u2019ll launch.\u201d\n\nLast month, Balchunas had predicted that the SEC would approve the ETFs by July 2nd after the SEC responded to several S-1 filings submitted by financial giants.\n\nAt the time, it was found that the regulatory agency sent back the filings to the firms for modifications, hinting that approvals were coming soon.\n\nOver a week later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated that the regulatory body would be approving ETH-based spot market ETF applications, but did not give a specific date. At the time, Gensler said the agency was currently working through the required disclosure statements needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about the asset managers making the full disclosure so that those registration statements can go effective and those lawyers know what that is.\n\nIt\u2019s something our Division of Corporation Finance handles hundreds, if not thousands of times over anybody\u2019s career. It\u2019s smoothly functioning. It\u2019s really up to the asset managers to make the proper disclosures.\u201d\n\nSpot market Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were approved by the SEC in January, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top crypto asset by market cap. Recently, firms have also been filing bids to create ETFs based around Ethereum rival Solana (SOL).\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Create an account to save your articles.\n\nCreate an account to save your articles.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced his thoughts on keeping the network decentralized amidst rising concerns about the it potentially transforming into a \"data center chain.\"\n\nThis debate has been ignited by recent comments from Doug Colkitt, founder of Ambient Finance, who vehemently opposes such a shift.\n\nWhile acknowledging the challenges posed by home staking, Buterin emphasized the importance of reducing the current 32 ETH requirement for staking. At current prices, a user would need roughly $111,000 worth of ETH to establish their own validator node.\n\n\"Every poll I make confirms the same thing: the #1 thing in becoming more home staking friendly is to reduce the 32 ETH requirement,\" Buterin stated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery poll I make confirms the same thing: the #1 thing in becoming more home staking friendly is to reduce the 32 ETH requirement. Doing that and SSF at the same time is a challenge. Ideas like Orbit are going to be really key here.https://t.co/BrxJs7fz6O Long-term, I've\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2024\n\nThis sentiment, which he says is supported by consistent community feedback, highlights the critical need to lower the financial barrier and make Ethereum staking more accessible.\n\nColkitt's primary argument hinges on the belief that Ethereum should not rely on data centers.\n\nHe emphasizes that protocols that cannot run on consumer hardware risk losing their censorship resistance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also argues that while home staking is often touted as the linchpin of decentralization, it has become a catch-all justification for complex and inefficient solutions without proper evaluation or clear definitions of what true decentralization should entail.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum wants to be a home staking network, it has to be as rigorously engineering-driven as high throughput chains like Solana,\u201d Colkitt asserted.\n\nHe advocates for establishing strict service level agreements (SLAs) and specifications for typical homestakers, and continually updating these benchmarks as consumer hardware and internet capabilities evolve.\n\nAccording to Colkitt, this approach will ensure network resources are allocated efficiently and effectively rather than being squandered on unproven and overly complicated schemes.\n\nButerin also pointed to innovative solutions like Orbit and Solo Staking Friendly (SSF) validator set management as key developments in addressing these challenges.\n\nOrbit and SSF are designed to make solo staking more accessible and efficient by managing validator sets to reduce the technical and financial barriers for individual stakers.\n\nThese solutions simplify the staking process, making it more feasible for more minor participants to contribute to the network's security.\n\nIn the long-term, Buterin expressed optimism about \"hyper-aggregation,\" a concept involving aggregating a large number of signatures (potentially up to 1 million) within a 12-second slot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis method, which Buterin notes is designed to be quantum-resistant, holds promise for enhancing the network's scalability and efficiency.\n\nQuantum-resistant technology refers to cryptographic algorithms that are secure against the potential threats of quantum computers, which could theoretically break current encryption methods.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that mitigating the associated risks and fully developing the technology will take considerable time and effort.\n\nButerin's comments highlight the complex balancing act required to maintain Ethereum's decentralization while pushing its performance and scalability boundaries.\n\nHis remarks underscore the need for continuous innovation and rigorous engineering to ensure that Ethereum remains accessible to home stakers without compromising its foundational principles.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP might have been in a downtrend, but the current state of the asset implies the possibility of a reversal. The current state of XRP is perfectly described by saying that not many people are selling it, but almost no one is buying it either.\n\nThe chart shows that XRP has had difficulty increasing in value over the previous few months. The lack of movement in the price can be explained by the volume profile, which shows minimal trading activity.\n\nGiven the state of the market, it appears that neither buyers nor sellers are willing to take large positions based on the low volume. A spike in volume might be interpreted as a sign of renewed interest and could raise the price.\n\nWith an RSI of approximately 41, XRP is in the lower neutral zone. This implies that there may yet be room for growth before overbought conditions materialize. An increase in buying pressure and the potential beginning of a new uptrend would be indicated by an RSI rise above 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with the recent decline, XRP still has solid fundamentals. When the legal dispute between Ripple, the company that created XRP, and the SEC is resolved, it may benefit XRP's price. Further providing a strong basis for future expansion are Ripple's continuing partnerships and technological developments.\n\nEthereum stays composed\n\nEthereum has been actively trading at around the $3,400 price threshold, but it has also been showing some worrying signs, while the 100 EMA is not considered the most reliable technical level for an asset. However, things may turn out better than expected.\n\nBecause it closely resembles the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) (orange line), the chart indicates that Ethereum has been able to maintain above the $3,370 mark. With the recent market turbulence, this level has served as a support zone, stabilizing the price of ETH. Volume analysis shows inconsistent signals.\n\nEven though trading volume has not increased significantly, the consistency shows that interest in Ethereum at these prices is stable. It is important to monitor this metric, because a spike in volume may indicate a more forceful move in either direction.\n\nEthereum is presently in the lower neutral zone, according to the relative strength index, which is circling 43. This points to potential upward movement before overbought conditions materialize. Additional proof of bullish momentum would be provided if the RSI could move closer to the 50-point level.\n\nIndicators of long-term trends, the 26-day and 200-day EMAs, are also displayed on the chart. As of right now, Ethereum is trading above the 200-day moving average, a bullish indication for the long run. It is still below the 50-day EMA, suggesting some short-term pessimism.\n\nEthereum's price action is heavily influenced by market sentiment. The overall trend is still positive despite a few negative signs. Potential price increases for Ethereum are well-founded due to its strong fundamentals, which include continuous network upgrades and growing user adoption.\n\nSolana struggles on way up\n\nSolana has been actively fighting for the $150 threshold for the last few weeks. However, despite positive fundamental developments that include the introduction of Blockchain links (or blinks), which are a specification that allows a user to complete an on-chain transaction on any website capable of displaying a URL, the price of the asset has not been moving actively.\n\nIn order to verify a bullish reversal and pursue the $150 target, Solana must close above numerous moving averages. Solana has recently found support at the 200-day EMA or roughly $130. Numerous tests of this support level show that there is significant buying interest at this price.\n\nMixed signals can be seen in the volume profile. Although there has been some trading activity, not much to indicate strong bullish momentum has emerged. The market's growing confidence in Solana's price action would be indicated by an increase in volume. For bulls, a move in the RSI above 50 would be positive."

        "content": "Mon 01 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nInitially expected in early July, the launch of Ethereum ETFs has just been postponed by the SEC, plunging crypto investors into palpable uncertainty. This unexpected decision, underpinned by additional requests for reviews of the S-1 forms, highlights the persistent regulatory challenges faced by the adoption of digital assets.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s new decision regarding Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to delay the much-anticipated launch of Ethereum ETFs, initially planned for early July. This decision follows additional comments issued by the American financial regulator on the S-1 forms submitted by potential issuers of these ETFs. Issuers now have until July 8 to resubmit their revised forms, potentially pushing the launch of Ethereum ETFs to mid-July or later.\n\nThis delay is part of a two-step process for the approval of Ethereum ETFs. The first step, involving the approval of form 19b-4, was completed in May. However, the S-1 forms, which represent the second step, do not have a fixed deadline, leaving the issuers dependent on the SEC\u2019s timeline for their review and approval.\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nWhile some crypto industry players remain optimistic about a quick approval following the revisions of the S-1 forms, others worry that this delay signifies deeper regulatory challenges. Analysts estimate that final approval could come within two to three weeks following the submission of revised forms, but the exact date remains uncertain. Crypto investors, who had initially anticipated approval in early July, now need to reassess their short-term strategies.\n\nMoreover, the implications of this delay extend beyond just the launch of the ETFs. It is indeed a critical test for the entire crypto sector. Once approved, Ethereum ETFs could not only gain institutional recognition but also transform the landscape of crypto investments, offering new opportunities for investors and consolidating Ethereum\u2019s position in the global financial market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "The Ethereum price turnaround is proving to be a huge game changer for altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. Following the SEC\u2019s approval of Ether ETFs, investors seem optimistic that the trend will continue with these altcoins and subsequently trigger a major rally in crypto prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair hovered at a 0.054 ratio during the US session on Monday. It seemed ready for a larger breakout but only if Ethereum gained more strength against Bitcoin, thus breaking above the resistance at 0.055.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the rebound to $3,445, the technical outlook may not be convincing enough especially with resistance foreseen at $3,500, $3,600, and $3,800. Key fundamentals like the decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL), and the crypto fear and greed index reinforce the bearish grip on ETH.\n\nThe immediate support at between $3,200 and $3,300 must hold this week to prevent further losses to $3,000, considering it may be too early to rule out an extended drop to the next key level at $2,800.\n\nETH/BTC Price Prediction: Is Ethereum Price Gearing Up For 25% Breakout\n\nEthereum has in the last few weeks drastically gained against the largest cryptocurrency such that the ETH/BTC trading pair tested the inverse head and shoulder (H&S) pattern\u2019s neckline resistance twice.\n\nEther bulls seem ready to continue with the uptrend above 0.055\u2014in a move that could ignite a 25% rally to 0.069. An inverse H&S pattern is bullish and often signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a sustainable uptrend.\n\nNevertheless, the pattern remains unvalidated until the price breaches the neckline resistance. In the ETH/BTC pair\u2019s case, this is the seller congestion at 0.055.\n\nThe Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) add credence to the likely breakout, with the 20-day EMA holding as the immediate support at 0.05461. A golden cross on the same daily chart lingers as the 50-day EMA in red crosses above the 200-day EMA in purple.\n\nOn top of the golden cross, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a lot of potential for the trading pair, holding above the midline at 50. Should the RSI close the gap to the overbought region at 70, the path of least resistance will remain upwards, further accentuating the breakout to 0.069.\n\nWhat To Watch Out For In Ether Price This Week\n\nA breakout is also looming in Ethereum price based on the technical structure backed by a soon-to-be-sent buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the daily chart.\n\nDespite the encouraging bullish outlook, ETH price holds between a rock and a hard place, with support provided by the 0.5% Fibonacci ratio and a confluence resistance established at $3,467 by the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA.\n\nIf the hurdle caves in, traders would push the bullish case, targeting a breakout to $4,000 this week. However, such a move will not happen in a vacuum, considering the two resistance levels at $3,600 and $3,800.\n\nWith the approval of Ethereum ETFs imminent in July, market sentiment is expected to improve exponentially and this might catalyze the rally above $4,000. The CoinGape Ethereum price prediction shows a vivid map for ETH\u2019s recovery to the previous all-time high. It is possible Ether could debut above $5,000 reaching a new record high.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Has Ethereum price bottomed? Ethereum price has likely bottomed with support at $3,200. However, the following weeks will determine the direction the coin takes. 2. Has the Ethereum bull run ended? The technical structure shows that Ethereum still has room for growth. With spot ETH ETF approval imminent, there\u2019s a high chance the bull run has not started. 3. What is a spot ETF? This is an investment product that tracks the real-time price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It allows investors to seek exposure to digital assets without buying physical coins on crypto exchanges. ETFs are purchased directly on stock exchanges.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

As shared in a lengthy blog post, Vitalik Buterin hinted at epochs and slots as the go-to models to help the Ethereum network stay competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum needs speedy transactions\n\nIn Buterin's view, Ethereum is better off than it was five years ago in terms of transaction finality metrics. The blockchain now averages 5 to 20 seconds for transactions, which compares well with its traditional finance competitors.\n\nEpochs and slots all the way down: ways to give Ethereum users faster transaction confirmation timeshttps://t.co/lfCXrFm6A1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2024\n\nHowever, with the slots and epochs architecture, the Ethereum cofounder argued that finality could drop down to 16 seconds. While the protocol has worked hard to pilot this slot and epoch architecture, Buterin noted that more improvement to this tech stack is still needed.\n\nButerin noted that Ethereum has always created an enabling environment for its constituent protocols, like layer 2, to create their own model for transaction confirmation. While this strategy has worked well, with layer-2 solutions proven to be faster, he believes it is time to guarantee efficiency.\n\nHe remains optimistic about the future of the Ethereum blockchain and how advances in transaction speed times on L1 can make the lives of L2 developers easier.\n\nMatching competition\n\nThe layer-1 blockchain space might be considered saturated, however, it has continued to evolve, with each new entrant boasting of enhanced capabilities. Ethereum\u2019s key competitors, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Fantom (FTM), all boast advanced technology in terms of transaction speed.\n\nWhile Ethereum still dominates the DeFi ecosystem, and the new proposals to increase its confirmation speed might only help make it more endearing to users. Overall, if the developers of the Ethereum ecosystem are able to promote this new futuristic architecture, the biggest beneficiary will be ETH.\n\nCombined with the expectations for spot Ethereum ETF trading this month, there might be a massive uptick in price moving forward."

        "content": "Mon 01 Jul 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, a historic milestone was reached for Ethereum: the network recorded its lowest gas fees since 2016, a piece of news that resonates like an earthquake in the crypto ecosystem. This unexpected phenomenon occurs in a context of high transactional activity, redefining the economic dynamics of the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain. Why this spectacular drop in gas fees, and what are the implications for the future of Ethereum and the crypto sector as a whole?\n\nA historic drop in gas fees\n\nSo, on June 30, 2024, the Ethereum network recorded an average gas fee of 3 Gwei, or about 0.14 dollars, according to Dune Analytics data. This drastic decrease marks the lowest level since 2016, offering a sharp contrast to the exorbitant fees observed during the NFT bubble in 2021. At that time, massive demand in the NFT sector drove transaction fees to new heights, leading some analysts to question the viability of the Ethereum network and explore more affordable alternatives like Solana.\n\nToday, despite sustained transactional activity, gas fees are surprisingly low. This situation is attributable to a series of technological improvements, including increased efficiency of the layer 1 market and the integration of layer 2 volumes. The introduction of \u201cblob transactions\u201d with EIP-4844 also played a crucial role in increasing the network\u2019s scalability. These innovations have smoothed transactions while keeping costs to a minimum, a technical feat that redefines Ethereum\u2019s capabilities.\n\nImplications for the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nFirst, this reduction in transactional costs could revitalize Ethereum\u2019s appeal to crypto developers and users, particularly those who had migrated to more economical alternatives. By making transactions more affordable, Ethereum once again positions itself as a preferred platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and daily transactions, potentially increasing adoption and innovation on the network.\n\nThis development also has significant implications for the network\u2019s security. Historically, high gas fees served as a protective mechanism against denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by making attacks costly. With the decrease in fees, it is crucial that the scalability and efficiency improvements introduced by recent updates are sufficient to maintain network security against a potential increase in attacks.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the decrease in fees also means that the second-largest crypto by market capitalization is less deflationary than before. With the amount of fees burned being reduced, Ethereum\u2019s total supply is increasing again, altering the dynamics of supply and demand in the market. This situation could influence investor perception and the long-term strategy of network stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, while the decrease in gas fees is positive news for users in terms of cost and accessibility, it demands continued attention to security and economic sustainability issues. The next steps for Ethereum will be to balance these different aspects while continuing to innovate to stay competitive in an increasingly saturated and demanding blockchain environment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Selling pressure on Ethereum was high in the last week.\n\nMarket indicators were bullish on the token.\n\nEthereum [ETH] finally gained bullish momentum at press time. If the latest data is to be considered, then ETH might be getting ready to reach new highs by the end of this year.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s going on.\n\nEthereum to breakout soon\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at CoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s price increased by over 2% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s price surged by more than 3%.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,488.88 with a market capitalization of over $419 billion. Thanks to the recent price increase, only 10% of ETH investors were at a loss, as per IntoTheBlock\u2019s data.\n\nThings can get even better for the token as a bullish pattern appeared on ETH\u2019s chart. World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a bullish falling wedge pattern.\n\nETH\u2019s price started to consolidate inside the pattern in May, and at press time, it was on the verge of a breakout.\n\nIt was interesting to note that ETH got rejected from the upper limit of the pattern a few times earlier. However, World of Charts mentioned that there were still chances of a breakout.\n\nIf that actually happens, then investors might witness the token touching new highs by the end of this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s there in the short term?\n\nAMBCrypto then planned to take a closer look at ETH\u2019s metrics to better understand what to expect in the short term. We found that selling pressure on the token increased.\n\nAs per our analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s Exchange Inflow spiked last week. Its Supply on Exchanges also increased, meaning that investors were selling the token.\n\nWhales remained confident in the token, as ETH\u2019s supply held by top addresses increased.\n\nA few other market indicators also looked optimistic. For instance, the MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark at press time.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nMoreover, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) followed a similar increasing trend, indicating that the chances of a price uptick were high.\n\nIf that happens, then investors might witness ETH touching $3,895 in the coming days. But if things get bearish, then ETH might drop to $2,877."

        "content": "Mon 01 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has just unveiled innovative proposals aimed at significantly reducing transaction confirmation times on the network. These innovations could transform the user experience and strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nEthereum in search of speed to dominate the crypto market\n\nAlthough Ethereum has made notable advances in recent years, the network still struggles to match the speed of newer blockchains.\n\nWith a block time of about 12 seconds, Ethereum lags behind competitors like Solana, capable of generating blocks in 0.4 seconds. This limitation hinders Ethereum\u2019s adoption for certain applications requiring minimal latency.\n\nTo address this challenge, Buterin proposes several technical innovations. The most ambitious of which is the \u201csingle-slot finality (SSF)\u201d or \u201cfinality in a single slot\u201d, which would radically simplify the network\u2019s architecture.\n\n\u201cThe main challenge of SSF is that, naively, it seems to imply that each participant of Ethereum would have to publish two messages every 12 seconds, which would be a significant load to manage for the chain.\u201d Vitalik\n\nThis approach would eliminate the current system of epochs and slots, which is considered too complex. However, its implementation raises questions about the load supported by the blockchain.\n\nA delicate balance between speed and decentralization\n\nAnother promising path involves \u201cbased pre-confirmations\u201d. This mechanism would allow users to pay additional fees in exchange for a guaranteed inclusion of their transaction in the next block. Compatible with layer 2 solutions, it would offer an almost instantaneous experience for demanding applications.\n\nWhile speed is crucial, Buterin insists on the importance of not compromising Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals. Decentralization and security remain absolute priorities.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current block time already represents a significant improvement over Bitcoin (10 minutes). Nevertheless, Buterin believes that some applications require latencies on the order of \u201chundreds of milliseconds, or even less\u201d.\n\nThe challenge is therefore to find the right balance between performance and network integrity. Buterin\u2019s proposals aim to push the limits while preserving the very essence of Ethereum.\n\nIn short, the forward-thinking ideas of Vitalik Buterin could redefine the standards of the crypto industry. If they come to fruition, these innovations would allow Ethereum to consolidate its leadership position while paving the way for new revolutionary applications in the blockchain universe.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Network to Get Major Boost With SSF Roadmap, Says Vitalik Buterin - CoinGape",
        "content": "On Sunday, June 30, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post explaining the road ahead for Ethereum and how they might have to part ways with the epoch-and-slot mechanism of its existing rollup-centric roadmap. Buterin proposes a new SSF mechanism to improve the transaction time latencies of the order of hundreds of milliseconds or even less.\n\nEthereum Eyes Single-Slot Finality\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum Gasper consensus employs a slot-and-epoch mechanism wherein validators cast votes in each 12-second slot. Also, all validators get the opportunity to vote once, over 32 slots. Later, a PBFT-like consensus algorithm takes care after two epochs (12.8 minutes), thereby providing a strong economic assurance known as finality. However, there are two major concerns with this approach.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe complexity and several interaction bugs between the two slot-by-slot voting mechanism as well as the epoch-by-epoch finality mechanism. The 12.8-minute finality period is pretty slow and inconvenient for the users.\n\nTo simplify this, Buterin proposes a single-slot finality mechanism similar to the Tendermint consensus, wherein Block-N is finalized even before the creation of Block N+1. The major difference from Tendermint is the retention of the \u201cinactivity leak\u201d mechanism. This will allow the Ethereum blockchain to continue and recover even if nearly one-third of validators go offline. Vitalik Buterin calls this a \u201cSecure Speed Finality\u201d SSF mechanism.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Spotlights Innovative Idealist DApps in Web3\n\nAddressing A Few Challenges With the SSF Mechanism\n\nVitalik Buterin also highlighted some key challenges associated with Single-slot finality (SSF) in the Ethereum ecosystem. He explained that the naive implementation of the SSF would require every Ethereum staker to publish two messages every 12 seconds, imposing a significant load on the Ethereum network. In his blog post, Buterin said:\n\n\u201cWhile there are clever ideas to mitigate this issue, including the recent Orbit SSF proposal, it remains a challenge. Although SSF significantly improves user experience by accelerating \u2018finality,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for users to wait 5-20 seconds.\u201d\n\nWhile implementing the SSF mechanism in Ethereum, Buterin suggests implementing Orbit-like techniques in order to reduce the total number of validators signing per slot and address the key goal of lowering 32 ETH minimum staking.\n\n\u201cThis approach might cause the slot time to increase to approximately 16 seconds,\u201d added Buterin. However, he added: \u201cDesigns like Orbit SSF are very recent, suggesting that the design space of slot-and-epoch designs where something like Orbit SSF is the epoch is still quite under-explored\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum developers are still figuring out the ideal solution in order to improve the finality. Last month, Buterin shared updates made with Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. The Ethereum L2 activity has touched fresh all-time highs recently.\n\nEthereum is thriving as an ecosystem right now with L2 activity hitting fresh all time highs every other day and the L1 roadmap being executed on with laser precision Meanwhile, crypto twitter is acting like Ethereum is failing and in dire need of an emergency intervention \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) July 1, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum Layer-2 Blast recently announced the launch of its native token and BLAST airdrop.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Price Shoots 5% As Whale Activity Spikes Ahead of Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs have received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are scheduled to launch on July 4th. The news of this approval has resulted in bullish swings for ETFSwap (ETFS), Filecoin (FIL), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Analysts believe these cryptos will yield up to 40,000% ROIs for investors.\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) Set To Generate 40,000% ROIs As More Investors Adopt Ethereum ETFs\n\nFor weeks, ETFSwap (ETFS) has been the receptor of mass hype and multiple accolades. This coin's integration of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry into its utility makes it a must-have token. As the metaverse waits eagerly for the launch of these Ethereum ETFs, investors gear toward ETFSwap (ETFS).\n\nThis crypto's primary aim is to completely revolutionize the current system of trading tokenized ETFs. Borderless ETF trade is possible with the platform\u2019s high-quality AI-powered protocol. This protocol consists of the ETF Tracker and ETF Screener, which offer useful investment recommendations that are in line with market conditions.\n\nExcluding this scheme, Ethereum ETF investors are also dazzled by the platform\u2019s unique perks. ETFSwap (ETFS) investors that contribute to the liquidity pool through staking events will receive an APR yield of 87%. ETFSwap (ETFS). They will also earn progressive trade perpetuals up to 10X via leveraged trading.\n\nThe presale of this token has a myriad of investors from multiple ecosystems, particularly Ethereum ETFs. ETFS is the platform\u2019s cryptocurrency that grants investors access to all governing processes of the network. The token is available on the ETFSwap (ETFS) website for $0.01831, which may yield up to 40,000% when the event ends.\n\nFilecoin (FIL) Price Heads To The Moon As It Eyes $10 Value\n\nAnother cryptocurrency that has benefited from the Ethereum ETFs craze is the DeFi network, Filecoin. Filecoin has enjoyed a smooth ride in Q2, maintaining its green zone. Contrary to its Q1 performance, this altcoin has impressed investors by shaking off the bear's effects extensively.\n\nFilecoin is a blockchain-based storage system that functions as a secure unit for important market data. Its initial aim was to run as a subsidiary layer for IPFS and individual data storage. Filecoin (FIL) is the utility token of this chain that ushers investors into decentralized storage.\n\nAs market participants began to lose faith in its comeback, Filecoin surprised investors with an astonishing surge. Its incredible display has led to presumptions that the Filecoin price can overcome the bear while propping the bull. Filecoin currently trades at $4.46 and has continued to make attempts to recover its 2023 price of $10.\n\nEthereum ETFs Spark Dogwifhat (WIF) Buying Pressure\n\nThe price of the Dogwifhat (WIF) token has revolted against the plunging tide of the metaverse. On June 25th, Dogwifhat (WIF) began to trade above $2, breaking out of its previous descent. Meanwhile, on-chain analysis has disclosed that a likely Ethereum ETF enthusiast has acquired $4.67 million worth of Dogwifhat (WIF).\n\nThis acquisition indicates that a possible rally may be in sight. Evidently, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a forerunner of the 2024 meme coin comeback. Experts believe that this cryptocurrency may drive the revival of the Solana (SOL) marketplace and push it to a new all-time high.\n\nConclusion On The Capability Of ETFSwap (ETFS), Filecoin (FIL), And Dogwifhat (WIF) To Push Investors\u2019 Profits By 40,000%\n\nThe crypto market has made a lot of buzz in the financial industry since Ethereum ETFs made headlines concerning SEC approval. This move has ignited global traffic as traditional investors seek alternative investment opportunities in cryptos like ETFSwap (ETFS). The presale of this token offers investors the opportunity to acquire the ETFS token at a discounted rate before it becomes too late.\n\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\n\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\n\nJoin The ETFSwap Community"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the fast-evolving realm of cryptocurrency, BlockDAG emerges as a beacon of innovation and success, with its presale now soaring past $54.9 million. As Ethereum struggles to maintain price stability below $3,500, and Polygon expands with Google Cloud\u2019s recent endorsement, BlockDAG shines brightly.\n\nCurrently in its 19th batch, priced at $0.014 with the upcoming batch set at $0.015, BlockDAG has not only captured the attention but also the confidence of the global crypto community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Challenges Amidst Market Volatility\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey through the crypto market remains turbulent as it struggles to break past the $3,550 resistance mark. Recent trading sessions saw Ethereum dip to $3,385, igniting cautious optimism among investors. The cryptocurrency now wrestles with a key bearish trend line established at $3,465 and trades below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical analysts suggest that if Ethereum fails to breach the $3,465 and $3,550 resistance levels, it could face potential declines, targeting major support levels at $3,350, with further dips possibly reaching $3,220 and $3,100.\n\nPolygon Pushes Forward with Notable Ecosystem Developments\n\nPolygon continues to stand out as a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, strengthened by significant milestones such as Google Cloud\u2019s role as a validator. This collaboration not only enhances the network\u2019s security but also boosts its technological robustness, broadening Google Cloud\u2019s involvement in blockchain technology.\n\nThe recent launch of Astar Network\u2019s Astar zkEVM with Gelato, and the introduction of native USDC on Polygon, supported by Circle, marks crucial steps in enhancing liquidity and facilitating institutional transactions. These developments, combined with a vibrant community growth of 29% and an increase in MATIC\u2019s price to $0.5607, underscore Polygon\u2019s expanding influence and innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nBlockDAG Dominates with Robust Presale and Community Engagement\n\nBlockDAG continues its impressive trajectory in the cryptocurrency presale arena.

The presale has successfully marketed over 11.8 billion BDAG coins and over 8250 miners, amassing an additional $3.5 million in fundraising. With a price surge of 1300%, BlockDAG is quickly becoming a formidable force in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe robust support from crypto influencers and the broader community amplifies BlockDAG\u2019s market presence, enticing a wider audience to its innovative approach. These strategic endorsements have positioned BlockDAG as the breakout cryptocurrency of 2024, promising substantial returns for early investors. As it progresses toward batch 45, market experts anticipate a potential 30,000x return on investment, illustrating the exciting and lucrative future that lies ahead for BlockDAG.\n\nAt the core of BlockDAG\u2019s impressive performance is its unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which allows it to handle between 10,000 and 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). This exceptional capacity ensures nearly instantaneous transaction confirmations, crucial in high-stakes, time-sensitive scenarios.\n\nSuch technical prowess makes BlockDAG an attractive choice for investors prioritizing efficient and rapid transaction capabilities. Furthermore, BlockDAG\u2019s commitment to maintaining low transaction fees and high scalability makes it a versatile and powerful platform, suitable for a wide range of applications from microtransactions to large-scale business operations.\n\nAs Ethereum navigates its price fluctuations and technical challenges, and Polygon advances its ecosystem with innovative partnerships and technological integrations, BlockDAG sets a new standard in the presale landscape.

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a leading name in the blockchain industry, with over 2.14 million registered names.\n\nThe upcoming ENSv2 upgrade is eagerly anticipated for its focus on scalability and affordability.\n\nUnbelievably, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been one of the top gainers this year. Its token is at its highest level since January 2022, after rising for two weeks running. With the market\u2019s attention on memecoins and AI, it was surprising when ENS rose to the top of the crypto market in early July.\n\nThis year, ENS has grown by an incredible 253%, much exceeding other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, which have risen by 57% and 47%, respectively.\n\nCoinMarketCap data show that the ENS price at the time of writing is about $32.53, representing a bullish position over the previous seven days with a 46.01% increase and a 27.41% rise in the previous 24 hours.\n\nUnderstanding ENS and Its Significance\n\nAmong the most well-known names in the blockchain space is Ethereum Name Service. With this site, users may quickly and cheaply register ETH domains to build customized Web3 identities like john.eth.\n\nThis function is essential since it gives the industry a memorable and simple identity in place of the usual random characters.\n\nIn addition, most blockchains\u2014including well-known ones such as Optimism, Solana, Arbitrum, and Base Blockchain\u2014can be used with ENS domains.\n\nOver the years, ENS has gathered 409 integrations and over 2.14 million identities. Its goal of simplifying the Web3 sector has won industry observers, including Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, approval.\n\nAnticipation of ENSv2 Upgrade\n\nA further factor driving up the price of ENS tokens is investor excitement over the impending ENSv2 upgrade. The emphasis of this improvement is on flexibility, cost, and scalability. Presently, developers are focusing on reserve resolution and name resolution enhancement.\n\nThough the roadmap suggests it will take a few months to deploy, the developers have not disclosed a precise timetable for the V2 upgrade."

        "content": "An exchange flow metric showed that the local bottom might be in for BTC, ETH.\n\nThe market sentiment was not bullish and holder behavior at crucial support levels would be key for the next price move.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] bulls struggled to shift the market dynamic in their favor. The large losses of the past ten days meant that the price was back at a support zone where buyers are expected to halt the sellers.\n\nEthereum\u2019s MVRV and NVT ratios showed the asset might be undervalued. The liquidity pocket at $3500 could see a short squeeze, but momentum was bearish otherwise.\n\nMeanwhile, another BTC investigation showed that mining activity had receded and that miners were selling Bitcoin. However, the selling pressure had begun to drop in intensity over the past two days.\n\nAMBCrypto decided to look at the movement of both assets from exchanges to gauge the market sentiment. It revealed that bulls might not have too much to cheer for yet.\n\nWhat does the exchange netflow metric indicate?\n\nThe exchange net flows metric offers valuable insights into the market. When the flows are positive, it shows inflows are greater.\n\nThis in turn is a sign of potential selling pressure on the asset, as it implies participants are sending the crypto to exchanges to sell them.\n\nValues below zero mean that outflows are greater, which is a good sign for buyers.\n\nIt indicates that market participants are withdrawing their assets from exchanges, likely to place them in safer storage, and indicates accumulation.\n\nThe 30-day simple moving averages were used to better understand the exchange flow trends. The ETH inflows were considerable in mid-March and toward late May.\n\nBoth occurrences marked a local top for the price.\n\nIn the past month, the net flow was heavily negative, showing accumulation. Over the past eight days, the outflow has slowed down, but the 30DMA net flow remained in negative territory.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin saw consistent accumulation in February and March. The 30DMA showed that the flow of BTC out of the exchanges continued to dominate.\n\nIn late April and on the 21st of May, there were spikes in the BTC inflow, but they were exceptions to the trend.\n\nAre Bitcoin, Ethereum headed for a consolidation?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of the in/out of the money data from IntoTheBlock highlighted key support regions.\n\nThe in/out of money around the price showed Ethereum has a strong bastion of support from $3080-$3180 and $3280-$3381. Similarly, the $3486-$3586 is also a staunch resistance.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nFor Bitcoin, the $59,450-$61,263 is support and $63,148-$64,960 resistance.\n\nThis meant that the current price consolidation of both these crypto market leaders could be confined within these levels and lead to a range formation."

        "title": "Bitcoin Sentiment Hits Lowest Level In 18 Months, Ethereum Token Rollblock Continues To Gain Momentum As Price Set To Increase Again - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "A lot has happened in the crypto community since the last bull market. After Bitcoin had its long-awaited halving event, many altcoins saw a significant rise in value. This all-time high rippled across the industry, as institutional investors began to secure their positions. With spot ETFs now inevitable, and a lot more profit to be made, it\u2019s no surprise that more innovative assets are sweeping the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum-based Rollblock continues to gain massive traction in the iGambling and GameFi industry. The unique online casino has shown promise with its presale activity and is certain of monumentally positive price movements. Here\u2019s why you should invest:\n\nDespite Halving and ETF Approval, Bitcoin Craze Starts To Dwindle.\n\nBitcoin had started the year with the promise of massive gains and price appreciation. The pioneer cryptocurrency has faced recent difficulty in upping its price action as sentiments around the asset hit its lowest since the start of the new year.\n\nWith a halving event in April and the approval of spot ETFs, Bitcoin investors were certain of a radical surge northwards. Many months later, this has not been the case, as the bull market has not sustained significantly.\n\nThis has not deterred crypto investors, as transaction data shows a low selloff rate, with institutional investors holding their position. With the success of the Bitcoin spot ETF trades, many financial authorities have acknowledged Bitcoin as an institutional investment, capitalizing on the security and profitability of the asset.\n\nThe current trend is consistent with retrospective analysis of Bitcoin price movements over time. Many analysts have noted a constant dip in Bitcoin price around June, with a corresponding rebound as July rolls around. Bitcoin could yet recover from the slump, and investors are hopeful that the data rings true, as Ethereum ETF trades are set to launch in July.\n\nMeanwhile, many Bitcoin investors are looking to other viable profit options, and with Rollblock\u2019s presale currently ongoing, a unique opportunity has presented itself.\n\nRollblock Price Climbs Even Higher As Market Demand Increases In Presale Phase\n\nNew crypto assets hardly generate the level of demand required to drive up presale prices. With the steady increase in Rollblock\u2019s presale price, it is evident that the market is itching for this new asset. With new projects, investors primarily seek out utility, community engagement, and profit potential.\n\nRollblock has caught investors\u2019 attention with its unique and lucrative online casino platform. This platform aims to combine traditional centralized gambling with the transparency and profitability of Blockchain technology. The result is a DeFi platform that upholds security, privacy, and profitability.\n\nInvestors in Rollblock stand to gain mouthwatering rewards and bonuses provided by the ecosystem. Users can play games and trade to earn RBLK tokens. Presale investors are at a vantage point, as weekly revenue generated by the platform is shared amongst holders. Rollblock also offers staking options, allowing users the opportunity to expand the protocol\u2019s liquidity pool. Staking rewards reach as high as 30% APY.\n\nRollblock understands the economics of cryptocurrency and has committed to a deflationary supply system. This would reduce the amount of RBLK tokens in circulation over time. The platform aims to achieve this through its buyback program. RBLK tokens would be periodically purchased in decentralized exchanges using a share of Rollblock\u2019s weekly profits. The purchased RBLK tokens would then be split equally between token holders and the network\u2019s burn pool.\n\nMoreover, Rollblock is currently in the third stage of its public presale, with tokens selling out fast due to robust demand. Already, the emerging project has sold more than 50% of its stage 3 presale allocation, with RBLK tokens going for a discounted price of $0.015. With these benefits, Rollblock has defined itself as the future of online gambling, promoting user privacy, asset security, and massive profitability.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin sentiment has reached its lowest level in over a year as its price struggles to make significant gains. Meanwhile, the Ethereum-based token Rollblock is experiencing strong momentum during its presale phase, with increasing demand driving its price up.\n\nThe integration of Blockchain technology is expected to significantly increase the current market valuation of the gambling industry, making Rollblock an appealing choice for investors seeking to capitalize on this profit opportunity.\n\nAs the project approaches its official launch, many crypto analysts are confident that its price will increase by more than 800%.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\n\n\n\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino"

        "content": "Solana outperformed Ethereum in terms of DEX volumes.\n\nThe price performance of both SOL and ETH tokens were positive over the last 24 hours.\n\nSolana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH] have been one of the top cryptocurrency networks in the space.\n\nEven though Ethereum has managed to retain its dominance in various areas for the most part, recent developments suggest that Solana could catch up with Ethereum soon.\n\nSolana shows promise\n\nData from DefiLlama showed Solana surging ahead of Ethereum in daily DEX trading volume. Solana captured a significant lead, processing $1.148 billion compared to Ethereum\u2019s $745 million.\n\nThis marks a shift in dominance within the DEX landscape, and could signal a growing preference for Solana\u2019s faster transaction speeds and lower fees.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum remains the leader in overall DeFi total value locked (TVL), but Solana\u2019s strong showing in DEX volume could help propel the protocol to new heights.\n\nEven though Solana\u2019s TVL was far behind Ethereum, Solana blew Ethereum out of the water in terms of overall activity.\n\nIn terms of daily active addresses, the overall number of addresses on Solana had grown to 1.4 million whereas, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network were 644,000 at the time of writing.\n\nIn terms of daily transactions, Solana showed significant dominance. At the time of writing, Solana 42.9 million transactions that were occurring on its network. Whereas on Ethereum, the number was around 1.1 million.\n\nLooking at the finer details\n\nEven though Solana managed to outgrow Ethereum in terms of activity, it is important to note that Layer-2s have not been taken into consideration while calculating activity.\n\nL2s like Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP] act as scaling solutions for Ethereum, processing transactions off the mainnet but still leveraging Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nActivity on these L2s translates to interest in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s impressive numbers raise questions about long-term sustainability.\n\nThe high transaction volume might be partly driven by speculative activity or meme coin trading, which may not translate into long-term value creation.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to see if this activity translates into building solid DeFi applications and attracting established projects.\n\nMoreover, Solana\u2019s architecture boasts faster speeds and lower fees, but it has faced criticism regarding network congestion and outages in the past.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nIf outages continue to occur on the Solana network, it could thoroughly impact the sentiment around Solana network and may steer some users away from the protocol.\n\nAt press time, both SOL and ETH tokens had benefited from the recent bullish sentiment rising in the crypto markets and grew by 6.6% and 3.4% respectively in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Trending memecoin Shiba Inu started the week in the red zone after a massive 100 billion SHIB tokens were transferred to the Coinbase exchange. Amid the ongoing price corrections experienced by the global crypto market, large investors are moving huge amounts of tokens, sparking speculations about the intent.\n\nToday, May 13, the general crypto market cap has fallen by 0.66% over the last 24 hours to $2.24 trillion. The prices of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped significantly. According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC and ETH are currently trading at $61k and $2,900 respectively. Consequently, the sentiment across the crypto market as measured by the crypto fear and greed index, rests at 52 points, indicating a period of investor uncertainty. Moreover, SHIB whales are carrying out hefty transactions regardless of the state of the market. Let us look at the transaction in detail.\n\nSHIB Whale Moves 100 Billion Tokens to Coinbase\n\nEarlier today, the blockchain transaction tracker, The Data Nerd, reported that it had spotted a mouthwatering amount of SHIB tokens changing hands. According to the provided data, the whale transferred a staggering 100.4 billion SHIB tokens from his wallet to the centralized exchange, Coinbase. Following this, the price of the token has suffered a loss of up to 3%.\n\n7 hours ago, a whale 0x462 just deposited 100B $SHIB (~$2.24M) to #Coinbase. Within a week, he accumulated those tokens with avg entry $0.00002408.\n\nIf sold at current price, he will have a small loss ~$178k. His address:https://t.co/NrkJwBbVb1 pic.twitter.com/cAJ7FZdRXg \u2014 The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd) May 13, 2024\n\nThe aforementioned tracker also mentioned that the whale had accumulated the Shiba Inu tokens over the week at an average price of $0.00002408. Notably, if the whale sells the holding now, he will suffer a loss of up to $178,000. With this, it is safe to say that the latest transaction is not intended for sale, but could be a part of a distribution strategy by the investor.\n\nA further look at the whale\u2019s wallet reveals that he has other tokens in holding, however, most of the recent transactions involved SHIB. For example, between May 5,6, and 7, the whale accumulated over 100 million SHIB tokens as revealed by the OKlink tracker.\n\nSHIB Price Dynamics Amid Large Transaction\n\nMeanwhile, this crypto move to the Coinbase exchange has sparked discussion across the SHIB community about the effect on the price of the token. According to CoinMarkeCap data, the price of SHIB has slumped by 3% over the last 24 hours. This is worrisome particularly because the dedicated Shiba Inu community has been anticipating a price rebound. As a result of this, its market cap has plummeted by 2.5% to $13 billion.\n\nConversely, the activities surrounding Shiba Inu, as measured by its trading volume, have witnessed a spike within the recorded time. Per CMC data, SHIB has a 24-hour trading volume of $233.7 million, signifying a 32.11% increase over the last day. Lastly, according to Coinglass data, SHIB\u2019s open interest dropped by 1.68% to $57.99 million, and the number of derivatives increased by 46.46% to $84.39 million."

It revealed this in a blog post on December 29 to its research team and customers.\n\nThe blog update also stated that the consensus layer core specs are \u201cnearing completion,\u201d revealing further that client teams are implementing and testing the withdrawal functionality.\n\nSince switching from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in mid-September 2022, enabling the withdrawal functionality for stakeholders has been one of the most anticipated milestones on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nSince its inception till date, over 15,766,262 ETH (worth over $18B) has been staked on the Beacon chain across 492,000 validators. Staking on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain first went live on December 1, 2020, with investors ultimately locked in until whenever the Ethereum developer community finalized the withdrawal functionality. Even when the function goes live, Ethereum\u2019s roadmap suggests the withdrawal will be available to users over time rather than immediately.\n\nThe most recent update from the Ethereum Foundation notably does not include a definite timeline. However, it reassures investors that the functionality is a top priority and would likely go live in 2023.\n\nEthereum continues on long-path to scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s migration to the PoS consensus mechanism earlier this year marked a significant step towards broader efforts to scale the network and improve security.\n\nIn a recent development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared an updated roadmap on how Ethereum plans to reach mainstream-level capacity. The new roadmap notably includes a new \u201cThe Scourge\u201d phase during which Ethereum will solve a long-known bottleneck around miner extractable value (MEV) transactions.\n\nAt full scale, Ethereum developers envision the network handling over 100,000 transactions per second at significantly lower fees. However, that path could take at least a few more years to achieve, with the staking unlocking function the most imminent on the list of objectives."
