        "title": "Ethereum Soars As SEC Reconsiders Spot Ether ETF Approval - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Ethereum Soars As SEC Reconsiders Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nThe price of Ethereum jumped 18% as the SEC reconsiders its position on the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF.\n\nOn Monday, new developments suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be rethinking its stance on spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have indicated a shift in the SEC\u2019s approach, raising the odds of approval from 25% to 75% after \u201chearing chatter\u201d about the financial regulator\u2019s internal discussions.\n\nAnalysts Adjust Predictions\n\nOn Monday Seyffart and Balchunas posted on X to update their predictions regarding the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Ether ETFs. \u201cThe SEC might be doing a 180 on their expected denial of spot Ether exchange-traded funds this week,\u201d wrote Balchunas. This new perspective is based on various signals, including recent SEC filings, public statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and insider reports suggesting that the commission might be leaning towards approval following political pressure on Democrats to reverse course on crypto.\n\nSeyffart echoed this sentiment, mentioning that the issue had become \u201cincreasingly political.\u201d He hinted at a surge of related filings in the coming days if their sources were correct. \u201cNever gonna hear the end of this from the [Ether] people in my replies if this turns out to be true,\u201d Seyffart remarked, highlighting the potential impact on the cryptocurrency community.\n\nUpcoming Deadlines and Broader Implications\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ether ETF is due by May 23. This decision is critical as VanEck\u2019s application is the first in a series of pending spot Ether ETFs, including those from ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity. The SEC has already delayed VanEck\u2019s application as long as allowed under regulatory guidelines, setting the stage for a potentially groundbreaking decision.\n\nEthereum soared to $3,636 on the news\n\nIn an April interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed skepticism about the SEC\u2019s approval of his company\u2019s ETF application in May. This skepticism seemed justified when Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ether futures ETF on May 7, followed by CEO Michael Sonnenshein\u2019s resignation announcement on May 20 (Cointelegraph).\n\nPolitical and Regulatory Dynamics\n\nThe evolving political landscape could also influence the SEC\u2019s decision. Recently, U.S. lawmakers in both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to overturn an SEC rule impacting banks dealing with companies holding digital assets. This congressional resolution\u2019s future remains uncertain, pending President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to either veto or sign it into law.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC has requested exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings, suggesting a potential move towards approving these applications. This request has led to speculation that the SEC might be progressing towards an approval decision. However, even if the 19b-4 filings are approved, the ETFs would still need their S-1 applications cleared before trading could commence, a process without a defined timeline.\n\nIndustry Reactions and Future Prospects\n\nOne company in talks with the SEC reported a more optimistic outlook, feeling that the regulatory body was no longer dragging its feet. This optimism is bolstered by the reassessment from Seyffart and Balchunas, who increased their approval odds based on new information and insider sources\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation into whether Ether qualifies as a security continues to add complexity to the situation. This investigation, launched after Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, could influence the SEC\u2019s final decision. A recent development from Prometheum, which launched its Ether custody service with plans to offer services for other digital assets considered securities, might also play a role in shaping the SEC\u2019s view.\n\nAs the May 23 deadline approaches, the financial and crypto communities are on high alert. The SEC\u2019s decision could significantly impact the market, setting a precedent for future cryptocurrency ETF approvals, taking crypto centre stage for the upcoming election cycle, and shaping the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States."

        "title": "Experts speak out on how high Ethereum could go with an ETF approval - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum's price nears all-time high as ETF decision fuels market optimism.\n\nShare this article\n\nTomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement \u201cis happening,\u201d despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.\n\nJames Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s case was different. \u201cIn that instance, though, everything came together \u2013 ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly \u2013 and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,\u201d he shares.\n\nAlthough Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC\u2019s movement after the funds\u2019 approval. \u201cIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.\u201d\n\nRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. \u201cIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins\u2019 growth,\u201d added Lienkha.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was \u201ca sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.\u201d As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute \u2013 implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.\n\nMarko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH \u201cwell beyond its previous all-time high.\u201d Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.\n\nWhat if\u2026?\n\nDespite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn\u2019t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.\n\nNevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange\u2019s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.\n\n\u201cWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,\u201d Jurina added.\n\nMoreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. \u201cEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.\u201d\n\nEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a \u2018layered\u2019 scenario, which could end in a \u201chard rejection\u201d or a \u201csoft rejection.\u201d A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.\n\n\u201cThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,\u201d Bitfinex analysts concluded."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Reach $5000? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "As the overall crypto market begins to show signs of strength, Ethereum, the largest altcoin, sees an overnight increase in price. The bullish resurgence takes back the psychological $3,500 mark as the underlying demand increases in tandem with the improving sentiment surrounding the approval of the Ethereum ETF.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s bull run is further fueled by the market\u2019s recovery rally, which is being supported by Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $70,000. What\u2019s the deal, then? Will the price of Ethereum surpass $5,000?\n\nHere is an overview of Ethereum:\n\nETH Price Prediction For May 2024\n\nThe Ethereum price is $3,813.68, a change of 23.79% over the past 24 hours as of 8:20 p.m. The recent price action in Ethereum left the token\u2019s market capitalization at $453.80B. So far this year, Ethereum has a change of 66.09%. The recent price jump comes along with high volume as it has surged 335% in the last 24 hours.\n\nTechnical Analysis of Ethereum\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ether\u2019s current gains are part of a falling wedge breakout.\n\nA falling wedge forms when the price moves within a descending channel with two converging trendlines. Meanwhile, as a rule of technical analysis, the pattern resolves when the price breaks above its upper trendline and rises to its peak height.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis | Source: Tradingview\n\nToday, the price surged passed the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), as it moves toward $4000, expected as the initial target of the falling wedge breakout.\n\nEther open interest, funding rate rise sharply\n\nEther\u2019s price increase coincides with a sharp increase in its open interest (OI) and funding rates.\n\nOn May 21, Ether Futures OI increased by more than $3 billion, and jumped to $14.68 billion, while the funding rate reached a one-month high of 0.567% per week.\n\nA high OI typically indicates increased investor interest and confidence in the asset, implying that traders are preparing for possible price movements.\n\nMeanwhile, a high funding rate indicates that more traders are betting on Ether\u2019s price rising (long positions) than on it falling (short positions). This suggests that traders are bullish and willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $5,000?\n\nWhile the current market conditions favor Ethereum, reaching $5,000 depends on several factors, including:\n\nOverall market trends: Continued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum.\n\nContinued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum. Regulatory developments: Approval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase.\n\nApproval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase. Ethereum-specific developments: Progress on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 could further boost investor confidence.\n\nOverall, the technical indicators and rising investor sentiment paint a bullish picture for Ethereum. However, external factors will ultimately determine whether the token can reach the $5,000 milestone."

        "content": "A lot of excitement and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts are predicting that if this approval happens, Ether could surge as high as $6,600.\n\nThe estimations come from analysts at the research firm, Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. They pointed out that a 75% increase in value occurred in the weeks that followed the SEC\u2019s approval of comparable Bitcoin WTFs in January.\n\nEthereum surged past $6,600 on speculation of SEC approval for ETFs, with a 22% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 4.5% rise. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped to $3,694. Its previous record was $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nIn research released on Tuesday, Chhugani and Sapra stated, \u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH.\u201d Two prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analysts created a stir on Monday when they increased the likelihood that an ETH ETF will be approved from 25% to 75%.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, said they revised their forecast for the ETF in response to rumors that the SEC was talking to exchanges more frequently. As previous, analysts have expressed it appears that the US\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is at a standstill.\n\nPotential SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs could take two steps: first, the ETF would need to be approved in theory, but the products wouldn\u2019t actually be sold in the market until after that. Observers of the market have interpreted this distinction favorably.\n\nConfusion has spread throughout the market as a result of the uncertainties surrounding ETF clearance, especially on prediction sites like Polymarket where users have staked $8 million on the result. Existing bets may become more complex if a two-step approval process is implemented.\n\nDuring these changes, Bitcoin has increased by 4.5% and passed over $70,000 in the last day, while Ethereum has gained 22% to $3,790. With ramifications for other applicants as well, the market is eager to see the SEC\u2019s ruling on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal."

        "content": "As the price of ether increases, the cost of running a full solo staking node \u2014 with 32 ETH now worth $115,000 \u2014 moves further out of reach for all but the most hard core hobbyists.\n\nOne of the social goals that Oisin Kyne and Collin Myers, founders of Obol Network, care about most is enabling people that don\u2019t have that kind of capital to participate in Ethereum consensus.\n\nThe pair looks forward to the day when the number of entities and locations validating the network will rise tenfold from its current crop of single-digit thousands of operators.\n\nThat includes a fellow in a Kenyan village who, according to Kyne, participates in a distributed validator cluster via EtherFi, running his hardware off a Starlink and a generator.\n\n\u201cIt certainly feels good to have people that are staking \u2014 that have the technical ability and are really into it, but either weren\u2019t in early or don\u2019t have, you know, bags \u2014 that can actually decentralize Ethereum and quite happily do it from the middle of nowhere,\u201d Kyne told Blockworks.\n\nObol has spent the past few years proving out the technology to decentralize projects like Lido, its launch partner, and to enable more solo stakers as well as new paradigms like squad staking.\n\n\u201cWe worked with [Lido] to integrate the technology into their stack, and now we\u2019re progressively opening the code base, decentralizing the community, and in the future plan to incentivize the community and bring everyone together around this contribution based mindset,\u201d Myers told Blockworks.\n\nAs a first step, Obol has announced the \u201c1% For Decentralisation\u201d funding model for the DVT middleware provider.\n\nUnder the plan, Obol\u2019s distributed validator (DV) clusters will contribute 1% of their staking rewards \u201ctoward projects that add value and impact at the Ethereum consensus layer, including technology partners, researchers, community educators, node operators, and more,\u201d according to a blog post published Tuesday.\n\nThe initiative piggybacks off the EasyRetroPGF \u2014 or Retroactive Public Goods Funding \u2014 system pioneered by GitCoin.\n\nWhereas public good funding from the Optimism Foundation focuses on the execution layer and user adoption, \u201cthere needs to be a more concerted focus around the validator, infrastructure area, the consensus integrity, that whole side of the network,\u201d the Obol founders say.\n\nMiddleware provides an interface between Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer and software further up the modular stack.\n\n\u201cThe creation of middleware enables add-on use cases to your existing experience,\u201d Myers explained. \u201cWithout middleware, it\u2019s just a boring old validator \u2014 you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nMEV Boost is one example in wide use alongside Obol today, that enables the little guy to earn similar staking yields as large professional operators. And soon validators will be able to participate in EigenLayer Actively Validated Services (AVS) or similar offerings on top.\n\n\u201cAll of this is an extension of the validator as a world-class citizen of Web3,\u201d Myers said.\n\nEthereum is sometimes criticized for the complexity of its design, or for tolerating centralizing influences in certain areas, such as block building and the scaling of the execution layer.\n\nBut Myers feels those attacks are misplaced.\n\n\u201cFrom where I sit, two years ago we went from bad rent extraction, client centralization, a completely monolithic software stack, and now we\u2019ve moved to modular, a bit more decentralized, open source, multiple options, lots of funding, good debate \u2014 and for me that\u2019s progress,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile there is some movement in the direction of ossifying the base consensus layer, he pushes back against the notion that the roadmap is decreasing innovation at layer one. Rather, \u201cthey are just enabling it to exist elsewhere through decentralization\u2026and DVT is a living example of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cstage\u201d framework used by L2beat is a useful gauge of decentralization progress, and Osin agreed with Vitalik\u2019s commitment to push \u201clayer-2s\u201d as such to reach the Stage 1 level by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting social showing, of people being like, \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to tolerate a sidechain masquerading as an L2, unless you can permissionlessly exit back to L1,\u201d Osin said.\n\nLido is backing the new Obol funding approach, with contributor Will Shannon, calling it \u201ca fantastic approach to strengthening the resilience and decentralization of the Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "How Ethereum Danksharding Will Impact Decentralized Finance - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has encountered significant challenges regarding scalability. The current mainnet can only handle 20 to 30 transactions per second (TPS), significantly lower than traditional payment systems. The high transaction fees on Ethereum have deterred users and restricted network accessibility. Initially, during the early stages of Ethereum 2.0, the leading scaling solution proposed was sharding, splitting the Ethereum network into \u201cshards\" for parallel transaction processing.\n\nHowever, due to concerns about complexity and security risks related to cross-shard communication, sharding became less favored over time. Before danksharding, other solutions, such as sharding and layer-2 scaling methods, such as rollups, were suggested to address Ethereum's scalability problems. These alternatives also had limitations in scalability and complexity, leading to the development of danksharding as a solution for scaling the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is Danksharding?\n\nDanksharding is a highly technical solution that works with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions, such as roll-ups, to improve scalability and efficiency on the Ethereum network. Ethereum\u2019s danksharding solutions aim to improve the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain by handling more transactions. This approach, part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, is crafted to outperform traditional sharding methods. In essence, danksharding segments the blockchain into fragments known as shards to process transactions and data simultaneously, enabling improved data processing without causing network congestion or increased fees.\n\nUsing larger data segments, danksharding boosts transaction capacity, enhancing the blockchain's performance. Danksharding aims to reduce transaction expenses and improve throughput by expanding block space and refining data availability. The Dencun upgrade was officially rolled out on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024. Expert analysts believe that the Dencun upgrade, which includes proto-danksharding, could be a \u201cbullish catalyst\u201d for the Ethereum price prediction in the second half of 2024, with Bed Baddow projecting the highest value the coin could reach by the end of the year is over $6400. This upgrade will impact Ethereum's price, potentially positively driving prices upwards towards this value.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Danksharding and Traditional Sharding Methods?\n\nThe main difference between danksharding and traditional sharding methods for Ethereum is the approach to scaling. Traditional sharding aimed to increase Ethereum's transaction processing capacity by dividing the network into multiple \u201cshard chains.\u201d This created a security issue for Ethereum since the multiple shards would share security at a consensus level. For instance, if the network was divided into ten shards, each shard became vulnerable to malicious attacks due to validators being spread out.\n\nTo address the security concerns with traditional sharding and the shift in Ethereum's scaling roadmap towards lay-2 solutions, danksharding was developed as a more secure and efficient scaling solution. This streamlined process is designed to simplify transactions within the network\u2019s shards, providing a more efficient path for Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nHow Will Danksharding Impact the Decentralization of Ethereum?\n\nThe impact of danksharding on the decentralization of Ethereum is a mixed bag, with potential benefits and drawbacks:\n\nPotential Benefits of Decentralization\n\n\u25cf Reduced hardware requirements for nodes: Ethereum nodes will only need to store and process data for their assigned shard rather than the entire blockchain history. This reduction in hardware and storage requirements could make it much easier for more nodes to participate in the network, potentially increasing decentralization.\n\n\u25cf Improved scalability and efficiency: Dankshanding is expected to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction processing efficiency significantly. This could potentially make the network more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users and developers, which could expand decentralization.\n\nPotential Drawbacks\n\n\u25cf Vulnerability of smaller rollups: Unlike traditional sharding, danksharding moves the validation of transactions off-chain, with the Ethereum mainnet acting as a data availability layer. However, this shift away from on-chain validation has raised concerns about the network\u2019s overall decentralization, mainly because the validation has become more centralized.\n\n\u25cf Shift from on-chain to off-chain validation: Danksharding\u2019s reliance on rollups might expose less popular rollups to security risks due to their limited number of validators. This could consolidate power and influence within well-established rollups, ultimately threatening decentralization.\n\n\u25cf Increased validator concentration: Danksharding could lead to block builders and an increase in validators receiving a larger share of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) profits. This concentration of power among smaller groups of validators can affect the overall decentralization of the network.\n\nIncreased Transaction Processing Capacity\n\nDanksharding is designed to allow Ethereum to process transactions much faster than it currently does. Ethereum transactions using danksharding have the potential to process over 100,000 TPS. This will dramatically improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, making it more compatible with traditional payment systems.\n\nAdditionally, this allows DeFi applications to handle a much larger volume of transactions, potentially reducing congestion and delays. The increased transaction processing capacity could help reinforce Ethereum\u2019s competitiveness and decentralization in the future.\n\nCompatibility with Layer-2 Solutions\n\nDanksharding is specifically designed to work with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions. This integration is expected to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of layer-2 networks, making them more competitive with alternative layer-1 blockchains. One of the biggest benefits of danksharding is its ability to reduce transaction fees up to ten times for layer-2 solutions.\n\nChallenges of Danksharding\n\nFull danksharding will take years to implement. The transition from the initial sharding proposal to the danksharding approach required a massive shift in Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, adding to the complexity of implementation.\n\nThe biggest concern and challenge of danksharding is that it compromises Ethereum\u2019s security in the long run. Many see the shift from on-chain validation as a security risk, making the network vulnerable to potential attacks. Ethereum\u2019s use of smaller rollups that handle blob-carrying transactions is seen as vulnerable due to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet\u2019s weaker protection mechanism. Ensuring the security and integrity of the network as it scales will be critical, and Ethereum would need to address this.\n\nFurthermore, the decentralization risks associated with danksharding are from its reliance on layer-2 rollup solutions, which may result in larger and more established rollup providers gaining more influence and power. Maintaining the overall decentralization of the Ethereum network is a vital consideration as the network scales and evolves.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDanksharding is a positive step in the right direction for decentralized finance on the Ethereum network. It can significantly improve scalability, efficiency, and user experience on DeFi applications. This could lead to increased adoption and growth of DeFi platforms, as the reduced costs and increased efficiency make them more attractive to institutions like crypto exchanges, wallets, blockchain gambling and gaming, and metaverse platforms."

        "title": "SEC signals possible approval of anticipated Ethereum spot ETFs - Fox Business",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is moving closer to approving a highly anticipated 'spot' Ethereum exchange-traded fund as soon as this week, FOX Business has learned.\n\nAccording to sources close to the Commission, the SEC and its Chairman Gary Gensler are taking cues from recent court rulings and prior guidance on Ethereum futures ETFs to grant nine issuers permission to offer products that track the daily price of the world's second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nSEC CHAIRMAN GENSLER'S STATEMENT ON SPOT BITCOIN ETFS\n\nWhile approval isn't certain, SEC staff have been signaling they're warming up to the idea of at least partially green lighting these products as soon as Thursday, which is the deadline for the agency to decide whether to approve so-called 19b-4 applications filed by the CBOE exchange, requesting to list Ethereum spot ETFs from VanEck and Ark Investments in partnership with 21 Shares.\n\nApproving the 19b-4 applications is the first in a two-part process where the SEC would also have to approve issuers' registration statements, known as S-1s - a process that could take several weeks - meaning the ETFs may not officially launch until later this year.\n\nCONSUMER ETFS SHOWING THE REAL INFLATION PICTURE\n\nBut an SEC blessing would be yet another significant development in the maturation of the $2 trillion crypto industry.\n\nMany had given up hope the SEC would smile on an Ethereum spot ETF, given the lack of engagement on applications and the uncertainty surrounding the Commission's thinking about Ethereum's status as a possible security.\n\nBut on Monday the SEC began actively engaging with issuers and national exchanges ahead of Thursday's deadline, which is what it did before approving eleven ETFs that tracked the daily price of Bitcoin in January.\n\nLIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE\n\nThe SEC, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nPotential ETF issuers who spoke on the condition of anonymity tell FOX Business they were surprised by what appeared to be a sudden change of heart by the agency.\n\nMany industry participants have attributed the abrupt SEC engagement to the increasing bipartisan support for the digital assets industry from Congress and former President Trump, who has said he would embrace the use of crypto and end the Biden Administration's regulatory \"hostility\" towards the industry if elected.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign updated its website to accept donations in cryptocurrency.\n\nStill, sources familiar with Gensler's thinking say he has been looking at other factors such as the court ruling involving crypto asset manager Grayscale and the Commission's prior green lighting of Ethereum futures ETFs, which came to market in October.\n\nBITCOIN'S BOUNCE IN EARLY INNINGS\n\nLast summer, a federal appeals court rejected the SEC's decision to deny Grayscale's petition to convert its GBTC Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF, saying the agency failed to make convincing arguments the bitcoin spot ETF was materially different to the futures ETF which had been trading since 2021. The Grayscale ruling laid the groundwork for the rollout of the bitcoin spot ETFs, and now, possibly the Ethereum spot ETFs as well.\n\nAccording to paperwork filed today by issuers, it appears the SEC's main sticking point for approving an Ethereum spot ETF is the so-called \"staking,\" which allows investors to earn passive income by staking their Ethereum as collateral and earning a return. In an ETF format, it may allow for investors to receive greater returns as opposed to the ones they may receive with an ETF that solely tracks the daily price of Ethereum.\n\nIt's staking by which the SEC believes it may have a case that \"Ethereum 2.0\", or Ethereum issued since the blockchain's merge to a so-called \"proof-of-stake\" consensus mechanism in 2022, may qualify as a security.\n\nIndeed, if the SEC approves the Ethereum ETFs on Thursday without the staking component, it doesn't negate the fact that Ethereum issued on today's proof-of-stake network may be a security in the eyes of the Commission. FOX Business reported in April that the SEC's Enforcement Division has been investigating Ethereum, its merge, and companies and individuals associated with it for at least a year.\n\nWhile the SEC maintains outside political factors do not influence it, there's no doubt crypto has become an increasingly political issue in recent weeks.\n\nSPOT BITCOIN ETFS: HOW TO INVEST AND WHAT IT MEANS\n\nThe Biden Administration, including Senate Democrats such as majority leader, Chuck Schumer (D-New York), appear worried that Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump could seize on the growing popularity of digital assets, particularly among young voters, and use the administration's crypto crackdown to win votes and take the White House and possibly the Senate.\n\nLast week, Schumer led a group of twelve Democrats to vote to repeal a controversial SEC rule that would limit the ability of crypto companies to get fair access to the banking system. The 60-38 vote to repeal was widely regarded as a breakthrough moment for the industry, who until recently, has grappled with a Democratic party that's shown unwavering support for Gensler and his regulatory crackdown on crypto.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House is scheduled to vote on a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, a base for establishing clarity for crypto companies and investors."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink Are Soaring - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A potentially historic decision is benefiting Ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) surged more than 25%, rising from just $3,000 to more than $3,700 at one point. This bullish momentum is primarily driven by growing anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a development that could have profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC's shift and expedited revisions\n\nFor a long time, the approval of an Ethereum ETF seemed like a distant possibility. Many analysts and market participants believed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wouldn't greenlight such an ETF, as they believed it to be a security and not a commodity like Bitcoin (BTC -1.35%), which received its own spot ETF approval in January this year.\n\nHowever, sentiment has shifted dramatically. Rumors are swirling that the SEC has requested several applicants to expedite their revisions to their 19b-4s. These applications, which are essential for listing new ETFs, must be corrected, allowing for the final approval with an S-1 application and thereby pave the way for the ETFs to start trading.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\n\nThe prospect of an Ethereum ETF is significant for several reasons. First, it would provide investors unfamiliar or uncomfortable navigating crypto exchanges and digital wallets an easy way to invest. If approved, then investors can buy the Ethereum ETF off their preferred brokerage, just as with any other stock.\n\nYet the most important aspect of a potential approval comes in the form of institutional investors. Currently, institutional investors face several hurdles when attempting to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, including custody concerns, regulatory uncertainties, and market volatility. An ETF would alleviate many of these issues, making it easier for institutional capital to flow into the Ethereum market.\n\nWith easier access, it is expected that the deep pockets of institutional investors could cause Ethereum's price to soar. The Bitcoin ETFs were already some of the most successful ETFs ever launched, and if Ethereum follows a similar path, it could result in a significant price surge.\n\nRipple effect on other cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile the focus is primarily on Ethereum, the positive sentiment has spilled over into other cryptocurrencies. Solana (SOL -0.70%), Avalanche (AVAX -0.86%), and Chainlink (LINK -1.39%) have all seen their prices rise by more than 25% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies, often referred to as \"altcoins,\" have been subject to heightened scrutiny lately because of their similarities with Ethereum, namely their proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Many agency officials believe proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are closer to a security than to a commodity. But with a potential Ethereum ETF approval this opinion might be changing and could give a boost to other proof of stake cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalysts' predictions and timelines\n\nWhile the approval of an Ethereum ETF is not yet guaranteed, analysts currently estimate a 75% chance of approval. This optimistic outlook is based on the SEC's recent actions and the growing recognition of Ethereum's importance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the earliest the ETFs could start trading is around the end of June. Applicants will need to revise and correct their applications, a process that typically takes several weeks.\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF represents a monumental shift in the regulatory landscape, offering a more accessible and secure investment vehicle for both retail and institutional investors. While the final decision is still pending, the current sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, and the approval could mark a new era of growth and adoption for the cryptocurrency market."

See\u2026 https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024\n\nJust an hour after the news spread by Balchunas, the information portal Coindesk published an article reporting some rumors from 3 different sources close to the SEC, according to which Gary Gensler and company would be asking requesting funds to quickly update the 19b-4 documents by Wednesday.\n\nThis in itself does not necessarily imply approval by the deadline date, considering that in addition to 19b-4 the SEC must carefully review the S-1 documents, and it may take longer than expected before giving a final response.\n\nCoindesk also reports that a company in negotiations with the federal entity believes that the market is on track for an imminent approval, and that ETH will not be considered as security.\n\nThe soap opera of crypto ETFs continues, started at the beginning of the year after the fake news emerged about a supposed approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, then denied by the SEC and finally confirmed a couple of weeks later.\n\nIn this case, given the reliability of the sources, we exclude the hypothesis fake news but remain on alert until the actual communication from the SEC.\n\nWe do not exclude a postponement, precisely for the reasons mentioned above regarding the S-1 document theme, and consequently a negative market reaction, with the price of ETH that could be strongly affected downwards.\n\nAll eyes are on the next two days, especially on the date of Thursday, March 23, deadline for the request of the ETF by Vaneck, even if as Bloomberg analysts affirm, the official announcement could arrive as early as Wednesday.\n\nEthereum price rises by 20% in one day thanks to the news on ETFs: local peak coming\n\nFollowing the news on the ETF ETH, with the chances of approval drastically increasing from one moment to the next, the price of Ethereum has increased sharply in just a few hours.\n\nFrom 9:00 pm yesterday until now, ETH has grown by 17.81% going from 3,150 USD to the current 3,714 USD.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the price evolution has an impact of 20%, with volumes exploding by +255%: we are talking about one of the most extreme pumps in the last years in the history of Ethereum.\n\nHourly chart of the price of Ethereum (ETH/USD), Coinbase market\n\nAs user X \u201cbx1core\u201d points out, in less than a day about 70 billion dollars of market capitalization have been added, almost as much as the entire market value of Solana.\n\nThis highlights how investors are bullish on the second largest cryptocurrency in the sector, and how their short-term sentiment depends on decisions regarding the approval or rejection of the spot ETF.\n\nIndeed, the news of an approval could bring, as happened analogously with Bitcoin, a strong inflow of institutional capital with consequent increase in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n$ETH literally added Solana\u2019s entire marketcap in one single candle\n\n\n\nSit down the king is home pic.twitter.com/eDziukrHw1 \u2014 bx1 (@bx1core) May 21, 2024\n\nIn a blink of an eye, the market outlook of Ethereum changes completely: with the latest rally, the chances of a breakout of the local high at 4,090 USD also increase in the coming days and of a subsequent breakout of the historical high set at 4,860 USD.\n\nIf the ETF is approved definitively, we could celebrate an event that will be remembered for a long time, whose effects will be visible even in the next 10 years.\n\nNow, however, maximum attention to short-term manipulations: those who know the crypto market well know that these are tempting opportunities to generate extreme volatility, perfect for making stellar gains or printing solemn losses.\n\nDO NOT BETRAY the EVENT: despite the news emerged, betting on the rise or fall at the same time as the deadline date is like flipping a coin.\n\nInstead if the goal is to accumulate ETH, a winning strategy could be to place a buy order in the price range from $3,200 to $2,900.\n\nOpen eyes and eye on market volatility: stay safe traders!"

        "title": "Ethereum is shining brightly: Crypto analysis of May 21, 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 21 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nWhile Ethereum seemed on the brink of oblivion, its price rebounded by nearly 20%. Let\u2019s examine the future prospects for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Situation\n\nAfter facing downward pressure that pushed it down to $2,900, the Ethereum price stabilized at this price level. It took waiting until the week of the final deadline for the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, for the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility to increase. Fortunately for Ethereum, expectations that became more optimistic on Monday, May 20, allowed the cryptocurrency to appreciate by over 20%. Thus, Ethereum reached a resistance level of $3,700, as noted in the analysis of May 9, 2024.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, one Ether is worth $3,650. It seems that the cryptocurrency is now stabilizing below its resistance level. These recent bullish fluctuations have allowed ETH to position itself again above its 50-day moving average, which could reassure investors about the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend. On the side of Ethereum\u2019s momentum, a notable recovery can be observed, as evidenced by the oscillators and the price of Ethereum itself. All these elements thus seem encouraging for the continuation of this movement.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, he is a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. There you will find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf the Ethereum price remains above $3,400, we could anticipate a breakthrough of $3,700. The next resistance to consider would be $3,900, or even $4,100. If the bullish movement continues, a new high at $4,400 could be marked. If Ethereum\u2019s momentum accelerates, it would not be impossible for Ethereum to reach its all-time high around $4,800. At this stage, it would represent an increase of over 31%.\n\nIf the Ethereum price fails to stay above $3,400, a return around $3,100 could be considered. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be in a price range around $3,050. At this stage, it would represent a decrease close to -17%.\n\nConclusion\n\nFollowing a period of decline, Ethereum has experienced a remarkable recovery, supported by optimistic expectations related to the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs. This positive momentum, illustrated by reaching a key resistance level and a regain of confidence among investors, suggests an encouraging trend for the cryptocurrency. However, we will have to wait for official announcements to confirm the acceptance of these ETFs and, consequently, the continuation of enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency. Thus, it will be crucial to closely observe the price reaction to different key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant in the face of potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let us remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nVitalik Buterin, the prominent co-founder of Ethereum, took to Twitter (aka X) to call for better interoperability between Ethereum layer-2 networks, suggesting that the ecosystem isn\u2019t \u201cunified\u201d amid a growing pack of networks that attempt to scale ETH in various ways.\n\n\u201cThe L2-verse doesn\u2019t feel enough like a unified Ethereum,\u201d Buterin said on Twitter. \u201cIt's much better than a year ago, but still far from perfect.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian programmer is calling for an \u201copen, decentralized, operator-free, governance-free protocol\u201d that will allow assets to be seamlessly bridged from one layer-2 network to another. This protocol should then be natively integrated into wallets, Buterin added.\n\n\u201cGet the basics done before getting too committed to any fancy toys,\u201d he said, in response to someone calling for more advanced optimizations of Ethereum scalability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe need an open decentralized (operator-free, governance-free) protocol for quickly moving assets from one L2 to another, and for that to be integrated into wallets' default sending interface. Get the basics done before getting too committed to any fancy toys. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 21, 2024\n\nCurrently, bridge options\u2014such as Optimism\u2019s Superchain\u2014are being built to allow assets to be moved from one chain to another. But that\u2019s just for chains building on the OP Stack. Buterin believes that having multiple solutions is damaging.\n\n\u201cWe need to get serious on doing this Ethereum-wide,\u201d he explained on Twitter. \u201cIf there are five separate solutions for five sub-ecosystems, that's needless fragmentation.\u201d\n\nHow could this be achieved? Buterin believes that alongside the Protocol Guild\u2014a collective of Ethereum contributors working to maintain and evolve the protocol\u2014the community should create a \u201cBasic Infrastructure Guild.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis new collective should aim to accelerate cross-layer-2 bridging solutions, develop zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs), and work on other \u201cpublic good\u201d infrastructure solutions.\n\n\u201cSet the standard that these things are ecosystem-wide public goods, and not products of individual companies,\u201d Buterin said on Twitter. \u201cThough like Linux, individual companies should absolutely be welcome to participate and even take initiative.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum took a big leap last night and early this morning on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked spot ETF applicants to submit revised 19b-4 filings.\n\nThe 19b-4 filings are what firms use to propose rule changes to the SEC. In this case, applicants would need the regulator to change their rules to allow for Ethereum spot ETFs to trade on exchanges.\n\nWhen this happened for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants in January, the industry was just days away from an historical approval of all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. There's no guarantee, of course, that things will play out quite the same as they did then. But sentiment around this week's upcoming deadline has taken a big swing and sent ripples throughout the market.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is holding above $3,600 and has seen volumes increase 219% in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStablecoin Open Dollar founder Joseph Schiarizzi noted on Twitter last night that Ethereum increased its market capitalization\u2014now $439 billion\u2014in 3 minutes by as much as half that of Ethereum competitor Solana.\n\nETH just added half of Solana's market cap in 3 minutes. \u2014 JOS\u039ePH \ud83c\udf69 (@CupOJoseph) May 20, 2024\n\nDelegate Labs and Clusters founder Foobar noted on Twitter that the spike in price had created the largest ETHUSD daily candle in history as the price went from $3,070 to $3,661.\n\nMeanwhile the open interest, or open ETH futures contracts, has swelled 26% in the past day to $15 billion. And call options\u2014which are opened by optimistic traders who think the price of an asset is going to increase\u2014outnumber put options almost 2:1, according to Coinglass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere's now $3 billion worth of open interest in Ethereum options that expire at the end of May and June.\n\nThe potential approval, or at least a step towards it, has gotten analysts wondering how the SEC could grant an approval while also fighting court battles over ETH's status as a security.\n\n\"If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between 'ETH' NOT being a security and 'staked ETH' (or even more flimsily, 'staking as a service ETH') as BEING a security,\" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote on Twitter.\n\nif the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the ethereum ETFs is true, i would guess they try to thread a needle between \u201cETH\u201d NOT being a security and \u201cstaked ETH\u201d (or even more flimsily, \u201cstaking as a service ETH\u201d) as BEING a security. that would be somewhat congruent with\u2026 \u2014 Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) May 21, 2024\n\nJust a month ago, Ethereum software giant Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC over its attempts to regulate ETH like a security. It was only a few weeks ago that court filings from that lawsuit revealed that a leaked internal memo from the SEC showed that the regulator has considered Ethereum to be a security for more than a year.\n\nIf the SEC does approve spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading, Singapore trading firm QCP Capital predicts ETH could quickly close the gap to $4,000 and rise as high as $5,000 before the end of the year.\n\n\"\u2060If not approved, we could expect an ugly move back to 3k,\" the firm wrote in a blog post. \"This uncertainty has resulted in higher volatility, but the better trade might be spot-futures basis which is now yielding above 10% again.\"\n\n(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt)\n\nAD\n\nAD"
