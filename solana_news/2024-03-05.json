        "title": "Experts see two factors driving Ethereum to $10,000 in catch-up rally with Bitcoin - DLNews",
        "content": "Bitcoin's all-time high cranks up pressure on Ether to follow suit.\n\nInvestors are counting on Ether ETFs to spur gains.\n\nAn Ethereum upgrade is on the way.\n\nBitcoin just hit a new high, and the wider crypto market is now worth more than $2.6 trillion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s not been lost in the bullish run-up, rallying more than 65% since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s impressive, but sitting at $3,809 in late afternoon trading UK time Wednesday, Ether is still 21% below its all-time high of $4,800.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nIn a word, time.\n\nSzymon Sypniewicz, CEO of crypto onboarding solution Ramp, said it may simply take longer for the market to understand Ethereum\u2019s complexity, especially \u201ccompared to the much simpler idea of Bitcoin as digital gold.\u201d\n\nNew financial system\n\nEthereum lovers have long argued the second most valuable blockchain network will be the infrastructure of an entirely new financial system.\n\nThrough smart contracts, supporters point to a future with more transparent markets, tokenised versions of popular funds, and faster settlement times.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOthers say it\u2019s only a matter of time before institutional investors take bigger positions in Ether. And the advent of Bitcoin ETFs may be increasing their appetite.\n\n\u201cETH hasn\u2019t hit its institutionalised hype cycle yet,\u201d like Bitcoin has, Robby Greenfield, co-founder and CEO of payments protocol Umoja Labs, told DL News. \u201cThus, the vast majority of new inflows from the BTC ETF will naturally lead toward greater buy pressure, along with the upcoming BTC halving,\u201d\n\nGreenfield predicted that Ethereum will close the gap with Bitcoin in terms of its gains.\n\nHe told DL News the cryptocurrency should \u201cclear $10,000 this year.\u201d\n\nGreenfield added that an Ethereum ETF approval would undoubtedly help drive up its value. He joins a host of industry players counting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to follow up its January approval of Bitcoin ETFs with a green light for Ether.\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u2019 \u2014 Eugene Cheung, Bybit\n\n\u201cAn ETH ETF should naturally be approved,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH \u2014 one of the world\u2019s premier risk assets \u2014 in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but the SEC, and especially its hard-charging chair, Gary Gensler, may take a different approach to an Ether ETF.\n\nGensler acknowledged reluctantly clearing the way for Bitcoin after the commission lost a court ruling in its effort to stop Grayscale from converting its BTC trust into an ETF.\n\nThere is no such court case driving decision-making on an ETH ETF.\n\nThe SEC is expected to weigh in on a slew of different Ethereum ETF applicants, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, in May.\n\nCrypto prediction market Polymarket puts the odds of approval at 43%. JPMorgan\u2019s latest analysis gives it a 50% chance.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called an Ethereum ETF \u201csmall potatoes,\u201d characterising it as \u201cthe opening act coming on after the headliner.\u201d\n\nEthereum upgrade\n\nJPMorgan does, however, point to another catalyst for Ethereum: the Dencun upgrade, which is designed to help the network scale up by cutting costs for various rollup solutions on the market.\n\nRollups batch crypto transactions, be they simple swaps or borrowing activity, into much smaller chunks of data.\n\nThese small chunks are then settled on Ethereum, reducing the overall data footprint on the network.\n\nBybit\u2019s Cheung says this is good news for Ethereum supporters.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d he told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nUnlike Bitcoin\u2019s automated halving event, Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade does not regulate the cryptocurrency\u2019s scarcity. In contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s pre-programmed 21 million token cap, Ethereum\u2019s supply is infinite.\n\nNot a sure thing\n\nStill, the upgrade\u2019s success isn\u2019t a sure thing for the asset\u2019s price performance.\n\nThe layer 1 competition is heating up, and one exec says Ethereum may even be overtaken this cycle.\n\n\u201cGiven the network\u2019s poor performance during periods of high activity and the proliferation of alternative layer 1 protocols that have optimised for Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings, Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-ranked cryptocurrency is not necessarily guaranteed this cycle,\u201d CMO of crypto exchange VALR, Ben Caselin, told DL News.\n\nLiam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

        "content": "Public comments are due in the next 21 days, and rebuttals are due in 35 days.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced in a filing submitted Monday that it will be extending its decision timeline on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal. Aside from Blackrock, the regulator has also delayed its decision on another ETF proposal by crypto firm Fidelity.\n\nThe SEC can delay decisions up to three times before arriving at a final decision, with the first deadline in May. According to the filing, the SEC is opening the approval of Ethereum ETFs to public comments to \u201caddress the sufficiency\u201d of the proposal.\n\nIn particular, the SEC has raised concerns on the \u201cnature of the underlying assets\u201d held by the iShares Ethereum Trust. Comments for both Fidelity and BlackRock are due in the next 21 days, and rebuttals are due in 35 days.\n\nThe SEC framed its concerns on the matter with the following question:\n\n\u201cAre there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulations?\u201d\n\nBoth BlackRock and Fidelity filed for their spot Ethereum ETFs in November last year, with other firms like Franklin Templeton, Ark 21Shares, VanEck, and Grayscale soon following suit. However, the SEC announced a delay last January and extended the initial 45-day review period, citing more time to read the proposals. The SEC had also approved ETFs on the same day, except this was for Bitcoin.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler was also quick to temper potential criticisms and clarify that the SEC has no ulterior motives and that the delays \u201cshouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d\n\nAn ETF is a pooled investment security that can be purchased or sold in the same manner as an individual stock, though it differs from a mutual fund in that the latter only trades once a day after market close.\n\nAnalysts and market commentators are ambivalent about when the final decision will be handed and whether BlackRock\u2019s ETF will get the green light. The policy environment in the United States could affect the decision and the relative success of crypto-based ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF currently holds a record-breaking $10 billion in assets under management.\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs has spurred the price of ETH, which is currently up 7.1% at the $3,700 level, according to data from CoinGecko."

        "title": "Beyond ETH: 3 Cryptos That Are a Better Bet Than Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Over the last 15 years, cryptocurrencies have existed. And as long as these digital assets have proliferated, they\u2019ve done so with volatility.\n\nThe entire market capitalization of the crypto sector peaked right around $3 trillion during the height of the last hype-driven mania in 2021. However, a so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019 ensued in the last couple years, with the sector bottoming out around $900 billion. At the time of writing, the entire market is moving quickly toward a $2.5 trillion valuation, with plenty of momentum to break through to new highs.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is certainly one of the top tokens leading the way higher, alongside the king of crypto Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Yet, there could be other more lucrative options in this sector for long-term investors seeking even greater upside. Let\u2019s dive into three such tokens.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana Crypto currency Gold Solana SOL. Close up on white background Blockchain concept 3d rendering\n\nSource: pasit chomying / Shutterstock.com\n\nA well-known \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d Solana (SOL-USD) might be an excellent option to consider instead of Ethereum.\n\nThis proof-of-stake network is built on an intriguing proof-of-history consensus mechanism. Essentially, that means Solana uses time stamps to speed up the sorting of transactions. Doing so allows the network to process multiples of the typical order flow at a fraction of the cost.\n\nTherefore, this speed and cost advantage are reasons most investors like Solana. The network has become synonymous with the NFT space, given the fact that many transactions are for smaller dollar amounts. Ethereum\u2019s network, which can charge hefty gas fees for its usage, isn\u2019t as well-suited for such purposes. Hence, the real-world utility Solana has been able to generate.\n\nAdditionally, while Ethereum focuses more on gradual upgrades, Solana is known for innovative solutions such as their Saga phone and successful crypto strategies. These high-growth strategies make this token more compelling for those seeking outsized gains, at least during this bull market rally.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) crypto coins on a black background\n\nSource: Skorzewiak / Shutterstock\n\nIt was only in 2020 when Ava Labs launched Avalanche (AVAX-USD). This new blockchain offers seamless automated contract executions through its smart contract support. Also, Avalanche focuses on enhancing scalability and usability. This allows the blockchain to handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nOne of the best features investors love about Avalanche compared to Ethereum is its relative cost-effectiveness. Like Solana, Avalanche offers transaction fees that are a fraction of the cost, which is rare for other blockchains to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the time of writing, Avalanche is the 10th-largest crypto based on market capitalization. AVAX\u2019s consensus protocol facilitates node collaboration, ensuring transaction processing. It boosts security by randomly verifying validators\u2019 confirmations, enhancing transaction legitimacy. Additionally, its three-blockchain structure resolves common blockchain issues, offering scalability, interoperability, and user-friendliness. This sets Avalanche apart in the blockchain sector and is the core thesis for owning this token for the long-term.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStanding out due to its strong focus on sustainability and security, Cardano (ADA-USD) places third in the list of cryptos to buy instead of Ethereum. Utilizing smart contracts via the Alonzo upgrade, ADA offers lucrative investment prospects. Predictions suggest Cardano could surge to new all-time highs, as soon as this August. The jury remains out on that, but I do think this is a mega-cap token many investors will be watching closely.\n\nMuch of that has to do with Cardano\u2019s impressive user growth. Total wallets on the Cardano network are nearing 4.6 million, with active daily addresses surpassing 30,000 and peaking at 64,568 on February 16. This spike in interest hints at growing demand for Cardano, signaling more upside could be on the short-, medium- and long-term horizon.\n\nI think Cardano\u2019s relative value proposition is intriguing, but I wouldn\u2019t be the farm on this one. Even still, Cardano can be viewed as a diversification play for investors looking to build a well-rounded crypto portfolio. In that regard, this network, with its strong fundamental growth metrics, appears appealing at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Beyond ETH: 3 Cryptos That Are a Better Bet Than Ethereum appeared first on InvestorPlace."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price continues to advance towards $4,000 despite market-wide liquidations and the U.S. SEC postponing a decision on Blackrock and Fidelity ETH ETF filings.\n\nEthereum traders have doubled bullish positions despite a major setback to institutional participation on the pioneer smart contract network and intense market volatility recorded on Mar. 6.\n\nMarket analysis explores how this show of conviction among speculative traders could impact the ongoing ETH price rally in the near-term.\n\nEthereum price reclaims $3,900 despite bearish headwinds\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rose 9%, soaring from $3,500 to a peak of $3,900 within the daily timeframe on Mar. 6. The latest wave of ETH price rally is remarkable, as ETH defied downward pressure from two major bearish events.\n\nThe crypto markets suffered intense volatility as investors who booked profits when BTC claimed a new all-time high on Mar. 5 inadvertently triggered over $1 billion in liquidations.\n\nPreviously, crypto.news also reported that the U.S. SEC had postponed its decision on Blackrock and Fidelity\u2019s filings to launch an Ethereum ETF product.\n\nDespite two crucial events, ETH added another $48 billion to its market cap within the daily timeframe on Mar. 6, breaking past $3,900 for the first time in three years.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price gained 9% on Mar. 6 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nIt was previously anticipated that the SEC would provide a verdict as early as April 2024. Still, the latest development means that the May 7 deadline on Vanguard\u2019s application is now the most significant date for a possible ETH ETF approval verdict.\n\nThe launch of the Ethereum ETF is expected to open the floodgates of institutional demand, as observed in the Bitcoin markets over the past month.\n\nTypically, news of such a verdict delay from the SEC, could put instant downward pressure on the price of the underlying asset. Remarkably, ETH defied the bears\u2019 soaring 9% within 24 hours of the postponement hitting the newsreels.\n\nBullish traders keep ETH funding rates elevated\n\nThe dominant bullish expectations and positive buzz surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem ahead of the upcoming Dencun upgrade were vital catalysts for ETH\u2019s resilient price performance on Mar. 6.\n\nMarket data shows that ETH speculative traders have maintained their bullish conviction, even as BTC and other mega-cap altcoins experienced major liquidations.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Funding Rates metric presents a daily aggregate of fees paid between holders of perpetual futures contracts for a specific crypto asset. Fluctuations in funding rate trends offer insights into speculative traders\u2019 inclinations regarding short-term price movements.\n\nThe chart below shows that the ETH funding rate remained at elevated positive values above 0.05% since Feb. 27, when ETH prices first broke above the $3,500 milestone price.\n\nDespite the bearish headwinds on Mar. 6, ETH bulls did not exit their positions. Instead, they doubled down on bullish positions, driving the funding rate to a 2024 peak of 0.09%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Funding rate vs. Price | March 2024 | Source: Santiment\n\nElevated levels in funding rates suggest that traders are overwhelmingly confident of further short-term price upswings and, as a result, offer higher fees to keep contracts open.\n\nUnsurprisingly, ETH\u2019s price quickly soared above $3,900 within the subsequent 24 hours following the spike in funding rate. If this rare market trend persists, according to historical trends, it\u2019s only a matter of time before ETH\u2019s price breaks above the $4,000 mark.\n\nEthereum price prediction: $4,500 retest only a matter of time?\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey to having a listed ETF in the U.S. may have suffered a setback. However, its path toward reclaiming the $4,000 price level still appears unhindered, considering the growing bullish conviction observed in the ETH derivatives markets.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s global in/out of money chart further affirms this stance: The latest price upswing on Mar. 6 effectively sent the percentage of profitable ETH holders above 97%.\n\nProfitable holders are often reluctant to sell during a bullish market phase, hence, ETH is likely to maintain a relatively high support level above $3,500 as it consolidates before its next leg-up.\n\nHowever, in the event of another bullish upswing, the bulls now have only the $3,992 resistance level to beat on its way to new peaks above $4,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction | March 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs seen above, 1.3 million addresses had acquired 493,080 ETH at the minimum price of $3,992. Hence, if Ethereum\u2019s price can establish a steady support level above that range, a move towards new peaks above $4,500 could be on the horizon as predicted."

        "content": "Though former President Donald Trump is famous for many things, Ethereum trading is not usually something that comes to mind for most. However, Trump dealt in Ethereum in recent months, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The blockchain analytics company cross-references on-chain transactions with financial filings made by a Donald Trump account to find the former President's wallet address.\n\nIn December 2023, Trump sent more than 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.4 million. However, ETH has since performed very well, and the former president may be wishing that he held on for longer.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nBitcoin has jumped nearly 50% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nIf Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH that he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth more than $4 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,700 today. By selling in December, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, some expect the price of ETH to continue going up in the near term. The chain is expected to unveil new upgrades soon, which will increase speeds and security while lowering costs. The potential for spot Ethereum ETFs as early as May 2024 could provide another boost for the token.\n\nWhile Trump may be regretting his sale, the ETH was essentially free for him. He obtained the tokens through an NFT project that used his name, image and likeness and gave Trump royalties.\n\nThe project, called Trump Digital Trading Cards, was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. As of right now, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time).\n\n\u2014\n\nTrending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets \u2014 has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?\n\n\u2014\n\nAdditionally, the project has generated more than 15,000 ETH in trading volume, which is what has allowed Trump to amass his ETH holding. In total, Trump has received nearly 1,500 ETH from the project.\n\nHowever, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump announced the release of another project in late 2023. The project is largely similar to the original project but carries some much more personalized rewards. For example, those who buy more than 47 NFTs, priced at $99 each, will receive a physical piece of the suit Trump was wearing in his infamous Georgia mugshot. Other rewards include autographed cards and even a dinner with Trump himself.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Trump continues to earn royalties and does well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he handles his ETH position going into the presidential election in November.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had if He Didn't Sell His Ethereum originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Top 6 Memecoins Surges Rapidly While Bitcoin Experienced Huge Spike & Ethereum Shine - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been commanding significant attention in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. BTC is edging closer to its previous all-time high, while ETH has exhibited remarkable resilience by overcoming substantial resistance levels. Despite these notable performances, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, with numerous altcoins demonstrating impressive growth trajectories. Memecoins, in particular, have emerged as focal points, drawing attention with their exceptional gains.\n\nTop 6 Memecoins Rapid Surge\n\nWithin the realm of memecoins, Pepe (PEPE) has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing an unprecedented surge of 400% over the past week. At its pinnacle, the memecoin reached an impressive peak of $0.00000766. Presently, PEPE continues to maintain momentum, trading at $0.00000716, marking a substantial 32.80% increase in price and an impressive 80% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nDogwifhat (WIF) has captured significant interest, boasting a weekly surge exceeding 338%. The memecoin currently valued at $1.63, WIF showcases stability despite a marginal 6.81% decrease in price, accompanied by a modest 8.56% decline in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nFloki (FLOKI) has also made waves within the cryptocurrency community, exhibiting a remarkable 320% gain over the past week. Presently the memecoin is trading at $0.0001536, FLOKI demonstrates resilience with a slight 4.23% increase in price, juxtaposed with a notable 26% decrease in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nBonk (BONK) Solana based memecoin has witnessed a surge of over 205% in the past week, currently trading at $0.00003664. Despite experiencing a significant 45% increase in price, BONK also boasts a remarkable 108% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours, indicating heightened investor interest.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) a well known memecoin has showcased robust growth, boasting a notable 178% increase over the last week and currently trading at $0.00002711. With a commendable 22% rise in price and a modest 2% increase in trading volume within the last 24 hours, SHIB continues to captivate market participants.\n\nThe pioneering memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has recorded impressive gains of 92% over the last week, trading at $0.1674. DOGE has experienced an 18% increase in price and an impressive 80% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours, underscoring its enduring appeal within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, several altcoins, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Solana (SOL), have reported substantial gains in their weekly charts. BCH surged by an impressive 70%, ADA by 33%, DOT by 31%, and SOL by 28%, as per data sourced from CoinMarketCap, further illustrating the widespread bullish sentiment pervading the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has recently surged, surpassing the $66,000 mark. As of the latest update, BTC is priced at $66,256, boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $65.53 billion and a market capitalization of $1.30 trillion. Notably, BTC has seen a 6.02% increase in price within the last 24 hours, with an impressive gain of 28% over the past week.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst CryptoCon has conveyed an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory, hinting at a potential early Christmas for enthusiasts of the digital asset. This optimism follows Bitcoin\u2019s recent breakthrough of a significant resistance level just a fortnight ago. Subsequent to this breakthrough, two new price targets have emerged: Level 3, marked at $85,334, and the Cycle Top Band, positioned at $115,000.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the indication of $115,000 as the cycle top by the Cycle Top Band isn\u2019t set in stone. Historical data indicates that Bitcoin often surpasses previous all-time highs (ATHs), leading to an upward extension of the bands and the possibility of attaining even loftier prices. Therefore, while $115,000 may appear to be a significant milestone, it might not signify the ultimate peak.\n\nThe significance of the Cycle Top Band only materializes when Bitcoin\u2019s price interacts with it, signaling a potential conclusion of the cycle. This methodology has proven effective in the past, with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements aligning with this pattern throughout the last three cycles.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum (ETH) has broken out from a major resistance level of $3,500. Currently, ETH is priced at $3,560.83, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $23.33 billion and a market capitalization of $427.77 billion. Over the last 24 hours, ETH has observed a 3.63% increase in price and a notable 14% surge over the past week.\n\nEthereum is currently positioned for significant growth, as underscored by insights from Rekt Capital, a prominent crypto analyst. Rekt Capital points out that Ethereum has recently surpassed its Macro Range, which was previously marked in red, indicating a significant breakthrough in its price movement. This development signals a potential shift in the market dynamics.\n\nHowever, in order to sustain this upward momentum, Ethereum now faces the crucial task of solidifying the former resistance level represented by the orange zone as a new support level. This transition is essential for Ethereum to consolidate its gains and pave the way for further price appreciation. Successfully establishing this support level would provide a strong foundation for Ethereum to ascend to higher price levels with greater stability and confidence.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, the current trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s price action is encouraging. The market sentiment is optimistic, reflecting growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects and its ability to navigate through evolving market conditions."

        "content": "Binance\u2019s Web3 wallet has integrated a brand-new Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s users can now use the wallet to complete transfers to and from the Blast Network, which offers native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\nBlast launched its mainnet last week and says it has already clocked more than $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL).\n\nTVL refers to the amount of capital deposited within a protocol\u2019s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem.\n\nSome members of the crypto community have expressed skepticism about the new Ethereum scaler. Back in November, Jarrod Watts, a senior developer relations engineer at Polygon Labs, argued that Blast wasn\u2019t actually a layer-2.\n\n\u201cThe Blast smart contract: 1/ Accepts funds from users. 2/ Stakes users\u2019 funds into protocols like LIDO.

        "title": "ETHDenver 2024: 3 Top Takeaways - Unchained",
        "content": "The festival saw a more than 33% increase to 20,000 visitors compared to last year. What do the attendees and presenters tell us about the future of Ethereum and crypto in general?\n\nAs the seventh annual ETHDenver drew to a close on Sunday, reflecting on who came and presented offers a hint at the future of Ethereum and crypto generally. The festival announced it had more than 20,000 attendees this year, a more than 33% increase from last year\u2019s 15,000 unique visitors. Among them were founders and developers of layer 2 and non-Ethereum projects as well as members of the U.S. government and a presidential candidate.\n\nLooking at the attendees and presenters of ETHDenver 2024, here are three takeaways about the future of Ethereum and crypto in general.\n\nRead more: ETHDenver\u2019s 2024 Hackathon: Onchain Security, AI, and Gaming Fun Dominate the Winning Projects\n\nTakeaway #1: Horizontal May Be the Answer to Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Problem\n\nEthereum has long had a scalability problem. When the number of transactions and users increases substantially on Ethereum, the blockchain network suffers in performance, marked by high levels of gas fees. Layer two (L2) rollups, which have been endorsed by the blockchain\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin since Oct. 2020, are seen as the answer to the scalability problem.\n\nThe number of L2s has substantially grown in the past couple of years as data analytics website L2Beat shows that there are 44 L2 projects currently.\n\nDespite the proliferation of scalability solutions in the form of L2s, \u201cwe are starting to see a lot of limitations on the performance of L2\u2026 notably recently with Inscriptions,\u201d Kenny Li, co-founder of L2 Manta, said to Unchained in an interview. For example, Arbitrum suffered an outage in Dec. 2023 because of a surge in inscriptions.\n\nLi said, \u201cThe scalability problem is not solved at all, especially when we\u2019ve talked about these killer apps, these 1 billion users\u2026 Most of these L2s are not going to be able to sustain 1 million active users, and so now the question is: what do we do next?\u201d\n\nWhile L2s offer faster and cheaper transactions than the base layer of Ethereum, they suffer from fragmentation. An application on one L2 can\u2019t efficiently communicate with the version of itself on a different chain, can\u2019t share liquidity, nor access the same user base, according to Li.\n\nPolygon co-founder Brendan Farmer noted a similar observation. \u201cIf we think about the current state of crypto, we\u2019re limited by infrastructure, and so we believe that in order to capture latent demand that we think exists, we need to remove the scaling limitations.\u201d\n\nFor both Manta\u2019s Li and Polygon\u2019s Farmer, how the crypto space progresses forward with widespread adoption is through \u201chorizontal scalability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where we can solve it, [scalability], in the sense of it\u2019s not going to be through one singular L2, or L3 even. It\u2019s going to be through horizontal scalability,\u201d Li indicated. \u201cInstead of just having the [transactions per second] of one L2, you can take advantage of the TPS of all the different L2s that are existing today that way applications when they need to scale their user base, they can look across all these L2s and say, \u2018Okay this one\u2019s got the TPS I need currently and start running compute through that\u2026 I think that\u2019s very akin to a very tried and true model, which is cloud computing.\u201d\n\nRemoving limitations on infrastructure, according to Farmer, is the ability to scale horizontally through Polygon\u2019s aggregation layer. \u201cThe way we think about the agg layer is, it\u2019s this piece of shared infrastructure that provides unified liquidity and composability and a user base that\u2019s accessible to any chain and there\u2019s no requirement to join the agg layer.\u201d\n\nThe focus on horizontal scalability has provided a sense of optimism for Farmer. \u201cThis is the first time where it\u2019s felt like there are real solutions to infrastructure problems that have been facing us for a long time. We can see in the distance the way to build an internet scale crypto ecosystem that is not limited by a lot of the infrastructure bottlenecks that we faced in the past,\u201d Farmer said.\n\nTakeaway #2: Ecosystems Merging\n\nETHDenver, as its name suggests, has historically been the home of Ethereum enthusiasts, contributors, and developers, and yet the annual community gathering has attracted individuals and communities from other blockchain networks, notably Solana and Bitcoin, demonstrating the growing overlap between the various sub ecosystems within the crypto space.\n\nOne of the talks on the mainstage was about how projects such as Eclipse, Neon, Monad, and Polygon were merging Solana and Ethereum together. One of the speakers, Polygon advisor Ajit Tripathi, praised both Ethereum\u2019s culture of research and Solana\u2019s product first, engineering culture, saying \u201cthese two things need to come together.\u201d\n\nSukanya Parashar, senior integration engineer for Neon EVM, which is based on Solana, said on stage, \u201cWe wanted something to build for the Ethereum community so that they easily can deploy their existing apps on Solana and get Solana\u2019s benefits of high transaction speed, low gas fees and of course parallel execution.\u201d\n\nCosmos, another blockchain network, is also seeing an overlap with the Ethereum community. \u201cWe\u2019re headed towards an industry where the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem are slowly converging\u2026 For example, there are rollups on Ethereum right now that are secured by Celestia DA,\u201d said Avril Dutheil, a core contributor of Cosmos-based chain Neutron, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nCelestia, as a standard Cosmos-SDK based blockchain that is known for its data availability services, is \u201can example of Cosmos actually securing Ethereum,\u201d Dutheil added.\n\nSimilarly to those in the Solana and Cosmos ecosystem, Bitcoiners are learning from the experiments happening on Ethereum. In fact, \u201cthere\u2019s an amazing opportunity to learn from everything that has already happened in Ethereum,\u201d Muneeb Ali, the co-creator of layer 2 Bitcoin network Stacks, said in a talk called, \u201cHave Fun Staking Turing Incomplete: What Bitcoin Builders Borrowed From Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDavid Tse, co-founder of BabylonChain and professor at Stanford University, said in the same talk that 1,200 people showed up to a Bitcoin event at ETHDenver, highlighting the synergy between Bitcoiners and Ethereum contributors.\n\n\u201cThe event was to showcase that there are synergies between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, and other ecosystems\u2026 Maximalism is not great, and I think if you work together, we can achieve much bigger things and just grow the piece,\u201d said co-panelist Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of BOB, a hybrid L2 between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nTakeaway #3: Politicians Recognize the Importance of Crypto\n\nThe United States federal government has not been friendly toward crypto, but three government officials and candidates came to ETHDenver to discuss how they hope to change the relationship.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, local congressional representative Brittany Petterson (D-CO), and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., each spoke on the mainstage.\n\nPeirce lamented the lack of regulatory clarity from the agency she currently serves, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, saying, \u201cIf you really want to sort the bad behavior from the good behavior, having rules that are clear to people who want to follow them is a much better approach.\u201d\n\nWhen CoinDesk\u2019s Jennifer Sanasie asked Petterson about how to stop American crypto startups from leaving the U.S. and setting up in regions with more regulatory clarity, Petterson said that the flight of investments \u2014 crypto or not \u2014 is a concern of hers in general.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s in question whether or not we will even do our job and pay our bills as the United States of America, if you can even believe that\u2019s how bad it\u2019s gotten at the federal level. And so our inability to govern, our inability to regulate and change with changing times as quickly as technology is innovating and [as] our economy is innovating, that is a huge problem for our long-term success as a country,\u201d Pettersen said on ETHDenver\u2019s main stage.\n\nKennedy Jr. emphasized his alignment with the crypto community, saying how he was going to \u201cend the war against all cryptocurrencies,\u201d in his press conference at ETHDenver.\n\n\u201cWe need the infrastructure for transactional freedom in this country so that people can use Bitcoin and they feel comfortable\u2026 There\u2019s a million ways to do that and I want to explore everything,\u201d he said. The political discussions at ETHDenver boil down to the prominent and growing intersection between the crypto industry and the U.S. government."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and mature, investors are constantly looking for information on the future performance of important digital assets like Ethereum (ETH), analysts believe that ETH predictions could reach up to 5,000 USD by the end of the year.\n\nThanks to its solid blockchain technology and versatile applications, Ethereum has emerged as a protagonist in the crypto space, attracting both investors and developers.\n\nLooking ahead to the end of 2024, let\u2019s analyze the factors that determine Ethereum\u2019s forecasts for this period.\n\nThe market dynamics that have led Ethereum price forecasts to $5,000\n\nBefore diving into future projections, it is essential to evaluate the current market dynamics of Ethereum. According to the latest data, Ethereum is trading at 3,801. This valuation reflects Ethereum\u2019s constant growth trajectory, supported by key updates and increasing adoption in various sectors.\n\nThe recent performance of Ethereum has been influenced by several factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, and market sentiment. The implementation of the Shapella upgrade in April 2023 has contributed to a significant surge in prices, highlighting the impact of protocol improvements on investor confidence.\n\nLooking ahead to the end of 2024, Ethereum is set to undergo further developments and updates that could influence its trajectory. The anticipated Dencun upgrade, expected in the coming years, is set to introduce improvements aimed at increasing scalability, security, and functionality.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is a milestone that could influence its long-term sustainability and performance. By replacing the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model with PoS, Ethereum aims to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact, aligning with the market\u2019s growing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations.\n\nRegulatory developments also play a crucial role in shaping Ethereum\u2019s prospects. As governments around the world address the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies, clarity and compliance measures could have an impact on investor sentiment and market dynamics.\n\nPrice forecasts and analysts\u2019 insights\n\nSeveral analysts and experts offer insights on the potential price trajectory of Ethereum by the end of 2024. Cryptonewz predicts that ETH could reach $5,000 by the end of the year, thanks to fundamental factors such as protocol upgrades, increasing adoption, and broader market trends.\n\nFurthermore, the bullish sentiment surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), could fuel demand and drive price appreciation. These innovative use cases demonstrate the versatility and utility of Ethereum beyond traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, market volatility and external factors such as geopolitical events or macroeconomic trends could introduce uncertainties and fluctuations in the price trajectory of Ethereum. It is essential for investors to consider risk factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.\n\nBeyond price predictions, investor sentiment and adoption trends provide valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects. As more institutions and retail investors embrace cryptocurrencies as an asset class, Ethereum is poised to benefit from increased liquidity and demand.\n\nFurthermore, the vibrant Ethereum developer community continues to drive innovation and build decentralized applications (DApps) in various sectors, from finance to gaming to supply chain management. This ongoing growth of the ecosystem strengthens Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform and enhances its utility and value proposition.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s predictions for the end of 2024 remain influenced by a combination of technological developments, regulatory factors, market dynamics, and investor sentiment. While price predictions offer guidance, it is essential to consider the broader ecosystem and fundamental factors that determine Ethereum\u2019s trajectory.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and mature, its ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions will be crucial to sustain its growth and relevance. By staying informed and monitoring key developments, investors can make informed decisions and navigate with confidence in the dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Polymer, an Ethereum rollup that is hoping to become Ethereum\u2019s interoperability hub, has launched the Polyverse Testnet, becoming the latest team hoping to tackle blockchain interoperability.\n\nThe testnet will be launched in three phases dubbed \u2018Basecamp,\u2019 \u2018Into the Unknown\u2019 and \u2018Discovery.\u2019 The first phase, Basecamp, will be live starting today and is designed to incentivize developers to facilitate liquidity onto the testnet from other rollups.\n\nPhase 2, Into the Unknown, will commence the following week, where Polymer will select a handful of decentralized apps to promote to end users, who will also be able to receive rewards. Then the final phase, Discovery, will focus on refining and optimizing incentive mechanisms to drive participation.\n\nThe blockchain interoperability problem\n\nLike many cross-chain messaging and bridging protocols today, Polymer was created to solve the issue of blockchain interoperability.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBlockchain ecosystems today remain relatively isolated from one another, meaning they can not communicate or interact with each other \u2014 creating terrible user experiences for their customers.\n\nAn example of this in Web2 would be being unable to send emails from your Gmail account to an Outlook account.\n\nTo address the communication barrier, cross-chain messaging protocols and other interoperability solutions have sprung into life as a means to enable blockchains to safely transfer valuable information to each other.\n\nThis type of infrastructure is critical to blockchain scaling, as evidenced by the attention and interest it has received from investors.\n\nWormhole, one of the largest cross-chain messaging solutions today, secured $225 million in a private token sale, which saw interest from Brevan Howard, Coinbase Ventures and Multicoin Capital late last year.\n\nSimilarly, LayerZero locked in a seven-figure Series B fundraise, where investors from a16z, OKX Ventures and Sequoia Capital gave the protocol $120 million to expand its operations.\n\nPolymer also recently revealed that it acquired $23 million to bring Cosmos SDK\u2019s inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol to Ethereum.\n\nRead More: Polymer Labs secures $23M to bring IBC to Ethereum\n\nPolymer\u2019s approaches to interoperability\n\nUnlike many interoperability protocols today, Polymer is not designed as a third-party bridge but rather as a layer-2 Ethereum rollup solution that serves a similar purpose to the \u2018interoperability hub\u2019 on Cosmos. It aims to provide IBC to Ethereum and connect with other layer-2 solutions.\n\nIBC, unlike many other interoperability solutions today, is not a bridge application but a network standard, Devain Pal Bansal, a product analyst at Polymer Labs, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThe biggest benefit of introducing it to Ethereum, particularly Ethereum rollups, is that it extends the capabilities of how a rollup settles on Ethereum via the native bridge and extends it cross rollups \u2013 without a third party required to attest to data or its validity by simply using the shared source of truth for all rollups \u2013 Ethereum,\u2019 Bansal said.\n\nTommy O\u2019Connell, a senior product manager at Polymer, explained to Blockworks that applications can build their own bridges and control inbound and outbound messages using a layer-1 trust layer. This eliminates the need for an additional trust assumption of a third party.\n\n\u201cThis also allows us to be focused on enabling chains to join Polymer\u2019s ecosystem of chains with just a SINGLE connection to the hub, mitigating Polymer being a blocker for growth,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThis differs from Wormhole, for example, which relies on a 13 of 19 supermajority to attest to a message before it is produced or sent. It is also different from Axelar, which relies on validators for attestations.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Polymer\u2019s minimum viable product (MVP) will be limited to the Base and Optimism at the testnet launch.\n\nThough this is the case, O\u2019Connell notes that there are immediate plans to grow to other OP stack chains and soon after to other chains such as those in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe primary benefit for OP stack rollups is that we have built an IBC client for OP geth, which enables us to extend the capabilities of native L1<>L2 bridge across rollups. It is particularly appealing because we can unlock other chains built on the OP stack with minimal expansion effort,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum soars, beginning of the Altseason? Crypto analysis of March 06, 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Wed 06 Mar 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nEthereum recorded an increase of over 16% last week and reached the $3,500 threshold. Let\u2019s examine the future perspectives for ETH together.\n\nCurrent Situation of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum continues its rise, reaching new highs. At the time of writing, one Ether is trading at approximately $3,850. Thus, the Ethereum price has crossed the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, calculated from its all-time high. It\u2019s worth noting that ETH has recently experienced a bearish impulse which allowed it to test this level as support. It now seems to be targeting the 78.6% level, located just below $4,000.\n\nNaturally, Ethereum has continued its bullish trend. However, it is worth mentioning that its price has significantly deviated from its 50-day moving average, indicating a period of high volatility that may lead to a correction. It is not surprising that the momentum of Ethereum has been revised upwards, which is well illustrated by the oscillators, indicating that a period of overbuying might currently be underway.\n\nDaily chart of ETH/USD\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, investor and passionate trader on the cryptocurrency market. Today a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. Here you will find Lives, educational content, and mutual aid around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nIt can be observed that the open interest of ETH/USDT perpetual contracts has been significantly more volatile than the price of Ethereum itself. Although funding rates have been positive, this reveals a period of uncertainty among speculators. With that said, it is clearly visible that Ethereum\u2019s recent drop was accompanied by a decrease in its open interest and liquidations of long positions. This indicates that many buying traders left the market during the last correction. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these positions have already been partially reopened, accompanying an increase in Ethereum. This phenomenon thus demonstrates a growing interest in cryptocurrency.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USD\n\nThe one-month Ethereum liquidation heatmap shows that the cryptocurrency has recently bounced off a subtle liquidation zone around $3,300. The interest shown at this level was predominantly buying, which contributed to the subsequent rise in ETH. Currently, the most significant liquidation threshold under its current price is around $3,000. The price\u2019s approach towards these levels could trigger a massive ordering, increasing the possibility of a period of increased volatility on Ethereum. These zones therefore represent crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (1 month)\n\nAssumptions for Ethereum\u2019s Price (ETH)\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price manages to hold above $3,350, we might anticipate a bullish continuation up to the levels of $3,900 or even $4,000. The next resistance to consider, if the bull run continues, would be $4,100 or even $4,500. At this stage, it would represent a rise of over +17%.\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price fails to hold above $3,350, we could envisage a return to $3,000. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be around $2,800. At this stage, it would represent a drop close to -25%.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum continues to show a bullish trend, crossing key Fibonacci retracement levels. Despite a recent bearish correction, Ethereum bounces back reaching new highs. Can we attribute this surge to the approach of the Dencun update? What is certain is that it will be crucial to closely observe the reaction of the price at various key levels to confirm or refute the current assumptions. It is also important to remain vigilant for potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let us remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "5 Under $1 Ethereum Layer 2 Altcoins To Buy As Dencun Upgrade Beckons - CoinGape",
        "content": "The impending Dencun update, poised for March 13, is set to elevate Ethereum, potentially driving its price above $3,800 amidst bullish trends. This significant upgrade highlights Ethereum\u2019s enduring advancements and its crucial role within the blockchain sphere.\n\nDrawing attention to five promising Ethereum Layer 2 altcoins priced under $1: Skale (SKL), Loopring (LRC), Mantle (MNT), Myria (MYRIA), and Gelato (GEL). These tokens, emblematic of innovation and scalability within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, present compelling opportunities for portfolio diversification in anticipation of the Dencun event.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Skale (SKL)\n\nSkale (SKL) stands at the forefront of the decentralized world, offering a groundbreaking network designed for developers. It\u2019s a unique platform that supports the creation of custom blockchains and decentralized apps, all within Ethereum\u2019s vast ecosystem. This initiative directly addresses Ethereum\u2019s scalability hurdles and the high cost of gas fees, providing a viable alternative for developers.\n\nThe network\u2019s currency, the SKL token, follows the ERC-777 standard, fulfilling a dual purpose. It not only incentivizes network participation through staking rewards but also plays a pivotal role in governance decisions.\n\nPresently, SKL is priced at $0.1054 despite a slight decrease of 5.76% in the last day. However, it has surged by more than 45% in the recent month. With a market cap of $546 million, it ranks as the 140th largest cryptocurrency.\n\n2. Loopring (LRC)\n\nLoopring (LRC), a pioneering Ethereum layer-2 solution, leverages \u201czkRollup\u201d technology for superior DEX performance. This approach consolidates transactions away from the chain. It employs zero-knowledge proofs to achieve reduced costs and enhanced transaction speeds compared to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet operations.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, LRC, plays a crucial role in staking, governance, and securing fee reductions within the ecosystem. As \u201czkRollups\u201d continues to gain prominence as a top-tier layer-2 methodology, Loopring is poised for significant growth in 2024. This positions it as a key alternative coin purchase ahead of the anticipated Dencun network upgrade.\n\nCurrently, LRC\u2019s price stands at $0.3503, witnessing a 7.03% drop over the past day following a modest market adjustment. Positioned at 154th on CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization is now $478 million.\n\n3. Mantle (MNT)\n\nMantle (MNT) has swiftly risen within the Ethereum Layer 2 network rankings, clinching the fourth spot in Total Value Locked (TVL) just two months after launch. This climb reflects a surge in investor interest, buoyed by an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 7.2%. Boasting the ability to process up to 200 transactions per second, Mantle underscores its processing strength. Its performance heralds a robust challenge to its peers in the Layer 2 space.\n\nWith its efficient and scalable nature, Mantle has become a notable contender. The token\u2019s price now sits at $1.01, following an uptick of more than 12% in the preceding week. Such growth earmarks it as one of the prime cryptocurrencies for purchase today.\n\n4. Myria (MYRIA)\n\nMyria emerges as a purpose-built Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, focusing on NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more. Developed in partnership with StarkWare, Myria\u2019s solution promises instant trade confirmations and zero gas fees for NFT transactions. This is achieved without compromising the security of user assets.\n\nUsing StarkWare\u2019s STARK prover and Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-Rollup) technology, Myria can compress numerous transfers into a single transaction. This efficiency enables it to support up to 9,000 transactions per second (TPS). Presently, Myria\u2019s token value is $0.01454, marking a 2.17% increase over the last 24 hours.\n\n5. Gelato Network (GEL)\n\nGelato Network (GEL), a pioneering decentralized network, leverages bot technology for the automation of smart contract operations across major public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Fantom. This innovation allows web3 developers to delegate their DevOps requirements. Consequently, they can dedicate their efforts entirely to developing their primary product.\n\nThe latest price of GEL stands at $0.7671, marking a 5.28% increase over the past 24 hours. Positioned at number 485 in CoinMarketCap\u2019s rankings, Gelato boasts a market capitalization of $84 million. The network reports a circulating supply of 109,951,523 GEL coins, while the maximum supply remains undisclosed.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Dencun upgrade positions Ethereum for a pivotal leap, making SKL, LRC, MNT, MYRIA, and GEL attractive prospects. These altcoins, emblematic of innovation and scalability within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, offer a unique investment opportunity ahead of a transformative moment in blockchain technology, spotlighting the potential for growth and diversification.\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Ethereum in the spotlight as weekly crypto inflows tap $1.84B - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Investment inflows linked to Ethereum rose to $85 million.\n\nThe price of ETH surpassed $3,600 and could hit $4,000 soon.\n\nLast week, digital asset investment products registered a total inflow of $1.84 billion. During the timeframe which ended on the 1st of March, Ethereum [ETH] hit its highest inflow since July 2022.\n\nAccording to the report provided by CoinShares, total trading volume hit $30 billion, indicating high interest in cryptocurrency-related products.\n\nHowever, most of the inflows went to Bitcoin [BTC] which accounted for 94% of the total. But short Bitcoin inflows also jumped, indicating that some investors were bearish on the coin. The report read,\n\n\u201c94% of the inflows were into Bitcoin, totalling US$1.72bn, although recent price moves saw short investors double down with a further US$22m inflows into short-bitcoin investment products.\u201d\n\nETFs offer the confidence\n\nFor Ethereum, its total inflows were about $85 million. The notable increase suggests that investors were looking to ETH exposure as the deadline to approve spot Ethereum ETFs nears. However, the Assets under Management (AuM) was shy of its all-time peak.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto observed that the AuM hit $14.6 billion. But it was still far off the high of $23.7 billion. This number implies that the value of Ethereum funds controlled by institutions was still lagging.\n\nHowever, if the U.S. SEC approves the Ethereum ETFs, this position might change and the total AuM value might go higher. But as of this writing, there were rumors that the SEC might delay the applications.\n\nIn terms of the price action, ETH\u2019s value has been increasing. At press time, ETH changed hands at $3,696, thanks to a 14.66% increase in the last seven days.\n\nVolume increases as ETH eyes a higher value\n\nWhen it comes to the volume, on-chain data showed that it has been increasing. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s volume was 31.69 billion.\n\nIf the volume continues to increase alongside ETH\u2019s price, then a higher value might appear in the short term. In a highly bullish scenario, ETH might cross the $4,000 mark within a few weeks.\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment, traders might need to be careful. If ETH slides below $3,500, the bullish thesis could be invalidated. Though it seems unlikely, it remains an option to watch out for.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the total AuM hit $82.6bn. This was only a little away from the $86bn peak which occurred in early November 2021. If the inflows continue to increase as it had done since the beginning of the year, the AuM might surpass the 2021 high.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nIn addition, other altcoins were also involved in the flows. While Polygon [MATIC] had more inflows, Solana [SOL] registered high outflows:"

As the market anticipates a reversal from recent pullbacks, many are eyeing SOL for its potential to rally.\n\nThe price chart indicates that SOL has been maintaining a strong uptrend, supported by a series of higher lows and higher highs, a bullish indicator in market technicals. The moving averages have positioned themselves in a manner that suggests sustained buying interest, with the shorter-term moving averages trending above the longer-term ones. This alignment typically underpins a continued bullish sentiment.\n\nSolana's immediate resistance lies around the $135 price level, a breakthrough of which could signal a fresh rally. On the downside, support can be found near $115 and $104, which have previously acted as springboards for price rebounds. The significant volume accompanying recent upward price movements shows active market participation, further bolstering the case for an optimistic outlook.\n\nA bullish scenario for Solana might emerge following a broader cryptocurrency market reversal, particularly if the market begins to seek alternatives to Ethereum amid high gas fees and network congestion. As a scalable and low-cost option, Solana could attract significant interest, both from developers and investors, potentially driving its price higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum remains strong\n\nEthereum is experiencing another significant price surge, bolstering its position as a mainstay on the cryptocurrency market. The recent upward momentum continues to captivate investors and enthusiasts, signaling robust market confidence and renewed interest in the blockchain's long-term potential.\n\nA meticulous examination of the price chart shows Ethereum breaking through resistance levels with gusto. The latest price action sees ETH pushing past the $3,500 barrier, a level that previously posed considerable resistance. This breakthrough is a testament to the strong bullish sentiment currently driving the market.\n\nThe chart depicts a steady sequence of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a robust uptrend. Ethereum\u2019s moving averages are in perfect bullish alignment, with short-term averages soaring above longer-term ones, suggesting that the momentum could very well sustain in the near term.\n\nFrom a support and resistance standpoint, the recent surge has placed Ethereum above the crucial $3,500 mark, which may now serve as a support level in the event of a retracement. A look at volume shows substantial buying pressure, reinforcing the current price increase.\n\nCardano has some fuel\n\nCardano is signaling potential upward mobility as trading volumes surge, despite indications of being oversold in recent times. This volume increase can be a harbinger of a substantial price surge, attracting attention from investors and traders within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAnalyzing the price chart, Cardano's recent performance reveals a promising trend. After enduring a period of consolidation, ADA is showing signs of life as trading volumes ramp up, a critical factor often preceding price rallies. This uptick in volume accompanies ADA's rise past the resistance level at $0.65, suggesting that the market is gathering momentum for a sustained move upwards.\n\nThe current trend is characterized by ADA's price trading above both the short and long-term moving averages, a bullish signal for market participants. The moving averages have formed a supportive base for the price, indicating that any pullbacks may be short-lived and used as buying opportunities for those looking to capitalize on Cardano's potential growth.\n\nLooking to the future, the immediate resistance Cardano faces is around the $0.77 mark. Should ADA's volume continue to increase and push the price above this level, it could open the door to new heights, potentially challenging the $0.80 threshold. A break above these levels would solidify the bullish case, potentially propelling ADA toward the coveted $1 mark."

        "title": "Liquid Restaking (LRT): A New Trend in the Ethereum Ecosystem - Incrypted",
        "content": "LRT Protocols: Growing Interest And Popular Applications\n\nThe restaking ecosystem is now in a testing phase. It will continue until EigenLayer is fully launched and AVS operators emerge. Despite this, LRT protocols are still attracting capital.\n\nThe above description outlines the general principle of operation for liquid restaking platforms. Now, let\u2019s examine the specific characteristics of the largest projects in this segment.\n\nAs of now, Ether.fi is the largest liquid restaking service. It offers a wrapped eETH token in exchange for restaked Ethereum. Moreover, depositors can choose solo-staking by setting up an Ethereum node with a partial deposit or no deposit at all. EigenLayer and Ether.fi award points to depositors based on the amount deposited. The current APR is 3.95%.\n\nPuffer.fi is a well-known LRT provider. They offer native ETH restaking to EigenLayer with the liquid token pufETH. Users can also run an Ethereum node through their platform.\n\nThe protocol stands out because of its top-notch interface and the gamification of the liquidity campaign. Additionally, it has launched a native anti-slashing system and other technical solutions. At the time of writing, the APR is 3.3%.\n\nKelp was launched by the founders of Studer Labs and is positioned as a DAO. Like other LRT services, it offers points and EigenLayer points. The protocol tokenized the latter by issuing a KEP token, where one KEP equals one EL point. This expands trading opportunities. It lets individuals exit farming before the EigenLayer airdrop.\n\nOne main feature of Kelp is its support for a variety of assets. It includes ETH and LSD tokens from different providers. Also, Kelp aims to create a community-driven infrastructure. It embodies the principles of a decentralized autonomous organization. The project documentation provides further technical details.\n\nRenzo protocol accepts ETH, as well as liquid staking tokens from Lido and Binance. The attracted assets go to EigenLayer or to an Ethereum deposit contract for restaking later. Renzo has launched its own points system and referral program. They\u2019ve also introduced the ezETH token. At the time of writing, the APR is 2.83%.\n\nEigenpie is a SubDAO on Magpie\u2019s DeFi platform. It provides earning opportunities in different decentralized finance applications.\n\nEigenpie\u2019s key feature is its integration of many LSD providers. Unlike its competitors, the service has isolated pools for each asset. It also allows the minting of individual LRT tokens. This feature lets incentives and rewards be distributed more flexibly. It lowers risks for investors.\n\nBesides these, there are half a dozen smaller projects. Most of them launched a few months ago and likely still have time to prove themselves. Yet, like LSD, the principle of \u2018the pioneer gets everything\u2019 may apply. This could bring Ether.fi to the forefront of the market.\n\nPoints Programs\n\nInterest in LRT is growing, possibly because people expect an airdrop from EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols. These mentioned applications have introduced point programs that grant points based on the amount of staked ETH.\n\nWhen a user provides an asset to an LRT service, they get points from both the project and EigenLayer simultaneously. These points will be converted into tokens in the future. For instance, according to Kopp, the TGE of the Ether.fi protocol has been scheduled for April 2024. As for the EigenLayer team, they have not yet announced a launch date.\n\nThese points also include APR for native ETH staking and potential rewards from LSD protocols. Most investors are attracted to the increased rewards for the same amount of locked assets.\n\nThe increase in leverage options has amplified this trend, especially in operations such as liquid restaking. Recently, Gearbox platform introduced liquid restaking with leverage of up to x19. Pendle yield trading platform also provides boosts for LRT point farming.\n\nPendle And Its Importance For LRT\n\nPendle offers a unique feature: it divides an asset into two tokens \u2013 a base part and a yield. You can trade them individually. This feature allows for the maximization of potential returns through leveraged liquidity. Although Pendle became popular during the peak of LSD, its mechanics also suit LRT protocols.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a scenario to explain the process. A user deposits their ETH (or a wrapped version) into the Pendle pool of a liquid restaking protocol like Ether.fi. This will allow them to transform the underlying asset into one of two tokens:\n\nyield token (YT) enables you to farm EigenLayer and Ether.fi points using leverage. Converting one ETH into YT can provide you with the same number of points as blocking in LRT with six ETH.\n\nAs the maturity date of YT approaches, the value of the yield token compared to the underlying asset decreases. On the maturity date, the yield token value becomes zero. So, in essence, the user \u00abburns\u00bb the deposited ETH (partially or completely) in exchange for a boost to farming points;\n\nbase token (PT) allows for a fixed yield during a specific period while being locked. When the maturity date arrives, the owner can use the PT to receive their asset and promised profit. But the yield of the PT changes, and you can only get the highest yield on the maturity date.\n\nThe liquidity provided by PT holders enables YT holders to receive boosts for farming. YT holders leverage the underlying asset, while PT holders get a fixed interest on the capital they provide. The amount of the boost and the rate of burning the underlying asset during farming depend on the ratio of assets in the YT and PT pools.\n\nTo justify such a strategy for point hunters, it is necessary to ensure that the rewards received in the future will outweigh the cost of the \u00abburned\u00bb underlying assets. However, currently, neither EigenLayer nor any of the LRT protocols have reported the conversion rate of points to tokens or even the date of distribution. Consequently, farming through Pendle represents a high-risk gamble with many variables."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced an extraordinary surge, catapulting its value past the $3900 mark. This surge comes on the heels of a brief period of retesting support levels, during which Ethereum demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of market fluctuations. As a result, Ethereum has seen a staggering 70% increase in value, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment and investor confidence.\n\nIn the midst of recent market volatility, Ethereum stood firm as it successfully retested new support levels. This retest not only validated the strength of Ethereum\u2019s underlying fundamentals but also served as a catalyst for its subsequent surge. Investors, buoyed by Ethereum\u2019s ability to weather market downturns, quickly repositioned themselves, driving Ethereum\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMarket Position and Growth Trends\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum continues to assert its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. Its recent surge has further solidified its position, attracting considerable attention from investors and traders worldwide. With its unique value proposition and innovative features, Ethereum stands poised for continued growth and success.\n\nOne of the most striking trends in Ethereum\u2019s recent performance is its divergence from Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. While Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s surge past $3900 demonstrates its ability to chart its own course independently of Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuations. This divergence highlights Ethereum\u2019s unique value proposition and underscores its growing importance as a standalone digital asset.\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest Sells Coinbase, Nvidia Again; Buys Tesla Shares\n\nValuation and Market Implications\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent growth metrics paint a compelling picture of its increasing value and significance within the cryptocurrency market. With notable percentage increases in trading price, Ethereum has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors, driving demand and fueling further growth.\n\nThe implications of Ethereum\u2019s valuation extend far beyond its own ecosystem, shaping the direction of the broader cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its reach, its valuation serves as a barometer of market sentiment, influencing investor behavior and market dynamics.

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs surpassed Ethereum on the weekly volume charts, with the NodeMonkes collection leading the charts as its market cap exceeded $500 million.\n\nOf the top five collections by weekly sales, three were from the Bitcoin ecosystem as interest in Ordinals surges as BTC approaches its all-time high in the ongoing bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin just can\u2019t put a foot wrong this year. The top crypto has gained close to 60% since the turn of the year, and it\u2019s edging ever closer to breaking its record-high price, as this report by Crypto News Flash alludes to. This terrific start to the year has translated to its NFTs, with Ordinals outshining Ethereum NFTs to emerge as the most traded weekly.\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Slam, Bitcoin NFTs have attracted $181,821,799 in trading volume, just edging out Ethereum to rank highest in the market. Ethereum trails closely behind by around $650,000, with Solana at a distant third with $65 million.\n\nWhile Bitcoin just edges Ethereum out, the altcoin still has superior numbers on the all-time list at $42 billion to $2.6 billion, and on the buyer\u2019s charts, its numbers are at least eight times higher.\n\nOn the weekly chart, Bitcoin saw 58,829 buyers, while Ethereum saw nearly twice that at 110,642.\n\nMost interestingly, the highest volume of trade went to uncategorized Ordinals, which Crypto Slam describes as \u201ca diverse assortment of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain that has not yet been identified as part of an established collection.\u201d\n\nThis points to Bitcoin\u2019s NFT revolution being spearheaded by retail users who mint their own Ordinals rather than purchasing from the blue-collar NFT collections. This is massively bullish as it shows genuine interest in the BTC NFTs and indicates that this hype can be sustained.\n\nNodeMonkes came in second on the weekly volume charts and was the top collection. NodeMonkes boasts of being the first collection to inscribe 10,000 unique pixelated profile pictures on the Bitcoin blockchain in the first few weeks after Ordinals launched. However, the collection\u2019s release was delayed, and others went to the market first.\n\nNodeMonkes have become wildly popular, and on Monday, one NFT in the collection sold for over $1 million for the first. The NFT, known as Alien Hoodie, is the second-highest NFT sale on Bitcoin after the recent $1.4 million sale of the second-ever Bitcoin Ordinal inscription.\n\nSOLD: Alien Hoodie (#2769) for 17 btc ($1,080,000) on M.E. The first million dollar monke sale. Congratulations to buyer & seller. \u2014\u2014 SEND NODES \u2014\u2014 pic.twitter.com/9DrvZBJH2X \u2014 NodeMonkes \u25c9 (@nodemonkes) March 4, 2024\n\nThe NATCATS TAP collection rounds up the top five highest sales this week as Bitcoin\u2019s third entry. Ethereum\u2019s entries into the top five were CryptoPunks and Pandora.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Flip Ethereum NFTs\n\nFor Bitcoin, flipping Ethereum is monumental. The king of altcoins has dominated the NFTs market for years, emerging as the most favored network for some of the largest collections, from Bored Ape Yacht Club to CryptoPunks and ArtBlocks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been at it for over five years. On the other hand, Bitcoin has barely done it for a year, with its Ordinals NFTs launching early last year. However, in that time, BTC has recorded $265 billion in overall trading volume with 370,000 buyers.\n\nEthereum might have even bigger challenges to worry about on the NFT front. As Crypto News Flash reported, the Injective network recently released its version of the semi-fungible ERC-404 token standard, giving Ethereum a run for its money on the front.\n\nCloser to home, users are increasingly turning to Layer 2 solutions to mint their NFTs to avoid gas charges on Ethereum. While this is still technically part of the Ethereum ecosystem, it points to dissatisfaction in the network. Crypto News Flash pointed to this trend in December when it reported on the rise of Polygon NFTs.\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction After Bitcoin Halving 2024 - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum is comfortably positioned as the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, and it looks like ETH will only solidify its spot over time. Of course, the most important crypto event in the next year will be Bitcoin halving, and it\u2019s expected to have a significant impact on the markets for all cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll share our Ethereum price prediction after the halving, and explore whether Ethereum is likely to be a good long-term investment or not. First, let\u2019s take a look at how Ethereum has performed during previous Bitcoin halvings.\n\nKey takeaways: Historical trends show Ethereum's varied performance around Bitcoin halvings, with notable differences between the second and third halvings.\n\nSpeculating on Ethereum's price after the fourth Bitcoin halving in 2024 remains uncertain. While Bitcoin halvings generally create a bullish sentiment, their specific impact on Ethereum's price is unpredictable.\n\nOur projections suggest a potential price dip for Ethereum to around $3,900 by April 2024, 25% below its all-time high but a significant 75% rise from its current value.\n\nLonger-term forecasts indicate a surge to over $6,300 by late July 2024, followed by a dip to $3,700 before rallying to peak above $7,300 in March 2025.\n\nEthereum's long-term potential as an investment looks promising due to the Ethereum triple halving concept. Factors such as reduced ETH issuance, EIP-1559's ETH burning, and staking contribute to deflationary pressure on its supply.\n\nHow has Ethereum performed before and after Bitcoin halvings?\n\nFirst off, we need to keep in mind that Ethereum didn\u2019t even exist yet when the first Bitcoin halving happened back in 2012. ETH has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the sample size of Ethereum\u2019s price action before and after Bitcoin halvings is extremely small.\n\nDate ETH Price 1M before Halv. ETH Price at Halv. ETH Price 1M after Halv. ETH Price 3M after Halv. 2nd BTC Halving Jul 9, 2016 $14.7 $11 $11.7 (+6.3%) $11.2 (+1.8%) 3rd BTC Halving May 11, 2020 $160 $211 $249 (+18%) $398 (+88.6%)\n\nBrackets show ETH performance relative to the BTC price at the time of each respective halving.\n\nAs we can see, the ETH price action around Bitcoin halvings has been quite different if we compare ETH\u2019s performance amidst the second Bitcoin halving and its performance amidst the third Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe Ether market was relatively quiet during the second Bitcoin halving, which happened in July 2016. In fact, ETH saw a 25% price decline in the month leading up to the second Bitcoin halving. Following the halving, it showed a modest recovery, although ETH\u2019s price three months after the halving was only about 1.8% higher than it was at the time of the halving.\n\nThe situation amidst the third BTC halving in May 2020 was much more favorable for Ethereum. ETH increased by 31.8% in the month leading up to the third halving. Three months after the halving, Ether was up a whopping 88.6% compared to its price at the time of the halving.\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s difficult to tell what will happen to the Ethereum price as the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches. Generally, Bitcoin halvings are seen as bullish events and improve the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So, it might be worth considering increasing your ETH stack a bit before the halving.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum price prediction after the Bitcoin halving in 2024-2025?\n\nCurrently, most estimates are suggesting that we should expect the next Bitcoin halving to happen in mid-April 2024. At the moment, the Ethereum price prediction on CoinCodex is forecasting Ethereum to trade at roughly $3,660 on April 15, 2024. This would be about -24.7% below Ethereum\u2019s current all-time high but a 24.9% increase compared to the Ethereum price at the time of writing.\n\nAs far as the Ethereum price prediction for 2024 and 2025 is concerned, the forecast is expecting the ETH price to accelerate sharply soon after the Bitcoin halving, hitting new all-time highs just above $6,600 in September of 2024.\n\nThe prediction is expecting that ETH will then drop and find support at roughly $4,070, before gathering momentum for a new rally that\u2019s forecasted to reach its peak above $7,000 in April 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a good long-term buy?\n\nEthereum appears to be quite promising as a long-term buy thanks to a concept known as the Ethereum triple halving. Even though the Ethereum protocol does not have a halving mechanism, it does have features that provide deflationary pressure to its supply:\n\nReduced ETH issuance under Proof-of-Stake consensus\n\nETH burning via the EIP-1559 upgrade\n\nEthereum staking lowers the amount of ETH that is effectively in circulation\n\nThese three factors have already contributed to reducing the ETH supply, and will continue to make ETH deflationary so long as demand for transacting on the Ethereum market remains high. Based on Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory and status as the undisputed king of the smart contracts space, the future is looking bright for ETH holders.\n\nEver since Ethereum moved from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, ETH has turned deflationary. Since the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the ETH supply has been dropping by 0.23% per year on average. In that time period, 1.08 million ETH has been issued, while 1.49 million coins have been burned.\n\nETH issuance and burns since the Ethereum network transitioned to Proof-of-Stake. Image source: ultrasound.money\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that it's not guaranteed that ETH will remain deflationary forever. This is because the EIP-1559 mechanism burns the base ETH transaction fees paid by users. This means that the amount of ETH that's being burned depends on the demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. If demand for transactions saw a significant drop, it's possible that ETH could become inflationary again at some point in the future.\n\nAnother way to get a unique perspective on the Ethereum price from a long-term perspective is the Ethereum rainbow chart. This chart uses a concept known as logarithmic regression and features 9 different colored bands. Depending on which band the Ethereum price currently resides in, it can be interpreted as signaling overbought, underbought, or neutral conditions.\n\nIn the video below, you can learn more about the Ethereum rainbow chart and how you can use it to gauge the current conditions in the Ethereum market, as well as its long-term prospects.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF\n\nIn January of 2024, the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by securities regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enter the U.S. market. Before that, the only Bitcoin ETFs which were allowed were Bitcoin futures ETFs, which held Bitcoin futures contract and not actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe logical next step for crypto investing products in the U.S. seem to be ETFs that would allow investor to easily gain access to Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization. Several asset management companies including the likes of Franklin Templeton and VanEck have already applied to list spot Ethereum ETFs, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said that he sees value in an Ethereum ETF.\n\nTo be sure, it might take a long time for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 after all, getting the first spot Bitcoin ETFs was a multi-year effort even though several large asset management firms were pushing to get these products on the market. Still, the narrative that an Ethereum ETF is likely to come in the future will likely serve as a tailwind for ETH.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade\n\nAnother bullish factor for Ethereum is the Dencun upgrade, which will introduce several EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The most notable EIP that will be included in the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, also dubbed \"Proto-Danksharding\".\n\nEIP-4844 aims to significantly improve performance for applications that depend on the use of extensive datasets, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and layer-2 scaling solutions developed on Ethereum. By dividing tasks between the consensus and \"database\" layers, the upgrade is an important step towards the ultimate goal of completely fragmenting the Ethereum blockchain into shards to achieve massive scalability.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade will also introduce other EIPs such as EIP-6780, EIP-5656 and EIP-1153.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSo far, there hasn\u2019t been a clear trend of how Ethereum tends to perform in anticipation and immediate aftermath of Bitcoin halvings. Of course, Ethereum has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the historical data is very limited. Overall, it might be a good idea to purchase some ETH as the halving approaches since the crypto markets tend to be optimistic in the lead-up to Bitcoin halvings.\n\nETH appears to be positioned well over the long term, thanks to its tokenomics. After transitioning to Proof-of-Stake, the protocol needs to issue much fewer new ETH coins, and EIP-1559 is constantly burning the ETH that\u2019s being spent to pay for transaction fees.

        "title": "Ethereum Could Hit $4,000 with Break of Key Resistance, Glassnode Co-founders Say - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is witnessing an intriguing development as Ethereum (ETH) is on the brink of potentially breaking a significant price resistance. According to the latest market analysis shared by the co-founders of Glassnode, a leading blockchain analytics firm, Ethereum is showing promising signs of a bullish run that could see its value surge towards the $4,000 mark.\n\nThrough a detailed tweet from Negentropic, an X (formerly Twitter) account run by Glassnode\u2019s co-founders, the recent market dynamics were dissected. The post outlined Ethereum\u2019s market behavior, noting its recent price actions mirroring those of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nLast week, #ETH mirrored #BTC\u2019s rise but struggled around $3.5k-$3.6k. Meanwhile, #BTC soared past $60k, touching $64k before settling near $62k. Failure to break $3.5k may lead to sideways movement, but a close above could fuel a surge towards $4k and beyond! \ud83d\ude80 #crypto \u2014 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0 (@Negentropic_) March 5, 2024\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin has experienced a substantial rally, surpassing the $60,000 threshold and reaching highs of $64,000 before stabilizing around $62,000, Ethereum has faced hurdles. The analysis indicated that ETH has struggled to breach the resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum is currently witnessing a positive shift in momentum. The latest figures show ETH\u2019s price standing at $3,759, representing a 7.40% increase over the last 24 hours.
