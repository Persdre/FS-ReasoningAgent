        "title": "Ethereum won\u2019t flip Bitcoin anytime soon, but Ordinals could change that - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin block space looks set to be the hottest commodity in crypto.\n\nBitcoin once again occupies more than half the entire crypto market, having outperformed ether by nearly double so far in 2023. Now, the long-prophesied \u201cflippening\u201d of ether over bitcoin is even further in the future.\n\nThe market currently values Bitcoin three times higher than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at $727 billion, has swelled by $400 billion in 2023 \u2014 a figure bigger than Mastercard\u2019s entire stock valuation and about twice that of Netflix\u2019s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation has grown by $100 billion, jumping from under $145 billion in January to nearly $245 billion today.\n\nSome anticipate that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will one day eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s, despite the latter\u2019s half-decade head start.\n\nThings were looking good coming out of the 2019 bear market and into 2021\u2019s explosive bull cycle. DeFi summer and NFT mania boosted interest in Ethereum, at times driving up fees for certain actions beyond $250.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s market value was 925% of Ethereum\u2019s \u2014 $130 billion to $14 billion \u2014 at the end of 2019 (bottom of the bear market).\n\nThat figure had shrunk to under 200% by the end of 2021 (peak bull market).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is now 300% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Bitcoin rally has widened the gap\n\nThe case for flippening has recently taken a hit by a different flip: The Bitcoin network now rakes in more fees than Ethereum for the first time since December 2020.\n\nOver the past four days, Bitcoin users have paid miners about $40 million to have their transactions processed.\n\nEthereum users, meanwhile, forked out less than $27 million ether (most of those fees have been burned, slightly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall supply).\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum networks Arbitrum and Optimism haven\u2019t bridged that gap as they each generate less than $200,000 in fees per day right now.\n\nThe fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward when you consider the sheer amount of use cases supported by Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges, DAOs, memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, DeFi and GameFi all run atop Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had for the longest time mostly had one application \u2014 bitcoin transactions. But the rate of on-chain transactions had until recently sustained very little growth since 2015. Perhaps due to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and the rising ubiquity of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past five years, Ethereum users have paid $17 billion in fees, Bitcoin users just $2.9 billion\n\nAll that changed with Ordinals \u2014 a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin (BTC) with unique data to create digital collectibles, first launched in January.\n\nMusic, text, art, video and even code for browser-based DOOM clones have since been inscribed to Bitcoin, resulting in an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC. Bitcoin users trade Ordinals as Ethereum or Solana users would trade NFTs.\n\nToday, anywhere from around a third to one half of Bitcoin transactions contain Ordinals, driving up demand for blockspace as well as transaction fees. At times today, \u201cmedium priority\u201d transactions went for around $11 compared to around $2.30 for the same on Ethereum (more priority generally means faster processing), although those prices have since come down.\n\nTron comes in third overall for monthly fees, mostly thanks to stablecoin Tether\n\nSo is Bitcoin netting more fees than Ethereum good for Bitcoin? Maybe not.\n\nSome Bitcoin insiders worry the network isn\u2019t properly equipped to handle Ordinals and potential influxes of interest in its original use case, BTC payments.\n\nThe CryptoKitties incident in December 2017 \u2014 during which a NFT game grew so popular that it spectacularly clogged Ethereum \u2014 first showed that Ethereum probably couldn\u2019t handle serving as the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d just yet.\n\nThen, the 2021 bull market saw NFT mint costs soar to $250 at times \u2014 a reminder of how necessary it was to port activity to smaller chains, including rollups. Still, memecoins and low quality token projects ratcheted up fees beyond $20 earlier this year, drastically reducing Ethereum\u2019s usefulness for non-critical tasks.\n\nThe NFT craze of 2021 made Ethereum block space the hottest commodity in crypto. Even while tanking its utility.\n\nOrdinals may end up having the same effect on Bitcoin, especially if demand keeps up and the bull market truly hits.\n\nAt that point, it would seem reasonable to value Bitcoin and Ethereum more similarly. It might just take another run.\n\nUpdated Nov. 16, 2023 at 4:25 pm ET: Corrected reference to percentages in bullet points.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What Is Validium in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Validium is an innovative addition to the suite of scaling solutions helping to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nValidium is a protocol that was introduced to improve scalability issues on the Ethereum network. In this guide, we look at what Validium is, how it works, and its benefits and challenges.\n\nWhat Is Validium?\n\nValidium is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to verify off-chain transactions. Its primary goal is to enhance the scalability, privacy, and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the solution\u2019s core are sidechains or L2 solutions linked to but handling transactions separately from the Ethereum main chain. In this way, they move transactions off-chain and help ease transactional pressure on the Ethereum network.\n\nConsequently, users can enjoy faster confirmation times while moving more volumes. Furthermore, Validium significantly reduces gas fees due to the reduced computational overhead, as it doesn\u2019t need to verify every transaction individually.\n\nHow Does Validium Work?\n\nValidium bundles sidechain transactions into batches and generates zk-proofs for each batch. Zk-proofs ensure the validity of the transactions and that the off-chain chain has been updated correctly.\n\nEvery sidechain has a validator responsible for aggregating transactions and generating zk-proofs, which are then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet for verification.\n\nIf the proof is valid, the verifiers update the mainnet record to reflect the changes that occurred in the sidechain.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Validium in Ethereum\n\nValidium has several potential use cases and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi protocols can use Validium to improve their efficiency and usability. For example, they can adopt the technology to create faster DeFi investment platforms with lower gas fees. This efficiency broadens the platform\u2019s accessibility and enhances the user experience.\n\nGaming and NFTs\n\nValidium solutions can facilitate seamless in-game transactions and interactions with NFT marketplaces due to their low fees and faster confirmation times. This provides gamers and collectors with more enjoyable experiences.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nThrough Validium, manufacturers can set up more efficient and transparent supply chain management systems. They can track their consignments off-chain easily and cost-efficiently without overloading the blockchain with data.\n\nKey Benefits of Validium in Ethereum\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the key benefits Validium brings to Ethereum.\n\nEnhanced Scalability\n\nValidium can process thousands of transactions per second (tps), compared to the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s 15-25 tps. This feature makes it ideal for high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. Increased throughputs are crucial to Ethereum adoption as they guarantee timely transactions.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nValidium uses zk-proofs to verify transactions by allowing one party to prove to another party that they know something without revealing what the thing they know is. As such, zk-proofs provide an elevated level of security for transactions, ensuring that validators cannot cheat or steal user funds. Additionally, Validium improves privacy by excluding sensitive user data from the public Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nReduced computational overhead makes Validium settlements significantly cheaper than mainnet ones. This is a major benefit for users, making Ethereum more affordable.\n\nFaster Transaction Speeds\n\nDue to its off-chain processing, Validium operations are much faster than those on the mainnet. This is important for applications that require fast and reliable transactions, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms.\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Validium\n\nDespite its benefits, Validium also has some challenges and limitations.\n\nCentralization of the Network\n\nUsers must trust the validator to process transactions correctly. This could lead to centralization concerns, as few validators could control a sizable portion of the network. Introducing a trusted third party contradicts the decentralization philosophy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInteroperability and Compatibility\n\nIntegrating Validium with existing Ethereum smart contracts and protocols can be challenging due to potential data structure incompatibilities. Ethereum developers are working on ways to ensure seamless interaction between the mainnet and its sidechains.\n\nDependence on Data Providers\n\nThe technology relies on data providers to make off-chain data available. This dependence on them introduces an element of trust that runs counter to decentralization, a central tenet of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHaving external data providers also puts the data processed on the network at risk of hacking or unauthorized access by malicious parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nValidium is important in Ethereum\u2019s journey toward scalability. Its ability to significantly improve transaction speeds, lower costs, and streamline operations is poised to redefine the network\u2019s experience, with many developers seeking to integrate it into their products."

        "title": "Former advisor Steven Nerayoff hypes Ethereum scandal expos\u00e9 - Protos",
        "content": "Ethereum whistleblowers Steven Nerayoff and TruthLabs have alleged numerous incidents of misconduct by early Ethereum insiders, with Nerayoff currently teasing the release of apparently never-before-heard audio recordings of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nNerayoff is promising to reveal scandalous evidence that he believes proves that Buterin copied his idea of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He is also threatening to sue over his supposed invention.\n\nOf course, fraud by third-party creators who simply used the Ethereum platform to create scam tokens or NFTs is nothing new. Many Ethereum ICO fundraisers during the 2017-2018 craze turned out to be doomed. Indeed, most ICOs have fallen to near-$0.\n\nSimilarly, most NFTs are now worthless. Ethereum insiders, however, are not responsible for those scams.\n\nWhat is new, however, is the fact that Steven Nerayoff and an unrelated researcher, TruthLabs, have both alleged misconduct by Ethereum founders and their allies and want to release the supposedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nRead more: These six-figure NFTs are down 99%\n\nSteven Nerayoff: Baffling yet impossible to ignore\n\nNerayoff makes sweeping claims that are often difficult to understand, yet he does speak with some authority. He was a former legal advisor to the Ethereum Foundation. He claims that Vitalik Buterin once lived with him in New York and worked in an office that Nerayoff rented for the benefit of Ethereum.\n\nSome observers used to dismiss most of Nerayoff\u2019s claims due to his personal credibility taking a hit when the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged him with criminal extortion in 2019. However, a New York judge dismissed that charge in May 2023, cleaning up his reputation considerably.\n\nAlthough Nerayoff has posted his recent, Ethereum-related claims to X, he says his legal team is working on organizing all the documents involved to substantiate his new claims. Curiously, he claims to have created a non-X platform to ostensibly ensure that the information he publishes will not be censored.\n\nOn November 14, he promised to publish specific allegations against Ethereum insiders \u201cwithin 48 hours, hopefully less.\u201d There have, however, been delays, with Nerayoff claiming that logistics and the creation of NFTs were responsible for most of the hold-ups.\n\nShould be within 48 hours hopefully less. Logistics, setting up Smart NFTs, etc. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nDid Vitalik Buterin ask Nerayoff to rescue the Ethereum Foundation?\n\nNerayoff claims that one of his upcoming NFTs will include a 2015 recording of Vitalik Buterin asking Nerayoff for a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nA transcript of Nerayoff\u2019s appearance on one of Mario Nawfal\u2019s \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d indicates that the NFT will include audio asking Nerayoff to help restructure the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGreat thread @CoinpediaNews . The NFT isn\u2019t about fraud it\u2019s a recording of a rescue plan to save Ethereum Vitalik asked me to create in 2015. It\u2019s a rare unedited historical view into what was really happening & crucial decisions made or not made which shaped much of crypto. https://t.co/4paTF5fseI \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nThis continues Nerayoff\u2019s pattern of claiming he created many of the standards that made Ethereum successful, including the \u2018fungible\u2019 tokens behind ICOs. The ERC-20 standard originally described the most commonly used API for Ethereum-based fungible tokens. The document doesn\u2019t list Nerayoff as a contributor unless he was going by a pseudonym.\n\nDid Vitalik invent anything? No he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. Only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs question Ethereum\u2019s The DAO\n\nTruthLabs supposedly found evidence that the Ethereum Foundation and Slock.it were behind the infamous hack of The DAO that precipitated the hard fork between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nNothing would surprise me but seems more likely others will flip on them. Now let me see, was the DAO an inside job? Oh there are too many to even count. They have a whole industry of people who could turn on them. Frankly I refused to cooperate at all but that\u2019s me most would. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nRead more: Ethereum centralization is becoming a serious problem\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the DAO hack was an inside job. Publicly, Slock.it was hit hard, and eventually sold to Blockchains.com in 2019. Blockchains.com rebranded Slock.it to BC Development Labs.\n\nSo, what did the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say about The DAO? According to Commissioners, The DAO insiders sold DAO tokens as unregistered securities. However, the SEC declined to file charges in that particular case.\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs also call out ex-SEC Director Bill Hinman\n\nBy now, it is no secret that former SEC chief William Hinman likely had an Ethereum-related conflict of interest while working for the SEC. Protos has previously covered Hinman\u2019s financial conflict of interest and its potential impact on the SEC v. Ripple case.\n\nBill Hinman routinely met Simpson Thacher & Bartlett employees, which received funding from a pro-Ethereum entity, including an employee who worked for its Hong Kong division. Hinman also did not divest from his financial interest in the Simpson Thacher, which had done work for the Ethereum Foundation, despite being warned to by the SEC\u2019s ethics office.\n\nAfter the Empower emails, I said a \ud83d\ude4a could prove Hinman violated the criminal financial conflict laws. You can be found violating 18 USC 208 if you allow even only an appearance of impropriety w/o being told you\u2019re violating the law. Here, he was told multiple times but did it. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nHowever, according to Nerayoff, the corruption among government officials might go far beyond just William Hinman\u2019s opining that ETH offers were not securities transactions.\n\nA transcript of a Mario Nawfal X audio space reveals that Nerayoff believes the SEC, DoJ, and FBI fabricated charges against him. \u201cThey were looking to get as many people in this industry as possible. And that all started at the very same time,\u201d he said. He also implied that Hinman was in on the Ethereum inside job.\n\nSome individuals were skeptical. However, attorney Michael Scotto opined that Nerayoff \u201chas a case.\u201d\n\nYes @StevenNerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. As his attorney I just wish he would stop talking until then, but he is very eager to share his experience. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is\u2026 https://t.co/cKQuuzgxP9 \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) October 28, 2023\n\nNerayoff acknowledged that his lawyers advised him not to post about it in a lengthy X post. However, he says he cares more about holding people accountable than the money he allegedly lost.\n\nMistakes in Gary Gensler\u2019s MIT course?\n\nPrior to becoming chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler taught a course about blockchain at MIT.\n\nTruthLabs has questioned why Gensler used this class to spread, in TruthLabs\u2019 opinion, false information about Ethereum\u2019s history. According to TruthLabs, his allegedly false teaching material included Gensler\u2019s claim that Canadian VCs mostly supported Ethereum during its pre-ICO days. Rather than Canadian money, as Protos has covered, Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money. If deflecting attention from China to Canada was intentional, TruthLabs posits that William Hinman might not be the only SEC official with an interest in misrepresenting Ethereum\u2019s financial ties.\n\nWhy is Gary Gensler teaching a false history on Ethereum's ICO in his MIT class?\n\n\n\nIn this \ud83e\uddf5, I will show you that it was the CCP that invested in Ethereum in its pre-ICO days, and not Canadian VC's like Gary teaches. pic.twitter.com/xfGtlux85C \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) April 19, 2023\n\nOther claims made in Gensler\u2019s lecture on Ethereum included the idea that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO. Lubin disagrees with this percentage, claiming he never owned more than half a percent of Ethereum\u2019s supply.\n\nNerayoff called Lubin out on this, citing a video in which Lubin said buying large quantities of tokens, or buying them to speculate, could become a sign that the token is a security.\n\nLubin is saying if you buy tokens in large quantities or to speculate it\u2019s a security. Gensler on video said Lubin was a VC who bought Ether in large quantities to speculate.\n\n\n\nSo, Ether is a security according to Lubin & Gensler due to Lubin\u2019s actions.\n\n\n\nWanna brag some more Joe?\u2026 https://t.co/BFLi3ZRmPv \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 12, 2023\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why \u2018news\u2019 attacking Gary Gensler is all over crypto media\n\nRevisiting Ethereum\u2019s ties to China\n\nAnyway, TruthLabs claims that Chinese entities Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and Fenbushi Capital were involved in setting up some of Lubin\u2019s Ethereum wallets.\n\nProtos has previously covered Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money.\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang Blockchain Labs set the Ethereum Foundation wallet up. Wanxiang\u2019s Dr. Xiao Feng went on record about its early support for Ethereum, pledging $500,000 to help launch it.\n\nGary Gensler teached to the public that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO for himself. Whats his source? Lubin claims he never even owned half a percent of Ethereums supply. So whats up with this 10%? And did he know about how Lubin called to disguise all major investors? pic.twitter.com/zpYgnOaWNP \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) April 19, 2023\n\nTruthLabs also notes a coincidence that Wanxiang Group and MIT announced a \u2018partnership\u2019 in March 2018. TruthLabs notes that it is possible that Chinese government-connected individuals could have used proxy or puppet entities to exert influence over Ethereum.\n\nLaura Shin\u2019s book, The Cryptopians, detailed allegations that Vitalik Buterin tolerated an out-of-place Chinese national named Ming Chan, who served as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s executive director, for a curious span of time \u2014 even after she clashed with other foundation members.\n\nInterestingly, Chan assumed that role in 2015 \u2014 the same year that Nerayoff alleges Buterin asked him about restructuring or saving the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum also famously published its whitepaper first in two languages: English initially, and then Chinese.\n\nFinally, and somewhat off-topic, Nerayoff makes yet another assertion: Vitalik Buterin could have shorted Ethereum at some point.\n\nAwaiting evidence from Steven Nerayoff, TruthLabs\n\nIn summary, Nerayoff and TruthLabs\u2019 allegations are seemingly impossible to ignore. However, it\u2019s important to remember that they are just that: allegations.\n\nNerayoff claims to be releasing another round of evidence today or tomorrow and intends to fight for his intellectual property rights in court.\n\nEthereum initially wanted to build a decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Much of its initial marketing billed it as a \u201cworld computer\u201d that could be used for blockchain applications like smart contracts. However, since inception, Ethereum has maintained strong ties to Chinese executives with curious motivations.\n\nBoth Nerayoff and TruthLabs claim to be interested in publicizing their version of the truth about Ethereum\u2019s origins and initial motivations. Many observers have been and will continue to await their allegedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction - Forecast for 2021, 2022, 2025 & 2030 - Forex Crunch",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nThe price of Ethereum has seen huge boosts over the last couple of years. Just one year ago, one Ethereum was worth less than $400. Today, Ethereum has a market value of over $2,500, even crossing the $4,000 mark only a few months ago. And the trend is that the Ethereum stock price will continue to rise on average.\n\nThis article focuses on our Ethereum price prediction. We arrived at reliable conclusions through a study of the history of Ethereum\u2019s price over the years, a fundamental analysis of its price trajectory, and a collation of expert opinions.\n\nOur Ethereum forecast looks into the future to help investors make smart investment decisions. By looking at the Ethereum price chart, we are able to determine the price of Ethereum within the coming decade.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2021\n\nBitcoin may be the godfather of cryptocurrencies, but Ethereum is that young prodigy who has high potentials of outdoing and outclassing its master. So much is the faith experts have in Ethereum that Billy Bambrough, a senior contributor on crypto and blockchain at Forbes, believes that \u201cBitcoin Could Be Left In The Dust By Ethereum In 2021\u2033\u009d.\n\nThe price of Ethereum currently sits at just over $2,400 per Ether. This is a little over half of Ethereum\u2019s highest ever price. The recent bear market saw prices crash all across the cryptocurrency market, and Ethereum was no exception. However, Ethereum has been recovering steadily over the last two weeks and prices are looking up once again.\n\nWith these points in mind, found below are our Ethereum forecasts for a variety of upcoming timeframes:\n\nOne Month \u2013 The past few days have seen Ethereum consolidate after a bullish push. Once this area has been surpassed, expect to see Ethereum head towards the $4000 level over the next month.\n\n\u2013 The past few days have seen Ethereum consolidate after a bullish push. Once this area has been surpassed, expect to see Ethereum head towards the $4000 level over the next month. Three Months \u2013 It\u2019s likely that Ethereum will head towards May\u2019s highs over the next three months, which could prove to be a solid resistance level. We predict that these levels will be broken, seeing Ethereum head towards the $4800 level.\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s likely that Ethereum will head towards May\u2019s highs over the next three months, which could prove to be a solid resistance level. We predict that these levels will be broken, seeing Ethereum head towards the $4800 level. Start of 2022 \u2013 As this will be new territory for Ethereum, the sky is really the limit for this crypto. We believe that a valuation of $5000 per coin is likely by the beginning of 2022, providing a solid base for further momentum.\n\nEthereum Price History \u2013 the Story of 2021 So Far\n\nEthereum started the year with a modest price tag of $770 on January 1, 2021. By the end of January 2021, the price of Ethereum had nearly doubled and was at $1,400. This was great for investors, and despite occasional dips, the price of Ethereum continued to rise on aggregate.\n\nSometime around the middle of February, Ethereum reached an all-time high value of nearly $2,000. One week later, it dropped to around $1,500. On April 1, Ethereum finally broke the $2,000 mark, starting the day on a price tag of $2,100.\n\nThe price of Ethereum continued to experience a steady rise for most of April. By the middle of April, Ethereum had reached another milestone. On April 1, two weeks after breaking past $2,000 for the first time, Ethereum broke past $2,500. This set a new ATH.\n\nEthereum first broke past the $3,000 threshold on May 2, 2021. This was during the last bull run that saw prices soar all across the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum went as high as $4,000 per coin during this same period and reached an all-time high of over $4,300 on May 12, 2021. The onset of the bear market brought the price of Ethereum crashing down.\n\nHowever, the market has been recovering lately, as has the price of Ethereum. This keeps us optimistic that our $3,000 Ethereum forecast is most likely to become a reality. And this is most likely going to happen before the end of August.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast\n\nTaking a look at the growth trajectory of Ethereum so far in 2021, it is not hard to see why we envision sustained increments in the price of Ethereum. The current Ethereum price is only a shadow of its price peaks, meaning Ethereum can become much more valuable with time.\n\nMany experts share this sentiment. Billy Bambrough of Forbes believes that Ethereum will someday become more valuable than Bitcoin. This might seem far-fetched to the casual observer, but many experts believe this to be a possibility.\n\nAccording to a Finder panel, Ethereum will end the year as a better investment than Bitcoin. Returns on investment in Ethereum are expected to exceed those on Bitcoin by 35% in 2021. This panel predicts the price of Ethereum to hover around $17,000 by the end of 2021.\n\nWe are inclined to agree with the panel\u2019s optimism, although our research and analysis predicts that Ethereum will be valued at around $5000 by the end of 2021. It\u2019s unlikely that Ethereum will not experience some struggles over the upcoming months, as rumours surrounding crypto regulation and taxation begin to heat up.\n\nHowever, the signs do seem to point towards some great gains for Ethereum over the next year. The uptake of Ethereum\u2019s technology over 2022 could see the coin push past the $5000 level and head higher. Furthermore, as more companies adopt smart contracts and utilise Ethereum\u2019s platform, the valuation will increase more \u2013 and our analysis leads us to believe that Ethereum could be valued at over $8000 by the end of 2022.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Long Term Outlook\n\nWe expect Ethereum to break through the $4,000 threshold again within the next three months. A $5,000 Ether price tag is also very realistic within this period. The end of the year often sees a rise in general cryptocurrency prices and this year will be no different.\n\nEthereum remains Bitcoin\u2019s closest competitor in the cryptocurrency market. The Ethereum blockchain utility token offers value that even Bitcoin doesn\u2019t. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is an open-source platform, as opposed to the bitcoin blockchain. The implication of this is its benefit for developers.\n\nDevelopers can deploy immutable and permanent decentralised applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can also interact with these applications. This means applications like games and NFT marketplaces can be programmed on the Ethereum blockchain. Combine these with the fact that Ethereum also has smart contract functionality and you can see why a $5,000 price for Ethereum is well within reach in the next three months.\n\nLet us visualize further in the future and discuss Ethereum price estimates for 2022. As is to be expected, every year sees its fair share of bull and bear runs. The coming year will not be an exception. While the price of Ethereum in 2022 will see inevitable ups and downs, there will be an aggregate increase in value. We predict unprecedented growth in the value of Ethereum in 2022. There are two reasons for this.\n\nGas Fees and Blockchain Transition\n\nFirst is the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in general. The last year has seen a surge in both the number of cryptocurrencies on the market and the value of most of these cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocurrencies have experienced double, triple, and even quadruple-digit growth in market value.\n\nThe second and more important reason for the unprecedented growth we foresee in Ethereum\u2019s market value is the coming of Ethereum 2.0. Because of the high gas fees that currently plague the Ethereum network, Ethereum\u2019s founders are working hard to release a new version of Ethereum. This version is set to be released in 2022.\n\nEthereum 2.0 will mark the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from a Proof of Work mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism. This means significantly lesser gas fees, more token utility, and invariably, a surge in Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nCombining the above points, our Ethereum price prediction 2025 puts the crypto\u2019s value at $15,000. The next four years should see Ethereum\u2019s platform rise in popularity, as the use case for this cryptocurrency is much stronger than others. If more entities adopt Ethereum, there\u2019s every reason to believe this valuation could be met.\n\nLooking further into the future, our Ethereum price prediction 2030 has Ethereum\u2019s value reaching the $50,000 mark. Numerous analysts predict even higher values than this, although we are erring on the side of caution as nobody knows the outcome of the rumoured taxation laws. What we can be sure of is that Ethereum\u2019s price looks set to showcase some serious bullish momentum over the next five to ten years \u2013 and beyond!\n\nEthereum Price Chart\n\nEthereum has experienced price swings like every other cryptocurrency in the market. However, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been able to guarantee investors and speculators an aggregate growth in value, and a proof of it could be if we put a context of an Ethereum 5-year forecast as well.\n\nThe chart below reflects Ethereum price live. This price chart details the movement of Ethereum\u2019s market value over the last year.\n\nEthereum price chart | Image source: CoinCodex\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you may already know, Ethereum has emerged as one of the world\u2019s most profitable cryptocurrencies. It is also arguably the most commercially successful cryptocurrency of the year so far.\n\nWith its price currently sitting at around $2500, Ethereum has managed to gain almost a 300% increase in its market value in less than 8 months. This is laudable, considering that this year brought one of crypto\u2019s worst bear markets.\n\nExperts forecast has shown a progressive increase in the price of Ethereum for the rest of the year, following its recovering pace after a bear run which saw a huge price crash across every cryptocurrency market. Ethereum\u2019s growth will be further bolstered in 2022 when Ethereum 2.0 is released. There is no denying that Ethereum can only get bigger from this point.\n\nFAQs"

Ethereum (ETF), XRP, and Solana (SOL) have all seen significant losses in the past day.\n\nAt the time of writing, the original meme coin was trading for $0.08, a 4% increase over the past 24-hour period. And over the week, the asset, which was once Elon Musk's favorite cryptocurrency, has gained more than 10% in value, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn the past day, $2.7 billion worth of DOGE has changed hands. The only times the meme coin's volume has been higher in 2023 were around the time that Musk changed the Twitter logo to a Shiba Inu in April and a Dogecoin developer teased at a new development in February.\n\nAs of 9.30am ET, it the best-performing top digital currency, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElsewhere, though, major assets were hit by a sell-off. ETH lost its $2,000 per coin level it hit last week.

        "title": "What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to bring back Plasma as a blockchain scaling solution that could sidestep existing data availability concerns.\n\nFirst created in 2017, Plasma networks can be considered \u201cchild\u201d chains of the Ethereum mainnet. These execute transactions away from Ethereum using their own block-validation mechanisms, then periodically post final states back to mainnet.\n\nPlasma chains differ from popular scaling solutions such as Arbitrum or Optimism, which instead post computed data back to Ethereum mainnet, although it is compressed.\n\nIn the blockchain world, data tied to computational tasks \u2014 such as processing transactions \u2014 must be stored somewhere. When stored on-chain this process is often costly and time-consuming for network participants, particularly validators and other node operators.\n\nFull nodes on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 and there are roughly 11,000 of them active worldwide \u2014 download all the data of each block so that network participants can verify it. This redundancy make it difficult for invalid transactions to be mistakenly executed.\n\nAlthough great for security, the consensus process hinders scalability as it is inefficient and reduces throughput.\n\nWith Plasma, all data processing and computational tasks are kept off Ethereum mainnet \u2014 only final verified states are posted to the chain \u2014 and thus less data takes up Ethereum block space.\n\nThe problem with Plasma\n\nAccording to Buterin, Plasma was not considered by the current batch of roll-up solutions for its overwhelming costs around client-side data storage and its application limits. This made it difficult to build Plasma-powered apps which did more than simple payments.\n\nIn his recent blog post, Buterin discussed a previous Plasma implementation known as Plasma Cash. This system sees each individual coin as its own non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique history.\n\nOperators on Plasma chains create new blocks in the form of a root of a Merkle tree. This means that every time there is a transaction, the owner of that transaction can be found by stepping through the tree.\n\nIf an operator chooses to misbehave by publishing an invalid or unavailable block, the owner of that transaction will have seven days to cancel by showing that they are either not the latest owner, that there is a double spend, or that there is an invalid history. This can make for a clunky process in the real-world, Buterin explained.\n\n\u201cIf you receive 0.001 ETH each from hundreds of people who are buying coffees from you, you are going to have 0.001 ETH in many places in the tree, and so actually exiting that ETH would still require submitting many separate exits, making the gas fees prohibitive,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nDefragmentation protocols do exist, Buterin said, but they are difficult to implement in practice. Further, it is difficult to apply the Plasma design to a generalized Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) as the design requires specific owners to object to false transactions.\n\nMany DeFi protocols on-chain, for example, do not have unique or individual owners, meaning that complex applications would not be able to work on Plasma.\n\nEnter zk-SNARKS\n\nButerin noted that concerns around Plasma can be resolved with the introduction of zk-SNARKS and validity proofs.\n\nZk-SNARKS, short for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d enables blockchains to prove that information is accurate without revealing the contents of the information itself.\n\nSNARKS are the proof system, and validity proofs are cryptographic proofs which attest that the information is indeed accurate.\n\n\u201cThe largest challenge of making Plasma work for payments, client-side data storage, can be efficiently addressed with validity proofs. Additionally, validity proofs provide a wide array of tools that allow us to make a Plasma-like chain that runs an EVM,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nValidity proofs will be able to prove that each Plasma block that is on the blockchain is valid \u2014 meaning that it will no longer be necessary to worry about who the last owner of each individual transaction on a Merkle tree is.\n\n\u201cIn a validity-proven Plasma chain, such withdrawals would not be subject to any challenges at all. This means that, in the normal case, withdrawals can be instant,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nConsiderations\n\nAlthough zk-SNARKs and validity proofs can address significant problems with the previous Plasma design, Buterin reasoned, there are still limitations.\n\nThis is most clearly highlighted when a particular state object, such as a token, does not have a clear economic owner.\n\nButerin drew on the example of Uniswap liquidity provider positions: \u201cIf you traded USDC for ETH in a Uniswap position, you could try to withdraw your pre-trade USDC and your post-trade ETH. If you collude with the Plasma chain operator, the liquidity providers and other users would not have access to the post-trade state, so they would not be able to withdraw their post-trade USDC.\u201d\n\nThis shows that although Plasma potentially offers useful solutions, there may still be concerns about bad actors, which should be addressed.\n\nDespite this, Buterin believes that Plasma remains an underrated design in the blockchain technology space and could help ease Ethereum transaction fees.\n\n\u201cRollups remain the gold standard, and have security properties that cannot be matched. This is particularly true from the developer experience perspective: nothing can match the simplicity of an application developer not even having to think about ownership graphs and incentive flows within their application,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cHowever, Plasma lets us completely sidestep the data availability question, greatly reducing transaction fees. Plasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Users of dapps that rely on Pyth network data across 27 blockchains\u2014including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism\u2014may be eligible for a token allocation, according to the network. Pyth Network Discord administrators and holders of Pyth NFTs are also likely to receive an allotment.\n\nThe Claim Process for the Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop will open on Monday, Nov 20 at 2 PM UTC. Stay tuned for more details on instructions on how the Claim Process works. Additionally, the Claim Process will be available for 90 days.

DeFi users can check their potential eligibility for the airdrop, as well as the amount of PYTH they are set to receive, at the network\u2019s airdrop check page.\n\nPyth users in several countries, however, will be ineligible to participate by default, due to mitigating legal factors. Residents of the United States and the United Kingdom will not be able to claim PYTH tokens; nor will residents of North Korea, Ukraine, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and eight other nations and territories.\n\nPyth\u2019s native token will have an initial circulating supply of 1.5 billion, according to the network. 8.5 billion additional PYTH tokens will unlock between six and 42 months from launch.\n\nDeFi oracle networks like Pyth connect blockchains with data sources from the off-chain world, allowing DeFi smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs from real-world events and data. They can enable smart contracts, for example, to automatically order products when an inventory drops; to pay out agreements that hinge on the price of stocks and commodities; or to track carbon emissions and tax a company if a certain level is exceeded. Oracle networks are central to the growing integration of the crypto market and traditional financial markets, as well as the application of smart contracts to traditional businesses.\n\nAs intermediaries of information, oracle networks can also be exploited. Last fall, a hacker managed to drain $100 million from decentralized exchange Mango Markets by manipulating the oracle-reported price of the MNGO token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPyth is the fourth-largest such oracle network by total value secured, according to DeFi Llama; Pyth\u2019s chief competitor, Chainlink, boasts over nine times the value secured, and a dominant 45% market share, compared with Pyth\u2019s 4.83%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "JPMorgan Chase, Siemens, and FedEx show that blockchain finance is more than a buzzword - Fortune",
        "content": "Innovation is a funny thing. It often arrives with an excess of hype and then fades into disappointment\u2014before reemerging in full bloom. A case in point is JPMorgan Chase\u2019s \u201cJPM Coin,\u201d a corporate stablecoin launched shortly after the 2017 crypto bubble that seemed doomed to languish as a proof of concept that would never catch on in the real world.\n\nIn recent weeks however, the story around JPM Coin has changed dramatically as the bank announced that it is notching daily transaction volumes above $1 billion and that its big corporate clients are finally tapping into the coin\u2019s promise to provide \u201cprogrammable\u201d money.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with JPM Coin, it\u2019s a digital dollar that the bank created on a private version of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that clients with access to the coin (or ones like it) can enjoy the benefits of crypto technology\u2014including 24/7 transactions and smart contracts\u2014within a secure corporate environment. Well, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work in theory.\n\nIn reality, the past six years have been marked by a series of announcements involving banks and companies saying they\u2019ve carried out a blockchain transaction\u2014involving dollars or equities or commodities\u2014and that\u2019s been the end of the matter. While the transactions did occur, they didn\u2019t really matter since they were mostly one-off events that didn\u2019t lead to any changes in day-to-day commerce.\n\nThis has quietly begun to change, however, as companies have moved past the PR phase of blockchain and started tapping into its actual benefits. I spoke with Naveen Mallela, the head of coin systems (yes, that\u2019s a title) at JPMorgan Chases\u2019s Onyx unit, and he explained that the likes of Siemens, Cargill, and FedEx are all using these tools in daily operations.\n\nMallela told me that customers are viewing JPM Coin less as a stablecoin than as a tool to manage commercial deposits and take advantage of programmable money. I pushed him on that, asking what exactly he means by programmable. He explained that it means creating automated instructions for funds you control. A primitive illustration is autopay for bills but, thanks to blockchain, companies can now carry out far more sophisticated operations.\n\nMallela gave three persuasive examples of programmable money in action: companies using blockchain to carry out cash sweeps that used to happen once a day, but that can now occur anytime; finance firms using smart contracts to monitor and address margin calls for securities; and companies arranging for shipping payments to be released at various stages of a voyage.\n\nBy relying on smart contracts to handle these operations, companies can deploy cash and staffing resources more efficiently. And this is likely only the beginning. Mallela notes that IFTTT (\u201cif this, then that\u201d) instructions are becoming commonplace in the corporate blockchain environment and that companies will find more and more ways to use them.\n\nMeanwhile, programmable money is sprouting up in the investment sector as well\u2014JPMorgan Chase and Apollo just launched tokenized funds in Singapore, while a startup called Superstate, founded by the creator of the popular DeFi protocol Compound, just raised $14 million to do the same in the U.S. All of this shows that while blockchain-based finance is still far from mainstream, it has quietly taken a giant leap forward.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBinance is launching a new crypto exchange in Thailand alongside Gulf Energy, a giant conglomerate run by the country's second-richest man.

        "title": "Metadata in Blockchain Transactions Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Examples of Metadata in Blockchain Transactions\n\nMetadata comprises a wide range of information and capabilities, such as timestamps, transaction particulars, smart contract data, digital signatures, gas fees, IPFS links, Oracle information, and nonfungible token (NFT) metadata. These metadata elements empower the blockchain network to store and operate a variety of functions and data.\n\nTimestamps\n\nEach block in a blockchain is accompanied by a timestamp that indicates the exact instant it was appended to the chain. This metadata documents the precise moment a transaction takes place.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nA variety of metadata, including sender and recipient addresses, transaction quantities, and unique transaction IDs, may be appended to each transaction recorded on a blockchain.\n\nSmart Contract Data\n\nMetadata could potentially contain parameters and input data that are essential for the functioning of the contract during the execution of smart contracts on a blockchain.\n\nDigital Signatures\n\nDigital signatures are included in metadata to verify the authenticity of transactions and establish ownership.\n\nGas Fees\n\nMetadata on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum may contain information pertaining to the petrol charges incurred during transaction processing. This information is necessary for miners and validators to effectively prioritize transactions.\n\nInterPlanetary File System Links\n\nIn blockchain metadata, references to IPFS, a decentralized file storage system, are present. In order to gain access to the data stored on the blockchain, users must periodically retrieve a reference to the IPFS file, typically in the form of a hash. This method allows for the storage of substantial files, such as documents, videos, or images that pertain to on-chain assets like NFTs.\n\nOracles\n\nOracles are external services that grant access to real-world data for smart contracts. Information from these oracles may be incorporated into blockchain metadata in order to activate smart contracts.\n\nNonfungible Token Metadata\n\nMetadata, including creators\u2019 names, descriptions, and additional particulars pertaining to the digital or physical assets they symbolize, is frequently included in NFTs.\n\nHow to Add Metadata to a Blockchain Transaction?\n\nIn order to incorporate metadata into a blockchain transaction, a user may utilize a smart contract, which consists of predetermined terms inscribed within it and operates autonomously.\n\nBy employing Ethereum as an illustrative case, we can comprehend the process. Ethereum is renowned for its capability to incorporate metadata into transactions via smart contracts.\n\nCreate a Smart Contract\n\nThe creation of a smart contract is a prerequisite for the addition of metadata. Specific guidelines regarding the location and method of metadata storage are incorporated within this contractual agreement. The metadata may be stored in a defined variable, which is typically a string.\n\nInteracting With the Smart Contract\n\nMetadata must be appended to a blockchain transaction via a transaction transmitted by an individual to the smart contract. Wallet applications for Ethereum or libraries such as web3.js or ethers.js may be utilized for this purpose.\n\nVerifying the Metadata\n\nThe metadata can be verified by any individual through interaction with the smart contract and by accessing the metadata variable subsequent to the transaction\u2019s confirmation and inclusion in the blockchain. Nevertheless, when adding metadata to a blockchain transaction, it is critical to keep in mind that factors including petrol costs, security, and privacy must be assumed.\n\nUse Cases of Blockchain Metadata\n\nMetadata generated by blockchain technology is implemented across numerous sectors, such as healthcare, digital identity, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nUtilizing a blockchain to store product production, transportation, and quality-related metadata can assist organizations in enhancing transparency and traceability. For instance, a food manufacturer may maintain records pertaining to the origin of components, their progression through the supply chain, and assessments of their quality.\n\nEnsuring regulatory compliance, addressing issues such as fraud or recalls, and confirming authenticity are all dependent on this information. Moreover, consumers can utilize this metadata to formulate informed judgments concerning the products they acquire.\n\nDigital Identity and Authentication\n\nMetadata on the blockchain can be utilized to preserve and safeguard credentials and confidential information. Individuals have control over their data and have the ability to grant or deny access to authorized parties; this reduces the likelihood of identity theft and privacy breaches. This technology can be utilized by educational institutions, governments, and businesses to expedite identification verification processes and enhance service security.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are an additional field in which blockchain metadata is indispensable. These self-executing contracts determine when and how to carry out a specific condition based on metadata. As an illustration, an insurance smart contract might employ meteorological data as metadata in order to promptly commence disbursements for policyholders who have been adversely affected by inclement weather.\n\nEligibility and interest rates for loans in the financial sector can be determined by loan agreements using metadata-maintained credit ratings and transaction histories. This enables the industry to conduct lending procedures in a more streamlined and automated fashion.\n\nNonfungible Tokens and Digital Assets\n\nNFTs and digital assets frequently employ blockchain data to assign significance and value to digital artifacts, artwork, and assets. Metadata pertains to details such as the characteristics of the digital item, the originator, and the ownership history. This knowledge can significantly benefit provenance tracing, art authentication, and the development of decentralized applications (DApps) that are built upon NFTs.\n\nHealthcare Records and Data Security\n\nIn addition, the healthcare industry is employing blockchain metadata to ensure data integrity and secure the management of patient records. Metadata can be utilized to retain medical histories, patient consent forms, and data access logs, thereby enhancing the confidentiality and security of health information. In addition, it enables communication among diverse healthcare systems and expedites the acquisition of critical medical information by emergency responders.\n\nChallenges Associated With Blockchain Metadata and Way Forward\n\nAddressing obstacles related to blockchain metadata, such as concerns regarding scalability, data security, and Oracle dependability, is imperative for the long-term progress of technology and its extensive implementation.\n\nScalability and storage costs are significant considerations due to the fact that as the scale of blockchain networks increases, they may experience a decline in efficiency and require more resources. The storage of massive amounts of data on the blockchain could place a burden on the network\u2019s architecture and heighten the danger of centralization.\n\nData privacy and security are additional concerns, especially when handling private or sensitive information. Privacy regulations may be in conflict with the transparency of blockchain technology; therefore, implementation and design must be approached with care. In addition, malicious or erroneous data inputs may compromise the dependability of blockchain applications and smart contracts that rely on oracles to retrieve external data.\n\nIt is imperative to tackle these obstacles in order to ensure the ongoing progress and widespread implementation of blockchain technology across diverse sectors. To surmount these challenges in blockchain metadata, a diversified approach is required. To mitigate scalability challenges, developers may consider investigating layer-2 solutions and sharding techniques as a means to offload specific data from the primary chain.\n\nThe utilization of permissioned blockchains and encryption can enhance the privacy and security of sensitive data. An additional layer of security can be applied to Oracle by utilizing multiple data sources for reputation and validation mechanisms. In light of this, blockchain metadata can be rendered more secure and efficient through the implementation of robust security protocols, innovative technology, and meticulous design."

        "content": "Plasma aimed to increase efficiency by taking the bulk of the data off the main chain.\n\nVitalik Buterin claimed that validity proofs could help in plugging the limitations of Plasma.\n\nAs Ethereum [ETH] congestion reached record levels, the need for effective scaling solutions was higher than ever in the blockchain industry.\n\nVitalik bats for Plasma chains\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin talked about the largely ignored advantages of layer-2 scaling solution Plasma in a recently published blog post, and urged Web3 developers to re-explore the technology.\n\nProposed by Buterin himself in 2017, Plasma aimed to increase efficiency by taking the bulk of the data off the main chain. The data is then redistributed onto a series of smaller chains called sidechains.\n\nDue to this, it was the best choice for high-throughput payment transactions.\n\nThese were the shortcomings\n\nHowever, the solution fell behind the competition due to its limitations in enabling smart contract deployment, something that rollups like Optimism [OP] and Arbitrum [ARB] allow.\n\nMoreover, Plasma sacrifices some aspects of security in favor of greater scalability. Highlighted by Vitalik Buterin as well, each Plasma sidechain was independent and responsible for its own security. This made them vulnerable to hacks if there wasn\u2019t enough mining power to secure them.\n\nOn the other hand, rollups, as we know, post all the information about executed transactions on the main chain. Therefore, rollups have been known to have much higher security than Plasma chains.\n\nWhat is the future?\n\nHowever, validity proofs could help in plugging the limitations of Plasma, said the inventor of Ethereum.\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cPlasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums. The fact that ZK-EVMs are finally coming to fruition this year makes it an excellent opportunity to re-explore this design space.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nRecall that Polygon [MATIC] introduced a proposal earlier to upgrade the PoS network to a zkEVM validium\n\nWhile admitting that rollups were the \u201cgold standard\u201d in scaling solutions, Buterin called for a revisit of Plasma technology because of its advantages in throughput and cost-effectiveness."

        "title": "How Jane Street-backed ZetaChain aims to expand Bitcoin\u2019s use cases - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Despite its dominant market share in the crypto sphere, Bitcoin has had limited applications compared to other blockchains which have blossomed to facilitate asset transfers in everything from financial products to video games.\n\nEthereum, for example, has close to 6,000 developers actively building on its network every month as of October 1, according to numbers from Developer Report. Bitcoin, in comparison, has just under 1,000 monthly developers.\n\nA California-based startup called ZetaChain wants to change that by including Bitcoin in the flourishing economy of decentralized finance (DeFi). Off the back of its sizable $27 million Series A raise in August, the company has been busy striking partnerships to scale its blockchain ecosystem.\n\nZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and get access to other blockchains without the need for so-called \u201cbridges\u201d or \u201cwrapped coins\u201d, which are popular solutions that solve one of the biggest hurdles in crypto today \u2014 interoperability across different networks.\n\nOne of the breakthroughs brought by ZetaChain, according to its core contributor Ankur Nandwani, is that developers can deploy smart contracts on the blockchain that can interact with native Bitcoin, essentially adding a smart contract layer to Bitcoin. First proposed by Ethereum, smart contracts are lines of code that execute on predefined rules and have given rise to a proliferation of applications like non-fungible tokens.\n\n\u201cEvery blockchain is like an isolated state and we are connecting them,\u201d said Nandwani in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cMost people use Bitcoin as gold. If you can borrow against gold, you should be able to do what you do with gold for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nToday, ZetaChain announced that it\u2019s adding native Bitcoin support to decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, letting users swap Bitcoin across 30 networks. Behind the scenes, Sushi works by deploying its EVM (Ethereum virtual machine)-compatible smart contract on ZetaChain, meaning that, for the first time, Sushi can support native Bitcoins by making minimal changes.\n\nThese Sushi smart contracts can be accessed from the Bitcoin network itself, so Bitcoin users don\u2019t even need to leave the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the increased liquidity from Bitcoin; it\u2019s about beginning a new chapter in DeFi, where we see more practical use cases of interoperability and enhanced connectivity,\u201d said Sushi\u2019s \u201chead chef\u201d Jared Grey in a statement.\n\nIn October, ZetaChain integrated with centralized exchange OKX\u2019s self-custodial wallet, allowing users to access dApps on various networks and to use their Bitcoins in dApps without the need for wrapping or bridging from the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nStarted in 2021 by serial entrepreneur Nandwani, ZetaChain announced its Series A funding round in August from investors from a range of backgrounds, including quantitative trading firm Jane Street Capital, crypto exchange Blockchain.com and China-focused early-stage VC firm Sky9."

        "title": "Is Solana (SOL) Worth the Hype? - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Crypto investors are buzzing about Solana again, and with good reason: the value of SOL is up over 350% since a year ago:\n\nIt has many of the hallmarks of a good investment: it\u2019s a real project (a leading Layer 1), with real users (about 100K/day), generating real revenue (about $50K/day in fees).\n\nBut is it a good long-term investment?\n\nAt Bitcoin Market Journal, we\u2019re in this for the long haul. And personally, I think Solana is a long shot in the long term. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThere Can Be Only One (or Two)\n\nOur first investing thesis is that while lots of experiments happen in the early stages of a new technology, ultimately only one (or sometimes two) big platforms survive in the long run. (Think PCs and Macs, Androids and iPhones, etc.)\n\nIn the traditional tech world, this is because big players get bigger, mostly through network effects: the bigger you get, the easier for new customers to join you. The smaller companies either get acquired, or driven out of business.\n\nThis is how we end up with Google gobbling up all the search business, OpenAI overtaking AI, and Salesforce forcing out other CRMs.\n\nIn the emergent world of blockchain technology, we are only just starting to understand what the categories even are. But one category is definitely smart contract platforms (a.k.a. Layer 1s), the operating system for crypto.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is, by all measures, the 800-pound gorilla in this space. They have the most users, the most revenue, the most developers. So for a competing Layer-1 like Solana, Ethereum is the one to beat.\n\nFor all the hype, let\u2019s look at how Solana stacks up:\n\nEthereum Solana Daily Active Users 300,000 100,000 Daily Fees $5,000,000 $50,000 Active Developers 200 75\n\nSource: Token Terminal (rounded for readability)\n\nThis is not to say that Solana must beat Ethereum in order to survive. Niche search engines like DuckDuckGo or WolframAlpha (I\u2019m still waiting for WolframBeta) have survived against Google. But their market share is tiny by comparison.\n\nAs long-term investors, we don\u2019t want to pick the projects that will survive; we want to pick the projects that will thrive. The numbers above show you that Solana has traction, but it still has a way to go.\n\nIt\u2019s Not the Technology, It\u2019s the Users\n\nBlockchain nerds get really excited about Solana\u2019s faster throughput (due to its Proof of History consensus algorithm vs. Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake), and its developer friendliness (they can use languages like Rust and C, vs. having to learn Ethereum\u2019s Solidity).\n\nThe tech crowd gets really excited about the tech, but no one else does. This is because the market does not really care about technology, the market cares about the users.\n\nIf a company is building a new blockchain application, where would they want to build it?\n\nThe one with a better consensus algorithm, or the one where more users are going to be able to use it?\n\nThe one with an easier programming language, or the one that\u2019s going to generate more revenue and fees?\n\nThe underdog, or the existing leader?\n\nCompanies will generally go with bigger tech platforms, because they\u2019re a safer bet. There\u2019s safety in numbers.\n\nBut what about investors? My experience is that investors also do not really care about the technology, they care about whether they can make money. The technology is only relevant if it\u2019s going to lead to a higher price multiple in the end.\n\nVHS vs. Betamax, MP3 vs. FLAC, QWERTY vs. any other keyboard layout: often the inferior technology wins. In blockchain, especially, the tech is only relevant if it leads to more users.\n\nMore users = more network effects = more value.\n\nYou want to find winning long-term investments? Look for blockchain projects with userbases that are large and growing. (Remember that before this recent price rally, the crypto outlets were bemoaning Solana\u2019s drop in daily users.)\n\nWhere are the Killer Apps?\n\nLayer 1s are like operating systems: to grab those critical users, you\u2019ve got to have some killer apps. For example, VisiCalc put the Apple II on the map, AOL introduced the Internet to the masses, and Siri made the iPhone indispensable.\n\n(In blockchain, we call them decentralized apps or \u201cdapps,\u201d but c\u2019mon, they\u2019re just apps.)\n\nOn Solana, you\u2019ve got the usual assortment of dapps: a DEX (Serum), an AMM (Raydium), wallets (Phantom), borrowing/lending (Solend), NFT marketplaces (Magic Eden). I think of these as copycats of bigger, more popular dapps on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, there are a few dapps that take advantage of Solana tech:\n\nThe decentralized music platform Audius lets artists publish directly to listeners and cut out the middleman, using Solana\u2019s higher throughput and lower transaction fees to handle a large volume of microtransactions.\n\nThe MMO game Star Atlas runs a complex game economy with real-time transactions\u2014all those tiny transactions are easier and faster to process on Solana than Ethereum.\n\nMango Markets offers decentralized spot trading and perpetual futures, which is nothing new, but Solana\u2019s speed and efficiency can allow for higher-frequency trading with lower latency.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that Solana can carve out a niche around dapps that require high-speed microtransactions. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d want to see a lot more of these specific dapps launching over the next year: dapps that you simply couldn\u2019t build on Ethereum.\n\nInvestor Takeaway: So Long, Solana\n\nThe recent price gains are likely due to excitement over Solana\u2019s Breakpoint community conference, and bullish sentiment from influencers like Cathie Wood.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely that Solana will unseat Ethereum anytime soon. I don\u2019t see any reason to jump on this bandwagon, especially when prices are triple what they were just a month ago.\n\nBut technology is full of surprises, and the early leaders aren\u2019t always the later leaders. Ethereum may not be the Layer 1 for the long term, and Solana may carve out a profitable niche. But at the moment, ETH is still the one to beat.\n\nSo for now, it\u2019s so long, Solana. But we\u2019ll keep an eye on you.\n\nFor more tips on building wealth with bitcoin and crypto, subscribe to our daily Bitcoin Market Journal newsletter."

The company anticipates a positive trajectory for Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP, though it warns of potential challenges for DOGE.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitget has stated that the Bitcoin market\u2019s expectations for future upward movement primarily hinge on the following factors:\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to halt interest rate hikes and the timing of rate cuts.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs by institutions such as BlackRock.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving.\n\nRegulatory easing to increase market access.\n\n\u201cCurrently, data indicates that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut may be delayed until September 2024, and the review results for Bitcoin ETFs are likely to be postponed until 2024. The Bitcoin halving is expected in 2024, and judging from the Litecoin halving hype, it\u2019s generating moderate interest,\u201d Bitget explained.\n\nBitget further noted that a recent court ruling mandates the US SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust conversion to an ETF. The listing of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has led to increased market belief that regulatory conditions are improving, increasing the likelihood of approval for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn addition, the firm highlighted that the market has been consolidating at lower levels for a long time, but there is now a demand for a rebound. Bitget stressed that interest rate policies are stabilizing, and the market is expecting an upward breakthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpward targets include $36,000, $38,000, and $42,000, with support at $32,000. However, it\u2019s not ruled out that a new black swan event could cause Bitcoin to return to a range of $25,000 to $32,000 in volatility,\u201d the exchange concluded.\n\nFor more articles on Bitcoin, visit the BitPinas page.\n\nEther (ETH)\n\nBitget highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s market share has reached a two-year high at 51%, while Ethereum\u2019s on-chain activity is at historic lows with daily Gas fees dropping to single digits. The exchange pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s price has been in a weaker position than Bitcoin, primarily following Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.\n\nHowever, Bitget still expects the Kusama upgrade at the end of the year to improve the development of Layer 2 solutions, which could lead to a price increase for Ethereum in early 2024.\n\nThe exchange noted that key levels to monitor for ETH are $2,400 and $2,800, with support levels around $1,500.\n\nRead: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Confirmed, Ether Surge in Price\n\nXRP\n\nAccording to the exchange, the likelihood of an upward trend in Ripple\u2019s price is driven by several positive factors.\n\nNotably, the US SEC dropped all charges against Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and Executive Chairman, Chris Larsen. This marks their third consecutive legal victory, following the July 2023 ruling that deemed \u201cXRP itself is not a security\u201d and the October federal judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the SEC\u2019s appeal request.\n\n\u201cIn terms of contract positions, Binance\u2019s long-to-short ratio is 2.5894, and the long-to-short ratio of account positions is 1.3357, indicating strong bullish sentiment. It\u2019s crucial to monitor whether the price can break through and hold above the 0.5u level. Once it stabilizes, there\u2019s potential to break through the prior resistance zone around 0.54u,\u201d the firm added.\n\nBitget, however, noted that support levels to watch are around the lows from July and September, near 0.46u. If there are no specific news catalysts, the cryptocurrency may remain in a narrow trading range, awaiting potential upward moves in Bitcoin or further developments in the news.\n\nDOGE\n\nAccording to Bitget\u2019s forecast, there is a high probability of Dogecoin price decline before the end of the year, as there are few positive factors influencing the price. In comparison to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has fewer positive news and development catalysts.\n\nHowever, the exchange emphasized that Binance\u2019s long-to-short ratio of 3.2589 and the long-to-short ratio of account positions at 1.0927 suggest a bullish sentiment among traders.\n\nAccordingly, Bitget noted that DOGE has experienced a decrease in both trading volume and price, fully retracing its 2023 gains.\n\n\u201cDOGE has experienced a decrease in both trading volume and price, fully retracing its 2023 gains. Monitoring the critical price support at $0.566 is crucial, as a breach could trigger accumulated selling pressure from earlier levels, potentially resulting in additional declines. Given the sustained long-term downtrend, the probability of an upward trend is relatively low,\u201d the firm stated.\n\nWhat is Bitget?\n\nEstablished in 2018, Bitget is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that enables users to buy, sell, hold, and earn cryptocurrencies. Bitget supports over 500 altcoins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. It offers a variety of services, including futures trading, copy trading, and smart trading tools.\n\nIn May, the Bitcoin, Beer, and Bitstories, co-presented by Bitget, centered on crypto trading strategies. The panel delved into the present state of the crypto industry, affirming its resilience despite the bear market. Discussion points included factors influencing trading and investment strategies, such as policy impacts, the role of institutions in fund flows, and the significance of risk mitigation.\n\nThis article is published on BitPinas: Crypto Exchange Bitget: 2024 Forecast for BTC, ETH, DOGE, XRP\n\nDisclaimer:"
