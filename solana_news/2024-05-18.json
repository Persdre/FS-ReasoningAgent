        "title": "IBC to Ethereum: Building the interconnected Internet of Blockchains - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009 and the explosion of innovation that followed, the web3 industry has faced many challenges. Beyond dealing with regulators, improving UX, and weeding out bad actors, blockchain engineers continue to tackle two major hurdles: scalability and interoperability.\n\nWhile many Layer 2s are working to scale Layer 1s like Bitcoin and Ethereum by improving throughput and reducing transaction fees, protocols like Union enable both\u2014interoperability at scale.\n\nThe need for blockchain interoperability\n\nWhatever your opinion on the WEF, its 2020 whitepaper on blockchain interoperability hit the nail when it stated, \u201cOrganisations do not want to find themselves on a blockchain platform that may limit their options for external collaboration in the future.\u201d\n\nTo elaborate further on that point, imagine having a Gmail account, sending a message to a Yahoo account, and being unable to exchange communications. The internet was able to develop as quickly as it did because it factored in interoperability from the early days, and blockchains must do the same.\n\nA notable player in the interoperability space is Cosmos, whose flagship Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol has enabled a host of sovereign chains to connect, transact, exchange, swap tokens, and perform other actions without compromising sovereignty. Map of Zones shows 91 zones now connected via IBC transacting more than $2.1 billion over the last 30 days in more than 8.7 million transactions.\n\nIBC isn\u2019t limited to Cosmos chains, either. The trustless interoperability protocol has broadened its scope to include EVM-compatible chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. However, most bridging solutions so far have been offered by centralized providers, meaning users must trust the bridging protocol.\n\nUnion provides a permissionless bridging protocol that connects modular blockchains and rollups trustlessly, without depending on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC, using advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography.\n\nAlready connecting several ecosystems, Union recently announced a partnership with L2 developer Polygon Labs that will tap into Polygon\u2019s AggLayer \u201cto facilitate message passing and asset transfers between the Polygon ecosystem and IBC-enabled chains,\u201d bridging two of the largest blockchain ecosystems: Polygon and Cosmos.\n\nPermissionlessly bridging Polygon, Cosmos, and beyond\n\nUnion founder and prior CTO at Composable Finance Karel Kubat told CryptoSlate, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a Cosmos to Polygon bridge but anything that\u2019s IBC-enabled, which includes Scroll, and soon Arbitrum, Berrachain, Movement Labs, M2\u2026 They can build and connect into the Agglayer using Union,\u201d permissionlessly tapping into the liquidity of one of the largest blockchain Layer 1s, Ethereum.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s very interesting because we have big L1 ecosystems that really only have permissioned centralized bridges or something in between. You need to go to the bridge provider to get support for a small ecosystem. What Union does, is if you\u2019re building a new Cosmos chain or a new rollup that\u2019s IBC enabled, you don\u2019t need to go to a centralized provider to get support. You just open the connection to Ethereum and you\u2019re done\u2026 So we\u2019re going quite quickly from a world with only 200 to 300 ecosystems to a world with thousands and thousands.\u201d\n\nThis type of seamless interoperability isn\u2019t possible with centralized solutions because the \u201cwait queue\u201d is too long. Every chain wanting to connect needs to request the bridging protocol\u2019s permission.\n\nWith Union, chains can permissionlessly open a channel with Ethereum, enabling a seamlessly interconnected future\u2026 of potentially millions of chains. Karel gives the example of dYdX, one of the largest decentralized exchanges that began as a smart contract on Ethereum and moved ecosystems to become a sovereign Cosmos app chain.\n\n\u201cWe all went into crypto for sovereignty,\u201d he says. \u201cAny successful smart contract is contemplating going to their own L2 or app chain.\u201d This means the total addressable market for Union is potentially vast. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone that wants to build a blockchain. It\u2019s any existing app on Ethereum and Solana that could benefit from making this move.\u201d\n\nUnion\u2019s IBC to Polygon bridge should be completed by the end of this year and you can keep up with the latest developments by following Union on X.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Coinbase analysts expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs would be approved.\n\nVitalik Buterin has responded to criticisms labeled at Ethereum developers, stating how they have been addressing some of the concerns of community members.\n\nEthereum could see a further rise as it outperforms Bitcoin for the first time in May.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a quick rally on Friday, posting a 5% gain as its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, responded to recent criticisms from the crypto community. Coinbase analysts have also expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs would debut in the market soon.\n\nRead more: Ethereum drops below $3,000 again, spot ETH ETF sparks debate in crypto community\n\nDaily digest market movers: Processing speed, Buterin's response\n\nCoinbase analysts have said that spot Ethereum ETFs would debut in the market despite the silence from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) towards issuers. \"As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it\u2019s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,\" said Coinbase analyst David Han.\n\nHe added that if the first deadline on May 23 sees a rejection from the SEC, \"there\u2019s a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, following Ethereum's slow price growth compared to Bitcoin and Solana, many crypto community members on X have targeted core Ethereum developers through a series of criticisms.\n\nMany criticized Ethereum's \"acceptance of MEV\" after the Department of Justice arrested two brothers for an MEV-related exploit on the number one smart contract blockchain. Others complained that Ethereum folks need to post more about the protocol and its updates.\n\nRead more: US Department of Justice charges brothers for alleged 12-second MEV fraud\n\nOne X user, @chainyoda, shared his plight:\n\nEthereum has a very bad case of cosmos infection.

This cycle all the ethereum devs and investors speak only PhD eg based sequencer, shared sequencer, intercontinental rollup... and one else gives a fk \u2014 chainyoda (@chainyoda) May 17, 2024\n\nMore importantly, Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi expressed dissatisfaction with the several upgrades the Ethereum network has undergone in a short while. \"My criticism is that you (Ethereum developers have) [...] have abandoned due process and rushed to hotfix things.\"\n\nPrivate transactions. Check.\n\nProprietary settlements (MEV). Check.\n\nStaked Ether issued by central auth. Check.\n\n\n\n0 local miner tips will nuke local stakers.\n\nGigagas hardware reqs will nuke local nodes.\n\n\n\nVoila, the banking system recreated. All privately held and operated. \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) May 16, 2024\n\nThe increased concerns sparked a series of posts from several Ethereum core contributors, including Josh Stark, Tim Beiko, Dankrad Feist and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin gave a detailed response to these criticisms in a blog post, stating that the concerns raised by community members are valid and \"are already being addressed by protocol features that are already in-progress.\"\n\nHe also stated that several other concerns from the community can be \"addressed by very realistic tweaks to the current roadmap.\" Buterin addressed three major areas that he believes form the majority of the concerns raised:\n\nMEV and builder dependence\n\nLiquid staking\n\nHardware requirement of nodes\n\nHe discussed how Verkle trees, EIP-4444, robust solo staking, and a peer-pressuring development process for MEV reduction can solve these issues.\n\n\"There is a near-unlimited number of blockchain projects aiming for the niche of \u2018we can be super-fast, we'll think about decentralization later.\u2019 I don't think Ethereum should be one of those projects,\" said Buterin.\n\n\"We should have deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique, and continue to work to maintain and improve on those properties as Ethereum scales,\" he added.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could attempt to break $3,251 resistance\n\nEthereum posted a 5% gain on Friday after it broke the $3,103 resistance. The rise follows a general appreciation of assets in the crypto market. However, Ethereum notably outperformed Bitcoin in the past 24 hours after several community members highlighted the ETH/BTC ratio was nearing a bottom.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows slight bullish signs, SEC faces several hurdles in attempts to deny spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nAs a result, ETH short liquidations are outpacing longs for the first time. With a total liquidation of $24.5 million in the past 24 hours, short liquidations sit at $17.54 million compared to $6.76 million long liquidations, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nThe recent ETH rise has also caused a spike in ETH open interest, which increased by 6.6% in the past 24 hours. This signifies renewed investor interest in ETH, meaning it may see less sideways movement in the coming days.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIf renewed confidence prevails, ETH could attempt to break the $3,161 resistance and, if successful, move past the $3,251 mark. However, it's important to watch out for volatility in the days leading up to the SEC's decision on spot ETH ETFs on May 23."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap entered a fresh rally in mid-week and rebounded from $2860 monthly support. This renewed buying interest bolstered by the Bitcoin price jump to $67000 on Friday has surged the ETH price to an 8.7% gain. However, an analysis of the daily chart shows the rising Ether price is heading to a crucial resistance indicating an upcoming pivot momentum for this asset.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Charts Might Turn Bullish Now: ETH Targets $4k?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Poised for Rebound as Falling Channel Pattern Nears Break\n\nIn the daily time frame chart, the Ethereum price shows the formation of a falling channel pattern. The two parallel trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support have plunged the ETH value from $4084 to $2864 support indicating a nearly 30% loss.\n\nWhile the BTC price rally bolsters a new recovery sentiment in altcoin, the ETH price could remain trapped in a correction until the chart setup is intact.\n\nHaving said that, the Ether coin is heading higher to challenge the upper boundary of the Channel pattern. After a 3% upswing, the coin buyers escape the range of this pattern, signaling the end-of-correction trend.\n\nAccording to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in the middle of its bull cycle. Ju highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that historically lasts around two years.\n\nIf this pattern continues, the current bull cycle might extend until April 2025. The accompanying chart from CryptoQuant illustrates the growth rate difference between Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and realized cap, showing similar cycles approximately every two years.\n\nThis potential uptrend significantly influences the altcoin market bolstering top assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP to lead to higher rallies.\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the channel pattern will accelerate the buying momentum and assist buyers in rechallenging the $4080 high.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA prevents the ETH price from breaching the channel pattern.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The ADX slope falling below 18% hints the prevailing bearish momentum is weakening.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Could Investing $10,000 in Solana Make You a Millionaire? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Could Ethereum's rival generate major multibagger gains?\n\nSolana (SOL -1.70%) has minted a lot of millionaires since its launch in 2020. The cryptocurrency started trading at $0.95 and hit its all-time high of $260.06 on Nov. 6, 2021 -- which would have turned a $10,000 investment into $2.74 million.\n\nSolana was widely seen as an alternative to Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) for the development of decentralized apps. Solana's blockchain was faster, more scalable, and had lower transaction costs than Ethereum. It accomplished that by using its unique proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism to accelerate the proof-of-stake (PoS) mining method used by Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a series of network congestion and security failures caused Solana to lose its luster, and rising rates subsequently crushed the cryptocurrency market. To make matters worse, failed crypto exchange FTX hastily liquidated its Solana tokens in several huge auctions to raise more cash to pay off its creditors. As a result, Solana's price dipped below $10 by the end of 2022.\n\nYet Solana bounced back, reaching $163; your original $10,000 investment would still be worth $1.72 million. It was tough for investors to stick with Solana through those wild swings, but it's now the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $71 billion. Could it keep growing and turn a fresh $10,000 investment to $1 million again?\n\nWhat's next for Solana?\n\nSolana's powerful recovery suggests it will remain a formidable rival for Ethereum as a platform for the development of decentralized apps and tokens. Its network has already been used to produce a wide range of meme coins, including notable ones like BONK (BONK 5.68%) and WIF (WIF 2.21%), as well as decentralized exchanges like Jupiter and Orca. The expansion of that ecosystem could make it a fertile environment for more crypto projects.\n\nNew decentralized wallets and financial apps could also help Solana (and Ethereum) disrupt traditional financial institutions. The introduction of Solana Pay, which was integrated into Shopify last year, marked a major step in that direction. Visa also started to run its stablecoin settlement program on Solana, while Circle recently added native Solana support for its EURC stablecoin.\n\nSolana Labs' subsidiary, Solana Mobile, even launched its own Saga smartphone last December. The Android device is still a niche gadget, but it targets Web3 enthusiasts with its integrated digital asset management and Solana blockchain tools.\n\nSolana's rapid expansion is impressive, but Ethereum is scrambling to match Solana's speed and scalability with its own network upgrades. In a recent essay, Ethereum's co-founder and chief architect, Vitalik Buterin, proposed the introduction of \"multidimensional gas fees\" which sound similar to Solana's variable project-by-project user fees across its \"local fee markets.\" If Ethereum closes that gap, it could throttle the long-term growth of Solana's blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow much higher can Solana soar?\n\nSolana seems to have overcome its initial growing pains. It resolved the congestion issues caused by the market's feverish interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021, survived FTX's large liquidations, and still processes transactions faster than Ethereum. Developers are still launching new apps on Solana and promoting their new tokens with airdrops.\n\nHowever, it's tough to tell how much larger Solana's blockchain can grow as long as it's overshadowed by Ethereum's larger network. For now, CoinPedia estimates that Solana's price could hit $500 by the end of the year and $1,672 by 2030.\n\nYou should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they imply that Solana will remain one of the world's top cryptocurrencies as it attracts more developers and becomes more widely adopted for mainstream payments. But even if Solana's price hits $1,672 by 2030, it would only turn a new $10,000 investment into about $100,000.\n\nTherefore, Solana might still have a lot of upside potential -- but it probably won't make you a millionaire by the end of the decade. It could also easily be cut in half before it generates bigger gains, so investors should brace for a lot of volatility."

        "content": "ETH was up by more than 6% over the last seven days.\n\nA few of the metrics suggested that the bullish momentum might not last.\n\nEthereum [ETH] caught investors off guard as its price gained bullish momentum on the 17th of May.\n\nWhile the token\u2019s price moved up, it broke above a bullish pattern that could allow the king of altcoins to touch $4k in the coming days or weeks.\n\nEthereum eyes $4k again\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH investors enjoyed profits last week, as the token\u2019s price had surged by more than 6%.\n\nThings heated up in the last few hours as ETH\u2019s value increased by over 2.6% over the last day. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion.\n\nThe bullish price action had a positive impact on the token\u2019s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week.\n\nIts Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market.\n\nThanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k.\n\nWorld Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern.\n\nThe pattern appeared on ETH\u2019s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it.\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again.\n\nWhat to expect in the short term?\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days\u2019 average, signifying less selling pressure.\n\nAnother positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital\u2019s data. We found that ETH\u2019s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone.\n\nA successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k.

        "title": "BlockDAG's Enhanced Dashboard and Strategic Roadmap Drive $28.3M in Presale, Outshining Ethereum and Polkadot - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "As Ethereum and Polkadot face market struggles, BlockDAG is currently a standout in cryptocurrency, thanks to its cutting-edge dashboard features and articulated roadmap. This approach has successfully captivated investors, culminating in a substantial $28.3 million in presale.\n\nThe platform\u2019s innovative dashboard, which includes features like current rankings and a leaderboard, provides critical insights and encourages competitive interaction among users. In contrast, Ethereum faces uncertain price predictions, and Polkadot continues to develop its smart contract capabilities. These elements position BlockDAG as a premier Layer 1 cryptocurrency with significant return potential.\n\nEthereum Faces Price Instability Amid Market Trends\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $2,904, marking a slight decline over the past day. Ethereum remains trapped within a bearish pattern despite some bullish attempts, potentially indicating further drops. From a recent high of $4,000 in March, Ethereum has fallen by 31%, with the price stabilizing around $2,870\u2014a critical support level now contested by bulls and bears.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum remains uncertain as both the 50-day exponential moving average and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appear to lean toward a bearish sentiment. A break below $2,870 could depress prices to $2,800 or even $2,200, making it crucial for investors to watch these levels closely.\n\nPolkadot Advances with New Smart Contracts\n\nPolkadot is enhancing its blockchain framework by integrating smart contracts through the ink! language, which facilitates the creation of robust, DOT-compatible applications. This move is set to tackle one of Polkadot\u2019s significant limitations and drive its platform forward. With the Pop Network\u2019s solution already operational on the Paseo testnet, Polkadot is preparing for its next development phase, including features to improve network efficiency and scalability.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Dashboard and Roadmap Accelerate Market Impact\n\nBlockDAG's updated dashboard provides many features that enhance user interaction and offer valuable insights. Users can view their current ranking and the necessary purchases to advance, fostering a competitive spirit through a leaderboard that showcases top investors. Additional tools like transaction previews, referral tracking, and detailed personal profiles simplify investment tracking and enhance user engagement.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG's ambitious roadmap is meticulously laid out in four distinct phases: initial development, expansion through strategic partnerships, the launch sequence, and finally, the closing of the presale leading to the mainnet launch. A key highlight of this roadmap is the X1 Miner app, designed to be user-friendly with functionalities such as a wallet, send/receive options, and a performance leaderboard. The app is geared towards easing the mining process and enhancing community involvement with dedicated sections for user interaction and streamlined onboarding.\n\nThese enhancements to the dashboard and roadmap have greatly appealed to investors, propelling the presale quickly through its phases. In Batch 13, priced at $0.008, the presale has successfully raised $28.3 million, demonstrating strong investor trust and the potential for significant returns.\n\nBlockDAG Sets a High Standard in the Crypto Market\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles with price volatility and Polkadot develops its smart contract infrastructure, BlockDAG is making significant strides with its innovative dashboard and comprehensive roadmap. These developments not only boost user engagement but also enhance BlockDAG's investment appeal, positioning it above established players like Ethereum and Polkadot. With a robust $28.3 million presale and over 9.2 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG offers a promising investment opportunity in the blockchain space, poised for substantial future growth.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Now!\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"
