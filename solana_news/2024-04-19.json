        "content": "Ethereum whale jumps on \u2018buy the dip\u2019 opportunity after Israel's attack on Iran.\n\nThe buyback yield of Ethereum exceeds that of major S&P 500 firms.\n\nEthereum may continue trading inside key range as investors await the market's response to Bitcoin halving.\n\nEthereum resumed its sideways movement on Friday after briefly crashing due to Israel's attack on Iran. The move presented a buying opportunity for a whale, who quickly profited from it. This also comes when Ethereum's buyback yield exceeds that of several S&P 500 firms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nDaily digest market movers: Israel's retaliation, whale activity, buyback yields, Hong Kong's ETH ETF\n\nEthereum wasn't left out, as the entire crypto market took a hit on Friday following Israel's strike in retaliation to Iran's attack on April 13. Here are your key market movers:\n\nAs ETH dipped briefly on Friday, a whale jumped on the opportunity, spending 9.5 million USDT to buy 3,253 ETH at ~$ $2,925, according to crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain. However, ETH's price has quickly recovered, especially as Iranian officials have downplayed responding to the attack. As a result, the whale made nearly $625,000 in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nEthereum is outshining major tech and financial giants in terms of buyback yields, according to Token Terminal. In a list of $200 billion+ finance and tech S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway, Ethereum ranks number 16, above Tesla and JPMorgan with a buyback yield of 0.23%.\n\n\n\nBuyback for Ethereum, in this case, is implemented through token burns that began after The Merge in 2022. The number one smart contract blockchain achieved this feat in only nine years compared to the median age of 44 years of other companies in the list.\n\nETH buyback yield\n\nAlso read: Ethereum moves sideways as Q1 report indicates token burns are making it deflationary\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed doubts that Mainland China investors may not get access to Hong Kong's spot ETH ETFs when they start trading. This pessimism is based on China's ban on all crypto-related activities in 2021. However, other analysts have pointed to Hong Kong's positive reception to crypto investment as a good sign that spot ETH ETFs would see impressive inflows when they launch in the region.\n\n\n\nDespite ETH's brief price decline, ETH's long liquidations weren't heavy, sitting around $34.4 million in the past 24 hours. This may be due to heavy liquidations already seen earlier in the week.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue trading inside key range\n\nETH attempted to break the $2,852 support on Friday after Israel attacked Iran. However, prices have quickly bounced back, and ETH appears to be continuing its consolidation. The calm may be due to investors exercising caution as they await how the market responds to Bitcoin's fourth halving, which is a few hours away.\n\nRead more: Ethereum declines as crypto market crash increases bearish sentiment\n\nConsidering that many analysts have predicted that Bitcoin halving is already priced in, ETH may experience light volatility in the next few hours.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nBut in the coming weeks, it won't go outside the range of $2,852 and $3,406 formed in recent price movements, except if major external factors prevail on its price. In the long term, ETH could test the resistance of $3,730. An unlikely approval of spot ETH ETFs by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would send it past the $4,000 key level to a new all-time high."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bitcoin roller coaster has taken another dive, breaking below the $60,000 mark and unsettling the market. This recent dip sees the cryptocurrency dipping its toes into the $58,000 territory, the least-expected move by the market. The fall through what many considered a solid support level at $60,000 is causing some panic.\n\nThis unsettling movement could have been seen as a dark cloud, but there is a silver lining that has the crypto faithful watching the calendar: the Bitcoin halving. Slated for around April 20, this event is historically known for shaking up the market in unexpected ways. The halving could tighten supply and potentially swing the pendulum back in favor of higher prices.\n\n\n\nLooking at the charts with a magnifying glass, we can see that Bitcoin's next support test lies at $58,572, just a stone's throw from where it is currently. If it fails to hold this line, the descent might continue toward the $50,319 area, where the next safety net lies.\n\nBut let's not write off Bitcoin just yet. If it can rally back and crack through the $60,000 ceiling again, it might just push back to its recent comfort zone. The first sign of recovery will be reclaiming ground above this critical level, with eyes then set on the $68,789 marker \u2014 a formidable resistance that could block the path to its previous highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's farewell\n\nEthereum's slide below $3,000 is more than just a number \u2014 it is a signal. It tells us that the confidence that was pushing prices up is shaky. The drop has been steep enough to make even the staunchest supporters a bit nervous about what's coming next.\n\nWe have spotted some levels that could tell us where things might head. Right now, Ethereum is testing the waters below the $3,000 line. If it does not climb back up soon, the next floor might be around the $2,800 mark, a point that could offer some resistance to the fall. On the chance that Ethereum finds its feet again, watch out for the $3,200 ceiling \u2014 it is the next battle to win for recovery hopes.\n\nThere is a real chance that ETH could keep dropping, especially if it does not get back above $3,000 quickly. But with the halving in play, it is too early to count it out. A surge of inflows to the market might change the situation in favor of bulls quicker than anticipated.\n\nSolana remains suppressed\n\nSolana, the cryptocurrency that has been on many investors' watchlists, is showing signs of strain. After a period of growth, SOL has slipped through what was a strong support level at around $130, and now folks are worried. If prices keep heading south and pass below the $100 mark, it could spell real trouble.\n\nKey indicators that many traders look to for signs of healing, like RSI and moving averages, have been breached. Currently, Solana struggles to find a proper footing for the price.\n\nThe situation looks tense. With the support at $130 now a thing of the past, the next checkpoint is at $100.\n\nYet, not all hope is lost. There is still a chance for a turnaround. Growth could be around the corner if Solana manages to rally and break through resistance levels, particularly around $150, which could act as a ladder to climb back up from its current position.\n\nThe future of Solana is not set in stone. If it finds strength and pushes above these resistance levels, it might just regain its previous momentum. But if it continues to fall, the drop below $100 could be a hard reality check for the coin and its investors."

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Crashes to Three-Month Low, ETH Price Recovers to $3,100 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Earlier today, amid news of the escalating geopolitical tensions and the Israel-Iran conflict, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market faced severe selling pressure. However, this dip once again met with a strong buying interest from investors. With the Ethereum price dropping to $2,877 earlier today, bulls are staging a strong recovery once again to $3,100.\n\nEthereum Gas Fee Drops to 3-Month Low\n\nRecent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals a notable decrease in transaction costs on the Ethereum network. The cost of conducting a transaction on Ethereum has plummeted to $2.07, marking a significant reduction from the $15.21 recorded on March 4th during a period of heightened demand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts at Santiment suggest that transaction fees on the Ethereum network often reflect prevailing sentiments within the cryptocurrency market. During periods of extreme bullishness, characterized by the belief that crypto assets are poised for significant price increases (\u201cTo the Moon\u201d), transaction fees tend to peak. Conversely, during phases of pessimism when sentiments lean towards the belief that cryptocurrency markets are in decline (\u201cCrypto is Dead\u201d), transaction fees typically revert to lower levels.\n\nThis pattern of transaction fees mirroring market sentiment underscores the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets. Peaks in transaction fees often coincide with price tops for Ethereum, while periods of low transaction costs are observed around price bottoms.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Layer-1 competitors like Solana have witnessed a huge surge in DeFi activity along with the recent meme coin frenzy. This competition has also led to network decongestion on Ethereum thereby keeping the gas fee on the lower side.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum made another attempt at recovery but encountered resistance near the $3,100 mark, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s struggles. Despite stabilizing above $3,000 initially, a bearish sentiment prevailed, pushing the price below this support level to briefly dip below $2,900. The bottom was established at $2,867 before a rebound ensued.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is in the process of recovering from its losses, having surpassed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement from $3,278 to $2,867. However, it continues to trade below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nThe immediate hurdle for Ethereum lies near the $3,020 level, followed by a significant resistance zone around $3,070, coinciding with both the 100-hourly SMA and a key bearish trend line forming on the hourly ETH/USD chart. Further resistance is anticipated around $3,120, aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A successful breach above $3,120 could pave the way for a potential upswing towards the $3,200 mark.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "The Ethereum bull run continues to captivate investors, reinforcing its status with a staggering market capitalisation of approximately $435 billion.

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Uncertain Rally, Ethereum (ETH) Dips Amid Whale Moves, Furrever Token (FURR) Offers Up to 15X Returns - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape constantly evolves, investors and market observers are closely monitoring several key developments that could shape the sector's future. Among these are Bitcoin's upcoming halving event, Ethereum's current price fluctuations due to significant whale activity, and the rise of new players like Furrever Token (FURR), which seeks to carve out a niche with its unique approach and potential high returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Cautions Against Expecting a Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving Event\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community braces for this year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, scheduled around April 19-20, JPMorgan has issued a less than optimistic forecast. Contrary to the significant price surges that followed previous halvings, the banking giant predicts that Bitcoin might not only fail to rally but could potentially see a decline in value.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin halvings have been pivotal moments that typically led to bullish market behavior. The process involves halving the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This mechanism serves as a counter to inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, such events have boosted the cryptocurrency's market price significantly within a year of occurrence. For instance, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin's price increased from $12 to $135 over the next 300 days.\n\nHowever, this year's scenario presents a unique backdrop. According to JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, the current market conditions are \"overbought\". Bitcoin's price, hovering around $61,200, is well above the $45,000 mark when adjusted for volatility in comparison with gold. This elevated baseline, combined with the peak price reached a month before the halving\u2014a first in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2014suggests a different outcome might be unfolding this time around.\n\nAdding to the cautious outlook, Goldman Sachs has also advised prudence. The firm highlighted the unpredictable macroeconomic factors currently at play, which could influence Bitcoin's performance differently compared to past cycles. Despite previous patterns of price appreciation post-halving, Goldman Sachs warns against assuming similar outcomes this year, given the distinct global economic conditions.\n\nThis tempered expectation marks a significant shift in sentiment among financial giants regarding the crypto market's behavior following the halving. As the event nears, the cryptocurrency community and investors are keeping a watchful eye, prepared for a range of possibilities that diverge from the historical norm.\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Continues as ICO Whale Offloads Significant ETH Holdings\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently experiencing heightened volatility, underscored by a recent 4% drop in price amid broader crypto market fluctuations. This latest dip has triggered a wave of speculation about the future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKey to the current market unrest is the activity of an ICO whale who has significantly reduced their holdings, selling off 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at a rate of $2,997 each. This move comes after additional transactions where the same whale offloaded 5,110 ETH on various platforms, with the price per ETH approximately at $2,545. Despite this large-scale sell-off, the whale still possesses about 29,700 ETH, which currently values approximately $89.4 million, held primarily across staking platforms.\n\nAdding to the market\u2019s unease, Whale Alert has flagged more Ethereum moving towards exchanges. Notably, an unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH to Coinbase, worth roughly $32.13 million, followed by another transaction of 10,726 ETH to the same exchange, valued at around $31.90 million.\n\nThese substantial movements to a major exchange like Coinbase are raising alarms about potential further increases in Ethereum\u2019s price volatility. However, amid these concerns, some analysts maintain a cautious optimism, buoyed by positive developments such as the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which may indicate a rebound or stabilization in the market soon.\n\nMoreover, with the cryptocurrency community looking forward to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, there is anticipation that this might also spur positive movements in Ethereum's price.\n\nAs the situation develops, Ethereum's current trading price stands at $2,978.31, marking a decrease of 3.45% from the previous day, with a trading volume that has risen by 10.77% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, Ethereum's price has seen a substantial 16% decline over the past week and an 18% drop over the last month, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty and the speculative nature of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Emerges as a Strong Contender Against Established Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) is carving out a niche for itself with a current price of $0.000564 and promising features that could potentially outperform major players like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON). What sets Furrever Token apart is its unique appeal rooted in the universal love for cute kitties, aiming to create a delightful and engaging experience for its users.\n\nThe charm of Furrever Token extends beyond its cat-themed aesthetics, encompassing a range of stickers, emojis, and visuals that enhance the user interface. This strategy not only enriches the community experience but also strengthens the bond among its members, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nOperating on the BNB-20 blockchain, the Furrever Token is designed with favorable tokenomics. About 65% of its tokens were made available during the presale, with the remainder distributed between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the development team. This distribution strategy promotes fairness and ensures the longevity and stability of the project.\n\nFinancially, Furrever Token is not just about the novelty; it offers significant return potential, boasting up to 15X returns which highlights its attractiveness as an investment. To secure its platform and user investments, the token has undergone rigorous audits, emphasizing its commitment to security and compliance.\n\nThe project\u2019s dedication is further evidenced by its active community engagement and transparent communication, critical factors that contribute to its growing legitimacy and appeal as an investment.\n\nAs Furrever Token continues to evolve and attract attention in the crypto market, its innovative integration of fun elements with serious financial prospects positions it as a formidable alternative to well-established cryptocurrencies like Solana and Toncoin. With strong community support and distinctive features, Furrever Token is poised to make a significant impact on the future landscape of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Consequently, a bullish rebound is anticipated in the medium term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart reveals an extended period of corrective retracements, culminating in the price finding support within a pivotal zone.\n\nThis zone encompasses the 100-day moving average at $3050 and the significant price range between the 0.5 ($3190) and 0.618 ($2972) Fibonacci levels.\n\nThis range carries significance as it attracts considerable demand, potentially hindering further downward pressure from market sellers. Additionally, a minor bullish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a bullish resurgence, targeting a reclaim of the $3.5K threshold. However, despite the bullish indications, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect toward the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer inspection of the 4-hour chart reveals the formation of a descending wedge pattern during a multi-month consolidation correction. Following a significant decline, the price has reached the lower boundary of the wedge and the support region around $3K.\n\nNonetheless, given the potential buying pressure within this crucial range, the price has entered a consolidation phase characterized by minimal volatility.\n\nThis price action highlights a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the 4-hour timeframe suggests the strength of buyers, increasing the likelihood of a bullish upswing in the medium term. In such a scenario, the next target for the price would be the critical resistance level at $3.5K. Conversely, should a break below this support occur, a descent toward the $2.7K support becomes increasingly probable.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price exhibits signs of recovery, it\u2019s crucial to determine whether this resurgence stems from spot buying or leveraged futures activity. A key metric for this analysis is the funding rates, where positive values signify bullish sentiment and negative values indicate fear in the market.\n\nObserving the recent downtrend in Ethereum\u2019s price, it\u2019s notable that the funding rate metric has mirrored this trajectory, steadily declining until reaching near-zero levels. This alignment suggests that the recent price drop has led to the liquidation of a significant number of positions in the perpetual market, resulting in a cooling effect on the futures market. Consequently, the market appears primed for the re-emergence of long positions, with the potential for a fresh upward surge."

If XRP bulls are able to haul above 50, it could kick off a strong move north, sending Ripple price above the $0.5783.\n\nA decisive candlestick close above this level on the three-day timeframe would encourage more buy orders. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, bulls should watch for a candlestick close above $0.7630, the mean threshold of the supply zone between $0.7277 and $0.7959.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears pull XRP price below the ascending trendline, it could encourage a sell off to send the Ripple price to the $0.4183 support.

        "content": "Ernst & Young (EY) has launched OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), an Ethereum solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs technology.\n\nThe solution will help private businesses efficiently manage and execute intricate business agreements while ensuring confidentiality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nEY Launches the OpsChain Contract Manager\n\nEY, one of the top \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms alongside Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC, has been exploring the business applications of zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) since at least 2018.\n\nOpsChain Contract Manager (OCM) is tailored to facilitate the secure management of business contracts on a public blockchain. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, OCM ensures contract integrity and confidentiality while enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform integrates with existing enterprise systems through a standardized API and supports various contract types, including volume purchase agreements and pricing models linked to market data feeds.\n\nThe development of OCM came from EY\u2019s previous client engagements, where it realized that contract term accuracy could be enhanced while significantly reducing cycle times and administrative costs by approximately 90% and 40%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, EY chose Ethereum, a public blockchain, over a private network to prevent any party from gaining undue advantage while mitigating the risk of sensitive business information leakage.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, highlighted that the technology behind OCM, Nightfall, initially emerged on Ethereum and underwent testing on its test network. The upcoming update will transition Nightfall to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and may incorporate a Layer-3 upgrade to enhance scalability and functionality.\n\nEY\u2019s Venture Into Blockchain\n\nEY\u2019s launch of OpsChain Contract Manager comes amid increasing blockchain adoption by major financial players. BlackRock also recently entered the space with a tokenized fund on Ethereum.\n\nEY\u2019s OCM reflects its commitment to revolutionizing how enterprises handle contracts, focusing on enhancing process efficiency and transparency through blockchain solutions. By integrating blockchain into traditional business practices, EY sets a precedent for the industry\u2019s progression toward embracing this transformative technology in routine operations.\n\nThis latest development builds upon EY\u2019s ongoing engagement with the blockchain sector. EY recently made headlines with a \u201chealthcare breakthrough\u201d by leveraging blockchain technology in collaboration with Canadian Blood Services.\n\nIn October 2023, EY unveiled the fourth generation of its EY blockchain analytics tool, Reconciler, designed to aid Fidelity in enhancing internal risk management for digital assets.\n\nIn September 2021, EY also announced its collaboration with Polygon to integrate Polygon\u2019s solutions with EY\u2019s flagship blockchain services, including EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer."

Chainwire \u00b7 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more \u203a\n\nDubai, United Arab Emirates, April 19th, 2024, Chainwire \u2013 The Telos Foundation today announced that it will work with Ponos Technology, the leading Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) research and development firm, to develop an end-to-end optimized, hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network featuring SNARKtor, the Telos-developed decentralized recursive proof aggregator. The teams will take a hardware-software co-design approach that will help unlock new possibilities in terms of massive scalability, greater data protection and trustless interoperability for Ethereum users globally.\n\nPonos Technology provides end-to-end optimized solutions for ZK proving, which is essentially achieved by leveraging FPGA acceleration, thus maximizing business value streams through cost-performance optimized computation by matching hardware-software co-designed modules and dedicated execution environments. The team includes a unique blend of experienced scientists and highly skilled industry experts that have accumulated deep technical knowledge on all aspects of ZKPs.\n\n\u201cZero Knowledge technology is going to become increasingly mainstream and can open the door to increased efficiency and security across so many industries,\u201d said Slobodan Lukovic, CEO and co-founder, Ponos Technology. \u201cSimilarly to AI, steady enhancements in algorithms coupled with advancements in underlying hardware infrastructures will enable commoditization of ZKPs and result in the technology being widely adopted in the near future.\u201d\n\nTelos will also be working with several other new partners during the development cycle, including:\n\nDigital M.O.B. \u2013 One of the strongest Ethereum developer teams in the world, having worked on projects including MetaMask, MakerDAO and Gnosis, among others.\n\nATKA \u2013 A Paris-based end-to-end Web3 incubator that has helped incubate world class projects such as Morpho and Mangrove, and whom Telos announced a strategic partnership with in March 2024.\n\nCometh \u2013 An award-winning dev team led by ETH France President Jerome de Tychey, who joined Telos as a technical EVM advisor also in March 2024.\n\nTelos Executive Director John Lilic, who helped lead pioneering teams at Consensys and Polygon in addition to maintaining his role as a Top 50 Web3 angel investor, will help coordinate and support the transformation. He will work closely with Alberto Garoffolo, Head of ZK technology at Telos and co-author of the SNARKtor whitepaper, and Jesse Schulman, CTO and Head of Engineering at Telos.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, Ethereum will need to take a hardware-software co-design approach in order to realize zkEVM performance at tremendous scale,\u201d said Lilic. \u201cThat\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking with Ponos Technology and our growing partner network as we build a hardware-accelerated zkEVM L2. We believe that this formula, alongside the exciting work our team is doing with recursive proofs via SNARKtor, is going to offer compelling services to the Ethereum community and beyond.\u201d\n\nTelos was created in 2018 through a fair drop network launch that did not include an ICO nor token sale. Over the past six years, the Telos Foundation has helped steward the development of two primary networks \u2013 Telos EVM and Telos Zero \u2013 and will now also focus on building a highly performant and succinctly provable L2 zkEVM.\n\nAdditional details on the Telos L2 will continue to be announced in the lead up to EthCC in July, for which Telos is a primary sponsor. Live in Brussels from EthCC, the Telos team plans to broadcast its first-ever demo of SNARKtor to the world as a precursor to the official launch of the Telos L2.\n\nAbout Telos\n\nTelos is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that includes Telos EVM, which tested as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine globally, and its high-speed consensus layer, Telos Zero. The project is also focused on expanding its capabilities with novel Zero Knowledge technology through the development of a hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network powered by SNARKtor, which promises to enhance privacy and scalability for global use cases. Telos is overseen by The Telos Foundation, an ownerless foundation dedicated to advancing the Telos blockchain network and its community.\n\nContact\n\nThe Telos Foundation\n\n[email protected]\n\nShare"

        "content": "Ethereum could fall under the $3k psychological support zone soon\n\nMetrics flashed a strong buy signal, but there\u2019s more that investors need to consider\n\nLately, Ethereum [ETH] has seen bearish sentiments strengthen behind it. In fact, a Santiment post on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that both Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum saw a hike in bear posting ahead of the halving.\n\nNegative engagement on social media saw a positive change on 18 April when BTC bounced to $64.1k and ETH to $3,094. AMBCrypto analyzed other metrics to understand if investors should be buying ETH now.\n\nDrop in gas fee could be a disguised threat\n\nAMBCrypto noted that the Open Interest behind Ethereum has slid dramatically over the last ten days. It fell from a peak of $7 billion on 9 April (Ethereum priced at $3638) to $4.6 billion, at press time (Ethereum priced at $2997).\n\nThe sharp decline in OI meant speculators feared going long and lacked bullish conviction. It conveyed bearish sentiment. The 1-day RSI was also below neutral 50 for the most part since 18 March. This implied that momentum has favoured the sellers for a month now.\n\nThe average fees on the network have also been in decline. A recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that although it is a positive for users, it also points to a drop in demand for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nAddressing the buying opportunity\n\nThe $3k psychological support zone would have been a fantastic buying opportunity a month ago. It still might prove to be. The 90-day MVRV ratio was below zero at press time, showing an undervalued asset and holders at a loss.\n\nHowever, the mean coin age has adamantly trended higher for three weeks. Together, they signalled investors to buy Ethereum.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAnd yet, the dormant circulation saw a massive spike on 18 April. This highlighted a flurry of token movements and could foreshadow a wave of selling. Moreover, Bitcoin was barely hanging on to the $61k support zone at the time of writing.\n\nPatience and prudence could be extremely beneficial for investors. The likelihood of another sell-off is still high. The possibility of another month or two of consolidation following the halving, in light of recent overheated market conditions, is high too."

Some community members like Ryan Adams of Bankless actually think that the target should have been reached by now.\n\nReferencing ETH\u2019s massive revenues, Adams recently claimed,\n\n\u201cNo, Ethereum isn\u2019t like the other chains. Ethereum is profitable. Over the past 18 months, Ethereum generated almost $1 billion in earnings.\u201d\n\nAdams added,\n\n\u201cEthereum is only 9 years old. ETH should be over $10k based on this alone.\u201d\n\nApart from higher revenue, TVL (Total Value Locked), and overall market cap, Solana dwarfs Ethereum on several fronts, as evidenced by a previous AMBCrypto report.\n\nHowever, the price chart performance is the most crucial for HODLers. A possible ETH move to $10k from $3.1k means a potential 3x upswing. Even if you take the wildest estimates, ETH\u2019s 3x would be way lower than SOL\u2019s 7x potential.\n\nIn other words, SOL might have higher potential for gains if the bull cycle explodes. That being said, ETH could play catch-up if the United States finally approves Spot Ethereum ETFs."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Update: BTC Halving Changes Altcoins Outlook, Ethereum, Solana On The Move - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bitcoin price update: After taking investors on a rollercoaster for the last two weeks, the crypto market started to move up on Friday, hours before Bitcoin halving. Investors who had been anxiously waiting for the green light rallied behind BTC price and also the altcoins, most of which are witnessing modest gains.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network, is up 1.6% in the last 24 hours and trading at $3,105. Similarly, Solana moved in tandem with the rest of the market, with its value rising by 6.5% to $145.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana plummeted to $120 last weekend as geopolitical tensions ravaged through the market, leaving behind liquidations in billions of dollars and investors counting losses.\n\nThe cumulative market cap has gone up by a staggering 5.4% to $2.47 trillion in just a day, underscoring the bullish outlook in the wider market. Select altcoins moved in double-digits like Toncoin\u2019s 17% surge to $7.20 and Internet Computer\u2019s 11% increase to $13.\n\nBitcoin price Update: Is The BTC\u2019s Sudden Move Topping $65,000 Sustainable?\n\nAs Bitcoin halving approaches, the buzz in the market catches momentum, encouraging investors to bet on further movement toward the $70,000. From a 24-hour low of $59,651, Bitcoin price sits above $65,000 toward the end of the European session on Friday.\n\nA sizeable 15% bump in the volume upholds the improving sentiment and rising interest among traders. Another 5% surge in the market cap to $1.28 solidifies BTC\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBased on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the four-hour chart, the ongoing movement seeking higher support above $65,000 could be sustainable in the short term, especially if the hype around the halving continues.\n\nMeanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is in line to prevent BTC from correcting significantly below $65,000. However, it is wise to prepare for a short-lived sweep for fresh liquidity at the black ascending trend line.\n\nA daily close above $65,000 would signal another confirmation of the uptrend eyeing $70,000 post-halving. The red band on the chart represents potential selling pressure and may delay the rally.\n\nBitcoin ETF Net Outflow Volume Shrinks\n\nRising net outflows in the Bitcoin ETF have been putting pressure on the price and the market, adding to the uncertainty due to the tensions in West Asia. Iran for the first time in history directly attacked Israel, sending over 300 ballistic missiles in its airspace.\n\nIf the war in West Asia escalates due to Israel\u2019s potential retaliation to Iran\u2019s attack, the global risk asset markets including crypto could suffer even more.\n\nHowever, SoSoValue shows that the total daily net outflow volume in the ETF market declined to only $4.39 million on Thursday. Grayscale is still posting the highest outflow volumes, with $89.99 million withdrawn from GBTC ETF on April 18.\n\nThere has also been a shift in the best-performing ETFs, with Fidelity leading the net inflow with $37 million and BlackRock coming second with $18.76 million.\n\nThe Bitcoin price rally in Q1 to a new ATH of $73,737 as seen on CoinGecko was mainly fuelled by growing demand for the ETF.\n\nExperts say that demand for the ETF coupled with the impact of Bitcoin halving on the supply of the scarce digital asset would be the ingredients like to make the next bull run. Bitcoin price is expected to peak above $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "In comparison to Ethereum and Base, where the average transaction values are $1,867 and $170, respectively, Degen Chain sees a notably lower average transaction value of $0.27.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Degen Chain, a recent addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, has achieved the highest transaction per second (TPS) rate among Ethereum layer-3 networks.\n\nOn the last day, Degen\u2019s transaction per second (TPS) count surged by over 68% to reach 37.12 TPS, surpassing its underlying blockchain, Base, which stood at 30.81 TPS, as reported by L2BEAT\n\nArbitrum One, Ethereum, and zkSync Era completed the top five rankings.\n\nWith Degen\u2019s 35.7 TPS multiplied by 86,400 seconds in a day, the memecoin chain handled a total of 3.08 million transactions during that period.\n\nDespite its high transaction throughput, Degen Chain recorded only $846,191 in trading volume over the last day, ranking it 41st out of 66 blockchains tracked by CoinGecko.\n\nDespite its widespread use in measuring a blockchain\u2019s scalability limits, transactions per second (TPS) is considered by many industry leaders as a flawed metric.\n\nThis is because TPS fails to account for the computational size of each transaction, which can vary significantly and impact the network\u2019s overall performance. This oversight suggests that TPS alone may not fully represent a blockchain\u2019s capacity or efficiency.\n\nThe Degen (DEGEN) token, which was initially conceived as a tipping token for users engaging with Degen\u2019s channel on the Farcaster platform, has evolved beyond its original purpose.\n\nIt now serves as the primary currency of a memecoin that has transitioned into its own blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, Degen Chain currently holds $4.1 million in total value locked, while the DEGEN token, which is only three months old, commands a market capitalization of $326 million.\n\nDegen Chain, regarded as an ultra-low-cost, application-specific layer 3 blockchain, was constructed using Arbitrum Orbit and utilizes Base\u2019s settlement layer, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nRead also: Sora Ventures & Metaplanet partner for \u2018Asia\u2019s Microstrategy\u2019"

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle to meet investor expectations with lackluster performances, all eyes turn to Furrever Token (FURR) and its promise of substantial returns. With disappointment looming over the performance of ETH and SHIB, investors seek solace in FURR\u2019s potential for huge ROI opportunities.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market experiences turbulence, fueled by uncertainties surrounding major tokens, Furrever Token emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a unique and charming investment proposition. Will FURR\u2019s irresistible blend of cuteness and profitability be enough to appease disappointed investors and steer them towards brighter horizons?\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Uphill Battle Amid Market Turmoil: Will it Rebound or Continue its Descent?\n\nAmidst market turmoil, Ethereum (ETH) struggles with its price of around $3,051.89, down 1% from yesterday. A recent flash crash, prompted by Middle East tensions, caused ETH to plummet over 16%, raising fears of further decline. The breach of crucial support at $3,000 exacerbates ETH\u2019s vulnerability. Diminished hopes for a spot Ether ETF in the U.S. and declining sentiment compound Ethereum\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped from 76 to 57, signaling a shift from \u201cextreme greed\u201d to \u201cgreed\u201d among traders. This reflects heightened fears of continued market downturns, prompting investors to sell. Ethereum\u2019s dip below $3,000, a critical level, emphasizes its struggle to regain support.\n\nIntoTheBlock data reveals resistance around $3,000, where 1.98 million addresses previously held ETH. Any upward movement faces strong selling pressure from investors aiming to break even. Key support levels include $2,800 and the 200-day EMA at $2,710.\n\nThe downward indicator confirms the MACD trend, suggesting favorable conditions for further declines. However, reclaiming $3,000 could trigger bullish sentiment, aiming for levels above $3,300. Beyond, $3,500 becomes a target for bullish investors seeking a reversal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Critical Crossroads: What Will the Future Bring?\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently navigating through a significant correction phase, with its price hovering around $0.00002237, up by 2% since yesterday. However, investors remain dissatisfied with SHIB\u2019s lackluster performance, which has endured nearly a 20% decline since last week.\n\nDespite this, recent price movements suggest a potential for recovery as SHIB encounters a critical golden ratio support level. Reflecting a trend in many meme tokens, Shiba Inu\u2019s price has surged to a key support level of around $0.00002 after a notable correction.\n\nPreviously rejected near the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance point at approximately $0.000037, the meme token now faces a possibility of an upward trend from the golden ratio support towards the significant resistance barrier at around $0.00002464, marked by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n\nWhile indicators present a mixed outlook, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in neutral territory and moving averages displaying a bullish crossover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines suggest a downward trend, albeit with rising momentum shown by the MACD histogram.\n\nAmidst these contradictory signals, SHIB could encounter significant Fibonacci resistances at $0.0000287 and $0.000035 if it experiences an upward trend. However, a breach below the golden ratio support around $0.00002 could find substantial support near the 50-week EMA at an estimated $0.00001426.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Offers You a Huge Opportunity with Its Amazing ROI\n\nCalling all SHIB and ETH investors!

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price is struggling to sustain above the crucial support at $3000 as the bulls and bears are competing for dominance\n\nWith this, the possibility of a bullish breakout emerges as the price sticks within the range, aiming to achieve higher targets\n\nThe Ethereum price is trading within a deep bearish trend after facing a rejection above $4000, registering daily, weekly, and even monthly losses. The daily RSI also dropped with a plunge in the price and has cemented below the average since then. This indicated an extended consolidation phase as the bulls and bears failed to utilize their strength. With an extended consolidation, the ETH price appears to be close to a breakout as the trend remains largely stagnant.\n\nAs mentioned above, the price continues to trade within a range after experiencing a shot time upswing to the resistance, which further coincided with the resistance area. Further, the price made a minor correction and soon backed up to the resistance area but later declined to the bottom part of the rally. However, the decline appears to be a bearish trap, as the trend could flip in a short while, causing a significant rise in the price, probably above $3300.\n\nAs seen, the price continues to trade within a descending triangle, but the recent accumulation within a narrow range suggests a diverse trend could be in the making. Therefore, it has now become extremely crucial for the token to break the consolidation as the bulls remain short of strength to lift the levels beyond the resistance. But the recent bounce up close to the resistance line has raised hopes for a breakout in the coming days.\n\nAlso Check Out : Will Ethereum-Based Tokens Rebound As Top Altcoins Stumble Again?\n\nIt appears pretty evident that the price may soar beyond resistance as the volume has dropped to a large extent. Hence, after an extended compression, the price is expected to trigger a rebound. Moreover, following the pattern, the price is required to trigger a pullback below the support, but the accumulation along the resistance, flashes bullish signals for crypto. Therefore, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to maintain a sideways trend for some more time, which could result in a bearish pullback, followed by a bullish rebound beyond $3300 initially and later at $3500.\n\nRead More : XRP Price Ready to Breakout?
