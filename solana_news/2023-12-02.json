We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

        "title": "Can Ethereum Price Recovery Surpass $3000 By Year End? - CoinGape",
        "content": "For the major period of November, the Ethereum (ETH) coin witnessed high volatility leading to a sideways trend between the $2,143 and $1,910 price levels. However, this consolidation came after a significant rally indicating the buyers could have an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum after the further rally. Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "This week, the global cryptocurrency market cap soared 5% to $1.49 trillion, marking its highest point since the Terra-induced collapse of last May. Several assets \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Celestia (TIA) \u2014 registered impressive gains.\n\nBitcoin nears $40,000\n\nBitcoin has been on a rampage since breaking out of the consolidation in early October. The premier crypto has continued to register impressive bullish closes, and this week was no different. With a 5.41% increase over the past seven days, Bitcoin is on track to record its seventh consecutive bullish week.\n\nBTC price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nThis streak of bullish closes began in mid-October when the asset changed hands at the $27,000 territory. Amid increased optimism from sustained ETF discussions, Bitcoin has extended the wins to seven straight weeks.\n\nThis week was less challenging than most, as BTC only registered two days of mild intraday declines. These declines came up on Nov. 27 (0.56%) and Nov. 30 (0.37%). Other days recorded bullish gains, but Dec. 1 stood out, as BTC surged 2.54%, marking its highest intraday gain for the week.\n\nThis Dec. 1 rally brought BTC the closest to the $39,000 territory in 17 months. The asset spiked to $38,983 but witnessed bearish resistance. BTC showed resilience, closing Dec. 1 at $38,688 to have another go at $39,000 the following day.\n\nThis second push was successful, helping Bitcoin reclaim $39,000 for the first time since the Terra implosion of last May. Bitcoin has built on this rally, changing hands at $39,489 at the reporting time, with the $40,000 price threshold its next target.\n\nYou might also like: Hong Kong, Singapore attract increasing crypto VC funding\n\nEthereum hits 17-month high\n\nBitcoin\u2019s uptrend favorably impacted Ethereum\u2019s price, as both assets maintained their close correlation this week. Ethereum started the week with mixed signals, dropping 1.71% on Nov. 27, but rising 0.99% the next day. Nov. 29 also brought another decline, with a 0.90% slide.\n\nETH price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s bullish story began on Nov. 30 despite BTC\u2019s 0.37% drop. ETH rallied 1.12% that day, extending this bullish run to the new month. The asset gained 1.72% on Dec. 1, with its largest intraday gain amounting to a 3.75% surge on Dec. 2.\n\nThe Dec. 2 rally was Ethereum\u2019s major boost this week, as the asset leveraged it to hit a 17-month high of $2,184. Despite facing a roadblock at this new yearly peak, the bulls retained their hold, keeping Ethereum above $2,100 at the close of day. Currently trading for $2,164, ETH is up 4.97% this week.\n\nCelestia clinches new ATH in 60% weekly gain\n\nCelestia was not left out in the market-wide uptrend this week. While Bitcoin and Ethereum flashed mixed signals at the start of the week, TIA went full-on bullish, surging 8.17% on Nov. 27 and 6.06% on Nov. 28. The following day was not very favorable, leading to a 3.53% decline.\n\nTIA price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, these drops did nothing to negate the ongoing uptrend. Celestia rallied by a massive 42% from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, recording three consecutive days of bullish momentum. Amid this momentum, TIA began recording new all-time highs on Dec. 2. The asset\u2019s latest ATH was $9.31 today.\n\nCelestia\u2019s massive uptrend put it among the top gainers over the past seven days. The asset is up 61% this week, securing third among the largest gainers. Celestia is facing a 0.48% drop today, but the asset has held up well above $8.5, currently changing hands at $8.81."

        "content": "The decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Goldfinch has approved plans to expand beyond Ethereum and launch its services on Base, a layer-2 blockchain created by major crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that our community has approved the deployment of the Goldfinch smart contracts on @BuildOnBase L2!\n\n\n\nThis strategic move aligns with our mission to make the power of crypto accessible to a broader audience by improving user experience and reducing gas\u2026 \u2014 Goldfinch (@goldfinch_fi) November 30, 2023\n\nGoldfinch governance members reached consensus on the proposal after extensive debate over the benefits of onboarding more users through Coinbase\u2019s large customer base versus remaining solely on Ethereum.\n\nThe Goldfinch community will next hold a soft vote and audit the code before officially activating the deployment contract to add Goldfinch to Base. This represents a major step toward lowering transaction fees and boosting adoption for the DeFi lending platform.\n\nAdditionally, Goldfinch\u2019s native GFI token surged 14% to $1.74 following news of the expansion on December 1.\n\nGFI Price | Source: Tradingview\n\nAs an Ethereum-exclusive project until now, the shift to a more affordable layer-2 network will enable greater accessibility by reducing prohibitively high gas fees on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGoldfinch co-founder Blake West and engineering manager Greg Egan were strong proponents for the move to Base, citing the blockchain\u2019s rapidly growing total value locked of over $300 million. They also referred to Coinbase\u2019s massive user base over 100 million worldwide that Base apps can leverage.\n\nAs one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges that recently went public, Coinbase\u2019s support provides credibility and a built-in customer pipeline that will accelerate DeFi adoption. Goldfinch aims to take advantage of Base as a customer acquisition channel going forward.\n\nThis latest development comes on the heels of Goldfinch marking the full repayment of its first-issued loan to crypto lender Fazz Financial in late November. The successful repayment of this genesis loan is a promising indicator for the newly expanded lending protocol."

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) his disapproval of the popular description of the Solana network as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d In his words, he doesn\u2019t \u201csee a future where Solana thrives and somehow ETH dies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly ???????? (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nSolana Lauded as an ETH Killer\n\nThe layer-1 Solana network was created to offer smart contract capabilities like the Ethereum network. However, it supersedes the Ethereum mainnet regarding speed and energy efficiency thanks to its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain implemented the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The network also processed only about 30 transactions per second, compared to Solana\u2019s record of 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nDue to its inherent features, the Solana network has been lauded as an ETH killer since its official launch in 2020. The term has also been used to describe some popular blockchains such as Cardano, Tezos, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\nSolana has also introduced toolsets to onboard developers from the Ethereum network into its ecosystem. In July, Solana Labs launched Solang, a compiler enabling developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s programming language (Solidity) to write smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.\n\nDescribing the expression as \u201clame,\u201d Yakovenko argued that even though Solana and Ethereum have similarities, the latter will not be overshadowed by the initial.\n\nSolana Ranks Among Best Performing Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmong the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s SOL emerged as the best performer. Maintaining its ranking as the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, SOL has soared by over 220% in the last three months alone. These metrics supersede crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nGoing from as low as $17.9 to as high as $65.2, market experts suggest that the cryptocurrency will likely surpass the $70 price mark as active addresses increase. Presently, SOL trades at $63.8, representing 2.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinStats"
