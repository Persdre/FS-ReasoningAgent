        "title": "What Is Polygon? \u2022 Layer-2 Ethereum Scaling - Benzinga",
        "content": "Want to invest in Polygon? eToro makes it easy to buy MATIC with a simple trading platform and low fees!\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is the largest and most vibrant of smart contracts compatible Layer 1 blockchain. However, high transaction fees on the Ethereum network have alienated investors from this product. High gas fees on the Ethereum network have led to the development of rival blockchains \u2014 such as Cardano, Solana, Avalanche \u2014 sometimes referred to as ETH killers. Although these blockchains are often faster and cheaper than Ethereum, they lack the security and the network effect of Ethereum's massive user base.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are applications created to help scale a blockchain. Examples of Layer 2 solutions are the Bitcoin Lightning network, Arbitrum and Polygon Crypto. These Layer 2 solutions process transactions off the mainnet, or Layer 1, and post them back in groups using rollups. Layer 2 solutions help increase transaction speed and reduce gas fees while still providing the security and decentralization of the mainnet. Layer 2 solutions are also often referred to as sidechains.\n\nOverview of Polygon\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon acts as a faster blockchain running concurrently alongside the Ethereum blockchain that uses multiple sidechains. These sidechains operate using the following methods to help improve scalability methods.\n\nZK-Rollups: ZK-rollups process multiple transfers off the Ethereum mainnet. These transfers are then bundled into a single transaction and posted to the mainnet. This process reduces the volume of transactions and the amount of data being processed on the Ethereum mainnet, enabling cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nPlasma chains: Plasma chains are blockchains that run alongside the Ethereum mainnet. The two blockchains can communicate with each other and allow assets to travel between them. Plasma chains have a consensus mechanism that creates blocks, and the root of each plasma chain block is published to the Ethereum mainnet. These roots are little pieces of information that can be used to prove the contents of those blocks.\n\nOptimistic rollups: Optimistic rollups are similar to ZK-rollups, except that they assume transactions are valid by default. They only run computations in the event the integrity of a transaction is challenged.\n\nThe MATIC token is Polygon\u2019s native cryptocurrency. MATIC, an ERC-20 token, is used for staking, fees and governance.\n\nWhy Do People Use Polygon?\n\nPeople use Polygon because of its fast transaction speeds and low gas fees. Gas fees on Polygon are often just a couple of cents, far lower than those charged on Ethereum. People also use Polygon because the network benefits from the strong security of the Ethereum blockchain, and it can benefit someone who wishes to be a contributor to the blockchain technology.\n\nPolygon History\n\nPolygon was launched in October 2017 as the Matic Network. Polygon was co-founded in Mumbai, India, by developers Anurag Arjun, Jaynti Kanani and Sandeep Nailwal. Kanani was a former data scientist at Housing.com before helping found Polygon and serving as the company\u2019s CEO. Nailwal was the previous chief technology officer (CTO) of Welspun Group. He also worked as a consultant at Deloitte and started another company known as ScopeWeaver. Arjun worked as a project manager at IRIS Business, SNL Financial and Dexter Consultancy. Matic was rebranded as Polygon in February 2021 to reflect its wide array of scaling solutions.\n\nWhere To Buy MATIC\n\nMATIC can be purchased from most centralized exchanges such as Voyager, Crypto.com and Binance. MATIC can also be purchased from decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and MetaMask Swap. Polygon uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. If you already own MATIC, you can earn more of it by staking and buy cryptocurrency to diversify your portfolio along with the Polygons you already hold.\n\nPolygon vs. Other Blockchains\n\nThe Polygon blockchain fundamentally differs from other blockchains such as Bitcoin and Solana because it relies heavily on another blockchain for its security. Polygon is in effect a part of the greater Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum is another Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. Arbitrum is slightly more decentralized because it is secured by Ethereum\u2019s large network of miners. Polygon, on the other hand, is secured by MATIC staking, which is a smaller pool of capital when compared to the miners who secure the Ethereum network. Polygon is slightly cheaper to use and has faster withdrawal times when transitioning your assets back onto the Ethereum Network.\n\nHow to Store MATIC Safely\n\nIf you wish to purchase a large sum of MATIC tokens, it is crucial to take the proper precautions to store your cryptocurrencies safely. The best place to store your MATIC tokens is on the hardware wallet Ledger.\n\nLedger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that stores access to your cryptocurrencies on an external device. Ledger wallets are not connected to the internet. This feature is beneficial because hot wallets that are connected to the internet are much more likely to be exposed to scams, hacks and private key leaks. Ledger wallets are currently priced at around $60 to $250 depending on the model you choose.\n\nShould You Use Polygon?\n\nPolygon is a scaling solution for the growing cryptographer that aims to improve the speed and reduce the cost of using the Ethereum blockchain. The company not only helps bring new cost-conscious users into the Ethereum ecosystem, but it also retains existing users. Many Ethereum projects are in the process of deploying on Polygon, and the Polygon Labs ecosystem is only expected to grow and add scaling solutions over time. However, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade risks rendering Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions less valuable as the mainnet scalability improves.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "title": "Manta Pacific adopts Celestia, embraces native Ethereum yield - Blockworks",
        "content": "Manta Pacific, a layer-2 network currently running on Optimism\u2019s OP stack, has become the first such chain to adopt modular data availability (DA) using the newly launched Celestia mainnet.\n\nThe shift to Celestia for DA, instead of Ethereum mainnet, is expected to make transactions for Manta Pacific cheaper by at least an order of magnitude, according to core contributor Kenny Li, which should \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the chain even if demand for block space picks up in a future bull market.\n\nCurrently, a typical transaction costs around $0.24 on Manta Pacific, but Li anticipates that they can reduce that to less than $0.03 within a week or two, and a 25x savings after further adjustments in January.\n\nRead more: Celestia, the first modular data availability network, launches on mainnet\n\nLi, who co-founded p0x Labs, which is developing Manta Network, started talking with the Celestia team in the first quarter of 2023, after learning that Celestia was working on an OP stack integration, which timed out well with Manta\u2019s launch plans.\n\n\u201cBy coincidence, we were able to kind of get the stars aligned there \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d Li told Blockworks.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s integration with Celestia utilizes data availability sampling (DAS), a mechanism that allows light nodes to verify data availability without downloading all data within a block. This method reduces costs by enabling more efficient data retrieval, effectively turning the rollup into a validium.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nThe adoption of modular blockchain designs involve a separation of various tasks \u2014 such as consensus, execution, data availability and settlement \u2014 across different layers, rather than handling all functions within a single chain.\n\nSince the launch of the Manta Pacific testnet in August, the Manta team decided to switch to a zkEVM based on the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK).\n\nPolygon\u2019s own proof-of-stake chain will also migrate to a zkEVM validium rollup.\n\nThis transition, which should take place in the second quarter of 2024, will solve the user pain point of delayed withdrawals required by the fault proofs endemic to Optimistic rollups.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re looking at, first, phasing it in such that one of our phases would essentially have a multi-prover model whereby we could fall back to the fault proofs on the OP stack if anything went wrong, but also being able to bring in the zk proofs so that we can have that fast finality for the users,\u201d Li said.\n\nFault proofs on Optimism are not yet live, so the integrity of transactions relies on trusting a centralized sequencer and community vigilance.\n\nManta also relies on one centralized sequencer to post data to Celestia, and Li analogizes the planned zk-prover fallback mechanism to the use of Celestia itself.\n\n\u201cThe components we need to think about [are] resiliency, fallback options, contingency plans, and so with Celestia, the contingency here is that the fallback goes back to Ethereum\u201d for data availability, Li explained.\n\nSince DA is the main driver of transaction costs for the user, a multi-prover system should have a negligible effect.\n\nP0x Labs, the team building the Manta Network, wrapped up a $25 million Series A funding round in July.\n\nManta Pacific joins Manta Atlantic, a Polkadot parachain expected to go live in early 2024, to collectively offer a multifaceted option for the development of Web3 applications.\n\nRead more: Polkadot rethinks the economics of parachain auctions\n\nManta Atlantic focuses on zk solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem, but Li said there are synergies between the two coming.\n\n\u201cA lot of the zk components that we built out on the circuit side specifically are focused on on-chain identity, and so one of our goals right now is to bridge that on-chain identity over to the Pacific ecosystem so that people can verify without revealing any of their wallet addresses and stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would include roughly 100,000 KYCd participants, he added.\n\nNative yield on ETH and USDC\n\nManta Pacific offers its own spin on the idea pioneered by Mantle and Blast to let users earn yield on their deposited ether and stablecoins while interacting with dapps on the layer-2 network.\n\nRead more: Mantle offers \u2018mETH\u2019 to the masses, as a \u2018lighter weight Lido\u2019\n\nManta relies on StakeStone a Liquid Staking Token (LST) protocol that accepts ETH and issues STONE, a non-rebasing Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) based on the LayerZero protocol, which can be used directly in DeFi dapps.\n\nStakeStone supports leading staking pools and is compatible with upcoming restaking, such as EigenLayer.\n\nSimilarly, USDC deposits are converted to the yield-bearing stablecoin (USDM) issued by Mountain Protocol. Manta will eventually enable bridging these tokens back out after an initial phase of about two months as part of a campaign, dubbed New Paradigm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Li sees it.\n\n\u201cKudos to Blast \u2014 they\u2019ve got like 800 million TVL [total value locked] from people who could otherwise be using those assets in ways that could provide more future value,\u201d Li said, adding that Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL is about $60 million after 3 days.\n\n\u201cI do know that many other [layer-2s] are also exploring this now as well, and I think while it\u2019s interesting and novel at this moment, a year from now, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s a commodity \u2014 the feature that everyone has,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

Those transfers have amounted to 11,200 ETH in total worth $24 million.\n\nJust now, #GalaxyDigital has deposited a total of 11.2K $ETH ($24.3M) to #binance.\n\n\n\nTill now, they have deposited a total of 31437 $ETH ($71M) to exchanges. pic.twitter.com/C3PPKmTHcf \u2014 The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd) December 18, 2023\n\n@OnchainDataNerd added that this was not the only ETH chunk sold by Galaxy Digital recently. In total, Mike Novogratz\u2019s company has disposed of a much bigger amount of ETH \u2013 roughly 31,437 coins, amounting to approximately $71 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDormant Ethereum wallet awakens\n\nAnother source of on-chain data on the Twitter/X app, @lookonchain Smart Money tracker, recently reported that a whale that had stayed inactive for one year has awakened and began selling his/her Ethereum on a decentralized exchange.\n\nA whale that has been dormant for 1 year is dumping $ETH on #DEX!\n\n\n\nSo far, 18,865 $ETH has been sold for 42M $DAI through 4 new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229.\n\n\n\nAnd currently has 5,588 $ETH($12.5M) left. pic.twitter.com/K6znM7pxxh \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 16, 2023\n\nThis Ether holder sold 18,865 Ethereum for 42,000,000 DAI stablecoins using four newly-created wallets. The whale sold all this Ethereum at an average price of $2,229. At the time of this writing, this massive crypto holder has 5,588 ETH left worth $12.5 million.\n\nOverall, as the Ethereum price continues dumping now, the whale activity of the second largest cryptocurrency has increased. Earlier today, a whale withdrew a staggering 60,000 ETH (evaluated at $131.76 million) from Bitfinex and borrowed 58 million DAI from Maker with some of that money. Then, they swapped the borrowed stablecoins to 58 million USDC and deposited them to Binance.\n\nWhale Alert cryptocurrency tracker spotted several massive Ethereum transactions.\n\nA total of 21,000 ETH was transferred from OKEx to Binance. The amount of 20,000 ETH was sent from an anonymous wallet to BitFlyer, and an unknown wallet deposited 15,839 ETH to the Binance exchange. Overall, all this Ethereum was moved in five transactions, worth almost $119 million in total.\n\nAfter rising 7.7% last week and hitting $2,317, Ethereum declined over the weekend and lost approximately 8%, exchanging hands at $2,131 at the time of this writing."

        "title": "Solana: il momento dell'Ethereum-killer \u00e8 arrivato - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In the last few days, Solana has surpassed Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this is not a general overtaking, so much so that for example, in terms of market capitalization, ETH\u2019s is still almost ten times higher than SOL\u2019s.\n\nThe overtaking, instead, occurred in a specific context, and as far as a single parameter is concerned.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Solana vs Ethereum\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, daily trading volumes on Solana DEX have reached those of Ethereum DEX.\n\nOn the contrary, on Friday for the first time in history, the daily trading volume on DEX on Solana exceeded that of DEX on Ethereum.\n\nBREAKING: @solana FLIPS @ethereum IN 24H DEX VOLUME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY pic.twitter.com/fmcYjnlyeq \u2014 DEGEN NEWS \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f (@DegenerateNews) December 16, 2023\n\nNote that these are relatively small volumes, around one billion dollars. For example, the daily trading volumes of ETH on centralized exchanges exceed 8 billion dollars, while those of SOL are less than 2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the data related to DEX does not only concern the exchange of ETH and SOL cryptocurrencies, but also all the other tokens present on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.\n\nIn particular, the recent boom in trading on Solana\u2019s DEX is mainly due to the boom of the Bonk token.\n\nThe incredible hype about Bonk\n\nTaking into consideration the overall trading volumes of Bonk on both DEX and decentralized exchanges, the all-time peak occurred precisely between December 15th and 16th.\n\nBonk is a token on Solana launched in December of last year, and had never exceeded $200 million in daily trading volume until December 8th.\n\nActually, to tell the truth, if we exclude the initial weeks, afterwards it didn\u2019t even exceed 10 million until the end of October.\n\nStarting from the end of October, with the awakening of the crypto markets, both trading volumes and price have skyrocketed.\n\nOn December 13th, volumes had risen to $350 million, and the following day they had already skyrocketed to $680 million.\n\nThe peak on December 15/16 first saw a surpass of 3 billion dollars, and then a decline to 2.6 billion. These numbers alone are able to justify the surpass of daily trading volume on the Solana DEX compared to the Ethereum DEX.\n\nThe return to normality\n\nIn fact, yesterday the trading volume of Bonk tokens dropped to 1.1 billion dollars, and the daily trading volume on DEXs on Ethereum has returned higher than that on Solana.\n\nSince Bonk is a token that \u201cawakens\u201d before Christmas, this trend is destined to quickly fade away, and yesterday\u2019s decline seems likely to persist today.\n\nTherefore, it was an exceptional circumstance not specifically related to Solana but to a token issued on the Solana blockchain, and therefore exchangeable on Solana DEXs and not on Ethereum ones.\n\nFor example, considering other parameters such as TVL, Ethereum continues to dominate undisputedly, with 55% of the entire DeFi TVL DeFi.\n\nAlthough it is slightly down compared to the 56% at the beginning of the month, it is still more than the sum of the TVL of all the other chains put together.\n\nIn addition, Solana is not even on the podium from this point of view, because compared to 28 billion dollars of TVL on Ethereum, 8 billion on Tron, and 3 billion on BCS, Solana is only in fifth place with just over one billion.\n\nThe same market capitalization of Bonk is just over one billion dollars, and this indicates that there are not many BONK tokens locked on DEX.\n\nSolana is challenging Ethereum\n\nDespite this, it can still be said that SOlana is somehow challenging Ethereum.\n\nWhile Ethereum in general seems untouchable at the moment, there are niches where Solana or other chains can perform better.\n\nIn particular, they perform better where it is more important for fees to be contained. For example, on DEXs it can be a problem if the average transaction fees are around $10, as is the case with current transactions on Ethereum.\n\nSolana allows for faster transactions and significantly lower costs, so it\u2019s no wonder that tokens like Bonk, which are not appealing to large investors, are now being issued on blockchains like Solana and traded there, perhaps on DEX platforms.\n\nMoreover, Bonk has only recently been added to the main centralized exchanges, while until just a few days ago it could practically only be traded on DEX.\n\nNote that the trading volume of Bonk in the last 24 hours on all exchanges has dropped below 700 million dollars, so the phenomenon mentioned above seems to have run its course."

        "title": "Lisk embraces Ethereum: a new era for blockchain interoperability. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Lisk blockchain, at the forefront of the Web3 ecosystem, has recently announced an epochal transition to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution.\n\nWith the support of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack and Gelato\u2019s advanced infrastructure, Lisk is poised to play a crucial role in bringing Optimism Superchain\u2019s vision to life. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe strategic transition of the Lisk blockchain to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution\n\nAs anticipated, Gelato has officially announced the expansion of its versatile all-in-one platform, known as Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nThis growth includes support not only for Polygon CDK, but also for OP Stack, the open-source modular development framework developed by Optimism Collective.\n\nIn this expansion phase, Gelato has opened its doors to Lisk, a top-level blockchain launched in 2016, so that it can join the Ethereum ecosystem by migrating to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2.\n\nLisk will become part of OP Mainnet, Base, and other OP chains, distinguishing itself as the first level 1 to commit to Optimism\u2019s Superchain vision.\n\nThe addition of OP Stack support by Gelato underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to revolutionizing the blockchain landscape.\n\nThe democratization of access to a modular block space allows a wide range of creators to easily implement their own level 2 blockchains, ready for launch.\n\nThis crucial step unlocks the potential of the main cryptographic applications, ushering in a new era in the adoption of blockchain, as highlighted by Luis Schliesske, founder of Gelato.\n\nDesigned to mitigate congestion issues on the main Ethereum network, OP Stack represents the open-source codebase and standards that power the Optimism ecosystem, aiming to support the Superchain.\n\nThanks to Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, OP Stack not only manages the implementation, hosting, and monitoring of new Layer 2 chains, but also obtains native integrations with Gelato\u2019s leading Web3 middleware services.\n\nThese include automation, off-chain data, and account abstraction, which enable a superior user experience. Additionally, the platform provides immediate access to high-level web3 services such as Etherscan, The Graph, LayerZero, and many others.\n\nThe Web3 revolution of Gelato\n\nLevel 2 chains implemented with Gelato, including Lisk, not only gain the benefits of the underlying blockchain, but also a fully production-ready web3 development environment.\n\nThis is a milestone for web3 development, as developers have access for the first time to an OP chain with end-to-end services and all infrastructure dependencies implemented from the start.\n\nBen Jones, head scientist at the Optimism Foundation, expresses enthusiasm for the extension of support from Gelato to Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk.\n\nGelato has already demonstrated its efficiency by executing one million transactions on OP Mainnet for projects like Synthetix, Lyra, and Velodrome. Jones anticipates that Gelato, with its developer experience, will contribute to turning Superchain\u2019s vision into a tangible reality.\n\nThrough Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, implementing your own complete OP chain of services becomes a simple process, without the need to write code.\n\nThis allows developers to focus on growing their core business, while Gelato handles the implementation and maintenance of the chain.\n\nDominic Schwenter, Chief Project Officer at Lisk, emphasizes that the use of Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to focus on creating products and tools appreciated by developers and end users, allocating resources to the development of Superchain.\n\nGelato and Optimism share a vision of a world where thousands of blockchains are interconnected, allowing for horizontal scaling of web3 applications. The Gelato Rollup-as-a-Service platform positions itself as a key component of this environment, managing clients\u2019 blockchains and providing an end-to-end development environment with essential infrastructure services for integrated developers."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is predicting market corrections for Solana (SOL) and another one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 201,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is setting up to dip below $50, more than 31% below its current value.\n\nAlthough the trader says that a correction is in sight for Solana, he thinks that SOL will eventually recover and regain its bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cSOL: for traders, I think sub $50 is coming for Solana in the mid-term.\n\nFor investors, SOL is going to go to much higher levels in the coming months, so probably just don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one. That\u2019ll be the one to consider shorting, to be honest. I think that this is in its distribution phase for now though.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLisk (LSK), a delegated proof of stake (DPOS) protocol, has unveiled its plans to migrate to Ethereum as a layer-2 scaling solution. According to the update shared on its official X account, Lisk said its layer-2 plot will be achieved in collaboration with Optimism (OP) and Gelato Network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the protocol noted, the push to Ethereum is to advance its key value protocol to bring real world assets (RWA) to emerging markets. Additionally, a switch to Ethereum will optimize its plans to provide a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on-chain.\n\nThe switch from a full-blown layer-1 to a layer-2 protocol is uncommon; however, the ease of implementing the move, as provided by Optimism, makes the transition easier. Lisk now says it is the first L1 blockchain that will join other protocols like Base to contribute to the Optimism Superchain. Recall that Base was designed by Coinbase using the OP technology Stack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Lisk will integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem as a Layer 2 (L2) in collaboration with @Optimism & @gelatonetwork!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Focused on solving local problems in Emerging Markets by bringing solutions around real-world assets (RWA), off-chain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/a05p5ldwEm \u2014 Lisk (@LiskHQ) December 19, 2023\n\nBy committing its developers to the development of Optimism Superchain, Lisk said it will advance the vision of contributing to the future of Web3. It believes its contributions in the long term will contribute to driving mass adoption into the industry.\n\nLisk price reacts\n\nThe announcement of the transition to the Ethereum protocol as a layer-1 network has pushed Lisk (LSK) to a new daily high. At the time of writing, the digital currency has jumped by 6.23% to $1.13, taking its market capitalization to $145,573,784.\n\nThe move to Ethereum might be the ultimate game-changer that Lisk needs to gain mainstream recognition, like other protocols in the L2 arena. Despite its revolutionary offerings and age, the protocol is ranked as the 262nd largest protocol by market capitalization, and its transaction count pales in comparison to OP and ARB.\n\nThis contrasts with Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB) and Polygon (MATIC), whose market cap ranking and total value locked (TVL) compete with many established layer-1 blockchains today."

        "content": "The Sandbox Embraces Polygon \u2013 Lower Fees, Endless Creativity\n\nThe Sandbox, a renowned virtual gaming universe, has recently revealed a critical development shift: transitioning its digital marketplace from Ethereum to Polygon.\n\nBy now being powered by the Polygon blockchain, the Metaverse\u2018s marketplace offers reduced fees for minting assets. Anyone can craft and sell their virtual creations while earning royalties from resales, with minting on Workspace and its improved UX/UI making this process effortless.\n\nFurther highlighting its dedication to becoming more affordable and seamless, the platform is committing itself to covering up to 10 transaction costs per user every month.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as an additional celebration of the chain switch, The Sandbox Marketplace is unveiling over 100 new digital artworks. Each artistic endeavor \u2014 designed by 30 artists who are part of The Sandbox\u2019s Creator Fund program \u2014 boasts a unique style like no other, comprising fantasy characters, futuristic designs, legendary creatures, and more.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Introducing The Sandbox Marketplace on @0xPolygon! \ud83d\udce3 Anyone can now mint ASSETs with greatly reduced fees! \ud83d\udcb0 Monetize your creations \u2013 Put your work up for sale and even get royalties for every ASSET resold on the Marketplace. \ud83d\udce4 Mint ASSETs with ease \u2013 Upload to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/yhpOP8lACv \u2014 The Sandbox (@TheSandboxGame) December 14, 2023\n\nOther New Notable Gains\n\nAlong with the transition to Polygon, various improvements were made to the platform. The browsing and search features have been upgraded, making it easier for users to discover new digital assets. One significant enhancement is the capability of users to mint NFTs using CATALYST tokens, thereby enabling a broader range of creators to design unique virtual collectibles on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, The Sandbox acknowledges that not all creators are in possession of CATALYST tokens. To address this issue, it has begun free distributions for these creators, which include all LAND owners. Moreover, LAND owners who participate in subsequent activities are promised an extra allocation of tokens.\n\nNotably, all existing digital assets created on the Ethereum network can remain on The Sandbox. However, there\u2019s also the provision to transfer these assets to Polygon in the near future. Thus, creators can continue to expand their digital landscapes unabated.\n\nThe Sandbox\u2019s blockchain move offers several benefits for both users and creators. Lower transaction costs, upgraded platform functionality, and fresh opportunities underline. For aspiring creators, artists, and users, there are many exciting advancements to look forward to in this ever-evolving virtual world.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "Up More Than 150% for the Year, These 3 Cryptos Have the Potential to Outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink are three cryptos that could outpace Bitcoin next year.\n\nWithout a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC 0.91%) has been the standout crypto performer of 2023. Up more than 150% for the year, Bitcoin has completely reenergized the crypto market. With Bitcoin currently trading around $42,000, some investors are even speculating that Bitcoin could soar past the $100,000 mark next year.\n\nBut with all the excitement around Bitcoin, investors might be overlooking cryptocurrencies with the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year. Three potential standouts include Solana (SOL 1.03%), Avalanche (AVAX 2.98%), and Chainlink (LINK 0.50%). Let's take a closer look at why you might want to put these cryptos on your investment radar right now.\n\nSolana and Avalanche\n\nBoth Solana and Avalanche are direct competitors to Ethereum (ETH 1.16%), the second-most valuable cryptocurrency. In crypto terminology, all three are Layer-1 blockchain networks. This simply means that they are the core base layer on which everything else is built in the blockchain world. That includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming, and Web3 apps.\n\nIf you compare the market caps of Solana and Avalanche to that of Ethereum, there's still a huge chasm. Ethereum is 8 times the size of Solana and 18 times the size of Avalanche. From my perspective, this gap should be much smaller.\n\nAnd many other investors seem to agree. Avalanche is up a sizzling 270% this year and Solana is up a blistering 630%. With that kind of performance, they are starting to gain the attention of some high-profile institutional investors. For example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, making the case that Solana is a faster and more cost-effective version of Ethereum. The implication, of course, was that Solana might one day overtake Ethereum.\n\nThe big question is whether the first-mover advantage of Ethereum is simply too insurmountable. Ethereum has seemingly been first to market with nearly every major blockchain innovation of the past five years, and that means Ethereum has a dominant position in just about every niche of the blockchain world. So keep your growth expectations for Solana and Avalanche in check.\n\nChainlink\n\nChainlink is the premier decentralized blockchain oracle in the world right now, and it's not even close. While Chainlink currently has a market cap of $8 billion, its nearest competitors have market caps measured in the hundreds of millions. For the year, Chainlink is up about 160%, and is now the 13th-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nAs a blockchain oracle, Chainlink provides data to smart contracts, which are small pieces of self-executable computer code. These smart contracts form the basis of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is why the data provided by Chainlink is so valuable. When smart contracts can't find the data they need on the blockchain, they turn to Chainlink for \"off-chain\" data.\n\nIf you buy into the concept that data is the oil of the digital economy, then you can see why Chainlink is so valuable. What has me especially excited about Chainlink is the potential for an integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In May, Chainlink outlined some of the potential use cases. And then, at this year's Chainlink conference in October, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt (a strategic advisor to Chainlink) hosted a fireside chat with Chainlink founder Sergey Nazarov discussing the intersection of blockchain and AI.\n\nThe big caveat here, of course, is that Chainlink is not an AI company and it's unclear when (or if) there will ever be a formal integration of Chainlink with ChatGPT. So, as an investor, just be aware that you're not getting direct exposure to the AI market by investing in Chainlink.\n\nJust how risky are these cryptos?\n\nWhile all three of these cryptos have the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year, Bitcoin should probably continue to represent at least one-half of your total crypto portfolio. Given that Bitcoin currently represents one-half of the current value of the $1.6 trillion crypto market, this seems like a reasonable rule of thumb.\n\nMoreover, keep in mind that the crypto market is still a volatile place to invest your money. All three of these cryptos are riskier than Bitcoin, and that means you should handle them with extreme care. That said, if you're willing to take on the extra risk, all three of these cryptos could outpace Bitcoin next year."

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) halving, expected in April 2024, is leading mining companies to reassess their operations to ensure they are prepared for the drop in rewards. One such way is by acquiring smaller firms to bring economies of scale to their activities. Earlier this month, Marathon said it had more than $800 million of cash and bitcoin to \"capitalize on strategic opportunities, including industry consolidation\" ahead of the halving."

        "content": "For the first time ever, Solana\u2019s daily DEX volume outshone Ethereum, although the reign was short-lived.\n\nThe newfound popularity of meme coin BONK, alongside USDC integration, has fuelled interest in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nSolana boasts cheaper transactions and faster settlement times compared to the congestion of Ethereum.\n\nSince its inception in 2020, Solana has been striving to overcome Ethereum to become the unofficial \u201cKing of DeFi\u201d. Although, in the long-term, that title no doubt still belongs to the Ether ecosystem, for just a moment, Solana managed to wear the crown.\n\nSolana \u201cFlips\u201d Eth For Very First Time\n\nTwo days ago, trading volume on Solana decentralised exchanges (DEX) managed to beat out Ethereum over a 24-hour period. Data acquired from DeFiLlama showed that Solana\u2019s daily volume surpassed USD $1.5 billion (AUD $2.24 billion), while Ethereum trailed behind at approximately USD $1.15 billion (AUD $1.72 billion).\n\nSolana trading volume, source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe \u201cflippening\u201d didn\u2019t last long, with order restored the day after as Ethereum once again reclaimed the throne for daily trading volume. However, the monumental occasion was not lost on Solana\u2019s community and comes amid significant ecosystem growth in the second half of 2023.\n\nI am just pacing around the house and saying whoa over and over at this point https://t.co/SSPZz3bVac \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8| bip-420 (@aeyakovenko) December 16, 2023\n\nBONK and USDC Leading the Charge\n\nThe newfound interest in Solana\u2019s decentralised finance ecosystem is being pushed by two elements: BONK and USDC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBONK is a meme coin in the ilk of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that has recently gained traction, quickly rising to the position of third-biggest meme token by market cap. This has sparked significant community interest, especially amid news that those who purchase a Solana phone were airdropped an amount of BONK worth more than the actual phone at retail. This is no longer the case thanks to a massive increase in demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s integration of the second-most popular stablecoin USDC has seen seasoned DeFi traders flock to the blockchain thanks to its cheap transaction fees and fast settlement times.\n\nThis is happening because ecosystem devs have continued shipping awesome products for the last 24 months. https://t.co/Yddhigq42b \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8| bip-420 (@aeyakovenko) December 18, 2023\n\nSolana Versus Ethereum: Who Will Win?\n\nWhen Ethereum introduced smart contracts in 2017, it revolutionised the blockchain industry. Hundreds of influential decentralised applications brought new utility to the world and helped bring solutions to real-world problems crypto had long wanted to implement. However, as the Ether DeFi world exploded, issues of its own started to arise \u2013 gas fees soared, network congestion thickened and settlement times lengthened.\n\nThese are the keys to Solana\u2019s case for overcoming Ethereum. Transaction fees on Solana are substantially cheaper than Ethereum, and it can handle congestion much better. But does it have the security and app developers on board to finish the job? Only time will tell."

        "content": "JAKARTA - The founder of Ethereum (ETH), Vitalik Buterin, recently caused a commotion among the crypto community. The reason is, he was caught selling a number of meme coins or coin memes in large quantities. Vitalik's meme coin, Doberman (DOBE) and DOJO.\n\nThis sale was revealed from data tracked by PeckShild Alert, a blockchain security firm. This sale raises various speculations about the motives and impacts on the crypto market.\n\nCoins of coin or coin memes are a type of cryptocurrency inspired by the characters, animals, or funny things that are popular on the internet. Some examples of well-known coin memes are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk. Meme coins are usually of low value, but can rise sharply due to the virality factor and community support.\n\nButerin is known as one of the biggest coin meme owners, as his wallet often receives tokens from coin meme developers. Their goal is to increase the credibility and popularity of their project by linking it to Buterin's name. As a result, Buterin's wallet is filled with various kinds of coin memes with a value of millions of dollars.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, Buterin sold 100,000,000,000.111.11 DOBE and 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO through the Uniswap V2 platform, a decentralized crypto exchange protocol. He exchanged the coin meme with Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), the ERC-20 version of Ether (ETH), the original cryptocurrency of Ethereum. The total transaction value reaches around $40,000 (IDR 618.4 million).\n\nThis sale is one of many major transactions made by Buterin in recent months. In September, he moved 2,000 ETH worth about $3.1 million (IDR 47.8 billion) to the Bitstamp exchange. In November, he denied allegations of selling 3.000 ETH, claiming that it was part of a donation for research projects.\n\nButerin himself has not provided an official explanation of the reasons for selling his latest coin memes. However, there are several possibilities to consider. First, he may want to clear his wallet of unwanted or useless assets. Second, he may want to reduce the risk of market volatility that could erode the value of his assets. Third, he may want to allocate funds for other purposes, such as the development of Ethereum or philanthropy.\n\nWhatever the motive, Buterin's selling of coin memes certainly has an impact on the crypto market considering meme coins are very sensitive to market sentiment, so Buterin's actions can trigger chain reactions from crypto traders and investors.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

As per recent regulatory updates on December 18, the SEC has delayed its verdict on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nHashdex\u2019s proposed Ether ETF aims to incorporate a mix of spot Ether and futures contracts. Conversely, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF, considered a strategic move, could compel the SEC to allow the conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to postpone includes initiating proceedings to seek additional public feedback on the viability of these ETFs. The delay also affects the decisions for VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF and the joint application from ARK Invest and 21Shares for their spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nUpdate: There it is.

The focus of the crypto market is also on the SEC\u2019s impending decision regarding 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with a potential decision expected as early as January 10, 2024.\n\nSeyffart, alongside fellow analyst Eric Balchunas, predicts a 90% likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, a development that has positively influenced market sentiment. Over the past six months, Bitcoin has seen a notable 44% price increase, while Ethereum has also enjoyed a 16.8% rise in the same period, according to TradingView statistics."

You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nThe Ethereum platform is an open-source blockchain platform with its cryptocurrency known as Ether (ETH). Ethereum is a blockchain network that allows users to create, monetize, and use Ether, the cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nVitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin announced the creation of the decentralized public ledger in July 2015. It is based on Blockchain technology, making it very difficult or almost impossible to hack, change, or cheat the system because Ethereum is based on Blockchain technology.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is a digital tool, available as either software or hardware, that enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. This wallet facilitates the management of Ethereum accounts, essential for conducting transactions and monitoring balances within the Ethereum network.\n\nEach Ethereum account can have multiple Ethereum addresses, which are public identifiers starting with \u201c0x\u201d and consisting of a string of letters and numbers. While the balance of these addresses is publicly visible on the blockchain, the identity of the address owner remains anonymous, represented only by this unique alphanumeric string.\n\nThe critical component of an Ethereum wallet is the private key, akin to a password. This key allows the user to operate their wallet and manage the funds within it. It\u2019s crucial that this key remains confidential to the wallet\u2019s owner, as anyone who gains access to it can access and potentially control the funds in that wallet.\n\nEthereum wallets come in various forms, catering to different needs and preferences. They can be software-based, residing on desktop or mobile devices, or hardware-based, offering enhanced security by storing information offline. There are also physical wallets, such as those made from paper or titanium, providing an offline method of storing the private keys securely.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum wallets are the interface through which users engage with the Ethereum blockchain, managing their accounts, funds, and interactions with decentralized applications and smart contracts. The choice of wallet type depends on the user\u2019s specific requirements, balancing convenience, accessibility, and security.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges and various services, including marketplaces and lending platforms, offer Ethereum storage solutions known as custodial wallets. These wallets maintain control over the users\u2019 private keys, offering a trade-off between convenience and direct control over funds. While they simplify access to funds, users are reliant on the service\u2019s security measures, increasing the risk of loss through hacking or mismanagement by the service.\n\nFor those seeking to utilize decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain, having access to private keys is essential. DApps are digital applications that operate on blockchain technology, offering a wide range of functionalities.\n\nEthereum wallets vary in their capabilities. While most allow basic functions like sending and receiving Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, others offer additional features. ERC-20 is a standard for issuing tokens on Ethereum, defining a set of rules for their operation. Some wallets enable direct cryptocurrency purchases using credit or debit cards and support for unique digital assets like nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which differ from fungible tokens like Ether (ETH).\n\nThese wallets also facilitate interaction with DApps, which span various domains such as social media, gaming, marketplaces, and financial services. Certain Ethereum wallets come with built-in browsers, making it easier to access these DApps directly. Additionally, linking bank accounts to wallets can simplify crypto transactions, often offering lower fees and the convenience of recurring payments.\n\nSecurity features in Ethereum wallets vary, with some allowing users to specify trusted addresses for fund transfers, and others offering multisignature (multisig) capabilities, requiring multiple approvals for transactions. Multisig accounts are common in blockchain platforms and traditional finance.\n\nWallets differ in the number and type of features they offer, with advanced wallets supporting a mix of Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and other cryptocurrencies to interact with various blockchain networks.\n\nUsers aren\u2019t limited to a single type of Ethereum wallet. With private keys, access is possible via mobile devices, desktops, browsers, or even paper wallets. The method of access can vary, but the underlying blockchain data remains constant.\n\nBelow is a classification of Ethereum wallet types:\n\nMobile Wallets:\n\nThese are applications installed on mobile devices, functioning as light nodes without requiring the entire blockchain download. They are convenient but less secure due to potential device loss or hacking. Mobile wallets often include built-in browsers for DApp interaction.\n\nDesktop Wallets:\n\nRunning on operating systems like macOS, Windows, or Linux, these wallets store keys locally and are used predominantly on desktop computers. They offer enhanced security, with options for full blockchain clients for independent transaction validation.\n\nWeb Interfaces:\n\nOnline platforms that allow wallet interaction through web browsers. They utilize cloud storage for accessibility but can be risky if they require users to trust a website with their private keys.\n\nBrowser Extensions:\n\nAdd-ons for desktop browsers, these wallets store ETH and ERC-20 tokens and are generally considered more secure than web interfaces. They encrypt private keys within the browser for added security.\n\nHardware Wallets:\n\nPhysical devices that store private keys offline (cold wallets), offering high security. They are suitable for large holdings and require physical access and a password or PIN for fund access.\n\nPaper Wallets:\n\nBasic cold wallets involving printed private keys. Highly secure but susceptible to physical damage or loss, paper wallets are inexpensive and easy to create.\n\nEach wallet type presents a balance of security, convenience, and functionality, and users should choose based on their specific needs and risk tolerance.\n\nType Description Mobile Wallets Easy-to-use apps on mobile devices. They offer convenience but can be less secure due to potential device loss or hacking. Useful for interacting with DApps and DeFi. Desktop Wallets Installed on computers, offering higher security than mobile wallets. Ideal for users preferring desktop-based management and offering features like smart contract creation. Web Interfaces Web-based platforms allowing wallet interaction via browsers. Convenient but can be risky due to potential web-based attacks like phishing or DNS attacks. Browser Extensions Add-ons for browsers, enabling interaction with DApps and storage of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Generally safer than web interfaces as they encrypt private keys in the browser. Hardware Wallets Physical devices storing private keys offline. Highly secure (cold storage) but can be costlier, ideal for large holdings or long-term storage. Paper Wallets Basic cold storage method involving printed private keys. Highly secure but susceptible to physical damage or loss. Inexpensive and simple to create.\n\nHot Wallet vs Cold Wallet For Ethereum\n\nFor individuals prioritizing ease of access and a reasonable degree of security, hot wallets present an optimal solution. These wallets are particularly advantageous for managing Ethereum accounts with modest asset values, offering a blend of security and user-friendly functionality. Hot wallets, accessible via the internet, provide the most straightforward and practical option for everyday transactions and engagements within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConversely, users who prefer not to rely on online service providers and are prepared to undertake the responsibility of securing their private keys might find cold wallets more suitable. These wallets, which store information offline, afford users a higher level of control over their assets. They are especially recommended for safeguarding significant cryptocurrency holdings, where the paramount concern is security over convenience. While opting for a cold wallet entails a trade-off in terms of accessibility, it significantly mitigates the risk of total asset loss \u2013 a scenario far more inconvenient than the additional steps required in managing a cold wallet. It is imperative for users of cold wallets to rigorously ensure the safety and confidentiality of their private keys, as this is integral to the security of their substantial assets.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet for NFTs\n\nThe significant popularity of Ethereum, coupled with its extensive developer community, has positioned it as the foremost blockchain platform for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Given this prominence, it\u2019s unsurprising that a majority of wallets now offer support for Ethereum-based tokens, particularly those adhering to the ERC-721 standard. In this context, a pertinent question arises: \u2018Which Ethereum wallet stands out as the preeminent choice for NFTs?\u2019\n\nMetaMask, widely acknowledged as the leading crypto wallet for Ethereum interactions, offers both a mobile application and a browser extension. These tools facilitate effortless access to Web 3.0 marketplaces, streamlining the process with just a few clicks.\n\nWithin the realm of Ethereum NFT wallets, MetaMask is frequently lauded as the superior option by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Its recurring mentions in Ethereum wallet reviews underscore its merits. One of MetaMask\u2019s primary advantages is its user-friendliness, making it accessible to individuals with even a rudimentary understanding of cryptocurrencies. Users can efficiently set up MetaMask to manage ETH, ERC-20, and ERC-721 tokens created on the Ethereum network, as well as assets from other blockchain networks.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s distinction also stems from its open-source nature and the dedication of its development team, contributing to its status as the most favored Ethereum NFT wallet in the community.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet \u2013 Conclusion\n\nIn concluding our exploration of the best Ethereum wallets, it\u2019s evident that each option presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The selection process is largely influenced by individual requirements and preferences, especially considering the diverse functionalities of these wallets. Ethereum, despite being a relatively recent entrant in the cryptocurrency arena, has rapidly ascended to prominence, necessitating a careful choice of wallet for optimal management of assets.\n\nSoftware wallets, or hot wallets, are typically chosen for their user-friendly interfaces and versatility. They excel in providing a seamless experience for purchasing, storing, selling, exchanging, and managing multiple cryptocurrencies within a single platform. These wallets are ideal for those who prioritize ease of use and quick access to their crypto assets.\n\nOn the other hand, hardware wallets, though potentially more costly, offer a significantly heightened level of security and privacy. Unlike their software counterparts, hardware wallets may support a limited range of cryptocurrencies but are unparalleled in safeguarding assets. For those seeking a balance between security and convenience, integrating a hardware wallet with a software or hot wallet can be an effective strategy. This combination harnesses the strengths of both types, ensuring robust security without compromising on accessibility.\n\nAfter thorough analysis and research, we have identified eToro as the standout crypto wallet for 2022. Its appeal lies in its comprehensive security measures, regulatory compliance, and widespread adoption by over 20 million users globally. eToro distinguishes itself not only as a safe and regulated wallet but also as a platform enabling users to trade cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, at competitive rates.
