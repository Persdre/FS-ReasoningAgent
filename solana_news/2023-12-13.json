        "content": "Web3 digital infrastructure provider COTI announced plans to launch a layer-2 chain on the Ethereum network that will be focused on adding a privacy layer to its products and services.\n\nAccording to a statement seen by CryptoPotato, the new protocol, COTI V2, will use a cryptographic technology called Garbled Circuits to enhance privacy while ensuring high speed and scalability.\n\nCOTI Unveils Privacy L2 Network\n\nCOTI claims Garbled Circuits is ten times more efficient than the Zero-Knowledge protocol, a method used by several layer-2 blockchains on the Ethereum network. COTI\u2019s new protocol will utilize Ethereum\u2019s pre-existing liquidity and security while implementing robust privacy protection for the ecosystem.\n\nThe launch of COTI\u2019s new protocol is driven by the lack of privacy and confidentiality on all layers of the public blockchain. The digital infrastructure provider believes the current state of the blockchain ecosystem gives malicious actors enough room to operate and that only strong privacy-centric architecture can protect the Web3 community.\n\nBesides ensuring privacy protection, COTI intends to focus on building areas that are \u201cwoefully lacking\u201d in Web3. The protocol\u2019s first challenge would be resolving users\u2019 ability to use the blockchain in complete privacy. COTI V2 will implement cryptography, enabling users to execute transactions without exposing their payment histories, wallet values/addresses, or other sensitive information.\n\nDeveloping a Complaint Ecosystem\n\nCOTI believes that focusing on anonymity to create privacy causes regulatory issues, which is ineffective in developing a complaint ecosystem. The new protocol will ensure transparency while protecting information that could harm users and the growth of web3.\n\nShahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI, said: \u201cSensitive data transmitted as public information on a blockchain is a bug, not a feature. This isn\u2019t tolerated in legacy business systems, so why should it be tolerated on-chain? COTI V2 will solve for this, preventing sensitive data from being broadcast to competitors, partners, and clients.\u201d\n\nThe digital infrastructure firm has scheduled the COTI V2 devnet release for the second quarter of 2024, after which the testnet and mainnet launch will follow. The company expects the launch to unlock countless new use cases in the industry and, in turn, trigger an immediate surge in web3 development."

        "content": "Ethereum price dropped close to the $2,100 level early on Wednesday, entering a crucial demand zone.\n\nOver 5.58 million wallet addresses hold nearly 40 million Ethereum tokens in the demand zone.\n\nAnalysts have predicted an ETH price rally to $3,000 since Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the $2,000 level.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, declined to $2,148 early on Wednesday. The fall in prices follows a broader sell-off in the crypto market since Monday, likely driven by investors\u2019 de-risking strategy ahead of a macro-packed week, with US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) last meeting of the year.\n\nEthereum price has entered a critical demand zone, according to on-chain metrics, in which market catalysts could help determine where ETH is headed next.\n\nAlso read: XRP price drop to $0.55 likely amidst Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s final push in US crypto legislation\n\nEthereum price reaches demand zone\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, Ethereum price has dipped into a demand zone considered crucial for the altcoin. The price range between $1,934 and $2,160 is key for Ethereum price as this is a range where 5.58 million wallet addresses accumulated nearly 40 million ETH tokens.\n\nThis makes the demand zone a critical support for ETH. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), this makes it an ideal reloading point for traders looking to add more Ethereum to their portfolio before the altcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money ETH. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum price eyes $3,000 target\n\nSeveral crypto analysts on X said Ethereum is primed for a rally. Since ETH price tested and broke out of the psychological barrier at $2,000, these analysts say the altcoin is ready to target the $3,000 level.\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @CryptoJelleNL argues ETH is ready to rally to $3,000 in the ongoing cycle.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart. Source: @CryptoJelleNL.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa), agrees with @CryptoJelleNL\u2019s thesis and notes that Ethereum is likely \u201cone of the easiest trades.\u201d Sherpa notes that after ETH consolidated under the $2,000 level for nearly two years, the altcoin is finally out of the range and ready to catch up to the $3,000 mark in the coming months.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nIn its predicted run up to the $3,000 mark, Ethereum price is likely to face resistance in the range between $2,160 and $2,247, where 1.04 million wallet addresses bought 5.49 million ETH tokens, according to IntoTheBlock data. A break past $2,247 is key to validating the bullish thesis for ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,171.38 on Binance. The altcoin is trading sideways close to the $2,100 level, after yielding nearly 5% weekly losses for holders."

        "content": "Cronos Labs, the web3 start-up accelerator behind the Cronos ecosystem, has launched a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) testnet blockchain network on top of the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared with CryptoPotato, the Cronos zkEVM Chain testnet is launched in an alliance between Cronos Labs, Matter Labs, engineering teams from digital asset exchange Crypto.com, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms VVS Finance, Veno Finance, and Fulcrom Finance.\n\nCronos Labs Launches zkEVM Chain Testnet\n\nThe Cronos zkEVM testnet is a hyperchain using the ZK Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (STARK) modular framework. As it is on top of the Sepolia faucet, the chain is secured by the Ethereum testnet from a final settlement and data availability standpoint.\n\nCronos Labs claims the new chain is the first public testnet utilizing the ZK Stack framework. As a hyperchain, the zkEVM testnet runs alongside a common settlement on the Ethereum mainnet. By 2024, the network will adopt a shared native bridge to the Ethereum mainnet, enabling users to send tokens and messages while enjoying the latter\u2019s security.\n\nKen Timsit, Managing Director of Cronos Labs, said: \u201cThe Cronos zkEVM testnet represents an opportunity for Cronos Labs and our partners, including VVS, Fulcrom, and Veno, to experiment with ZK layer 2 technology in order to prepare the next phase of growth starting in 2024. Other Cronos apps are warmly invited to join the testnet.\u201d\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM Testnet to Use TCRO\n\nThe new network uses a Boojum STARK-based ZK-proof system, which runs on general processing units (GPUs) while reducing fees. The zkEVM chain also uses TCRO, a testnet version of CRO, the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos ecosystem, to pay transaction fees. Cronos Labs said fee payments can be made in other cryptocurrencies due to the native account abstraction implemented at the protocol level.\n\n\u201cWhen we introduced the ZK Stack, we opened up the door for anyone wanting to build on top of Ethereum to do so by deploying hyperchains. Whether you\u2019re building a specialized Rollup or a general purpose one, hyperchains allow you to tap into Ethereum\u2019s extensive userbase base and liquidity while preserving its robust security and decentralization\u201d, said Marco Cora, senior vice president of business and operations at Matter Labs, the firm behind Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling solution zkSync.\n\nAs the latest sister chain in the Cronos network, the zkEVM testnet will ease the movement of liquidity between the ecosystem and Ethereum."

        "content": "In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged not only as one of the pioneers in blockchain technology but also as a contender in the narrative of being \u201cdigital gold\u201d; This article aims to show Ethereum\u2019s evolving role as a store of value, akin to the traditional perception of gold, and explores the factors shaping this narrative.\n\nSmart Contracts and Inherent Value:\n\nIts primary distinction from Bitcoin lies in its ability to execute smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded terms. While Bitcoin is often hailed as a store of value due to its scarcity, Ethereum\u2019s value proposition extends beyond scarcity to include programmability. Smart contracts add an extra layer of functionality and utility to Ethereum, potentially enhancing its intrinsic value.\n\nThe versatility provided by smart contracts enables Ethereum to be more than just a medium of exchange. It serves as a platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi), further contributing to its perceived value. Investors and enthusiasts view Ethereum not only as a digital asset but as a cornerstone of a decentralized ecosystem with myriad use cases.\n\nDecentralization and Security:\n\nSimilar to gold\u2019s historical appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature positions it as a potential hedge in the digital realm. The lack of dependence on a single central authority and the robust security of the Ethereum blockchain contribute to its reputation as a secure and resilient store of value.\n\nDecentralization aligns with the ethos of financial sovereignty, allowing individuals to have greater control over their assets. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized network enhances its credibility as a long-term store of value, appealing to those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems.\n\nChallenges and Considerations:\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s narrative as digital gold gains traction, challenges persist. Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, as part of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, aims to address scalability and environmental concerns. However, the success and timing of these upgrades play a crucial role in solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a store of value.\n\nMarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and competition within the cryptocurrency space are additional factors influencing Ethereum\u2019s narrative.\n\nAs the landscape evolves, Ethereum must navigate these variables to maintain and strengthen its status as a digital gold alternative.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s journey as a store of value, akin to digital gold, reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Its unique attributes, including smart contracts and decentralization, contribute to a narrative that extends beyond being a mere digital currency. As Ethereum continues to grow and adapt to emerging challenges, its role as a store of value is likely to remain a focal point in discussions surrounding the broader implications of blockchain technology and decentralized finance."

        "title": "Know the Best Cross-Chain Bridges With their Features - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The demand for blockchain is increasing because it enhances security and enables faster transactions. But this is not the only need for the community. Users also need interoperability within the chains. This is provided by cross-chain bridge services.\n\nMany blockchain platforms use different techniques to facilitate interoperability. The techniques include different consensus protocols, data storage, and execution environment. Examples of blockchain executing some of these techniques are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Solana which operates the exchange facilities\n\nWhat is Cross Chain Bridging?\n\nA cross-chain bridge helps in the transfer or exchange of information. This means the exchange of assets and information from one blockchain to another blockchain. Exchange around different blockchains is possible but it requires a high amount of fees and is also time-consuming.\n\nFor this exchange first, the cryptocurrency has to be changed into the fiat currency and the process also involves fees. After this, the user utilizes this currency into the desired cryptocurrency which is time taking.\n\nThe cross-chain bridges facilitate the exchange without the need for fiat currency. There is no requirement to change the cryptocurrency to the fiat currency. The transfer of one cryptocurrency to another is easily facilitated by cross-chain bridges which are fast, efficient, and secure. It also enables the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain to another.\n\nThere are several ways to enable transfers through a cross-chain bridge. One such way is through wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens encapsulated the value of one token inside another token.\n\nAnother approach is enabling the liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, the cross-chain bridge provider holds pools of various coins where one can be exchanged for another.\n\n6 Best Cross-Chain Bridge\n\nPortal Token Bridge: Portal Token Bridge is built on top of a wormhole protocol that enables transfers of both tokens and NFTs across the bridge across different chains. When the token is bridged between chains the original token is locked on a smart contract and a new wrapped token is minted on the target chain.\n\nThe supported blockchain networks are Acala, Akgorand, Aptos, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, Binance, Polygon, Terra, etc. The supported tokens are USD, Maker DAO, Shiba Inu, Axie Infinity, Sandbox, etc\n\nSynapsis Bridge: The Synapsis protocol provides secure cross-chain communication through its universal interoperability model. Synapsis Bridge allows users to swap on-chain assets across 15+ EVM and non-EVM blockchains safely and securely.\n\nThe supported blockchain networks are Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, etc. Some of the supported tokens are Synapse, Wrapped Bitcoin, USD Tether, etc.\n\nUmbria Narni Bridge: The Umbria Narni Bridge facilitates blockchain asset transfer through a unique world where assets are held across multiple chains. It is a liquidity provision protocol to lower the cost and speed up the cross-bridging.\n\nIt holds multiple assets on multiple chains together in the liquidity pool. The supported blockchains are Fantom, Cardano, Polygon Mainnet, Ethereum Mainnet, BNB Chain, Avalanche, KuCoin community chain, Huobi Eco Chain, etc. And, some of the supported cryptocurrency coins are Ethereum, Polygon, Tether, USD coin,\n\nWrapped token, etc.\n\nIt is different from other cross-chain bridges because it does not rely on validator smart contracts which slows down the bridging process. By removing the necessity of validation it can complete the cross-chain transaction with cheaper fees.\n\nMultichain: It is a router protocol that facilitates the flow of data and assets across different blockchain networks. No other cross-chain bridge supports the exchange of so many tokens as Multichain.

Moreover, all coins, including new altcoins, can be volatile and they are ultimately subject to the supply and demand forces of the market."

        "content": "Global football authority FIFA is pursuing a dual-blockchain strategy for its latest NFT drop commemorating the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar. The organization plans to leverage both Polygon and its existing partner Algorand to maximize reach.\n\nKeypoints\n\nFIFA is launching a collection of 1000 NFTs to commemorate the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, with 100 rare NFTs on Algorand and 900 on Polygon\n\nThe NFT drop is part of FIFA\u2019s efforts to expand its presence in web3 while serving its existing community on Algorand\n\nThe rare Algorand NFTs will offer holders the chance to win tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Finals\n\nPolygon was chosen to reach a wider audience on Ethereum, but FIFA stated it remains committed to Algorand as well\n\nBoth Algorand (ALGO) and Polygon (MATIC) have seen falling prices over the last 24 hours amid a broader crypto market downturn\n\nOn December 15th, FIFA will drop 100 \u201crare collectible\u201d NFTs on Algorand\u2019s FIFA+ Collect platform, its dedicated NFT marketplace launched earlier this year. These rare pieces will provide holders the opportunity to win tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Finals, creating immense demand.\n\nThe remaining 900 NFTs from the collection will drop on Polygon four days later via OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace on Ethereum. These will provide digital memorabilia for collectors without the same level of exclusivity. By tapping Polygon, FIFA hopes to bring its NFTs to a wider audience familiar with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nWe want to ensure that everyone clearly understood yesterday's announcement???? Two new drops were announced \u270c\ufe0f\n\n1\u20e3st drop????Dec 15th, 2023, via the FIFA+ Connect platform on the Algorand network \u2013 100 Collectibles\n\n&\n\n2\u20e3nd drop???? Dec 19th, 2023, via OpenSea on the Polygon network \u2014 FIFAPlusCollect (@FIFAPlusCollect) December 12, 2023\n\nFIFA said the dual-chain approach aligns with its focus on serving users first and foremost. A spokesman stated the organization \u201cremains vigilant on the progress of the existing chains and community\u201d in determining its technology partnerships. For now, Algorand still plays a pivotal role.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of falling prices for both Algorand (ALGO) and Polygon (MATIC) amid a crypto market downturn. ALGO has shed 7.2% in the last 24 hours while MATIC is down 3.8%. However, both cryptocurrencies remain up substantially over the last six months having ridden recent waves in the market.\n\nAs the Web3 and NFT space matures, expect more traditional brands and entities like FIFA to leverage a multi-chain strategy. This provides the flexibility to engage with users across ecosystems while staying true to early-adopter communities on networks like Algorand. Although speculative, blockchain interoperability may one day render these complex decisions obsolete."
