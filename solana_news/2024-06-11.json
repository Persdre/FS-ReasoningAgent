        "title": "Could Telegram-Associated TON Blockchain Be the 'Next Solana' and Challenge Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "While lagging behind Solana, TON\u2019s daily active addresses have exceeded Ethereum\u2019s figures every day except for one thus far in June. Some believe TON could close the distance in market cap with Solana.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, making its market cap stand at $18 billion.\n\nThe Open Network (TON) Blockchain is showing signs it may be the next Solana by virtue of challenging the historical smart contract leader, Ethereum.\n\nDriven by Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet built into every app and the rampant play of mini-games, the TON blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in daily active addresses every day in June except one, a sign of growing popularity for the network connected to Telegram, the popular messaging application with more than 900 million monthly active users.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Artemis, TON has averaged 465,200 daily active addresses in June with a high of 568,300 on June 3, levels Ethereum has not crossed as the latter has yet to see more than 400,000 daily active addresses on its base layer in the month, excluding its various layer 2s.\n\n\u201cFor early ecosystems such as TON, we believe [daily active users] is a better metric to watch than [total value locked] or fees, as gathering users is a higher priority than making money,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at liquid venture firm Decentral Park Capital, in her weekly newsletter published on May 20.\n\nDespite having higher levels of daily active addresses than Ethereum, TON\u2019s growing figures still dwindle in comparison to Solana\u2019s which has averaged roughly 1.64 million daily active addresses in June.\n\n\u201cTON is good for the blockchain industry as data shows it\u2019s adding net new activity,\u201d wrote Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at Artemis, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cDaily active addresses on both Solana and TON have increased over the course of the year, indicating TON is onboarding new addresses.\u201d\n\nTON\u2019s Opt-Out Wallet Launches With Massive User Base\n\nTelegram\u2019s built-in community aided by its in-app crypto wallet has helped propel TON\u2019s level of daily active addresses to where it is currently, argued Jehan Chu, an investor in the TON ecosystem and managing partner of blockchain venture capital firm Kenetic.\n\nThe native crypto wallet in Telegram is \u201can opt-out wallet, which means other than the 30 or 40 million US users who are geoblocked, the other 860 million Telegram users all have a crypto wallet natively [and] automatically,\u201d Chu said in a conversation with Unchained. \u201cLet that sink in\u2026 That is Thanos-level kind of change.\u201d\n\nTelegram has been able to scale its technology as well as the onboarding of its large user base through the official rollout of Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet, launched in Sept. 2023. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s not really about wallets. It\u2019s about the seamless integration of web3 technology into where users already are,\u201d namely messaging, \u201cone of the highest traffic destinations for users on a daily basis,\u201d said Chu.\n\n\u201c99.999% of blockchain projects are a tech idea trying to create a community \u2013 from nothing. According to CoinMarketCap there are more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a hard road for most,\u201d wrote Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto-focused venture firm Pantera, in the company\u2019s May announcement about how TON was its largest investment ever. \u201cTelegram is a community [of over 900 million users] integrating blockchain technology. That\u2019s just got to be easier.\u201d\n\nPantera, which has $4.7 billion in assets under management, cited other reasons in its rationale for investing in TON, including its values as a neutral platform independent of state influence and easy onboarding process.\n\nGames Drive Record Levels of Activity\n\nWhat has driven the recent surge in activity is another factor that led Pantera to its massive investment: an ecosystem of mini-applications which include chatbots and games. Referring to Telegram\u2019s increased levels of daily active addresses, Chu said it arose from \u201ca combination of things \u2013 obviously, games are a big driver.\u201d A number of mini-games within Telegram have attracted substantial attention from its users, such as Notcoin, Hamster Kombat, and Catizen.\n\nNotcoin, a free game on Telegram where over 35 million users have tapped their screens to earn tokens, rolled out its cryptocurrency in May and has since garnered a market cap of $1.6 billion, data from CoinGecko shows. Similarly, Hamster Kombat has nearly 33.6 million subscribers in its Telegram channel, while Catizen has over 3.6 million users.\n\nBloomberg also reported on Tuesday that many in the crypto space believe this trend of mini-games in Telegram \u201ccould be the \u2018killer app\u2019 that will define the current bull market.\u201d\n\nWhile they don\u2019t interact with the TON blockchain, popular trading bots such as BONKbot native to Solana and Banana Gun, which is on Ethereum, depend on Telegram to generate fees from enabling crypto users to trade on their mobile devices. Telegram also has trading bots for the TON blockchain, such as sTONks and TOB Bot.\n\n\u201cWe believe that similar TON-native Telegram bots will become the preferred user experience for many traders,\u201d according to Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, bringing its market cap to $18 billion. Despite outpacing the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, BTC and ETH, TON\u2019s price performance this last year is not as strong as Solana\u2019s, whose native token soared 860% in the same period to a market cap of more than $68 billion.\n\nAccording to Decentral Park Capital\u2019s Ye, TON has solid potential \u201cto close the gap in market cap with Solana this cycle.\u201d\n\nCorrection (June 13, 2024 11:14 A.M. EST): The previous title erroneously referred to TON Blockchain as belonging to Telegram. Following the SEC\u2019s ruling, Telegram has no relationship with The Open Network (TON) Blockchain, which is now stewarded by the TON Foundation. Unchained regrets the mistake."

        "content": "Currently available on testnet, Blobstream is expected to be deployed on L2s following audits and Celestia's upcoming launch.\n\nShare this article\n\nModular blockchain network Celestia has launched its data availability solution, Blobstream, on the Ethereum mainnet, according to the team\u2019s announcement on Monday.\n\nBlobstream \ud83c\udf87 is now live on Ethereum mainnet. Deploy a high-throughput L2 as *permissionlessly* as a smart contract. pic.twitter.com/74wyw5Xknq \u2014 Celestia (@CelestiaOrg) June 10, 2024\n\nDeveloped by Succinct Labs, Blobstream enables Celestia\u2019s data roots to be streamed to an Ethereum light client on-chain. The solution offers high-throughput data availability (DA) for Ethereum layer 2 solutions (L2s), secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees.\n\n\u201cThis provides permissionless, high-throughput DA to Ethereum L2s, secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees rather than reputation or hidden trust assumptions,\u201d stated Celestia.\n\nPreviously, Ethereum developers faced throughput limitations, prompting them to move to alternative layer 1 networks or rely on centralized services for DA.\n\nBlobstream allows developers to continue their work within the Ethereum ecosystem. Builders can create customizable, high-throughput blockspace without the need for permissions or committees while ensuring security through cryptographic economic guarantees.\n\nApart from the launch, the Celestia team announced that Blobstream on the Ethereum mainnet is now accessible on Celestia\u2019s blockchain explorer Celenium.\n\nAccording to Celestia\u2019s blog announcement, Succinct Labs has introduced Blobstream X, a zero-knowledge (ZK) implementation that streamlines the verification of Celestia validator signatures on-chain with a single ZK proof. This reduces validator overhead, simplifies the Celestia protocol, and accelerates the streaming of data root commitments for Ethereum L2s.\n\nAs noted, both Blobstream and its ZK implementation are currently available on testnet. Following code audits and Celestia\u2019s upcoming launch, the community will be able to deploy Blobstream on Ethereum Mainnet and L2s to enhance streaming DA.\n\nPrior to this deployment, Celestia had already brought Blobstream to Arbitrum Orbit, Starknet, and Base, marking a continuous commitment to improving the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure."

        "title": "Ethereum Whales Activity Surges: Will ETH Break $4,000 or Drop Below $3,650? Analyst Insight - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has brought attention to a notable trend in the Ethereum market. Over the past three weeks, the number of Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH has surged by 3%. This increase indicates a significant spike in buying pressure among large-scale investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales.\u201d\n\nThis uptick in large holders could signal a positive outlook for Ethereum, as increased accumulation by whales often precedes significant price movements. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring these developments, anticipating potential impacts on the broader crypto market.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at $3,698.25, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12.20 billion and a market capitalization of $444.30 billion. Despite this bullish activity among major holders, the ETH price has slightly dropped 0.28% in the past 24 hours.\n\nWill Ethereum Break $4,000 or Drop Below $3,650?\n\nIn a recent analysis, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Patel outlined potential scenarios for Ethereum (ETH) price movements. Patel\u2019s insights delve into both bullish and bearish outcomes, providing a detailed forecast based on current trading patterns.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading within a bull flag or parallel channel pattern against the USDT. This setup typically indicates a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. Traders and investors are keenly observing these patterns to determine their next moves.\n\nAccording to Patel, a bearish scenario could unfold if ETH breaks below the crucial support level of $3,650. Should this happen, Ethereum might experience a significant drop towards $3,152. This level is noteworthy as it represents the last Fair Value Gap (FVG), a region where prices previously moved quickly, leaving little traded volume behind.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum manages to stay above the level of $3,152 support, then it turns into a bullish one. As Patel predicts, following this, ETH can rally up to $4,000 in the meantime. Go past that resistance, and a hugely bullish wave could knock Ether to $6,000-$7,000.\n\nCrypto Patel\u2019s analysis reiterates the importance of vigilance on important support and resistance levels in this existing trading scenario. Traders must remain alert and change their strategies according to these potential breakout points.\n\nRelated Reading | DOGE Enters Key Wyckoff Phase: Major Spike Predicted Amid Market Volatility"

In addition, the company expects to enhance support for DeFi applications, including AMM exchanges, by providing a reliable asset solution.\n\nThe announcement follows Ripple\u2019s recent acquisition of Standard Custody and the appointment of its CEO, Jack McDonald, as Senior Vice President overseeing the stablecoin division yesterday.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple has chosen Axelar\u2019s interoperability platform for its XRPL EVM sidechain, favoring its user-friendly approach over the previously considered XLS-38 bridge. The company said Axelar\u2019s integration with prominent projects and its security features were key factors in this decision.\n\n3/ We're migrating to @axelarnetwork for its robust security and efficiency in cross-chain transactions. \"Axelar is a battle-tested, production-ready bridge to bring XRP as a native currency to the XRPL EVM Sidechain.\u201d \u2014 @FerranPrat12, @Peersyst CEO. \u2014 RippleX (@RippleXDev) June 12, 2024\n\nDespite recent progress, RLUSD has faced regulatory roadblocks.

According to the SEC, the stablecoin is evidence that Ripple might keep doing things that violate securities laws."

Mistakes can cause significant financial losses.\n\nBecause of this, many Ethereum users choose to stake through a third party provider.\n\nStaking providers usually take a percentage of rewards \u2014 between 10% and 25% \u2014 in exchange for helping their users stake.\n\nAt the low end, Lido, Binance Staked ETH, and Mantle Staked ETH charge a 10% fee on staking rewards.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Wrapped Staked ETH sits on the high end, charging 25%.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s 15% Pooled Staking fee, Saint Olive says, falls somewhere in the middle.\n\n\u201cUsers care more about the rewards they actually receive, and how secure the solution is, rather than the provider fee itself,\u201d Saint Olive said.\n\nSecurity and convenience\n\nThe new offering may appeal to more casual crypto users because of its convenience.\n\nMetaMask users can start staking their Ether via the wallet\u2019s interface.\n\nHowever, MetaMask also gives users the option to stake through rival staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool \u2014 both of which offer lower staking fees \u2014 through the same interface.\n\nAs for security, Pooled Staking will use the same staking system used by Consensys Staking, the firm\u2019s enterprise-grade staking product.\n\nConsensys says it has received third-party security certifications for both Consensys Staking and MetaMask.\n\nConsensys Staking has 33,000 Ethereum validators with more than 1 million Ether staked, equivalent to 3.3% of all staked Ether, according to the Pooled Staking announcement.\n\nEven so, it says it has never had one of its validators get slashed.\n\nSlashing is when the Ethereum network takes Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish data when they are supposed to, or don\u2019t publish the correct data.\n\nIn November, Bitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, suffered a $200,000 loss after nearly 100 of its validators were slashed for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nIn October, 20 of Lido\u2019s validators were also slashed, costing the protocol $45,000.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "In the NFT market, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) took center stage with revenues exceeding $4.27 million. The Ethereum Name Service uses NFT technology in its decentralized URL method on the Ethereum blockchain, even though it isn\u2019t an NFT collection per se. Users may convert addresses on Ethereum into formats that are simple to read with this method. In essence, an ENS domain registration grants you a distinct NFT that is linked to the domain name of your choice, which you can then transfer or sell as with any other NFT.\n\nDiverse Range of Top Sellers\n\nFollowing closely behind ENS, the $PIZZA BRC-20 NFTs, hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain, secured the second position with $2.18 million in sales. Even though it topped the charts on Sunday with $7.12 million, sales of this collection fell. With $1.24 million in sales, Guild of Guardians Avatars on the Immutable network took third place.\n\nWith sales of $987,910, the Blast\u2019s Fantasy Top collection came in fourth place, and with $635,539 in sales, the Genesis Fanta Field collection on Solana made its debut in the top 10. With $583,411 in sales, the DMarket collection, a component of the Mythos network also left its impact, coming in sixth.\n\nWith $470,907 in sales, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a flagship NFT from Yuga Labs and the second-highest seller ever, finished the day in eighth place. The OKX NFT Creation series, based in Polygon, came in just behind, taking eighth place with $414,817 in sales. With sales of about $350,000 apiece, two more Polygon collections Matr1x Fire Weapon and TTAvatars rounded out the top 10.\n\nBlockchain Breakdown\n\nRegarding the blockchain, Ethereum, under the leadership of ENS, commanded the most daily sales amounting to $8.45 million, a notable rise over $4.51 million the day before. The daily sales volume on the Bitcoin blockchain was $4.11 million, a decrease from the $11.03 million that was reported on June 9. Sales on the Solana blockchain were $2.68 million, however transactions on the Polygon blockchain totaled $2.44 million, which was a greater volume. Immutable recorded $1.56 million in sales, while the Blast blockchain recorded $988,646 in sales.\n\nIn summary, ENS\u2019s surge in NFT sales, alongside a diverse range of collections and blockchain activity, underscores the growing prominence and dynamism of the NFT market."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices wavered Wednesday as investors parsed commentary from the Federal Reserve that provided new insight into the U.S. central bank\u2019s fight against inflation.\n\nPolicymakers\u2019 move to leave interest rates unchanged for an 11th consecutive month was a foregone conclusion, based on movements in Fed futures markets. At its most restrictive position in over 20 years, the Fed kept its benchmark borrowing rate at a range between 5.25% and 5.50%.\n\nThis month\u2019s release of a so-called \u201cdot plot,\u201d however, suggested shot callers at the U.S. central bank have seen a notable shift in financial conditions since March. The Fed in its most recent Summary of Economic Projections had penciled in three rate cuts through years-end.\n\nThe dot plot released Wednesday suggested Fed policymakers now think one rate cut could be more appropriate\u2014interpreted by the market as a hawkish sign. The projection went beyond the two rate cuts that economists had expected the Fed could telegraph, as it looks to keep rates higher for longer in the face of a strong economy and U.S. labor market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency prices had risen earlier in the day on news that inflation had slowed to 3.3% in the 12 months through May. The report indicated that consumer prices for American goods and services rose slightly less last month than economists had expected.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s announcement, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell. Just 15 minutes after the Fed\u2019s move, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price swiftly fell 1.2% to around $69,000 from $69,900. Meanwhile, the prices of Ethereum and Solana also ticked down at similar rates.\n\nThe Fed has maintained in recent months that it will not cut rates until it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that stance on Wednesday and said, \u201cSo far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,\u201d Powell added in a statement. \u201cIn recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s policy meeting, futures traders penciled in a 61% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, likely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing rates. That figure fell to 59% following the release of Powell\u2019s written remarks.\n\nNot long before U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed began lifting interest rates from near-zero to cool a red-hot economy. While inflation has come down significantly since then, Powell affirmed Wednesday that the U.S. central bank\u2019s quest to 2% isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nPowell pointed to Wednesday\u2019s Consumer Price Index report, where inflation was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, as a sign of potential progress. \u201cLet me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals,\u201d Powell added, of which one is \u201cmaximum employment\u201d among U.S. workers.\n\nThe price of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, typically face pressure as interest rates rise and the payouts on holding cash and U.S. Treasuries become more attractive. Investors anticipate the opposite would happen as the Fed loosens U.S. monetary conditions.\n\n\u201cWe can't know what the future holds, but in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance,\u201d Powell said, adding that the Fed is looking for a gradual decline in inflation and greater balance in the labor market. \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress here.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add a further quote from Powell.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies popped Wednesday after a widely watched inflation gauge showed that U.S. consumer prices increased last month by less than economists had expected.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.3% in the 12 months through May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists\u2019 forecast of 3.4%. Previously, the index tracking American goods and services showed that consumer prices rose 3.4% annually.\n\nImmediately following the report\u2019s release, Bitcoin jumped 2.8% to around $69,500 from $67,900. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana, showed gains of over 3% over the past day, but their prices had still fallen over the past week after Friday\u2019s flash crash.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened in the green. The move came just hours before the Federal Reserve\u2019s June policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for an 11th straight month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Fed\u2019s decision loomed, Bitcoin is nearing a price of $70,000 as of this writing, showing gains of over 4% over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, U.S. inflation was flat. The reading followed a 0.3% bump in consumer prices in April and a 0.4% increase in March and February.\n\nWhile investors had already anticipated that Fed policymakers would leave interest rates untouched Wednesday, rate cut hopes for September strengthened, however. That chance rose after the report\u2019s release to 62% from 46%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\n\nLikely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing costs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that policymakers need \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation is heading to its target of 2% annually before loosening monetary policy through rate cuts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShifting rate cut expectations dented Bitcoin\u2019s price in April, knocking the cryptocurrency away from all-time highs above $73,000 a month prior. However, analysts say Bitcoin could test those prices again as a path toward rate cuts emerges with more certainty and a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cAt this point, my confidence in Fed rate cuts is pretty high,\u201d Grayscale's Head of Research Zach Pandl said on Twitter (aka X), adding that rate cuts becoming a base case again is good for the strength of Bitcoin relative to the dollar in a separate post.\n\nLow Core CPI inflation in May => Fed rate cuts again the base case => bad for Dollar, good for Bitcoin $BTC pic.twitter.com/2Ntlfl3iJs \u2014 Zach Pandl (@LowBeta_) June 12, 2024\n\nMarkets largely shrugged at hotter-than-expected U.S. job growth last Friday. Still, hours after the figures were released, Bitcoin plunged alongside the rest of the crypto market, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of liquidations in leveraged crypto positions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the dollar value of liquidated positions was comparatively muted. Within the past four hours, $10 million worth of crypto long positions have been purged, while bearish traders saw $39 million worth of short positions be closed, per data from CoinGlass.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "U.Today - Although was beginning to gain traction on the market, the severe and ongoing consolidation that produced virtually nothing and only pulled ETH at about $3,800 was an important signal pointing to the asset's potential future performance.\n\nDespite its early strong momentum, the price action of ETH has surprised a lot of traders. After hitting resistance at about $3,800, Ethereum entered a consolidation phase. The current decline that we have observed, which is frequently an indication of market indecision, was foreseen in this instance by sideways movement. Over the past few days, Ethereum's price has dropped significantly, approaching $3,500.\n\nThe market had been feeling bullish overall, so many people were surprised by this sudden decline. There are several possible reasons for this unforeseen behavior. Initial liquidity issues could be crucial. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment are always important. Ethereum's performance may have been impacted by recent global financial trends, regulatory news or even bigger sell-offs on the market. It is also critical to keep in mind that fluctuations in (such as the decline below $70,000) frequently have an impact on the entire cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum.\n\nTechnical indicators show that there was a significant sell-off of ETH in a short period of time. Reentry by buyers onto the market may indicate potential for expansion. Moving averages also show another concerning pattern: the shorter-term MAs crossing below the longer-term MAs, which is typically a bearish signal. Despite the recent downturn, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong.\n\nBitcoin is struggling\n\nBitcoin is struggling to cross the $70,000 threshold for a number of reasons. The significant lack of purchasing power is one of the main causes. Bitcoin's price previously reached all-time highs due to significant capital inflows.\n\nA decreasing number of new purchasers are nevertheless willing to make these high-level investments, according to the state of the market. The lack of buying interest is making it difficult for Bitcoin to surpass the psychological $70,000 barrier.\n\nThe change in institutional behavior is another important component. Institutions are now shifting money away from Bitcoin ETFs despite the fact that they were crucial to Bitcoin's earlier rallies. This change is partially the result of people looking for better returns in alternative asset classes or new developments in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe potential price of Bitcoin is weakened by diminished institutional support because a significant portion of the buying pressure that raised prices came from these large-scale investors.\n\nFurthermore, strong fundamental drivers that have historically sparked enormous bull runs are absent from Bitcoin at the moment. While the NFT craze played a similar role in 2021, the ICO boom in 2017 propelled Bitcoin to previously-unheard-of heights. There is currently no trend or invention like this propelling investor capital and enthusiasm toward Bitcoin on a large scale.\n\nThe struggles of Bitcoin are also reflected in technical indicators. It appears that neither overbought nor oversold conditions exist as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been circling around neutral. This neutral RSI adds to the general sense of indecisiveness and uncertainty on the market, further impeding any meaningful price movement.\n\nin trouble\n\nXRP's current state is really problematic. The asset has lost numerous key support levels like the 50 EMA, psychological levels at $0.5 and others. Such performance certainly puts XRP down on the list of better-performing assets. However, the only question now is: will it reach the yearly low of $0.44?\n\nXRP has been steadily losing value over the last few weeks as it has been in a downtrend. The first real red flag appeared when the 50-day EMA disappeared. After that, XRP dropped below both the critical psychological support level of $0.5, which is represented by the orange line on the 100-day EMA, further deteriorating its technical outlook.\n\nThe annual low of $0.44 is the next significant support level for XRP. The likelihood of reaching this level appears to be growing given the state of the market and technical indicators. There is a long-term bearish trend indicated by the 200-day EMA, which is still significantly above the current price.\n\nThe absence of significant purchasing power is one of the primary causes of XRP's downfall. The asset finds it difficult to hold onto its value, much less increase it in the absence of substantial buy-side interest. Due to investor caution brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties, the overall market conditions for cryptocurrencies are currently not very favorable.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMetaMask, a leading Ethereum wallet and browser extension, has launched its pooled staking service, allowing users to stake any amount of ETH.\n\nEthereum staking is the mechanism by which validators on the proof of stake network participate in consensus, or the verification of transactions before they're added to the blockchain. If their nodes process blocks of transactions that are online and process blocks when assigned, they collect rewards. And if they don't, they can see their staked ETH slashed as a penalty.\n\nBut users need 32 ETH to become a validator\u2014a criteria that 99% of holders fall short of, MetaMask said in its press release.\n\nThe pooled staking will allow MetaMask users to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards for contributing to the network's security. The service is currently available to a small group of users, with a broader rollout expected soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, it will not initially be available in the United States or United Kingdom.\n\nThe crackdown on staking services in the U.S. has been severe. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Kraken $30 million in a settlement over charges that its crypto staking service constituted an unregistered offering of securities. Coinbase saw its staking service curtailed after the SEC made similar allegations against the San Francisco-based crypto exchange.\n\nIn the U.K., things are a bit less dire\u2014but still unclear.\n\nEconomic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami promised in Feburary this year that staking and stablecoin rules would be read in six months. When asked about progress during a Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit, he said he's still confident the rules will be implemented.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"What I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins,\" Afolami said during the London event. \"Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSome members of the Ethereum community have seen the regulatory pressure or lack of clarity as an opportunity to further decentralize the network. As it stands, the U.S. accounts for 50% of all validator nodes on the network, followed by Germany with 12%, South Korea with 6%, and the UK with 4%, according to Etherscan.\n\nMatthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at Consensys\u2014the company behind Metamask\u2014emphasized the simplicity and control offered by the new service. \u201cMetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards, and making Ethereum more secure,\u201d he said.\n\nMetaMask's pooled staking is backed by Consensys Staking, which manages over 33,000 Ethereum validators and more than 1 million ETH staked. The company boasted in its press release that its has zero slashed validators and a 99.9% validator participation rate.\n\nMetaMask's move into pooled staking pits it against established players like Lido and Coinbase, which does still offer its staking service internationally and in several U.S. states. Together the two providers account for almost 45% of the 33 million ETH\u2014worth $116 billion at the time of writing\u2014that's been staked on the network.\n\nLido, the largest liquid staking platform, allows users to stake ETH and receive Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH) tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning an annual percentage yield (APY) around 3.8%. The project's extensive liquidity and integration with numerous dApps make it a formidable competitor.\n\nMeanwhile Coinbase, though it has had to cut back on its staking service availability, is still the second-largest pooled staking provider by a wide margin. Its 15% portion is three times the size of the next couple competitors Figment, Ether.fi, and Kiln.fi."

        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysts are offering a variety of predictions for Bitcoin's future price movements, reflecting a range of optimism influenced by upcoming events and historical trends. However, the broader cryptocurrency market indicates a burgeoning altcoin season, where altcoins, particularly those involved in AI and decentralized finance (DeFi) like BlockDAG Network and Ethereum, might outshine Bitcoin in the short and longer term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin Trend to $100,000\n\n\n\nOne of the most influential factors in Bitcoin price predictions is the recent Bitcoin halving event, occurred in April 2024. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half, effectively reducing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been followed by significant price increases. For example, post-halving price surges have been observed in past cycles, leading some analysts to forecast that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs of $100,000 now two months after the 2024 event.\n\nDan Tapiero, a prominent crypto analyst, predicts that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by late 2024 or early 2025. Tapiero cites the halving event and the increasing adoption of blockchain technologies by both countries and companies as key factors driving this potential rise. Similarly, Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered Bank also believes Bitcoin could test the $100,000 mark next year, driven by banking sector turmoil, the halving event, and the end of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.\n\nBeyond these optimistic forecasts, other analysts provide a more nuanced view. For instance, projections for Bitcoin's 2024 price range from a low of around $27,341 to a high of $118,102, reflecting the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility. This wide range highlights the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin's market behavior, influenced by various macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and shifts in investor sentiment.\n\nLooking further ahead, some predictions are even more bullish. By 2030, Bitcoin's price is anticipated to reach between $149,316 and $265,318, suggesting a potential increase of over 850% from its current levels. These long-term projections are often based on the assumption that institutional interest and mainstream adoption will continue to grow like it has done since 2009, providing an even stronger foundation for Bitcoin's value appreciation.\n\nAltcoins: Ethereum and BlockDAG Network Lead\n\n\n\nAnalysts point out that while Bitcoin may reach new highs, it lacks the explosive potential of many altcoins in the current market environment. The altcoin market shows substantial upside potential, driven by innovations in AI and blockchain technology. For instance, AI-focused cryptos like Bittensor, Fetch.ai, and Openfabric AI are gaining traction due to their novel applications in decentralized machine learning and AI-driven tasks.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum continues to be a critical player, with expectations of significant growth due to its extensive use in DeFi and other blockchain applications. Analysts suggest that Ethereum, along with BlockDAG Network , which offer scalable and efficient blockchain solutions, could lead the next phase of blockchain adoption.\n\nEthereum is poised to lead the altcoin season in 2024, according to several analysts and market experts. This potential leadership is attributed to various factors, including technological upgrades, regulatory developments, and the overall momentum in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOne of the critical drivers for Ethereum's potential leadership is the upgrades to its network. The most notable of these is the EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) upgrade, which took place in March 2024 and aimed to significantly reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability. This improvement is benefiting Ethereum's layer 2 (L2) networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, making Ethereum more efficient and attractive for users and developers.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another catalyst for Ethereum's rise. ETFs make it easier for institutional investors to invest in Ethereum without dealing with the complexities of direct cryptocurrency transactions. The recent approval of Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong has already generated optimism in the market. There is also speculation about potential ETF approvals in the United States, which could further drive institutional adoption.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Historical Patterns\n\nHistorically, altcoin seasons follow significant events in the cryptocurrency market, such as Bitcoin halvings. Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and Josh Olszewicz highlight that Bitcoin's recent performance often precedes a shift in investment towards altcoins. They suggest that Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin recently indicates a potential for a significant catch-up, especially as technological and regulatory developments come to fruition.\n\nCrypto analyst Ash Crypto has pointed out that Ethereum's current price action resembles the bullish breakout observed in 2020. If Ethereum follows a similar trajectory, it could reach new all-time highs overcoming the $4,000 mark and can catalyze a broader altcoin rally, potentially leading to a substantial increase in altcoin valuations.\n\nAt the same time, BlockDAG Network represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology, aiming to address some of the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain systems. Utilizing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG combines enhanced transaction speeds and security with high decentralization, creating a robust framework for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto mining.\n\nBlockDAG has garnered significant attention and investment since its inception. It has raised substantial funds through its presale, highlighting strong investor confidence. For instance, the project has already raised over $50 million and is seeing daily inflows of $500,000 that has left analysts claiming it could lead the altcoin market together with Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs market dynamics evolve, it is essential to recognize the distinct opportunities presented by different projects within the cryptocurrency landscape. Bitcoin's potential rise to $100,000 reflects its status as a digital store of value, while the altcoin market, especially with projects like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network, promises higher returns driven by technological advancements and new use cases. This diversification highlights the importance of a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment, balancing between established assets like Bitcoin and emerging technologies within the altcoin space.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Biaoqing\n\nBeijing, China, June 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It\u2019s no longer rumour that Biaoqing coin is going to be listed on popular Exchange Bitmart: and other leading exchanges would be coming onboard soon.\n\nBiaoqing Launched on June 9th on the Ethereum blockchain, $BIAO has experienced remarkable price growth. In less than a day, its market cap soared from a few thousand dollars to more $6 million, capturing the attention of the crypto space.\n\nThe team has big plans for the Biaoqing project. They are already listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto data aggregator, and are marketing in every way possible: billboards in the busiest places around the world, trending on various platforms (X, Telegram, dextools, etc.), partnerships with crypto influencers and crypto hedge funds, and many other initiatives. They are also hosting regular Twitter Spaces to keep the community updated and plan to continue their efforts to market $BIAO internationally.\n\n$BIAO is a memecoin based on the biggest meme that ever existed in China and the eastern world in general: Biaoqing. Biaoqing features a series of facial expressions printed on the head of a panda. It is a real phenomenon in Asia, to the point that it's impossible not to have seen it in any of their group chats. The Biaoqing faces are used as frequently as Westerners use their emojis. Like many other famous memes before them, $BIAO aims to rally memecoin enthusiasts around a meme that has never been truly presented in the crypto sphere.\n\nBecause of its narrative of being the \"Pepe of China,\" $BIAO immediately showed a lot of potential. The numerous Biaoqing memes surrounding the project, as well as their qualitative branding, contributed to its viral potential. The Biaoqing faces are hilarious and have tremendous potential to capture the hearts of every meme lover.\n\nIt is important to note that, like every other successful memecoin before it, $BIAO has a lot of originality. Western memes are saturating the market, and we've seen almost all of them represented by a token. But Eastern memes are still absent from the memecoin space, leaving a big gap to be filled. With Biaoqing being the number one meme in China, this could start a new trend. All of this suggests that $BIAO will most likely have a bright future.\n\n$BIAO is available on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network, without transaction taxes. It will also be listed on centralized exchanges, which, considering their tremendous trading volume, should happen very soon.\n\nWith a strong team, hilarious memes, extensive connections, the true originality of being the biggest meme in Asia, and aggressive marketing, Biaoqing shows promise. However, potential investors should conduct their own research before investing. Trade safely!\n\nStory continues\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite: https://biaoqing.live/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/biaoerc20\n\nX(Twitter): https://x.com/biaoerc20\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "ICBC: the largest bank in the world bets on the crypto Ethereum (ETH) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "ICBC, the largest bank in the world, claims that the crypto Ethereum represents the driving technical force of the digital future, defining it as \u201cdigital oil\u201d. At the same time, it describes Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nAccording to the bank ICBC, the crypto Ethereum is \u2018the digital oil of the 21st century\u2019\n\nAs anticipated, the largest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is defining Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and Ethereum (ETH) as \u201cdigital oil\u201d.\n\nIn a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets at VanEck, the ICBC praises the two main criptovalute by market capitalization.\n\nThe report indicates that the market demand for digital assets is robust, driving innovation in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe market demand drives the continuous evolution of digital currencies.\u201d\n\nThe report compares Bitcoin to gold, highlighting that the cryptocurrency has additional advantages:\n\n\u201cBitcoin maintains scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while simultaneously solving issues related to its divisibility, authenticity, and transportability. Its monetary attributes are weakening, while its asset attributes are strengthening.\u201d\n\nDefining Ethereum as \u201cdigital oil,\u201d the report praises the various features of the ecosystem of the leading smart contract platform. Although ICBC highlights some shortcomings of the network, it believes that technological progress will resolve them over time.\n\n\u201cEthereum has consistently improved its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing a technical foundation for the digital future.\u201d\n\nSustainability, security, and efficiency\n\nFurthermore, the report reiterates how Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its unique programming language (Solidity) and the virtual machine (EVM).\n\nAllowing developers to create a wide range of smart contracts and complex applications, providing strong support to blockchain technology.\n\nNot surprisingly, says the report, its flexibility is widely recognized in the sectors of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and it is also expanding to physical infrastructure networks (DePin).\n\n\u201cIn essence, the Turing completeness of Ethereum allows it to execute any programming instruction with the necessary resources and correct instructions, but it also poses several practical challenges. Looking to the future, Ethereum developers will continue to work to balance sustainability, security, and efficiency.\u201d\n\nEthereum under pressure: bear forecasts dominate the market\n\nEthereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is going through a difficult period.\n\nIts price has indeed failed to surpass the threshold of 4,000 dollars, generating concern among traders and investors.\n\nTo better understand the current market dynamics, it is useful to observe the behavior of the participants in the futures market, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAn important indicator is the Taker Buy Sell ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers compared to sellers.\n\nA ratio greater than one indicates that buyers are more aggressive, while a ratio less than one shows greater aggressiveness on the part of sellers.\n\nExamining the 7-day moving average chart of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum, it is noted that the ratio, which has never exceeded one, has collapsed in recent days.\n\nThis indicates that the sellers have been more active in the futures market, continuing to sell short or to cash in the profits from the gains at the beginning of the year.\n\nA drop so marked in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio is not generally a positive sign for Ethereum. In fact, it indicates that the majority of futures traders are bear on Ethereum and expect a further price drop of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the macroeconomic context, several factors could reverse this trend. Good news, such as new partnerships, technological discoveries, or regulatory approvals, could restore investor confidence and drive up the price of Ether."

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) recently tagged Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u201cdigital oil.\u201d\n\nETH Supports Smart Contracts and DApps\n\nThe top financial institution commended the growth and advancement that both Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) has registered over the years. It compared BTC to gold, citing that it \u201cretains the scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus while solving [gold\u2019s] problem of being difficult to divide, difficult to identify authenticity, and inconvenient to carry.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nNext, ICBC named Ethereum as digital oil, citing its crucial role in serving as a strong support to numerous Web3.0 innovations including the launch of stablecoins.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been continuously upgrading its technology in terms of security, scalability and sustainability, providing technical power for the digital future. In addition, the introduction and development of stablecoins provide a bridge for the digital currency market to connect to the real world,\u201d ICBC highlighted.\n\nThe bank acknowledged the fact that Ethereum has its programming language known as Solidity but more importantly, ICBC highlighted how the network supports developers. Per the bank\u2019s published statement, ETH allows developers to deploy complex smart contracts as well as Decentralized Applications (DApps). ICBC believes strongly that this has made Ethereum the mainstay in inventive new fields like Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nFurthermore, the top China-based bank sees this sentiment transcending gradually to the physical infrastructure network.\n\nCommunity Awaits Final Approval For spot Ethereum ETF\n\nICBC\u2019s endorsement for the altcoin comes while the crypto industry is waiting for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve spot Ethereum ETF trading. The regulator has requested the submission of amended and updated S-1 registration from all Ethereum ETF applicants.\n\nLast week, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman hinted at the possibility of a slow process for the final spot Ethereum ETF trading approval. In his words, the approval of the necessary S-1 forms \u201cwill take some time.\u201d\n\nIt is worthy of note that after the submission of the S-1 applications, the Commission would provide filers with its first feedback which will in turn prompt more changes to be made.

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Whether Bitcoin Hits Another All-Time High or Not - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum and Solana are set to soar higher in 2024, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nAfter Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,750 in mid-March, crypto investors were understandably excited about where it could head next. The crypto seemed poised to skyrocket past the $100,000 level this year. But Bitcoin continues to trade right around the $70,000 mark, leaving some crypto investors searching for potential alternatives.\n\nIf you're one of those investors, there are two cryptocurrencies to put on your radar screen right now: Ethereum (ETH -0.14%) and Solana (SOL -0.11%). Both will potentially soar higher in 2024, whether or not Bitcoin goes along for the ride.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe big catalyst for Ethereum right now is the recent approval of eight new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They're set to start trading soon, and when they do, it could lead to a huge influx of new investor money into Ethereum.\n\nWhile this influx of money isn't likely to be anywhere close to the amount of money that flooded into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's nonetheless expected to be significant. For example, JPMorgan Chase predicts that the influx of new money into spot Ethereum ETFs could be as high as $3 billion over the next six months. And K33 Research, an independent crypto research firm, thinks the number could be as high as $4 billion.\n\nThe thought of so much new money flowing into Ethereum, which is already up 70% for the year, has some investors giddy. For example, some think Ethereum might outperform Bitcoin over the next six months, simply due to the potential impact of the ETF boom. When you add in the fact that Ethereum continues to roll out new tech upgrades to its core blockchain, there's growing cause for optimism.\n\nSolana\n\nLike Ethereum, Solana is up 70% for the year. This comes on the back of a monster year in 2023 when it skyrocketed more than 900%. While Solana's upward trajectory has cooled somewhat of late, there's still potential for an enormous move upward in the second half of the year.\n\nOnce you take a quick look at Solana's core metrics, you'll understand why. Just about every key metric has experienced tremendous growth over the past 12 months. The number of users is way up, transaction activity is way up, and the size of the Solana blockchain ecosystem continues to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\nIn no small part, this has to do with soaring consumer adoption. Solana has become the go-to blockchain for buying, selling, and launching meme coins. Even big-time celebrities (well, OK, B-list and C-list celebrities) are getting in on the action, with rappers, reality stars, and musicians launching meme coins of their own on Solana. Since these celebrities have millions of followers on social media, it's possible to argue that Solana is getting a free marketing blitz directed at its core user demographic (young, tech-savvy, and with plenty of disposable income to spend on crypto).\n\nThe good news is that all of this is uncorrelated with what's happening on the Bitcoin blockchain, so Solana can soar higher, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nThe Layer 1 investment thesis\n\nEthereum and Solana share one key trait in common: They're both Layer 1 blockchains. This means that they're the fundamental building blocks of the blockchain world. When it comes to any key blockchain niche -- such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, or decentralized Web3 applications -- the core starting point is always the Layer 1.\n\nThat's what has me excited about Ethereum and Solana as potential Bitcoin alternatives. If you buy into the general notion that a crypto bull market rally should help to inject new life into every single niche of the blockchain and crypto world, then Ethereum and Solana should be among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats, and Ethereum and Solana are two of the biggest boats out there. Even if you're on the sidelines about Bitcoin, it might be time to take a closer look at Ethereum or Solana."

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nCryptocurrencies are going through a tumultuous period, marked by a significant drop in prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two main cryptos, are particularly affected. This decline raises questions about the future of the market and the forces at play. Let\u2019s analyze this situation in detail.\n\nSelling Pressure: A Threat to Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, often perceived as a safe haven in the crypto sphere, is not immune to market fluctuations. The crucial support level to watch on the daily chart is $66,205. This threshold coincides with a major resistance line.\n\nA close below this level could intensify selling pressure, leading to a further drop in price.\n\nConversely, the most important resistance level for Bitcoin is $69,667. Recently, this level has generated strong resistance pressure, preventing the price from rising.\n\nA daily close above this threshold could rekindle the hope of an uptrend. However, investors need to stay cautious, as market movements are often unpredictable.\n\nIf the flagship crypto closes below $66,205, selling pressure could accelerate. This situation could push the price to new lows, further eroding investor confidence.\n\nIncreased market volatility heightens risks, making predictions difficult. Traders should therefore closely monitor these critical levels.\n\nEthereum: Between Consolidation and Selling Pressure\n\nEthereum, the second largest crypto, is also under significant pressure. On the daily chart, a consolidation has emerged after breaking out of a triangle pattern.\n\nThis consolidation is often a sign of stability, but the current selling pressure has broken the key support level.\n\nFor the ETH crypto, the most important support level is $3,502. A daily close below this level could trigger an increase in selling pressure, nullifying recent optimistic gains linked to ETFs. This situation would be concerning for investors who hoped for a sustainable rebound.\n\nThe key resistance level for this crypto is the 9 EMA average of $3,689. A daily close above this level could give a boost to the price, paving the way for a recovery. However, the market remains fragile, and investors need to stay vigilant against unpredictable fluctuations.\n\nIn the coming days, Ethereum\u2019s behavior around support and resistance levels will determine its trajectory.\n\nInvestors need to be ready to react quickly to market moves to minimize losses and maximize potential gains. Patience and caution are essential in this uncertain period.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors: A Determining Influence\n\nThe price fluctuations of Bitcoin and the ETH crypto cannot be fully understood without examining macroeconomic factors. The global economic situation plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency movements.\n\nEconomic reports, such as employment data in the United States, have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFor example, a recent report revealed stronger-than-expected job growth in May, contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s decline. This data influences investors\u2019 decisions and trading strategies.\n\nDecisions by central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, also affect cryptocurrencies. For example, lower interest rates can make risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. However, uncertainties around future central bank decisions add a layer of complexity to market analysis.\n\nOverall investor sentiment also plays a role. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to massive sell-offs, while excessive optimism can lead to impulsive buying.\n\nInvestors need to stay informed and vigilant, adopting a proactive approach to managing risks. Caution is essential in this uncertain landscape. The future of cryptos remains promising, but the road is fraught with challenges. Indeed, the risk of liquidation persists around 71k.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter a rise of more than 20%, Ethereum\u2019s price is undergoing a bearish correction. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Situation\n\nAfter rising from $3,000 to $3,800 following the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price stabilized before facing bearish pressure, bringing it down to $3,500. This decline was fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s slight drop, which pulled the entire cryptocurrency market with it. Currently, the cryptocurrency seems to be stabilizing, demonstrating renewed interest from buyers. At the time of writing this article, one Ether is worth slightly more than $3,500. Thus, it is below the $3,800 mark, which corresponds to the point of control noted since its last rebound.\n\n\n\nThe point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest trading volume over a given period, indicating a key support or resistance zone.\n\nThe next value area to consider is just below the Ethereum price level, specifically below the $3,000 mark. This area coincides with the identified support zone at the same price level.\n\nEthereum remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, continuing to confirm the idea that the cryptocurrency is in an uptrend. However, it should be noted that Ethereum\u2019s momentum is being revised downwards, as evidenced by the oscillators and Ethereum\u2019s own price.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, he is a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of self-employed traders active since 2017. You\u2019ll find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around the financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nA Closer Look at Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest of perpetual contracts linked to Ethereum has recently followed the course of its underlying asset. Coupled with a still-positive funding rate, this demonstrates majority participation from buyers in Ethereum derivatives. However, it should be noted that, although positive, these rates have been slightly revised downwards, reflecting a slight capitulation from buyers. This phenomenon could be explained by increasing selling pressure, but also by liquidations, particularly marked on the buyers\u2019 side.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USD\n\nThe liquidation heatmap of ETH/USDT over three months reveals that the liquidation zone at $3,700 was recently reached. It seems to have triggered buying interest that was not sustained, allowing the bearish movement to continue. Currently, the most significant liquidation zones are on both sides of the current price. Above, we can note the $3,900 zone. Below, we can note the $3,000 zone. The price approaching these levels could trigger a massive number of orders, thus increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones therefore represent a crucial point of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price remains above $3,300, we could anticipate a bullish recovery up to $3,900 or even $4,000. The next resistance to consider would then be $4,100. If the upward movement continues, this could mark a new high at $4,500 and even reach Ethereum\u2019s ATH, just below $4,900. At this stage, it would represent a rise of more than 37%.\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price fails to stay above $3,300, we could envisage a return to around $3,000. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be in a price range between $2,800 and $2,700. At this stage, it would represent a decrease of around -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter an initial rise followed by stabilization, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced bearish pressure, partly due to a decline in the overall cryptocurrency market. Currently, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilization with renewed interest from buyers. Although these fluctuations cast doubt on Ethereum\u2019s future direction, its underlying trend remains bullish, favoring the idea of a potential rebound. However, it will be crucial to closely monitor the price\u2019s reaction to the different key levels to confirm or invalidate current hypotheses. It is also important to stay vigilant against potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let\u2019s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "ETH/BTC Price Prediction: Can Ethereum Price Pump Ahead Of FOMC? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price broke out downward from a consolidation zone, invalidating the previous bullish flag. Meanwhile, the markets eagerly await the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday to know whether interest rates will get cut or spike higher.\n\nThe price of Ethereum was $3,448 during American trading hours on Tuesday, a 6% drop in the last 24 hours and a further 9.7% decrease in 7 days, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH/USD Price Prediction: Bears Take Hold of the Market, These Are the Support Levels to Watch\n\nETH price was previously trending in a consolidation zone, part of a larger bull flag market structure. Bull flags are bullish, and the markets expected the pattern to resolve upwards. However, the Ethereum price experienced great downward pressure in the early morning hours of June 11.\n\nThe price of Ethereum broke below the range, invalidating the bull flag on the 4-hour timeframe. Nevertheless, on the daily timeframe, ETH price action is still trending above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), albeit very close.\n\nIf bears persist, ETH price may drop further and find support at the 50-day SMA, which also coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. This will put the price of ETH around $3,400. Further below, key support areas exist around $3,200 and $2,900.\n\nOn the flip side, if the bulls overpower the bears, the ETH price may rally and test the lower boundary of the range around $3,650. If ETH continues to rise, it may re-enter the range and move sideways between $3,700 and $3,950 before breaking to the upside and heading towards $4,200. Currently, $3,650 is the strongest resistance level for Ethereum price action.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum Price Crashing?\n\nThe drop in Ethereum price comes a day ahead of the FOMC meeting and also coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price. The crypto community thinks that the recent market panic is connected to the FOMC outcome.\n\nThe panic is of FOMC and PPI outcome coming on wed and thurs. My guess is we will pump back strong after FOMC and PPI numbers\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f#Bitcoin #altcoins \u2014 \u20bf SatMaxx \u20bf (@vinee202) June 11, 2024\n\nMarket analysts from Bankrate forecast that the FOMC will leave interest rates at a 23-year high in the upcoming meeting. However, they also estimate that there will be three or fewer rate cuts before the end of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum fundamentals remain strong, as the mainnet continues to dominate in fees over Layer 2s, generating 20X more fees than the top L2s combined.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors remain alert for Wednesday and Thursday since FOMC and PPI data may influence the next direction of Ethereum price and the general markets. Ethereum\u2019s positive fundamentals may help sustain the price if FOMC results and comments turn out negative for the markets\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Ethereum Struggling With MEV Bots, Executive Argues That Solana Has Succeeded - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Unlike Bitcoin, where transactions are ordered on a first-come, first-served basis, Ethereum and Solana rely on a pool of validators to confirm transactions and add them to the next block. This process allows for flexibility, as users can expedite their transactions by paying higher fees.\n\nAt the protocol level, prioritizing transactions based on gas fees has inadvertently led to the rise of complex Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots on Solana and Ethereum. By exploiting the system, these bots have become a significant factor in the ongoing debate about gas fees.\n\nMEV Bots Pushing Gas Fees Higher On Ethereum?\n\nNow, the debate surrounding validators, gas fees, and the impact of MEV bots on Solana and Ethereum is escalating. Mert Mumtaz, the co-founder of Solana RPC provider Helius, taking to X, highlighted the role of a single sandwich bot, Jaredfromsubway, which was the top source of gas fees on Ethereum.\n\nThis bot alone is responsible for a staggering 142 ETH per day, surpassing fees paid by major players like Coinbase.\n\nWith this MEV bot being the highest source of gas fees on Ethereum, the co-founder argues that by not subsidizing validators, the Ethereum Foundation is indirectly endorsing MEV bot operators to continue \u201crobbing\u201d retail traders.\n\nAs it is, Ethereum, notorious for its scalability issues, is the most expensive network to transact on. Though on-chain scaling is a concern, the proliferation of MEV bots as seen with Jaredfromsubway, could be contributing immensely.\n\nIs Solana Doing A Better Job At Addressing MEV Bots?\n\nIn light of this, the analyst points out that Ethereum developers have failed to address the MEV menace despite years of dedicated research and solutions at various protocol levels.\n\nBecause of this persistent problem and coordinated and extensive research that continues to fail in Ethereum, the analyst thinks Solana is doing much better in handling the impact of MEV bots on gas fees.\n\nSolana currently and actively subsides most of its validators. The subsidy, absent in Ethereum, penalizes operators engaging in MEV operations, discouraging the behavior. Nonetheless, it is crucial to know that the subsidy is on voting costs and not the cost of hardware and operation.\n\nEven so, some think this approach only offers \u201cband-aid\u201d solutions. If anything, they argue that Solana actually \u201cinvented\u201d and \u201cweaponized\u201d MEV. There are other claims that SOL holders like Multicoin Capital prioritize chains based on their MEV capture potential.\n\nRecently, some of these subsidized validators were caught enabling MEV to \u201csandwich\u201d users. While the Solana Foundation swiftly removed their stake, it remains to be seen whether MEV attacks will stop.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December\n\nAs the upcoming elections draw closer, former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in various sectors, including cryptocurrency, could play a significant role. Many are wondering if Trump is a big crypto investor himself as recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump reached a quick $33 million high last week. According to Arkham, he currently holds 475.6 ETH, worth $1.73 million.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn December 2023, Trump sent over 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.3 million. However, ETH has since performed well, and Trump may regret selling too soon.\n\nIf Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth around $3.9 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,600 today. If he held and sold now instead, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.\n\nWith many investment management firms aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s continued market share growth and its leading status among smart contract platforms could propel its value to a $2.2 trillion market cap, or approximately $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nWhile Trump might regret his sale, the ETH was free. He acquired the tokens through an NFT project that utilized his name, image, and likeness, granting Trump royalties through his licensing deals.\n\nThe Trump Digital Trading Cards project was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. Currently, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time).\n\nHowever, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump released another project in late 2023, coined the \"Mugshot Edition,\" a nod to his legal troubles. It offered personalized rewards, with those who bought at least 47 Trump cards getting to have dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago and receiving a piece of the suit Trump wore for his mugshot when he was arrested in August.\n\nAs Trump continues to earn royalties and performs well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he manages his ETH position going into the presidential election in November. Mark Cuban said earlier this week on X, that crypto could be a big factor in tipping the scale in favor of Trump this November.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Reach $70,000 This Week As Ethereum, Solana Scream Buy? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto markets have been swimming in a sea of red in the last few days after Bitcoin price crashed to the $66,000 zone. Investors are now scanning the markets for optimal re-entry positions ahead of the next upward move. Key market-moving events this week include the FOMC meeting on June 12 and the Producer Price Index (PPI) data release on June 13. Market analysts anticipate that Bitcoin will react sharply to these developments.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum and Solana are also preparing for their next upward moves. Here is a complete breakdown of how these assets may perform in the coming days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Price Eyes $72,000 as ETF Volumes Hits ATH\n\nBitcoin price traded around $67,405 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours. With just 9 hours to go before the FOMC meeting, Bitcoin is struggling to stay above $67,000.\n\nBTC price action is trending above the 50-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMA), which is a bullish indicator for Bitcoin investors. The June 12 daily candle is also showing signs of a struggle and indecision between the bull and the bears.\n\nThe asset has been trending inside a consolidation zone for the past four weeks. Despite the slide in price, Bitcoin fundamentals remain strong, with BTC Spot ETF total cumulative flow surpassing $292 billion. This signals round 2 of massive accumulation. For comparison, the first round of BTC ETF accumulation saw Bitcoin surge from $38,000 to $73,000.\n\nWith this important metric underway, and with dovish comments from FOMC officials, Bitcoin price may hit and surpass $70,000 this week.\n\nEthereum Price Prepares to Test $3,600\n\nEther dropped by 7.6% to $3,521 over the last 7 days, following the market-wide crash. According to the recent Ethereum price prediction by CoinGape analysts, ETH had previously surged in price after the SEC approved 8 ETH ETFs. However, facts emerging later about the nature of the approved applications killed the hype. BlackRock is still pursuing the approval of its S-1 Form, which many Ethereum investors find bullish.\n\nEthereum price broke downward from a consolidation zone it had been in for about 3 weeks. Initially, the zone was part of a bull flag that usually resolves upwards. However, following Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price, the market structure was invalidated.\n\nEthereum may be preparing to bounce back upward, using $3,300 as support. Investors are waiting for the FOMC outcome in order to make their decisions later today. If bullish news graces the crypto space, Ethereum price may break back into the previous range and touch $4,000.\n\nSolana Price Flashes a Huge Buy Signal, $285 Target in the Works\n\nAlthough the recent general market downturn has affected many cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s price has braced the storm relatively well. Solana price prediction shows the staking token trading around $151 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 2% decrease in 24 hours and a further 12.9% decrease in 7 days. Nevertheless, SOL price action remains bullish and in an uptrend.\n\nSitting at a $69.7 billion market cap, Solana has been dominating the markets. Currently, the price action is trending above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) but below the 50-day moving average.\n\nSOL price has been making higher lows for 275 days straight, an impressive bullish streak. The asset is now in a symmetrical triangle, which may resolve in either direction. However, since Solana\u2019s price is in an uptrend, the chances of resolving upward may be higher than otherwise.\n\nA break above the symmetrical triangle may result in a 59% surge in price that will set the SOL price around $285. This will also be an all-time high price for the asset. Solana network has been an exceptional performer, with nearly half a million tokens launched in May 2024.\n\nOn its way up, SOL price may encounter resistance around $196, $228, and $267. Conversely, $132, $126, and $110 may provide robust support for the asset.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCrypto investors are eagerly awaiting the FOMC announcement in less than 10 hours (at press time). Expert forecasts point to no hikes or cuts, but officials\u2019 comments may either hurt or boost cryptocurrency prices. Investors are hoping for dovish comments from Jerome Powel and his counterparts to avoid further bleeding in the crypto markets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US could drive ETH to new highs; analyst Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk disagrees it\u2019s priced in.\n\nZdu\u0144czyk cites a US$154K ETH price target by 2030, with significant yearly growth and a solid user base supporting this forecast.\n\nHe advocates a 70% BTC and 30% ETH portfolio for optimal risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe case of the Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) possibly coming to the United States is a potential catalyst for ETH to reach new all-time highs. Or is the launch \u2013 which is expected to see Ether ETFs trade as early as July \u2013 already priced in?\n\nRelated: Fidelity International Introduces Instant Share Tokenisation on JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx Blockchain\n\nCrypto analyst Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk, a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) with 651K followers on social platform X, doesn\u2019t think so. Based on a VanEck analysis, @crypto_birb believes that ETH could be worth $154K (AU$233.5K) by 2030, with a base target of US$22K (AU$33.3K).\n\nVanEck\u2019s target for ETH by 2030, source: Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk via X\n\nAccording to Zdu\u0144czyk and VanEck the optimal crypto portfolio is 70% in BTC and 30% in ETH \u2013 and they say adding 6% of crypto to the standard 60/40 portfolio will boost profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanEck Believes Huge Price Target Driven by US$66 Billion in Free Cash Flows\n\nSo how did the American investment manager come to that lofty price prediction?\n\nIt\u2019s simply a \u201cprojection of Ethereum generating $66 billion in free cash flows by 2030 and applying a 33x valuation multiple\u201d says Zdu\u0144czyk.\n\n2) Portfolio Boost: 6% Crypto Allocation\n\n\n\nAdding 6% crypto to a 60/40 portfolio boosts the Sharpe ratio, with a minor drawdown impact.

The platform\u2019s robust economic activity is further underscored by a settlement value of US$4tn (AU$6tn) and US$5.5tn (AU$8.3tn) in stablecoin transfers, reinforcing these growth figures, he added.\n\nBy 2030 it is expected that 71% of the network revenue will come from finance, based on a strong user base and transaction fees much lower than those of credit card processors and payment apps.\n\nOther bullish forces for ETH are the increasing importance of layer-2 networks and the potential of AI integration.\n\nFurther, Zdu\u0144czyk believes Ethereum will become a Sharpe Ratio leader. The Sharpe Ratio assesses an investment\u2019s performance against a risk-free asset, adjusting for risk; a higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe analyst calculates that a portfolio consisting of 71.4% Bitcoin (BTC) and 28.6% Ethereum (ETH) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.43. This indicates that this combination of BTC and ETH provides a favourable balance between expected return and volatility when compared to other potential combinations of these two cryptocurrencies.\n\nSharpe Ratio comparison BTC/ETH, source: @crypto_birb via TradingView\n\nRelated: Analyst Miles Deutscher Unveils 20X Portfolio Strategy for the Upcoming Bull Run\n\nFinal words of warning though, Zdu\u0144czyk says that 2030 is well past his \u201ctimeframe of interest\u201d and in general long-term predictions are obviously fraught with uncertainty. He believes there will be a possibly prolonged bear market in 2026, which is why he will be looking to exit the market in 2025."
