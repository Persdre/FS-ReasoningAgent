        "title": "MIT grads\u2019 $25 million crypto crime puts spotlight on Ethereum front-running - Fortune",
        "content": "If you graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with elite computer skills, you can make great money working for a tech company\u2014or even more money working on Wall Street. But if that doesn\u2019t grab you, and you want to get even richer, you can always try your hand at white-collar crime like twentysomething brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. The pair came up with a scheme that let them pocket $25 million in just 12 seconds. Unfortunately, it ended badly, as the feds announced yesterday in a press release that reads like a pulp novel.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents,\u201d wrote the DOJ. For good measure, the release quotes an agent who declares the crime was solved \u201cwith cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work.\u201d\n\nPurple prose aside, the case involves some impressive detective work as well as a sophisticated explanation by Justice Department lawyers of a new type of alleged crime involving the Ethereum blockchain. The crime involves the arcane business of \u201cMaximum Extractable Value,\u201d or MEV, which entails packaging transactions in a block in a way that allows those who construct the blockchain to profit from others\u2019 transactions.\n\nThe miners who build blockchains do not, of course, do this out of the goodness of their hearts. Instead, the process relies on incentives that allow miners\u2014in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains\u2014to obtain a reward in the form of both coins and transaction fees for adding a new block. When Ethereum switched to a new blockchain construction process known as proof-of-stake, however, it created new opportunities for miners to make money\u2014including by front-running trades included in the blocks they package. This is what people mean by MEV. (Bitcoin investment firm River, as well as the DOJ\u2019s criminal indictment, has a good explanation of how exactly it works).\n\nMEV has been around for a while now, and while a number of people in crypto find it distasteful, it is not illegal\u2014and indeed, similar things go on in the world of traditional finance such as the practice known as payment for order flow. The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, took things a step further when they detected a bug in a popular piece of software used to carry out MEV. This allowed them not to simply front-run Ethereum users\u2019 transactions, but to tamper with them in a way that allowed them to outright rob them.\n\nAll of this is likely to draw new scrutiny of the murky practice of MEV, and potentially lead to calls for reform among the Ethereum crowd. As for the Peraire-Bueno, the episode also showed that people with MIT degrees are also capable of old-fashioned stupidity. Not only did they get caught, but the DOJ also found evidence they conducted web searches about things like money laundering and how to get away with financial fraud. Don\u2019t Google your crimes, people! Finally, the brothers can at least take comfort that they are not the only MIT grads to be charged with crypto crimes\u2014the school is also the alma mater of a certain Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe government of El Salvador has mined 474 Bitcoins in the last three years via volcano-powered rigs, contributing to the country's overall holding of 5,575.

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > 2 arrested for $25 million exploit of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake validators\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s already wobbly foundation looks even shakier following the arrest of two brothers who exploited the network\u2019s vulnerabilities to steal $25 million from transaction validators.\n\nOn May 15, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the arrest of two brothers\u2014Anton and James Peraire-Bueno\u2014on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, the brothers face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe MIT-educated pair are accused of netting around $25 million worth of tokens in a 12-second span\u2014the duration of a block validation \u2018slot\u2019 on Ethereum\u2014by manipulating vulnerabilities in the process by which Ethereum verifies transactions. Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the \u201cnovel\u201d scheme \u201ccalls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\u201d\n\nThe scheme involved Ethereum\u2019s so-called \u2018maximal extractable value\u2019 (MEV), the process by which Ethereum\u2019s transaction validators can preview and reorder pending transactions. MEV allows validators to personally profit from this advance knowledge by front-running significant or large transactions. European regulators recently flagged MEV for its potential for market abuse.\n\nThe DOJ says the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole funds that would otherwise have gone to a group of Ethereum validators using MEV-Boost. This open-source software outsources the creation of new Ethereum blocks to a network of \u2018searchers,\u2019 \u2018builders,\u2019 and \u2018relays.\u2019\n\nSearchers utilize automated bots to scan the Ethereum mempool for profitable arbitrage opportunities, then forward a bundle of preferred transactions to the builder. This bundle prioritizes the searcher\u2019s \u2018frontrun\u2019 transaction, aka buying a token on the expectation that the transactions that follow will boost the value of said token. The searcher also includes a \u2018sell\u2019 transaction further back in the bundle to cash out this expected spike in token value.\n\nBuilders sent these bundles to a relay, which initially submits only the blockheader to a validator. Only after the validator accepts the block for publishing to the chain does the validator see the complete ordered transaction list.\n\nTaking the bait\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the brothers began plotting their heist around December 2022, just months after Ethereum made its transition from a consensus mechanism based around proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe brothers established 16 validators, then engaged in a series of \u2018bait transactions\u2019 to figure out what motivated MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The brothers thus identified three \u2018victim traders\u2019 that specialized in crypto arbitrage trades.\n\nThe brothers then initiated \u201cat least eight\u201d transactions (the \u2018Lure transactions\u2019) they knew would cause the victim traders\u2019 MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The bundles also included the victim traders\u2019 own \u2018buy\u2019 transactions in which they paid $25 million in stablecoins and other tokens to acquire \u201csubstantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies\u201d (aka shitcoins of little or no utility).\n\nThe victim traders also included their \u2018sell\u2019 transactions after the Lure transactions, but with coded conditions that the frontrun transactions couldn\u2019t be executed unless the Lure transactions \u201ctook place immediately after the frontrun trades\u201d and the sell transactions occurred immediately after the Lure transactions.\n\nBut the brothers had identified a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that prematurely exposed the full content of proposed blocks. This allowed the brothers to tamper with the victim traders\u2019 proposed blocks when one of the brothers\u2019 16 validators was selected to approve the next block.\n\nOnce the victim traders\u2019 $25 million buy transactions had gone through, the brothers \u201creplaced the Lure transactions with Tampered transactions. In the Tampered transactions, the defendants sold the same illiquid cryptocurrencies that the victim traders had recently purchased as a result of the Lure transactions and, for which the defendants already held as a result of information gathered through the bait transactions. In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.\u201d\n\nThe net result was that the victim traders\u2019 sell orders couldn\u2019t go through, leaving them with worthless shitcoins while the brothers collected around $25 million in stablecoins and more liquid tokens. The brothers then published the re-ordered block to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe victim traders eventually caught on to what had occurred and reached out to the brothers, as did \u201ca representative from Ethereum.\u201d The brothers ignored these pleas and set about laundering their stolen loot through exchanges with minimal \u2018know your customer\u2019 controls as well as some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nWhile the brothers may have graduated from MIT, they failed OpSec 101 by googling phrases such as \u2018money laundering\u2019 and \u2018does the United States extradite to [insert country here]\u2019 ahead of their heist.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the brothers\u2019 high-tech antics \u201cwere no match for DOJ prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme.\u201d IRS Criminal Investigation unit special agent Thomas Fattorusso added that his office had \u201csimply followed the money\u201d using \u201ccutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWhile the company behind MEV-Boost released an update to prevent future exploits of this kind, the reputational hit that Ethereum has taken since its shift to PoS shows no sign of ending. In fact, PoS is considered one of the primary reasons why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is (allegedly) preparing to designate ETH as an unregistered security.\n\nA significant chunk of ETH was already concentrated in relatively few hands, most of them belonging to Ethereum insiders who were the primary beneficiaries of 2014\u2019s controversial crowdsale. PoS was guaranteed to further concentrate control of the network, trigging more planks of the Howey test. Regulatory blowback was/is inevitable.\n\n\u2018Compromised and partially drained\u2019\n\nStill more \u2018crypto\u2019 bro-on-bro violence made the news this week courtesy of a hack of the BlockTower blockchain-focused institutional investment firm.\n\nOn May 14, Bloomberg reported that BlockTower\u2019s main hedge fund had been \u201ccompromised and partially drained by fraudsters,\u201d citing sources familiar with the situation who didn\u2019t want to be identified. The total amount of the stolen assets, as well as the nature of the hack went unspecified, but BlockTower has reportedly hired blockchain forensics experts to get to the bottom of this mess.\n\nAs a private company beholden only to its well-heeled investors, BlockTower has so far offered no official statement about the report. The company\u2019s main fund held around $1.7 billion worth of assets under management prior to the hack.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlockTower has suffered losses via exploits, having lost $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens after hackers targeted its wallet on the Dexibel decentralized exchange in 2023.\n\nBlockTower describes its Flagship fund\u2019s M.O. as \u201cfocused on liquid crypto assets via a multi-strategy approach analyzing both top-down market regimes and bottom-up asset selection (beta augmented with alpha), and incorporating market neutral strategies where appropriate to the opportunity set.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, BlockTower launched a dedicated venture capital fund that has taken stakes in numerous \u2018crypto\u2019 entities, including memecoin-factory Solana, struggling NFT-focused Dapper Labs, Sky Mavis (parent of the Axie Infinity game, which suffered a nine-figure hack of its Ronin Bridge network in 2022) and fraudulent \u2018algorithmic stablecoin\u2019 issuer Terraform Labs.\n\nHonestly, given that stellar track record, we\u2019re a little surprised there was anything left to steal.\n\nMake it stop\n\nBlockTower wasn\u2019t the end of this week\u2019s hackery. The Sonne Finance \u2018decentralized non-custodial lending protocol\u2019 was taken for $20 million worth of \u2018wrapped\u2019 ETH and USDC tokens. Sonne Finance said it\u2019s prepared to offer the hacker a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 that would allow him/her/they to keep 10% of their loot as payment for pointing out the gaping security flaws if they return the other 90%.\n\nBut the hacker has reportedly already swapped some of their ill-gotten gains for nearly 1,200 ETH and 183,000 DAI (an Ethereum-based stablecoin maintained by the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization). From there, the ETH will almost certainly tread the well-trodden path to Tornado Cash, the ETH-based coin mixer that helps obfuscate a digital asset\u2019s digital trail.\n\nWe say that with some confidence because on May 14, Reuters revealed a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee report that found Tornado Cash helped launder $147.5 million worth of ETH that was stolen from Justin Sun\u2019s HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange last year by North Korea\u2019s hackers.\n\nThat nine-figure sum was funneled through Tornado Cash in the month of March alone. A further $66.3 million worth of ETH that was stolen from the Sun-linked Poloniex exchange has been similarly washed. With apologies to ancient Rome, when it comes to stolen tokens, all roads lead to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe UN report, based on data provided by PeckShield and Elliptic analysts, also found that North Korea was the likely culprit behind 97 suspected attacks on \u2018crypto\u2019 firms that netted the Hermit Kingdom some $3.6 billion between 2017 and 2024. The same report indicates that North Korea may have been responsible for 11 \u2018crypto\u2019 heists so far this year that netted nearly $55 million.\n\nIronically, many of the victims of these heists were likely among the legions of \u2018crypto bros\u2019 loudly denouncing this week\u2019s sentencing of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in a Dutch prison for money laundering. Code is law, after all\u2026 that is, until it\u2019s your bits of code that have been stolen and laundered. Still, man up and take one for the team, right?\n\nOne imagines that, within crypto crook circles, it\u2019s hard to get angry when they get caught thieving from each other. After all, it\u2019s the dominant ethos of this game, in which the much-ballyhooed notion of \u2018building\u2019 doesn\u2019t so much take a backseat to \u2018grifting,\u2019 it gets relegated to a rickety trailer haphazardly hitched to the back of this out-of-control 18-wheeler.\n\nFor those of you who crave a more productive, utilitarian and (ta-da!) legally- and regulatory-compliant worldview, there\u2019s a little shindig going on in London next week that might be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nWatch: Teranode & the Web3 world with edge-to-edge electronic value system"

        "content": "As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has attracted the attention of investors and industry experts. With advancements in blockchain technology and the increasing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps), the future of Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a subject of widespread debate.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Ethereum hit an all-time high of $4,600, fuelled by the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Yet, what causes the price of Ethereum to continue to fluctuate wildly? Could Ethereum one day witness a value overflow of this cryptocurrency at a higher growth rate?\n\nIn this article, we bring you a detailed review regarding the factors that could influence the economic predictions of ETH in the coming years. We will also give you the anticipated costs in 2024, 2025, and 2026.\n\nEthereum Overview\n\nEthereum is an innovative cryptocurrency that takes the shape of a decentralized, open-source blockchain. It first emerged in 2015 and came alive via people looking for a network that encourages smart contracts and decentralized apps to be developed and used without manipulating, hacking, or being influenced by fraud.\n\nThis platform further aids creators in planning goods and performing contracts quickly without any negative consequences. Indeed, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a wider scope that includes cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. For this type of machines like those that are required to reach a new level of these apps, the \u2018Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2018 (EVM) lies in the epicenter of Ethereum.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis\n\nEver since 2015, prices of Ethereum have seen quite some lows and some highs at the same time; thus, it\u2019s been quite a volatile ride for the fintech asset. Ethereum prices had been determined and influenced by a lot of things such as the overall market sentiment, advances in technology and how well they were adopted within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA particular craze worth mentioning about 2017 was the ICO, and the buying using ETH alone brought about a surge in the demand for ETH. About $8 was its initial price at the beginning of 2017, and its price has reached an all-time high of over $1300 before 2018 ended. From there, a bear market showed continuous decline of ETH prices through months. ETH\u2019s price had leveled at around $130 at the end of the year.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic catalyzed the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and a lot of mainstream interest and recognition which it didn\u2019t have before. The rise of decentralized finance of the DEFI was primarily seen as very bullish for the evolution of the Ethereum Network, and subsequently, the price of ETH lifted from then. Each ETH was priced at $4600 at the end of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022.\n\nBy the end of 2022, Ethereum saw another dip which continued through all of 2023 with the fintech asset priced as low as 1100$. The market came back by the end of 2023 at a ranging price of around $4000. And in May 2024, the price of Ethereum is currently around $3080.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions for 2024, 2025, and 2026\n\nPrice Prediction 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum network grows and expands, the demand for its native cryptocurrency will also grow in 2024. More sharding and scaling solutions will strengthen the network\u2019s capacities and speed and draw more users into the system. Henceforth, the bull run is likely and the currency will hit the $3,500 \u2013 $4,000 mark, by mid-2024.\n\nBy the end of 2024, ETH\u2019s integration into traditional finance and major corporation adoption could cause the predictions to increase to $4,000 \u2013 $5,000 if foreign exchange and other layer-2 scaling solutions tonight volumes.\n\nPrice Prediction 2025\n\nBy 2025, the Ethereum ecosystem might further mature and absorb into various fields. By solving all the scaling issues (if there are any) and introducing new layer-2 solutions, it will become far more efficient and will attract even more users and developers. So, the price might rise in the years to come.\n\nSlowly, when more real-world uses are implemented, and Ethereum-based app usage increases, the use could potentially even make the demand rise up. Since it can be noted from many experts that big investors and traditional finance sectors have also increased their interest in Ethereum. It might also make a profit to much extent as it is considered that Ethereum will become a dominant blockchain platform.\n\nIf this continues, the price predicted might reach within the range of $6000-$7000 by the end of the year 2025. The cryptocurrency market is notorious and high volatility is one of the aspects preventing it since unexpected events happen in the market frequently, which might increase or decrease the prices. Any legislative shift can also increase or decrease the prices of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice Prediction 2026\n\nIn 2026, Ethereum may prove to be unbeatable and may have shown much progress. The powerful Ethereum ecosystem and scaling solutions may probably absorb almost all industries. By not having any stress to adapt and evolve as it is upgraded or updated regularly, it can potentially cause several organizations or even governments to adopt blockchain technology.\n\nThe price for Ethereum (according to experts\u2019 speculation) might reach a range of $8000-$10000 by the end of 2026 if significant developments occur.\n\nForecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024-2026\n\nYear Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024 $3,500 \u2013 $5,000 2025 $6,000 \u2013 $7,000 2026 $8,000 \u2013 $10,000 Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH)\n\nInvestment Strategies\n\nEthereum is no different than any other investments and it is important to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. Here are some effective tips for people looking to invest in Ethereum:\n\nTechnical Analysis: Some of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on. These pinpoint the price areas where one should sell and buy.\n\nSome of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on.

Technological developments, scalability solutions, and increasing interest from institutions are driving such a surge. Investors are advised to do comprehensive research, frame proper strategies, and be cautious while playing around in the ever-volatile cryptocurrencies market.\n\nRead Also: Is Vanguard Charting a New Path with the Appointment of Outsider CEO Salim Ramji?"

While L2s have successfully improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability by handling transactions off the main chain, they have inadvertently reduced the demand for Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, on the main chain. This reduction in demand has led to lower transaction fees, measured in gwei, and subsequently, less burning of ETH. Currently, gwei sits at around 8, significantly lower than in previous times, indicating that at this level, ETH is far from being deflationary.\n\nRead more: Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020\n\nEthereum can shift from deflationary to inflationary due to changes in network activity and the balance of Ether burned versus issued. Under EIP-1559, when transaction volumes are low and the burned base fees are less than the Ether issued in block rewards, the total supply of Ether increases, making Ethereum inflationary. This dynamic demonstrates how Ethereum\u2019s supply is not fixed but responsive to network usage, potentially impacting its value and scarcity when shifts from a deflationary to an inflationary state occur.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum L2s are ripping, processing 10 times more transactions than the main chain, while reaching an all-time high in weekly active addresses.\n\nGiven these levels of gas fees, the question arises: how much activity needs to happen in the L2s for ETH to become deflationary again?\n\nRead more: Horizontal Scalability Is the Solution to L2 Fragmentation\n\nA Complex System\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, told Unchained that the deflationary mechanism of ETH is directly tied to its market cap and the balance between revenue and expenses. At low prices, the burning mechanism can exceed the issuance, making ETH deflationary. However, as the market cap grows and if revenues don\u2019t keep up proportionally, ETH can become inflationary.\n\nThis bidirectional influence means that the market cap not only affects the deflationary or inflationary nature of ETH, but also that this nature, in turn, affects the market cap through investor perceptions and behaviors.\n\nTo reverse this trend and restore the deflationary status of ETH, a significant increase in activity on L2s is required. This means that more transactions and fees need to be funneled back to the Ethereum main chain to increase the burning of ETH. However, according to Dietrichs, research has not been done to assess exactly how much activity it would take. Neither the Ethereum Foundation nor researcher Justin Drake responded to several emails requesting additional information on how much L2 activity is needed to keep ETH supply deflationary.\n\nIn addition, Dietrichs pointed out that for any given revenue and issuance level, with constant investor preferences, there is essentially one specific equilibrium market cap that the market would trend towards. Any change in these factors\u2014revenue, issuance, or investor preferences\u2014shifts this equilibrium market cap point. This dynamic feedback loop suggests that addressing the deflationary challenge is not just about tweaking a few parameters, but about understanding and influencing a complex system of interrelated factors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, the question remains: Can the foundational promise of ultrasound money be restored, or will Ethereum have to adapt to a new economic reality?\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "content": "The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, will likely take place by the end of 2024, or in early 2025. One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation."

        "content": "Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, two brothers who operate Ethereum validators, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe charges related to a scheme that has been described as exploiting the \u2018very integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million.\u2019\n\nThe brothers allegedly worked together on a complex exploit that allowed them to take advantage of traders searching for \u2018maximum extractable value\u2019 (MEV) on Ethereum.\n\nBy operating multiple Ethereum validators, the brothers were allegedly able to submit blocks that included exploited transactions.\n\nAllegedly, once the brothers were aware that their validators would soon have opportunities to submit blocks, they would create \u2018bait\u2019 transactions that seemed to have significant upside for the MEV traders and wait for those traders to attempt to \u2018sandwich\u2019 their trades.\n\nThese sandwich bots will often look for transactions with the potential for arbitrage and place transactions that buy shortly before and sell shortly after.\n\nWhen the traders were baited into submitting these \u2018bundles\u2019 of transactions, the brothers allegedly submitted a fake signature to MEV-Boost Relay, which at the time resulted in the relays prematurely releasing the whole proposed block.\n\nThey then allegedly took advantage of the fact that they were operating validators to disassemble the block and allow the traders to still front-run. However, instead of buying the asset the MEV trader believes they are interested in, they actually sold that asset at the higher price.\n\nA rogue validator on Flashbot seems to be exploiting MEV bots.

        "title": "SEC approval of spot ethereum ETFs would benefit all investors - American Banker",
        "content": "The SEC, having already approved spot bitcoin ETFs, ought to follow through and grant the same approval to spot ethereum funds. Doing so would create a new surge of investment, with positive economic impacts, writes Rachel Lin, of SynFutures. Unshu - stock.adobe.com\n\nOpinions vary widely on the potential approval of spot ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs , by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Despite mounting uncertainty about when or if the regulator will approve the new financial instrument, there is optimism ahead pertaining to the prospects of an ethereum ETF approval \u2014 akin to the fervor for the once long-awaited bitcoin ETF .\n\nThe BTC ETF proved pivotal in driving institutional interest in the digital asset class, particularly in regions like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, where investors sought new growth opportunities after missing out on the stock market surge. Its success was the impetus to drive investors that once shunned cryptocurrencies to finally make the leap in a more secure fashion.\n\nAs the second-largest digital asset, ethereum boasts a vast ecosystem that positions it as a front-runner in the digital economy. Regulatory clarity, coupled with institutional investment, is poised to propel ethereum to unprecedented heights. Beyond mere price action, the approval of ethereum ETFs holds symbolic importance, solidifying crypto's status as a legitimate asset class and reinforcing its role in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nThe trend toward regulatory clarity is unmistakable, evidenced by the SEC's acknowledgement of ethereum's non-security status in permitting futures trading. This sets a clear precedent for the approval of a spot ethereum ETF. To deviate from this path would not only highlight regulatory ambiguity but also undermine market confidence. Moreover, proactive regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions like Hong Kong, where plans for spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs have just been greenlit, highlights the growing global acceptance and recognition of the potential of ethereum-based financial instruments. These developments underscore the urgent need for the SEC to align its regulatory framework with evolving market dynamics and maintain competitiveness in the global landscape.\n\nUndoubtedly, market demand from institutional investors serves as a driving force behind the push for ethereum ETF approval. The lineup of heavyweight players eagerly awaiting the green light \u2014 BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark and Hashdex, and most recently Bitwise \u2014 underscores the potential for ethereum ETFs to unlock new avenues for investment and liquidity. This influx of institutional capital could not only boost ethereum's market profile but also catalyze the development of more sophisticated products and services within the ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCryptocurrency House votes to nullify crypto custody guidance; Biden vows veto The House advanced a resolution that would roll back a Securities and Exchange Commission resolution that banks argue cuts them out of the crypto custodying business, but President Biden said he would veto it if it passes the Senate. May 9\n\nMoreover, the fact that the global ETF assets under management, or AUM, have exceeded $11 trillion suggests that investors are increasingly turning to ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle. While ETFs represent 13% of equity assets in the United States, indicating a significant adoption rate, their penetration is comparatively lower in Europe (8.8%) and the Asia-Pacific region (4.6%). The lower penetration rates of ETFs in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region suggest potential opportunities for growth. As more ETF products become available tailored to regional preferences and regulatory requirements, we may see a further expansion of the ETF market globally.\n\nConsidering the lessons learnt from BTC ETFs and the increasing recognition of crypto as a viable alternative asset, especially in a cooling economy, ETFs offer a less burdensome and tax-efficient means of exposure to cryptocurrencies. They simplify the complexities associated with owning crypto outright and broaden accessibility from individual retirement accounts all the way to large institutional accounts.\n\nThe broader impact of ethereum ETF approval reverberates across both short and long-term horizons. In the short term, we can expect increased trading activity and price volatility for ethereum and altcoins in the days leading up to the SEC's decision. However, in the long run, institutional adoption facilitated by ethereum ETFs could spur ecosystem growth, paving the way for a more robust and diverse range of financial instruments. Moreover, approval would provide much-needed regulatory clarity, particularly for ethereum-based financial products, mitigating uncertainty and fostering a conducive environment for innovation.\n\nIn light of the regulatory precedent, global trends and market demand, it appears increasingly likely that the SEC will grant approval for ethereum ETFs, notwithstanding delays and regulatory hurdles. I confidently predict that this will propel prices of bitcoin and ethereum to new heights. These milestones will reflect the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies and herald a new era of mainstream adoption and acceptance.\n\n"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were steady hours heading into another U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer prices report.\n\nThe new Consumer Price Index report will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST. For now, things seem pretty tame in crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin price sitting just above $62,000\u2014up 0.6% compared to the same time yesterday. And the Ethereum price, which had sunk to around $2,900, was down 0.2% since Tuesday morning, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEconomists have been forecasting that the market is in for another disappointingly high Consumer Price Index report today. The CPI is one of the key metrics that the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether it should lower the federal interest rate. But analysts have flagged that gas prices have been on the rise and prices have been inching upwards in the services sectors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's bad, but not necessarily terrible news, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory is still down,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s been a more gradual downward move relative to the expectations coming into 2024.\u201d\n\nWhen the BLS issued its March Consumer Price Index report last month, it showed that personal expenditures in the U.S. had grown by 3.7%. The news that the U.S. economy had been growing slower than expected caused BTC and ETH to dip.\n\nBitcoin started the month having sunk below $60,000, briefly touched $65,000, and triggered the liquidation of hundreds of millions worth of derivatives positions along the way. More recently, the mix of macroeconomic factors\u2014including the war in Israel's War on Gaza and slowed growth in major economies like the U.S.\u2014has sparked pessimism in crypto markets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there's a little good news: Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes said earlier this month that the bottom for BTC is already in.\n\n\"I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. But he noted that he wasn't planning to add more Bitcoin to his bags.\n\n\"The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins,\" Hayes said. \"I\u2019m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions.\""

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price to Reach $10,000 by the End of 2024? Analyst Weighs In - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum\u2019s price recently surpassed $3,000, with analysts predicting further significant gains.\n\nDeclining MVRV ratio, negative exchange netflow, and potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the US could drive ETH\u2019s value higher.\n\nIs ETH Gearing up for an ATH?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant uptrend in the past few days, with numerous digital assets rising to multi-week highs. Although not witnessing such a substantial increase, Ethereum (ETH) is also among the notable gainers.\n\nIts price surpassed the $3,000 mark, representing a 4% increase on a daily scale. Numerous analysts believe this could be the starting point of a bull run that can take place in the near future.\n\nThe X user Michael van de Poppe is among the optimists. He claimed recently that ETH is on its way to reaching a higher timeframe support level. \u201cThe good times are there in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d he assumed.\n\nCryptoYoddha was even more bullish, envisioning a price explosion toward the $10,000 milestone by the end of the year.\n\nLast but not least, World of Charts argued that ETH has started breaking the \u201cfalling wedge consolidation\u201d on a 12-hour timeframe. \u201cTrend is already up and expecting continuation towards $4500 in coming weeks,\u201d the analyst forecasted.\n\nObserving Some Important Factors\n\nOne element signaling that ETH\u2019s value could be on the verge of a rally is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). It helps to identify if the asset is overvalued or undervalued. A high ratio suggests a market top, while a low one may indicate a good buying opportunity. The MVRV has been on a significant downfall since mid-March.\n\nAnother factor is ETH\u2019s exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the past month (according to CryptoQuant\u2019s data). Shifting from centralized platforms towards self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.\n\nLast but not least, ETH\u2019s price may head north in case of the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. However, such a green light may also lead to the same immediate \u201csell-the-news\u201d event witnessed after the BTC ETF approvals in January."

This marks the first time Solana has outpaced Ethereum in its history, but there is always a catch.\n\nBreaking down the data\n\nAccording to Blockworks Research, Solana generated $2,248,681 in TEV on May 12, surpassing Ethereum's $1,977,416. TEV combines transaction fees and miner/extractor value (MEV). TEV is often used to analyze the utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nFor the first time ever on May 12, Solana generated more Total Economic Value than Ethereum in a single day pic.twitter.com/nrCe7pMNjb \u2014 Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 14, 2024\n\nChris Burniske, the former Ark Invest analyst, commented on the whole thing, stating that we should keep an eye on L1s that are keeping up their annual expansion in the form of TEV. Higher TEV can indicate greater usage and demand, which can, in turn, provide more flexibility in the economic policies of the network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a problem\n\nHowever, the achievement has sparked some debate between Solana and Ethereum users. Critics argue that comparing Solana's TEV with Ethereum's without considering layer-2 (L2) solutions is misleading. L2 solutions are built on top of Ethereum to enhance scalability and reduce fees, effectively offloading some of the activity from the main Ethereum blockchain (L1), while remaining a crucial part of it. As one commentator pointed out, \"Since some ETH activity has moved to L2s, wouldn't we include that? Come on Chris, this is just disingenuous if you don\u2019t take L2s into account.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, comparing TEV across blockchains remains valuable. As Burniske explained, each L2 operates in its own blockspace environment, and TEV comparisons are typically made on an L1-to-L1 basis. However, some may disagree with such an approach and consider L2s an inseparable part of larger ecosystems like Ethereum, which has struggled due to high fees in the past. For now, Ethereum fees sometimes drop even below Tron's."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst predicts one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is about to have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 638,000 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) could soar against BTC by more than 84% from its current value.\n\n\u201cAVAX/BTC: I might be crazy bros, but I still believe AVAX rips higher from here.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the analyst suggests that AVAX/BTC is printing a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart and could soon reach 0.000950 BTC ($62.13).\n\nAVAX/BTC is trading for .000515 BTC ($33.89) at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the analyst predicts ETH competitor Solana is about to soar against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) after printing a bullish pattern on the daily chart of higher high prices and higher low prices.\n\nHe believes SOL/BTC could soon cross the 0.0032 BTC ($209) level.\n\n\u201cSOL/BTC: Solana is still one of the biggest no brainer long plays out there. Don\u2019t fight strength.\u201d\n\nSOL/BTC is trading for 0.00243 BTC ($160) at time of writing, up more than 3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) will breakout based on a 2021 pattern when the memecoin rallied after the soaring meme stock GameStop (GME) hit a market top. GME had a massive rally this week but has since retraced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make this simple for you. Here\u2019s a chart of Dogecoin versus GME. You may not remember this, but it was GameStop that led the way back in early 2021. It wasn\u2019t until after it topped that DOGE started sending. Dogecoin is overdue for a good pump.

        "content": "Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin (BTC) and a certain breed of altcoins will be beneficiaries of artificial intelligence\u2019s (AI) rise to prominence.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 16,200 followers on the social media platform X that AI will need a money system, and that BTC may be the best available form.\n\nHowever, Coutts says that stablecoins and the native tokens of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NEAR, are also well-suited.\n\n\u201cAI needs a money.\n\nBitcoin is the best form factor, but it won\u2019t be the only one. Stablecoins and native tokens for smart contract platforms will also see widespread use.\n\nSOL ETH NEAR.\u201d\n\nCoutts recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) technology could send the total market cap of the layer-1 crypto sector soaring from the current $1.9 trillion valuation to as high as $25 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe analyst shares an excerpt from his firm\u2019s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services.\n\nThe report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.\n\n\u201cBy incorporating an \u2018AI growth factor\u2019 starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a candid tweet Thursday, DeGods and y00ts NFT project founder Rohun Vora (aka Frank DeGods) took a critical look at his previous decisions, especially those made during tumultuous times for the well-known collections. His reflection sheds light on the pressures of community expectations and being a founder.\n\n\u201cI used to try to move mountains to appease the community in times of chaos,\" he began. \"Every single time it's backfired.\"\n\nThroughout the years as the leader of DeGods, he has made many decisions to try and please his holders and keep the buzz going. For example, the team went through many art changes, including a planned upgrade and self-proclaimed art \u201cdowngrade.\u201d On Thursday, the team said that it would make no further art changes to DeGods.\n\nBut the biggest and most controversial move was bridging DeGods NFTs from Solana to Ethereum last year, along with y00ts from Solana to Ethereum sidechain network Polygon\u2014though they then moved y00ts to the Ethereum mainnet and returned a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ni used to try to move mountains to appease the community in times of chaos. every single time it's backfired. the truth is, on the internet you either stand by your conviction or you're a pussy. i've been a pussy in the past. like the bridge off SOL. everyone in the community\u2026 \u2014 Frank (33.3%) (@frankdegods) May 16, 2024\n\nMaking the decision to bridge the projects off of the Solana blockchain happened as the community was in a state of panic following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, which preceded Solana\u2019s price collapsing to a low of about $8\u2014roughly 97% from its 2021 peak.\n\nFrank, feeling the pressure, made the call to move the projects to the Ethereum ecosystem, which houses the most valuable NFT projects. He framed the move at the time as one designed to elevate DeGods into the big leagues of NFT culture.\n\n\"Like the bridge off SOL,\u201d Frank wrote. \u201cEveryone in the community was panicking (myself included) during FTX. I tried to fix their anxiety. In reality, I was just being a pussy.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrank contrasted his past actions with his current mindset, emphasizing the importance of standing by your convictions.\n\n\"The truth is, on the internet you either stand by your convictions or you're a pussy,\" he tweeted. Frank stressed that succumbing to short-term pressures and seeking immediate approval often backfires. It\u2019s a lesson he learned by leading one of the most prominent NFT projects, and one that has faced considerable challenges\u2014many self-inflicted, as he admitted.\n\nFrank recently announced the launch of an optional bridge back to Solana for both DeGods and y00ts. This move allows the community to decide whether to stay on Ethereum or return to Solana, reflecting his desire to provide flexibility and choice. There are no strong-armed incentives this time around. It's just an option.\n\n\"I said I want to allow our community to come back home and I meant it. I still do,\u201d he wrote, though they launched the latest bridge with decidedly less fanfare than the original.\n\nDecrypt reached out to Frank for additional comment, but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nFrank\u2019s tweet offers a raw and honest look at the challenges of leading an NFT project amid the constant demands of holders, particularly amid a diminished market for such assets. The bridge back to Solana and increasing openness about the past appear to be moves to atone for lingering regrets, all while the projects attempt to move forward.\n\nyou can now bridge your DeGods & y00ts between solana & ethereum. pic.twitter.com/EXCIwcvbY5 \u2014 de (@delabsxyz) May 1, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLooking forward, Frank expressed his belief in building a robust and resilient community, rather than one that constantly seeks validation through reactive measures.\n\n\"I believe that antifragility is the answer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat's my conviction. Not just building the best community, but the strongest one.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) buyers held the price floor at the $2.9k support level, as selling pressure continued to persist. Over the past month, ETH has traded between a broad price range with $3.2k serving as the range high and $2.9k serving as the range low.\n\nWith ETH trading just above the $2.9k support level, it has presented buyers with an opportunity to leverage the price zone for a possible reversal.\n\nPrice Range Offers Long Opportunity\n\nETH\u2019s latest price rejection came at the range high of $3.2k on May 6. This brought another wave of selling pressure that saw the altcoin retest the range low of $2.9k. However, it also presented an opportunity for buyers to rally.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nAnalyzing the previous price action in the trading range showed that ETH had successfully achieved bullish rebounds thrice from the support level. This makes it a solid price zone for buyers with the tendency for a repeat of the price movement.\n\nA look at the chart indicators indicated bullish movement. Capital inflows rose to +0.08 as indicated by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). Yet, the selling pressure kept the Relative Strength Index (RSI) under the neutral 50 mark. Bulls will need the RSI to flip bullish for a sustained upward rally.\n\nBuyers can consider entries at the current market price of $2.9k with a target zone of $3.1k to $3.2k. However, a bearish candle close below the $2.9k support level would invalidate the bullish thesis and interested buyers would have to consider the $2.7k support level for new entries.\n\nETH Long/Short Ratio | Coinglass\n\nTraders in the futures market leaned slightly bullish on the higher timeframes which could serve as encouragement for spot traders. However, the tight margins mean the trades could easily swing either way and open long positions should be managed properly to avoid getting caught out by sharp price drops.\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "content": "This week has been notably bullish for the cryptocurrency market as the Bitcoin price showed a notable rally from $60000 to $67000. Amid a sudden change in market dynamics the meme sector often shows a major move due to their inherent volatile nature and susceptible to speculating trading. The opportunity seekers can consider Ethereum based meme coins to buy such as Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and MOG Coin (MOG) projecting the potential of substantial growth.\n\nThe Meme coin frenzy is abuzz in the crypto space, with Solana-based and Ethereum-based meme coins leading the charge. Ethereum\u2019s popularity in the meme coin sector stems from several factors. It has a vast user base, ensuring extensive reach and adoption. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s integration with DeFi applications offers added utility to meme coins.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s growing presence, Ethereum\u2019s established network and extensive ecosystem continue to dominate the meme coin landscape, making it the go-to platform for these digital assets.\n\n1. Meme Coins To Buy \u2013 Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues its impressive rise in decentralized finance, marked by a robust 12% value surge. Known as the second meme coin, SHIB has shown a 7% increase over the past week, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nCurrently priced at $0.00002447, SHIB is poised for further growth and maintains its upward momentum. It holds the 11th spot on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market cap of $14.42 billion.\n\nThis ascent is driven by several factors, including heightened trading activity, strategic token burns, and the rise of other meme coins like BONK, BOME, and WIF. Additionally, the rollout of Shibarium plays a significant role in SHIB\u2019s appeal.\n\nThese elements collectively make Shiba Inu an attractive prospect for potential investors aiming for substantial returns.\n\n2. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, is also gaining significant attention. With a current market cap of $4.04 billion, Pepe coin has secured the 24th position in market rankings. The Pepe price stands at $0.000009691, experiencing a remarkable 482% surge over the past year. This performance marks PEPE as the leading meme coin on CoinMarketCap.\n\nOver the past week, PEPE has seen a significant 20% rise, solidifying its status as a key player in the altcoin market. Its recent value surge following a bullish breakout positions PEPE as a prime option for investors looking to capitalize on the altcoin season in the 2024 bull run.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI), initially known as a meme coin, has now made significant strides in the Web3 space. Incorporating aspects of the Metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it has earned the nickname \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto.\u201d Floki\u2019s blend of meme appeal and real-world utility sets it apart in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nAccessible on both the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, Floki is available as BEP-20 and ERC-20 tokens, respectively. FLOKI recently experienced a notable surge following the approval of a major token burn proposal by the FLOKI DAO.\n\nThis development, along with recent major listings and exchange integrations, has sparked optimism within the FLOKI community, suggesting a potential continued rise.\n\nCurrently, the Floki price is $0.0002007, showing an 11% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite this, it saw a significant 15% increase over the past week. The crypto community is watching closely, anticipating further gains in the 2024 bull run.\n\n4. MOG Coin (MOG)\n\nMOG Coin (MOG) is also making waves in the cryptocurrency world with its unique meme-driven approach. MOG Coin price value now stands at $0.0\u202606229, marking a 0.10% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nSince the start of the year, MOG has skyrocketed by an impressive 3753%, positioning itself as a top affordable meme cryptocurrency for potentially massive gains in the 2024 bullish market.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum meme coins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki, and MOG are poised for impressive returns in the 2024 bull run. With the market\u2019s upward trend, these coins present promising opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the crypto market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

After a sequence of lower highs, BTC could change the market structure if it manages a stable close above the $65,500 resistance level.\n\nThis is likely, provided BTC holders keep their profit appetite in check and buyer momentum increases. The higher lows on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show a growing bullish trend. Traders looking to enter long positions for BTC may consider waiting for a higher reading on the RSI.\n\nA stable close above $65,500 on the one-day time frame would encourage more buy orders, with the ensuing buying pressure sending Bitcoin price to $70,000. Beyond this level, BTC would have a chance at taking back the $73,777 peak. Notably, the DXY Compare indicator is also dropping, which has often displayed a countercurrent flow against BTC price.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders book profits for the Wednesday god candle, Bitcoin price could drop. A slip below $63,354 would spook panic sellers like it did on two recent occasions, May 9 and 13, where BTC was rejected from the aforementioned level.\n\nIn a dire case, Bitcoin price could descend below the ascending trendline and ultimately fall below the $60,630 support level. Below this level, BTC could roll over to $58,000, or worse, $56,552, levels last tested on May 1.\n\nAlso Read: Will GameStop stock resurgence have downstream effect on BTC and alts?\n\n$3,212 level is critical for Ethereum price\u2019s upside potential\n\nEthereum price is attempting to reclaim ground above the ascending trendline after a slip below on Tuesday. The governing chart pattern is a falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal technical formation. For the 26% target objective to be realized, however, ETH must manage a candlestick close above $3,212.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased seller momentum could see Ethereum price drop.

        "title": "What is Mantle Network (MNT): exploring Ethereum's first modular Layer-2 solution - OKX",
        "content": "Mantle Network is a pioneering modular Layer-2 solution designed to help scale the Ethereum network efficiently, handling more transactions faster than before. The tool achieves this by bundling transactions together using Optimistic Rollup technology, reducing gas fees and speeding up transaction times.\n\nIt's understandable why the Mantle Network and its technology has gained plenty of interest, with scalability a hot topic among crypto commentators. By providing a fast and cost-effective solution, Mantle Network aims to make decentralized applications (DApps) more accessible and user-friendly for all on Ethereum.\n\nCould it be a catalyst that unlocks more of Ethereum\u2019s potential? Read on as we explore Mantle Network and its functionality, the advantages it brings to the space, the role of the project's MNT token, and more.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMantle Network's unique modular design improves performance and handles Ethereum's blockchain trilemma by separating execution, consensus, settlement, and storage.\n\nMantle Network uses Optimistic Rollup tech to speed up Ethereum transactions and reduce gas fees.\n\nInitially called BitDAO, Mantle is now backed by Bybit. This provides financial support and EVM compatibility for seamless Ethereum contract integration.\n\nMantle Network aims to lower fees and boost speeds to make DApps more user-friendly and accessible by increasing scalability.\n\nThe project's native token, MNT, plays an important part in the network's security and efficiency, and supports community governance.\n\nWhat is Mantle Network?\n\nMantle Network is an advanced Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. It uses Optimistic Rollup technology to increase transaction speeds and lower gas fees. Transactions are processed off-chain, but still settled on Ethereum to capitalize on the network's security.\n\nOriginally known as BitDAO, Mantle Network is backed by Bybit, a crypto exchange. This relationship not only provides the project with financial support but also helps attract a sizable user base, positioning Mantle Network as a strong contender in the Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nMantle Network is built around a unique modular architecture. Unlike other blockchains, it separates execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into specialized modules. This modular design not only enhances scalability and performance but also maintains the network's compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a result, existing Ethereum applications can migrate to Mantle Network with minimal modifications.\n\nMantle Network's Optimistic Rollup technology assumes transactions are valid and only checks for fraud if needed, improving efficiency. Meanwhile, the tool incorporates advanced data availability technologies like EigenLayer, which helps reduce the fragmentation of security on Ethereum and bolsters security for DApps using Ethereum-based modules. For Mantle Network users, this provides cheaper and more accessible data storage while inheriting Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nMantel Network's integration of governance and utility drives the ecosystem's economic model, providing network security, functionality, and the maintenance of a decentralized and efficient blockchain environment. As a consequence, the technology's unique features and strong support make it a promising contributor to Ethereum's future scalability.\n\nHow Mantle Network works, and its advantages\n\nMantle Network comprises a variety of advanced tools and technologies that combine at Layer-2 to boost Ethereum's scalability. Read on to understand the network's architecture and the advantages it brings.\n\nValidator nodes and transaction compression\n\nValidator nodes are essential to Mantle Network's operation, and they bundle user transactions into compressed blocks. This compression reduces the size of the associated data, reducing gas fees and increasing transaction throughput.\n\nOptimistic Rollup technology\n\nOptimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid by default and only verify them if there's a challenge. This allows Mantle Network to handle a greater volume of transactions quickly and at a lower cost. When a batch of transactions is processed, it's posted to the Ethereum mainnet as \"calldata,\" a cheaper storage method that makes sure the data is accessible without overloading the Ethereum network.\n\nIf a user suspects a transaction is invalid, they can submit a fraud proof. The Ethereum mainnet then checks the transaction to make sure it's valid. If the transaction is fraudulent, the validator's bond is slashed, providing a strong incentive for honest behavior.\n\nEthereum compatibility and a modular architecture\n\nMantle Network supports Ethereum contracts and tools by allowing developers to quickly move their DApps to the network with minimal steps.\n\nMeanwhile, the network's modular architecture enhances its overall efficiency by separating the execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability functions into distinct layers. This modular approach improves performance and addresses scalability, security, and decentralization challenges \u2014 often called the blockchain trilemma.\n\nData availability and security\n\nMantle Network uses EigenLayer's EigenDA to ensure accessible and secure transaction data. This advanced technique offers high throughput while protecting data integrity.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of Mantle Network?\n\nWhile the functionality explored above brings a host of advantages to users of Mantle Network, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind.\n\nOptimistic Rollups can be complex\n\nOptimistic Rollups are complex. They assume transactions are valid, which can lead to delays if a transaction is challenged. This fraud-proofing process takes time, which can be a problem for applications that need immediate confirmation.\n\nCentralization risks exist\n\nOne concern is the risk of centralization, especially with the control of the sequencer in Optimistic Rollups. At first, the sequencer might be centralized, posing security and operational risks.\n\nAlthough Mantle Network plans to decentralize its sequencer to lower these risks, the transition process itself could still have weak points and cause a single point of failure.\n\nOver-dependence on Ethereum\n\nMantle Network relies on Ethereum for security, but this can be a double-edged sword. While it benefits from Ethereum's robust security, the network has also been affected by congestion and high gas prices on the mainnet. This can hurt Mantle Network's performance and cost-effectiveness during busy times on Ethereum.\n\nCompetition within the Layer-2 space\n\nAnother challenge for Mantle Network is the competition from other Layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. To stay competitive, Mantle Network must keep innovating and growing its ecosystem. That requires a lot of resources and a constant commitment to development to stay ahead.\n\nDevelopers face a learning Curve\n\nThere's a learning curve with Mantle Network's modular architecture. Although the modular design offers flexibility, it also adds complexity. Developers might need extra time and resources to understand the network's components, potentially slowing down development and deployment.\n\nWhat's the role of the MNT token in Mantle Network?\n\nMNT is the native token of Mantle Network. It's held in the Mantle Treasury and can therefore be considered \"not in circulation\", according to the project website. Meanwhile, the Mantle Governance process manages token distribution.\n\nMNT plays a variety of roles in the network.\n\nGovernance: MNT token holders can vote on important network decisions, such as upgrades, funding, and other key matters. Each token equals one vote, protecting a community-driven and decentralized Mantle Network.\n\nTransaction fees: Mantle Network uses the MNT token to pay transaction fees. It helps keep the network running and gives the token a purpose.\n\nStaking: You can stake MNT tokens to help secure the Mantle Network. This means locking up your tokens to support network functions like validating transactions.\n\nSupporting ecosystem growth: MNT tokens fund ecosystem growth initiatives, including supporting new projects, grants, and other development activities that expand the Mantle Network ecosystem.\n\nWhat's next for Mantle Network?\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, the Mantle Network is expected to grow and develop in several key areas.\n\nMost notably, Mantle Network's technology will reportedly be enhanced, with a particular focus on its modular architecture. The network's modular design simplifies the process of making upgrades and scalability improvements by separating functions like execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability into distinct layers. As a result, hard forks are no longer needed.\n\nDecentralization is also expected to be an important focus for the project going forward. Governance and decentralization are already a priority for Mantle Network. As the first DAO-based Layer-2 solution, the project emphasizes decentralized governance. Token holders decide on protocol upgrades and fund allocations, making sure any changes align with community needs. Mantle Network plans to decentralize its sequencer, making the network more resilient, secure, and less prone to censorship.\n\nEnhancements to staking on the network are another area of development, particularly with the Mantle Liquidity Staking Protocol (LSP). With LSP, users can stake ETH for yield-bearing mETH, making the network more useful and offering further incentives to the community.\n\nWhat's more, Mantle Network is expected to form new strategic partnerships aimed at enhancing interoperability and expanding the ecosystem. These collaborations should connect Mantle Network with DeFi protocols and Web3 applications, strengthening its market position.\n\nThe final word\n\nEthereum's scalability challenges are well documented, and Mantle Network is another Layer-2 solution that aims to ease this limitation for users and developers. The tool uses Optimistic Rollup technology to speed up transactions and reduce gas fees on Ethereum, but its influence goes further still.\n\nMantle Network's modular architecture provides compatibility with existing Ethereum applications, while its Optimistic Rollup technology assumes transactions are valid and only checks for fraud if needed, improving efficiency further.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve while facing competition from established and emerging projects, solutions such as Mantle Network provide a compelling reason to use and build on Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum loses ultrasound money status.\n\nTotal supply has increased by over 100,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has transitioned from being labeled \u201cultrasound money\u201d due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which has altered its deflationary characteristics.\n\nThis upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, leading to a slowdown in the rate at which Ether is removed from circulation.\n\nThe total supply of ETH has increased, and there has been a recent rise in the supply of ETH on exchanges. How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?\n\nEthereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months.\n\nFrom November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH\u2019s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.\n\nHowever, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum\u2019s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.\n\nAn examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March.\n\nDuring this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum\u2019s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics.\n\nAlso, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.\n\nEthereum sees a decline in overall fees\n\nThe recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions.\n\nData from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.\n\nThis fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times.\n\nAs of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million.\n\nThis downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges climbs\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances.\n\nThe increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.\n\nAs of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.\n\nDespite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.\n\nFurthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.\n\nETH continues to trend below $3,000\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nBoth the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line.\n\nHowever, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick."

        "content": "Among the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, BlockDAG emerges as a notable contender amidst the volatile Ethereum price predictions and Fantom's (FTM) declining market cap. Recently showcased at London\u2019s Piccadilly Circus, BlockDAG has captured the attention of major investors and is quickly becoming a digital asset to watch.\n\nFantom (FTM) Continues Growth Despite Market Fluctuations\n\nDespite some setbacks, Fantom has impressively doubled its market cap to $2.6 billion. Although there has been a dip in token revenue, the platform's growth in USD and total value locked (TVL) demonstrates a solid base for expansion. Enhanced by reduced staking requirements, Fantom is bolstering its network security and decentralization, making it a compelling alternative to Ethereum due to its focus on scalability and low transaction fees.\n\nEthereum Faces Price Resistance\n\nAs a foundational platform for smart contracts, Ethereum is currently grappling with price resistance around the $3,000 threshold. A successful break above this level could signal an upward trend, however, projections currently indicate potential drops to $2,880 or even lower. This volatility poses risks for short-term investors but could represent an opportunity for those looking at the longer-term potential. Despite these challenges, Ethereum continues to be a central hub for developers and a key player in the decentralized applications landscape.\n\nBlockDAG: Innovating and Captivating the Crypto World\n\nBlockDAG is quickly gaining traction in the crypto community with its distinctive approach to mining and engaging its community. Highlighted by its vibrant display in Piccadilly Circus and an event at the Las Vegas Sphere, BlockDAG is on the radar of many crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe upcoming launch of its X1 mobile mining app on June 1 is particularly exciting, promising to make mining accessible and efficient through a user-friendly platform. This app will enable smartphone users to mine BDAG coins without excessive battery or data use and will feature a leaderboard and referral system to foster a robust community ecosystem.\n\nBlockDAG: Poised to Be the Top Crypto Investment in 2024?\n\nWith the crypto landscape constantly evolving, new opportunities arise as established entities like Ethereum and Fantom navigate their own challenges. Amid this, BlockDAG stands out with its innovative solutions and community-focused initiatives.\n\nThe launch of the X1 app and its focus on making crypto mining accessible positions BlockDAG as an exciting new project that could lead the market. For investors searching for fresh and promising opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector, BlockDAG offers an appealing option, especially with its ongoing presale capturing significant investor interest.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

        "title": "BlockDAG\u2019s Dashboard Upgrade Enhances Transparency, Outshining Spot Ethereum ETFs And Render's Market Outlook - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "While enthusiasm wanes for spot Ethereum ETFs due to underwhelming performance, and Render demonstrates potential for recovery despite a recent price dip, BlockDAG has made significant strides with a major upgrade to its dashboard. This enhancement bolsters transparency and equips users with advanced tools for analytics, propelling BlockDAG to the forefront of the cryptocurrency scene with an impressive $26.9 million in presales.\n\nDeclining Enthusiasm for Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nInterest in spot Ethereum ETFs has dwindled as Ethereum continues to underperform relative to its peers. The cautious approach by the SEC, especially under the leadership of Gary Gensler, has resulted in delayed approvals for Ethereum ETF applications, contrasting with the earlier approvals for Bitcoin ETFs. The withdrawal of Grayscale\u2019s ETH ETF application has further fueled skepticism, contributing to a pessimistic outlook for near-term approval. Ethereum's stagnant market activity has led to disinterest and uncertainty among investors, reflecting a broader sense of market apprehension.\n\nRender Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations\n\nRender has recently seen a 4% decrease in its price but remains a subject of optimism as its trading volume has risen by 27%. Currently priced at $10.84, Render is expected to rebound from this minor slump, viewed by analysts as a normal market correction. Predictive technical indicators suggest a bullish trend, with Render potentially climbing to $12.21 and aiming to revisit its peak of $13.86.\n\nComprehensive Dashboard Upgrade and Mining Innovations by BlockDAG\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s latest dashboard upgrade introduces a new dimension of user engagement and transparency. The dashboard provides detailed transaction insights, enabling investors to effectively track their investment activities. Features like 'My Transactions' display detailed histories in various currencies such as BTC, ETH, and USDT. The 'Live Transactions' functionality offers real-time purchase visibility and categorizes investments based on the USD amount, enhancing the competitive aspect with a leaderboard that highlights the top 30 investors.\n\nAdditionally, BlockDAG continues to innovate in the mining sector with the launch of the X10 miner from its X series. This device boasts a 100 MH/s hash rate, capable of mining up to 200 BDAG daily, anticipated to deliver substantial returns at the official launch price. The X10 utilizes ASIC technology for high efficiency and low noise, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced miners.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Position as a Market Leader in Cryptocurrency\n\nAs BlockDAG commences its twelfth batch with a compelling price of $0.0075 per coin, it has effectively raised $26.9 million by selling more than 9.1 billion coins. This achievement highlights BlockDAG as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. With uncertain futures for spot Ethereum ETFs and a recovering Render market, BlockDAG\u2019s innovative dashboard and mining solutions establish new standards in market transparency and user engagement. These strategic advancements position BlockDAG not only as a pioneer in technological innovation but also as a lucrative option for investors seeking substantial tools and potential high returns in the evolving crypto market.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"
