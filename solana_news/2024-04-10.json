        "title": "What is EIP-7251 (MaxEB) in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "EIP-7251, also known as MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for Ethereum that aims to address the issue of redundant network validators.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum has led to the continued increase of validators who participate in the network\u2019s consensus process. Ethereum researchers have expressed concerns about the potential instability in the network due to the continued increase of validator sets.\n\nRead on as we discuss EIP-7251 and its role in addressing these concerns.\n\nWhat Is EIP-7251 (MaxEB)?\n\nEIP-7251, or MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for the Ethereum network that aims to address the issue of \u2018redundant validators.\u2019\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum amount a validator can stake from the current 32 ETH to 2048 ETH while maintaining the minimum staking balance limit at 32 ETH.\n\nThe goal is to allow large node operators to consolidate their validator sets, potentially reducing the number of validators and increasing the network\u2019s efficiency. Validators won\u2019t have to fully exit and re-enter the protocol to merge their effective balances.\n\nFor solo stakers, EIP-7251 will enable them to earn compounding rewards and stake their ether in more flexible increments. For example, a large node operator with 2048 ETH can consolidate 64 validator sets into one, while a solo staker with a 45 ETH balance only has to dedicate resources to one validator set.\n\nAs of March 2024, the Ethereum network has over 950,000 validator sets. Theoretically, this means the network is truly decentralized. However, while the network recognizes each validator as a unique entity, a party can run several validators on the same device.\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum effective balance limit to allow consolidation and accurately reflect the network\u2019s decentralization levels.\n\nHow Does EIP-7251 Work?\n\nEIP-7251 proposes to reduce the number of validators while maintaining high economic security on the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-7251 relies on four key features that make it work:\n\nCreating a minimum balance and increasing the maximum balance: EIP-7251 proposes creating a minimum activation balance of 32 ETH and increasing the maximum effective balance from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH.\n\nCombination of multiple validator sets: With the increased maximum limit, large node operators combine their validators without cycling through the exit and activation queues. This helps speed up the staking process while decreasing costs due to the in-protocol consolidation.\n\nAdding execution layer partial withdrawals: Execution layer messages trigger partial withdrawals in addition to full exits. For example, a validator with 200 ETH staked can remove 50 ETH without exiting. This increases the flexibility of staking configurations, allowing validators to control the moment and amount they withdraw.\n\nCustom effective balance ceiling: EIP-7251 enables validators to customize the maximum amount that activates partial withdrawals.\n\nReasons For and Against MaxEB\n\nThere are several compelling reasons to make the case to increase the maximum effective balance:\n\nAddressing Consensus Layer Challenges\n\nUnder the current limits, the network experiences high withdrawal loads from exceeding the maximum effective balance. Additionally, the large validator sets strain the resources and cause network delays.\n\nConsequently, reducing the number of validators addresses this problem, especially as the network continues to scale.\n\nAllows for Future Upgrades\n\nUpgrades to the Ethereum network, as noted on the roadmap, such as single-slot finality and enshrined proposer-builder separation, rely on a low validator set. The consolidation helps lay the groundwork for the implementation of such upgrades.\n\nCompetitive Solo Staking\n\nWhile large node operators appear to be the key EIP-7251 beneficiaries, solo stakers also have something to gain. Individual stakers can stake flexible amounts of ETH and enjoy the compounding rewards.\n\nReduced Overhead Costs\n\nFor large node operators, the 32 ETH ceiling presents the logistical challenge of running thousands of validators on a single machine. EIP-7251 minimizes the hassle by reducing the number of validators. This also brings the operating cost down, which maximizes the returns.\n\nThere are several reasons against MaxEB:\n\nSlashing Risk\n\nA Proof of Stake (PoS) network such as Ethereum promotes economic security through slashing. Slashing involves partial or full destruction of a validator\u2019s staked assets if they are deemed responsible for actions that threaten the network\u2019s security. MaxEB raises the maximum limit a validator can stake, increasing their slashing risk.\n\nThe Ethereum community is aware of this risk and proposes modification of the slashing penalties. The idea is to introduce non-linear slashing mechanisms that will encourage consolidation.\n\nComplexity\n\nThe current ceiling of 32 ETH per validator makes it simple to consider different consensus aspects. Raising it to 2048 ETH may draw focus away from other critical areas. This may lead to a drop in the network\u2019s security levels.\n\nDecentralization\n\nAs of March 2024, there are over 950,000 validator sets on the Ethereum network. Consolidation under MaxEB will significantly reduce that number. Consequently, there might be an imbalance in committee influence. This goes against the principles of decentralization, as a malicious actor can potentially dominate a committee and execute a 51% attack.\n\nRegulatory Interference\n\nWith auto-compounding validator rewards possible after implementing EIP-7251, regulators may find grounds to argue that ETH is an interest-bearing security.\n\nCurrently, validators are considered service providers who earn rewards for securing the network. Implementing EIP-7251 will lead to more rewards for validators with a higher balance, which may offer regulators grounds to argue that being a validator is the equivalent of a savings account in a traditional bank.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEIP-7251 proposes significantly reducing the number of validators without making major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are key issues that the community needs to address to ensure its implementation doesn\u2019t affect the network negatively. The community has acknowledged challenges such as slashing concerns and has made proposals to address them. However, others, like regulatory concerns, have yet to be fully explored.\n\nOverall, EIP-7251 presents a pathway to an efficient Ethereum network, provided the community addresses all concerns before implementation."

        "title": "NFTs and the Environment: What You Need to Know - Investopedia",
        "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ordinals are assets that are tokenized using a blockchain. Because blockchains use energy, NFTs can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change through their production, exchange, and storage.\n\nLearn more about NFTs and ordinals, their environmental impacts, and steps users can take to be more aware.\n\nKey Takeaways Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may contribute to wasteful energy use and carbon output, depending on how they are produced.\n\nEthereum is the leading blockchain used to mint NFTs. It transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on Sept. 15, 2022. The transition, called The Merge, caused a significant reduction in NFT energy use.\n\n\n\nBlockchain developers and communities are working to find ways to lessen or eliminate the environmental impact NFTs have.\n\nUsers can lower their impact by choosing blockchains with less energy-intensive requirements.\n\n\n\nHow NFTs Impact the Environment\n\nNFTs are generally built on Ethereum or blockchains similar to it. Ordinals are similar to NFTs but created on the Bitcoin blockchain or blockchains like it.\n\nDepending on the programming and design of the blockchain on which these NFTs and ordinals reside, these transactions can consume significant amounts of energy.\n\n\n\nThis article uses \"NFT\" to refer to NFTs and ordinals for brevity.\n\nEnergy consumption occurs when an NFT is minted, bought, sold, and stored. Here's a look at each of these stages of the NFT lifecycle:\n\nNFT is minted : The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process.\n\n: The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process. NFT is listed : Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price.\n\n: Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price. NFT is sold/purchased : When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner.\n\n: When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner. Storage: The asset\u2014a file, image, and so on\u2014is stored off-chain, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS).\n\nMinting an NFT is a separate transaction on a blockchain, as is transferring ownership during a sale. All transactions use energy.\n\nNon-Transactional Energy Use\n\nNFTs also require storage, even if there isn't transaction activity. These tokenized assets are generally digital assets such as documents, images, and videos, all requiring digital space. Blockchains themselves are not equipped to store these assets, so only the tokens (alphanumeric sequences that are the result of hashed data) are stored on the blockchains. The assets are stored elsewhere, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). The IPFS was created as a decentralized and distributed storage system for platforms that need it, like blockchains.\n\nData storage requires energy. As the number of NFTs grows, the overall energy consumption and storage space of NFTs are likely to increase.\n\nElectronic Waste\n\nIn addition to energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste) is an issue. If a blockchain relies on mining, like Bitcoin does, hardware is continuously improved and upgraded.\n\nMining typically uses hardware such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems. This hardware can quickly become outdated\u2014it's also subject to 24-hour 100% usage, which wears electronic circuits out. Updating and replacing faulty equipment creates tons of e-waste.\n\nE-waste contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into the environment if improperly disposed of. Additionally, the processing of e-waste is energy-intensive and can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Hardware that isn't recycled ends up in landfills, releasing toxins into the environment.\n\nRecycling e-waste significantly lowers the energy consumption of manufacturing new electronic products by reducing the mining and processing of new raw materials, particularly precious metals.\n\nImproving the Sustainability of NFTs\n\nGiven the potential environmental impact of NFTs, there is a movement to develop more sustainable blockchain and NFT protocols. Additionally, artists, buyers, and sellers can choose to use NFT platforms and blockchains that use less energy. These would likely include less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms and, to a point, blockchains with hotspots in areas that use renewable energy sources.\n\nTo determine blockchain sustainability, you must inspect where nodes are located and determine the significant energy sources in those areas. For example, the Ethereum network has 2,900 nodes (the most) in the U.S., the energy generation of which is 79% from petroleum, natural gas, and coal. The U.S. also has about 1,600 reachable Bitcoin nodes. It's safe to say that platforms using a blockchain with a significant presence in the U.S. are not as energy efficient as they could be. However, Ethereum uses less energy, so in the U.S. it's a better choice.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nBlockchain mining and hardware recycling often rely on burning fossil fuels, leaving a significant environmental footprint. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy, offer eco-friendly alternatives to power these operations.\n\nSolar Energy : Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity.\n\n: Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity.

Biomass Energy: Biomass energy consists of organic materials. Plants, crops, and agricultural waste can be burned to generate heat or converted into biofuels.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms\n\nShifting from Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism for Bitcoin and other mining-based blockchains, to more energy-efficient ones, such as Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, can significantly reduce the environmental impact NFTs have. PoS eliminates the competitive mining and reward process altogether.\n\nPoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW because PoS does not require miners to expend energy in a competition to solve a cryptographic problem. Instead, PoS uses a system called staking, where validators who have staked cryptocurrency\u2014basically locking it from being used\u2014on the network are randomly chosen to verify transactions and propose new blocks.\n\nEthereum is expected to consume about 5.36 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, while Bitcoin is expected to consume about 173.19 terawatt hours annually, more than Poland and Egypt.\n\nSome notable PoS blockchains include:\n\nEthereum : The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more. The NFT marketplace OpenSea is built on Ethereum.\n\n: The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more.

Tezos: The Tezos blockchain hosts several NFT marketplaces, such as Rarible, which operates an NFT marketplace and supports the artistic creation of NFTs.\n\nWhy Does an NFT Use So Much Energy? Non-fungible tokens use energy because they require a blockchain network to conduct work verifying them as transactions. More transactions require more energy.\n\nAre NFTs Harmful to the Environment? Creating, selling, and buying an NFT require energy and hardware use, which can lead to pollution or e-waste that would not otherwise be necessary if they did not exist.\n\nWhat Is the Carbon Footprint of an NFT? It is hard to determine what one NFT costs regarding carbon generation, but it's safe to say that they add to human activities' total carbon output.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNFTs leave a carbon footprint at every stage of their existence, but conscious choices and prioritizing eco-friendly practices in how they are created, traded, and stored can offset their potential impact on the environment.\n\nCryptocurrency developers can reduce NFT energy consumption by improving or switching to less energy-intensive blockchain consensus mechanisms. NFT minting and hosting platforms can use blockchains that don't require large amounts of energy.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Here is Shiba Inu Price if SHIB Hits Ethereum Market Cap - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see its price skyrocket by more than 24 times if it grows to capture the current market cap of leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH).\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s market cap has seen a drastic decline since the cryptocurrency collapsed from the $0.000045 high on March 5. At this peak price, SHIB\u2019s market cap hit a high of $26.5 billion, putting it among the top 10 assets by valuation and bringing it closer to flipping Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nHowever, SHIB\u2019s market cap has dropped to the current figure of $16.7 billion, representing a 37% drop from the recent high. Consequently, Shiba Inu has ceded its position within the top 10, descending to the 12th position as both Toncoin (TON) and Avalanche (AVAX) have surpassed it.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the prevailing turbulence, Shiba Inu enthusiasts expect SHIB to eventually recover, with projections of a possible push above Dogecoin. Such a scenario would result in mind-blowing price gains for Shiba Inu.\n\nShiba Inu Price if It Hits Ethereum Market Cap\n\nAmid these sentiments, we assessed how much the price of Shiba Inu would be if it soared to hit the market cap of the king altcoin, Ethereum. ETH has solidified its spot as the largest altcoin in the market, boasting a market capitalization of $407.58 billion.\n\nNotably, Ethereum accounts for 15.8% of the global cryptocurrency market cap of $2.58 trillion. At the current valuation, Ethereum\u2019s price currently sits at $3,388. We leveraged a data analytics tool to evaluate how much Shiba Inu\u2019s price would be if it equaled ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe data indicates that Shiba Inu\u2019s valuation is about 0.04x under Ethereum\u2019s, emphasizing the massive gap between both assets. If SHIB captures Ethereum\u2019s market cap, its price will skyrocket by as much as 24.36x to reach $0.0006898, representing a new ATH.\n\nInterestingly, some analytical platforms have projected timelines for Shiba Inu to reach prices around this region. The Crypto Basic revealed in February that Changelly analysts expect SHIB to reach $0.000712 by 2030. At this price, Shiba Inu\u2019s market cap would soar to $419.5 billion, above Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSHIB\u2019s Current Position\n\nNotably, SHIB\u2019s all-time high market cap was $43 billion, attained on Oct. 28, 2021, when Shiba Inu soared to its ATH price of $0.00008616, according to CoinGecko data. Shiba Inu would need to rally by another 206% to reclaim this all-time high price and slip into a price discovery phase.\n\nThe crypto market is already on a recovery path following the recent turmoil, with prices witnessing gradual growth over the last two days. Shiba Inu has leveraged this campaign to push toward reclaiming the $0.000028, $0.000029 and $0.000030 levels.\n\nAmid a 2.6% rise over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu currently trades for $0.00002810. SHIB has reclaimed $0.000028, but its position above this price level remains delicate. It attempted to push above $0.000029 earlier but faced stern opposition."

        "content": "Inflation has increased by 3.5%.\n\nEthereum has seen over 2% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum [ETH] experienced a positive response following the release of the latest CPI report. This report garnered significant attention and discussions among traders, with many expressing a greater inclination towards crypto assets in light of the findings.\n\nCPI shows 3.5% inflation increase\n\nThe CPI for March surpassed expectations, rising by 0.4% compared to the anticipated 0.3% and February\u2019s 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI increased by 3.5%, slightly higher than the expected 3.4% and February\u2019s 3.2%.\n\nYear-over-year core CPI saw a slight uptick to 3.8%, slightly surpassing the expected 3.7% and remaining unchanged from February\u2019s figure. This data suggests that a rate cut is unlikely soon.\n\nAccording to Santiment data, this month\u2019s CPI report generated significant attention, evidenced by the highest number of mentions in social discussions. The social volume spiked to over 257, with social dominance reaching around 1.58%.\n\nAt the time of this writing, social volume had decreased to 49, while social dominance stood at 1.05%. The implications of this report have led to increased interest in crypto assets like Ethereum.\n\nBuy calls put Ethereum in a favorable position\n\nThe CPI report wasn\u2019t the sole topic driving increased interaction; discussions around buy and sell calls also saw heightened engagement. According to Santiment data, on 10th April, the social volume for buy calls reached 814, with a social dominance of 4.97%.\n\nConversely, the social volume for sell calls was 533, with a social dominance of 3.25%.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the buy social volume had decreased to 210, while the sell social volume was 144. Additionally, the buy social dominance stood at 4.48%, while the sell dominance was 3.07%.\n\nThese figures indicate a stronger inclination towards buying among traders, a sentiment reflected in Ethereum outflows.\n\nEthereum sees more exchange outflow\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow reveals that the increase in buy calls following the CPI report is mirrored in its exchange flow. Data showed that outflow dominated ETH exchange flow, with over 15,800 ETH leaving various exchanges on 10th April.\n\nAs of this writing, outflow continued to dominate, with over 800 ETH already withdrawn from exchanges. This suggests heightened activity in ETH buying and selling post-CPI report.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum continues to climb post-CPI\n\nThe daily timeframe chart showed that Ethereum closed with a gain on 10th April, suggesting that the CPI report did not have a negative effect.\n\nAnalysis of the chart revealed that ETH closed with over a 1% increase, trading at around $3,400. As of the latest data, the increase has persisted, with ETH trading at around $3,580, reflecting a further over 1% increase."

        "content": "Stream Finance, a newcomer to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s crypto derivatives space, successfully secured $1.5 million during its seed funding round. The round, led by Polychain with participation from angel investors, values Stream Finance at $20 million.\n\nThis financial boost has elevated the company\u2019s market valuation to an impressive $20 million. At the heart of Stream Trading\u2019s operation is its innovative protocol, which offers depositors the opportunity to engage in high-yield rate arbitrage trades.\n\nFor this service, the company imposes a fee of 10% or more, underscoring its revenue-generating mechanism.\n\nRapid Growth Amidst a Crypto Bull Market\n\nThe founding duo, Diogenes Casares and Solal Afota, swiftly assembled a talented team to leverage the ongoing crypto bull market. Their strategic moves are bearing fruit, as trading platforms across the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape are witnessing substantial gains.\n\nStream Trading, having just concluded its beta testing phase, has already amassed $5 million in total value locked, positioning it on the brink of profitability.\n\nMoreover, Casares has articulated a visionary trajectory for Stream Trading, aspiring to evolve into a leading decentralized perpetuals exchange. This ambition sets it on a competitive path against established names like dYdX within the nascent yet dynamic DeFi derivatives sector.\n\nDespite its nascent stage, Casares claims Stream is nearing profitability. Their protocol offers depositors access to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, with fees exceeding 10%. Stream\u2019s long-term vision is to become a decentralized perpetuals exchange, rivalling the likes of dYdX in the young, five-year-old DeFi derivatives market.\n\nCasares believes current protocols prioritize low fees over improving funding rates, the interest paid by traders speculating on asset prices. \u201cOur focus is on the funding rate side, not the swap fees,\u201d he stated.\n\nStream Trading differentiates itself by focusing on optimizing funding rates rather than merely reducing swap fees, a strategic pivot from the conventional approach adopted by most protocols.\n\nStream Trading\u2019s successful funding round highlights the innovative approaches being adopted by new entrants to carve out their niche."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, ETH is carving out what appears to be an ascending channel, a structure that could signal a steady climb toward $4,000.\n\nThe ascending channel is outlined by two upward sloping parallel lines on the chart. This pattern captures the swings of the price between higher highs and higher lows, showcasing a gradual but consistent upward trend.\n\nFor Ethereum, the lower line of the channel seems to be providing a stepping stone from which the price bounces back up, and the upper line is where the price peaks before retreating slightly.\n\nA key level to watch is the recent resistance Ethereum has encountered near the $3,500 level. A decisive push past this point could pave the way for a test of higher resistances, ultimately aiming for the channel's upper boundary and beyond to $4,000. Currently, the chart shows Ethereum hovering around $3,500, which aligns with the channel's midpoint \u2014 a crucial area for bulls to defend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $3,072 mark stands as the channel's lower boundary. As long as the price remains within the confines of the channel, optimism remains. A dip below, however, could signal a need to reassess the bullish scenario.\n\nLooking ahead, the main goal for Ethereum is to maintain its momentum within this ascending channel. A breakout above could confirm the bulls' strength, leading to a significant rally. On the flip side, a breakdown could shift market sentiment.\n\nShiba Inu's positive dynamic\n\nShiba Inu is showing the possibility of a volatility explosion as the asset is on the verge of reaching the tip of the aforementioned formation. This pattern is formed when the price of an asset consolidates within converging support and resistance lines, hinting that a significant price move could be on the horizon \u2014 either a sharp rise or a decline.\n\nThe pattern's apex draws nearer, suggesting that a big move is imminent. Symmetrical triangles are notorious for their unpredictability in terms of direction. The breakout could lead to a surge in price if it moves upward or a fall if it breaks down.\n\nCurrently, SHIB is trading within a tight range, and the specific price to watch is the triangle's upper boundary, around $0.00002776. A consistent move above this level could signal a breakout to the upside, with the next resistance possibly forming near the $0.00002987 mark. Conversely, if SHIB breaks below the triangle's lower support at $0.00002515, it may experience a downturn, with the next level of significant support at $0.00002236.\n\nThe future of SHIB, within this symmetrical triangle, remains unclear, and so does the direction of the token and its future. SHIB might leverage this pattern for a bullish breakout if the market remains bullish.\n\nCardano on reversal point\n\nCardano's indicators suggest an upcoming reversal. The asset has reached a crucial price level that, in the past, has served as a beginning point of a bullish reversal.\n\nADA is hovering around the $0.57 mark, a significant level that has historically acted as a pivot point. This price acted as a strong support in previous trading sessions, hinting at the potential for a bounce back. The critical resistance to overcome for a solid reversal stands at $0.62 which, if broken, could see ADA rally toward the next resistance point at $0.65.\n\nIf ADA fails to maintain this support level, the next significant floor is expected near the $0.5266 mark, where buyers may reemerge to bolster the price. This zone remains crucial for the bulls to defend to prevent further declines that could dampen the short-term outlook for ADA.\n\nA successful rebound from the current support could validate Cardano's readiness to climb. An upswing backed by increased trading volumes and positive market sentiment could carry ADA to retest its recent peaks and potentially establish new ones."

        "content": "Berlin, Germany, April 11th, 2024, Chainwire\n\nNektar Network - the multilayered Re-staking network is designed to optimize 's security model while scaling distributed solutions, paving the way for more decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThe team behind Diva Staking unveils the Nektar Network, a pioneering restaking ecosystem poised to redefine the Ethereum trust model and extend its utility across distributed systems. The Nektar Network launches with a vision to democratize Ethereum\u2019s validation process while addressing the challenges of centralization and resilience.\n\nPopularized by EigenLayer, already with $14 billion in re-staked ETH, Re-staking implies repurposing a staked asset to secure additional tasks or duties by the validators using such staked assets as collateral. Users can opt into Nektar to augment their staking activities, earning additional rewards from AVSs.\n\nNektar Network tackles critical challenges within the blockchain space by empowering different agents. Nektar facilitates the seamless establishment of PoS-based distributed systems, enhancing trust and security for applications utilizing its services.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving into a more sophisticated and developed landscape. There are now specialized actors vital for a smooth bootstrapping of the network. We are confident that with their help, the Nektar Community will grow at lightning speed to become one of the most relevant actors within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNektar Network aims to be a response to the growing problem of centralization in the Ethereum ecosystem. While there are major concerns about a limited number of actors controlling the validation layer, at a Re-staking level the ecosystem was in need of viable alternatives to diversify the growing interest in Re-staking. Nektar Network intends to position itself as the most resilient alternative within this vital component of Ethereum\u2019s scaling.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of Distributed Validation Technology (DVT) within Nektar enhances Ethereum's resilience, presenting a robust infrastructure for developers, operators, and validators to engage with the Ethereum network more securely and efficiently.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, liquid staking has democratized access to Ethereum validation. On the other, it has created a centralization problem where a handful of entities could, in theory, collude to control the network. Continuing down this path would contradict one of Ethereum\u2019s core tenets and send the wrong message to stakeholders. Nektar provides a restaking network as decentralized as possible, powered by DVT.\n\nUsers can find more information here.\n\nMedia inquiries\n\nRedhill (on behalf of Nektar Network)\n\nTien Ma\n\ntien@redhill.world\n\nAbout Nektar Network\n\nNektar Network is a multilayered restaking network built on top of Ethereum. It consists of components that together form a comprehensive incentives system designed to democratize access to Ethereum's trust model.\n\nFor more information about Nektar Network, users can visit our website or follow on Farcaster and X.\n\nAbout Diva Staking\n\nFounded in 2023, Diva Staking is the company behind Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). It aims to increase the decentralization of Ethereum staking through its proprietary DVT solution that balances the interests of stakers and operators. In January 2023, Diva Staking raised $3.5 million in seed funding from A&T Capital, OKX Ventures, Alphemy Capital, and Metaweb Ventures, among others.\n\nContactTien MaRedhill GmbHtien@redhill.asia\n\nThis article was originally published on Chainwire"

        "content": "Ethereum's recent price movement has shown that it's still significantly correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nWhales are accumulating Ethereum, with the aim to participate in the ETH restaking boom.\n\nThe SEC's recent Wells notice to decentralized exchange Uniswap could affect Ethereum, considering it is home to a large portion of DeFi.\n\nEthereum (ETH) showed signs of recovering its bullish momentum on Thursday, briefly rising to $3,618 as whales entered a buying spree. Despite the movement from whales, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wells notice to Uniswap could affect Ethereum in the long run.\n\nRead more: Ethereum extends correction as Van Eck CEO dampens chances of spot ETH ETF approval\n\nDaily digest market movers: Whales accumulation, Bitcoin correlation, Wells notice\n\nEthereum joined a host of other altcoins in trading in the green on Thursday after two days of sustaining a bearish move. Here are your key market movers for the largest smart contract blockchain:\n\nAfter ETH's slight increase on Thursday, large ETH whale Ox347 deposited 9000 ETH tokens to Binance at $3,560 in a bid to book profits, according to onchain insights from Spot On Chain. Although this is the whale's largest ETH deposit to date, its address still holds 29,738 ETH worth a whopping $106 million with an estimated profit of $68.5 million.\n\n\n\nDespite the profit-taking from whale Ox347, onchain data from Lookonchain indicates that some other whales are taking opposite actions:\n\n\n\nWhale 0x4359, who had earlier bought 10,309 ETH ($35.82 million) at the bottom of the price drop on Wednesday, withdrew another 3,092 ETH ($11.12 million) from Binance on Thursday. As a result, his total ETH withdrawals from Binance in the past three days have reached 24,044 ETH ($86.5 million).\n\n\n\nAnother whale, 0xACc7, withdrew 22,251 ETH ($80.06 million) from exchanges on Thursday, taking their total exchange withdrawals in the past three days to 33,925 ETH ($122.06 million).\n\n\n\nSome crypto community members have speculated that the whales' recent move may be to participate in the restaking boom that's heating up in DeFi, especially with the Mainnet launch of EigenLayer. Data from Lookonchain confirms this as whales/institutions withdrew ETH from Binance and staked it into Pendle and Bedrock.\n\nWhile the recent price increase may have several factors layered in, it shows Ethereum still maintains a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Like several other large-cap altcoins, Ethereum's price movement has largely mimicked Bitcoin's since the beginning of the year. Hence, the Bitcoin halving \u2013 less than eight days away \u2013 could prove critical in determining ETH's price movement in the coming days.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells notice to Ethereum's largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap. The Wells notice, a formal document indicating the SEC's intention to take legal action against an individual or firm, was issued based on claims that Uniswap operated as an unregistered securities broker and exchange.\n\n\n\nIf the SEC succeeds in taking legal action against Uniswap, it could significantly affect the broader DeFi landscape. This would have telling effects on Ethereum, the underlying home to roughly 80% of DeFi solutions. Earlier in March, the SEC had issued subpoenas to three firms that had dealings with the Ethereum Foundation. Many crypto community members have stated that the SEC aims to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum could be set for growth as Vitalik Butein shares update on its future\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue sideways movement\n\nETH's price has been following a sideways pattern after recovering from the one-week correction that followed the high of $4,094 on March 11. While traders expected a rally back to the $4,094 high when ETH tagged the key resistance of $3,730 on Monday, the price retraced. The continued sideways move indicates traders are exercising caution and are indecisive on whether to go long or short.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nRead more: Ethereum's price recovery looks imminent as ETF approval sees a glimmer hope\n\nThe constant switch between increased long and short liquidations in the past two weeks confirms this indecision. ETH may continue this sideways movement until key events like the Bitcoin halving and the SEC's spot ETH ETF approval decision take place. However, a bearish trend may begin if the price breaks key supports of $3,210 and $3,056 formed on April 5 and March 20, respectively.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,500, up 0.8% at the time of writing."

        "title": "Ethereum Electra Upgrade: Here Are The 4 Code Changes Embedded - CoinGape",
        "content": "The next consensus layer-focused hardfork coming to Ethereum is the Electra upgrade and developers have been busy reinforcing the upgrade with certain EIPs that offer specific functions. The 4 key EIPs were teased by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim.\n\nEthereum Electra Upgrade Sees Multiple Implementation\n\nThe Ethereum Electra protocol is billed to go live on the testnet very soon. From discussions held during the last All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) bi-weekly meeting spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Researcher Alex Stokes, Ethereum developers are integrating EIP 6110, EIP 7002, EIP 7251 and EIP 7549 into the Electra upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo far, these are the 4 code changes going into Electra \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n-EIP 6110 (Supply validator deposits on chain)\n\n-EIP 7002 (Execution layer triggerable exits)\n\n-EIP 7251 (Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE)\n\n-EIP 7549 (Move committee index outside attestation) pic.twitter.com/XXfYkkvCO2 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) April 9, 2024\n\nEIP 6110 which was created as far back as December 2022, is poised to supply validator deposits on-chain. According to the Ethereum Foundation (EF), \u201cThis EIP allows for an in-protocol mechanism of deposit processing on the Consensus Layer and eliminates the proposer voting mechanism utilized currently.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, the EIP 6110 will contribute to improving Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nEIP 7002 can also be referred to as the Execution layer triggerable exits. It would allow validators to trigger exits via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. There are still considerations from developers to make minor adjustments to this EIP that will equally trigger a change in Engine API.\n\nEIP 7251 is tagged \u201cIncrease the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE\u201d as it aims to allow validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. Noteworthy, EIP 7002 is a prerequisite for this EIP, hence, there are speculations that the implementation of EIP 7002 and 7251 in the same upgrade will trigger some complexities.\n\nDeveloper\u2019s Concern Highlighted\n\nFor EIP 7251, Lighthouse developer \u201cethDreamer\u201d coined two questions of concerns that would need to be addressed before the implementation. First, he is concerned about whether custom ceilings for partial withdrawals for validators with an effective balance greater than 32 ETH will be included.\n\nSecondly, he wants to know if consolidation of validators as a CL or EL-initiated operation should be enabled. Answers to these questions are expected from the next Ethereum developers\u2019 breakout meeting.\n\nEIP 7549 moves the committee index outside of the signed Attestation message. This is one of the most recently created EIPs.\n\n\u201cThis proposal aims to make Casper FFG clients more efficient by reducing the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. While all types of clients can benefit from this EIP, ZK circuits proving Casper FFG consensus are likely to have the most impact,\u201d a statement from EF detailed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is undergoing intense evolution and Electra Upgrade is the next major after Dencun Upgrade which went live on the mainnet earlier this year.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "How high can Ethereum go in the next five years? - Times of Malta",
        "content": "Ethereum was launched in 2014 through an initial coin offering with an initial price of $0.311. Although it traded below $1 until January 2016, the price reached an all-time high of $1,270 in January 2018.\n\nDue to its rapidly rising popularity, Ethereum has often been compared to Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency. So, investor curiosity surrounding Ethereum (ETH) has always been high \u2013 people want to understand its worth in the next few years before investing.\n\nSo, before you decide whether to buy Ethereum, let us find out what analysts have to say.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price history\n\nIn 2021, following a significant surge, the price reached an all-time high of $4,891.70 on 16 November. However, this all-time high was followed by a crypto bear market, which caused Ethereum's price to go down to $890 on 18 June 2022. Despite this, the price has increased since then. ETH has risen 130% from its June 2022 low of $890 and 71% this year. However, it is still down 58% from its record high.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum's price saw high volatility, primarily due to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US.\n\nThe recent news that BlackRock is planning to file an Ethereum ETF has boosted ETH prices above $2000 for the first time since July 2023.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2025\n\nGeneral predictions predict that Bitcoin halving in 2024 will dominate cryptocurrency narratives in 2025. Bitcoin and many altcoins are also expected to reach historic all-time highs 12-18 months after these halving events, so 2025 may be the year we see these increases.\n\nBased on these projections, ETH might achieve an all-time high of $6,600, a new low of $2,800, and an average of $3,200.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2026\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving event in April 2024 is expected to impact Bitcoin prices in 2025. However, experts say that we can expect a dip in 2026.\n\nSince cryptocurrency prices were in the spotlight last year, we expect governments to implement cryptocurrency regulations soon. There may be a slowdown in the current economic downturn if these regulations are positive and promote crypto evolution.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is likely to undergo scaling by this time, making it much more valuable. Despite no latest all-time highs, Ethereum is projected to average $4,500 in 2026, with sustained highs of $5,800, lows of $3,500, and no upcoming all-time highs.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2027\n\nEthereum is expected to see a great year in 2027 due to its continued institutional use and absence of price-halving events. After several big regulatory moves are implemented, the global economy is expected to grow steadily after the recession scares of 2022 and 2023.\n\nHowever, technical improvements are expected to make ETH more affordable and easier to use, which should counteract the growing demand. Due to these factors, ETH prices may fall into a narrow range in 2027.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2028\n\nIn the years leading up to the 5th Bitcoin Halving in 2028, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity. Investors are becoming more aware of the cycle and the expected rise in cryptocurrency prices. Ethereum's price might rise due to investor speculation. Whether Bitcoin and Ethereum undergo decoupling at this point remains to be seen. However, Ethereum's price will continue to be influenced by Bitcoin.\n\nThese factors predict that Ethereum's price might hit $6,300, close to its all-time high in 2025. Investors are unlikely to buy at higher prices. The median price fluctuates from $4,200 to $5,800.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2029\n\nEthereum is expected to implement most upgrades by 2029. We may see more institutional and public networks used for business and personal stuff. Ethereum's widespread adoption is expected to transform commerce and value transfer.\n\nEven though many people believe the Bitcoin Halving event is already priced in, prices continue to rise. The price of Ethereum might hit a first-time 5-figure price of $10,200, with a low of $7,100 and an average of $8,800 if it retains its position among the world\u2019s most popular and widely-used smart contract platforms.\n\nFinal words\n\nEthereum is predicted to grow significantly over the next five years. However, it is important to remember that several factors can affect its price, like demand, development, competition, and market sentiment. The success of Ethereum depends on how well it can solve scalability issues, expand its applications, and stay on top.\n\nDisclaimer: The information, view and opinions provided in this article are being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "title": "Ethereum vs BNB: 5 key differences in crypto futures this April - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "BNB\u2019s funding rate has been mostly negative since the beginning of the month.\n\nBNB accumulation remains steady in the coin\u2019s spot market.\n\nBinance Coin [BNB] is showing signs of weakness in the perpetual futures market. Coinglass\u2019 data showed that this month, it has experienced the most negative funding rates of the top five leading crypto assets.\n\nInformation retrieved from the data provider revealed that between the 4th and 8th of April, the coin\u2019s funding rate across exchanges was negative.\n\nFunding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that an asset\u2019s contract price stays close to its spot price.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s contract price is higher than its spot price, traders who have placed bets on a price rally (long traders) pay a fee to traders anticipating a decline (short traders). When this happens, the asset\u2019s funding rate will be positive.\n\nConversely, when the contract price is lower than the spot price, short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions, resulting in negative funding rates. When an asset\u2019s funding rate is negative, more traders are holding short positions than there are traders expecting a price rally.\n\nEthereum vs BNB In comparing Ethereum and BNB, particularly in the volatile arena of crypto futures this April, several key differences emerge. Firstly, Ethereum\u2019s funding rates have remained more stable compared to BNB\u2019s dramatic shift from negative to positive within days. Secondly, while BNB showed a significant 29% increase in futures open interest, Ethereum\u2019s growth in this area has been more consistent, reflecting its broader market acceptance. Thirdly, BNB\u2019s quick rebound in the futures market contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s steadier, more predictable market movements. Fourthly, the negative funding rates experienced by BNB highlight a market sentiment that differs markedly from Ethereum, which typically enjoys a more balanced view among traders. Finally, the comparison of key momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), would likely show differing trends between the two, with BNB recently witnessing a surge in accumulation not necessarily mirrored by Ethereum. These differences underscore the unique dynamics and investor sentiment driving each cryptocurrency, providing insightful perspectives for traders navigating the futures markets.\n\nSeparately, according to Coinglass, BNB\u2019s futures market sentiments have improved in the past four days, as the funding rate has remained positive. This has also been accompanied by a rally in the coin\u2019s futures open interest.\n\nAt $747 million at press time, BNB\u2019s futures open interest has increased by 29% since 8th April.\n\nThe market steadies\n\nAs of this writing, BNB exchanged hands at $611. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value has grown by 5% in the last week.\n\nAs the coin attempts to consolidate within a range, market volatility has reduced significantly. An assessment of BNB\u2019s Bollinger Bands showed a narrow gap between the upper and lower bands that make up the indicator.\n\nWhen the gap between these two bands is narrow, the market experiences low volatility. However, traders also interpret this as a signal that a breakout or significant price movement may occur in the short term.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nFurther, BNB\u2019s key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines at the time of writing. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 61.19, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 51.44.\n\nThese values showed that BNB accumulation persisted among market participants."
