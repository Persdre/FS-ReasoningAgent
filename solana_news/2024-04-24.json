        "title": "SEC sued over Ethereum, crypto firm asks court to state token is not a security - Fortune",
        "content": "A bitter legal fight between the crypto industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission grew more intense on Thursday as Consensys, a major backer of the Ethereum blockchain, filed a lawsuit against the agency in Texas federal court. The complaint seeks to head off an impending SEC lawsuit against the company over features of its popular MetaMask wallet, but also asks the court to resolve one of the biggest legal uncertainties hanging over the crypto industry by stating that Ethereum\u2019s digital token, Ether, is not a security.\n\nIn its 34-page legal filing, Consensys uses dramatic language to argue that the SEC\u2019s efforts to exert jurisdiction over Ethereum is both illegal and a threat to blockchain technology more broadly.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if he or she were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nThe new lawsuit comes as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler pursues an aggressive enforcement campaign against leading companies in the crypto sector, including Coinbase and Uniswap. In recent weeks, this campaign has involved a wave of subpoenas asking firms and developers for documents related to their dealings with the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, which supports the blockchain\u2019s development.\n\nGensler\u2019s tactics have angered many in the crypto industry who have complained the SEC has failed to provide clear rules or to create a regulatory model that accounts for the distinct features of blockchain technology. Gensler has disputed this, claiming existing securities laws are clear and sufficient, and that the crypto industry refuses to comply with them.\n\nThe controversy over Ethereum has been especially heated since the SEC has signaled repeatedly in the past that the blockchain\u2019s tokens, like Bitcoin, are not securities and therefore outside its jurisdiction. This includes a landmark 2018 speech where a senior official stated that Ethereum had become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s decision last year to allow Ethereum futures trading\u2014an implicit acknowledgement that Ether is a commodity. Meanwhile, video has surfaced of Gensler himself, in his role as a private citizen, telling hedge funds in 2018 that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nThese precedents, however, have failed to dissuade Gensler, who appears to be using a recent feature of Ethereum, known as staking, as grounds for the recent legal campaign.\n\nA warning notice and a preemptive lawsuit\n\nThe Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC earlier this month issued a so-called Wells Notice, which describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm, and often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint added that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker dealer.\n\nAccording to Consensys, the SEC objects to MetaMask offering users a means to stake Ethereum on their behalf. Staking is a relatively new process for Ethereum, introduced on a blockchain-wide basis in September 2022, that replaced energy-intensive mining with a system of validators who pledge collateral in order to become a trusted validator.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Consensys founder Joe Lubin described as \u201cpreposterous\u201d the theory that staking transformed Ethereum from a commodity into a security.\n\n\u201cThe act of staking is really just posting a security bond so you can get paid to contribute labor and resources to help operate the Ethereum protocol. Now they\u2019re trying to turn that into some sort of investment contract,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune about the lawsuit or on the agency\u2019s view of the legal status of staking.\n\nLubin also stated that Gensler\u2019s legal position appeared to be an attempt to halt the overall growth of crypto, and to justify the SEC blocking pending applications by companies to launch spot ETFs for Ethereum following the huge popularity of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to regulate a technology on its merits, which the SEC shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re trying to stifle certain kinds of innovation. And they\u2019re trying to do that because probably they see Ether spot ETFs as a floodgate that\u2019s going to bring a lot of capital into our ecosystem,\u201d said Lubin.\n\nThe Consensys lawsuit was filed in Texas, which dovetails with a broader strategy of the crypto industry to tee up eventual legal appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The circuit has shown greater skepticism of agency actions than other courts and, if the industry can win a favorable judgment, it would likely tee up an appeal for the Supreme Court.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear for now what will happen in the event the SEC chooses to file a lawsuit on its own to follow up on the Wells Notice instead of resolving the issues with Consensys in the Texas court.\n\nThe complaint itself asks the court for a number of additional rulings beyond declaring that Ethereum is not a security. Those include declarations that MetaMask is not a broker dealer, and that the SEC is violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process. It also seeks an injunction barring the SEC from conducting any investigations on the premise that Ethereum is a security."

        "content": "The blockchain race is about to get even more crowded: Movement Labs, a San Francisco\u2013based software development team that\u2019s building a layer 2 Ethereum blockchain, has closed a $38 million funding round, Fortune has exclusively learned.\n\nPolychain Capital, the crypto VC mega firm led by Coinbase alum Olaf Carlson-Wee, led the Series A, with participation from other digital-assets-focused investors including Hack VC, dao5, and Robot Ventures.\n\nMovement\u2019s raise comes on the heels of more sizable rounds for other companies building new blockchains, including Monad Labs, which raised $225 million to build a layer 1, and Berachain, another layer 1 developer that recently announced a $100 million Series B.\n\nWhile the flurry of fundraises reflects a return to crypto-focused venture investments, the concentration of capital around blockchains also indicates an increasingly competitive landscape for companies hoping to build the next Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Movement cofounders Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon said they hope to differentiate Movement by building the first layer 2 blockchain atop Ethereum that utilizes Move, a programming language originally built by Facebook for Diem, its ill-fated stablecoin project.\n\nRead more: We\u2019re Gen Z college dropouts who raised $41.4M for our blockchain startup. Here\u2019s how we did it\n\n\u201cWe are delivering Move to the front door of Ethereum, and it\u2019s this ecosystem that we\u2019re serving,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cA lot of folks who never wanted to leave Ethereum are, for the first time, going to be able to benefit from the security performance of a next-generation virtual machine.\u201d\n\nAccording to Scanlon and Manche, Movement Labs will soon announce its devnet and aims to launch its mainnet in the late summer or early fall. The company also plans to launch its own token, tentatively named Move.\n\nThe Ethereum movement\n\nTo outside observers, the proliferation of new blockchains may seem like overkill\u2014a view often shared by those in the industry. The first, Bitcoin, created the concept of cryptocurrency in 2009; the next major advance came in 2015 with the launch of Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications ranging from exchanges to money-lending protocols.\n\nDevelopers since then have been vexed by blockchains\u2019 speed and cost, with a series of layer 2s built atop Ethereum, as well as new layer 1s such as Solana, promising faster and cheaper transactions. As evidenced by the recent congestion issues plaguing Solana amid its memecoin mania, the problems remain.\n\nTwo recently launched blockchains, Aptos and Sui, came with a new value proposition: Each boasted teams of developers from Facebook who helped build the crypto-focused programming language called Move. They also created the Move Virtual Machine, a kind of computer program undergirding a blockchain that would represent a next-generation update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nAs Manche and Scanlon explained, while Move and its new virtual machine would come with better security and capabilities than EVM, most developers were still building for Ethereum, which had much stronger community backing. Even if Sui and Aptos could boast better performance, they couldn\u2019t necessarily build a thriving new ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAptos and Sui raised a lot of money,\u201d Manche told Fortune. \u201cBut they failed to execute on the community aspect.\u201d\n\nMovement, in contrast, is building its layer 2 on top of Ethereum but while using the Move programming language and the MVM. It\u2019s also building a tool called Move Stack, which will allow the Move Virtual Machine to be adoptable by other blockchain networks outside of Ethereum. Scanlon said they\u2019ve been contacted by \u201cquite a few\u201d different blockchains, including Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nTheir thesis is that developers will want to build using Move, which they say is more intuitive than other languages, such as Solidity, but still be part of the Ethereum community. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to bring Facebook on-chain,\u201d Manche said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the language that Facebook built to Ethereum.\u201d"

This project aims to address smart contract vulnerabilities and enhance transaction throughput via the Movement zero-knowledge Layer 2 blockchain.\n\n\u201cThis Series A funding enables us to aggressively hire top talent in engineering, research, product, business development and other key functions to execute our roadmap. [It] allows us to significantly scale our 40+ person team,\u201d Manche said.\n\nMore specifically, Manche told The Block, Movement Labs would be expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region and making significant investments in building out its formal verification and security research team. \u201cWe are also doubling down on our zero-knowledge proof engineering capabilities to push the boundaries of scalability and privacy,\u201d Manche added.\n\nMovement\u2019s Layer 2 would expand the usage of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed at Meta by a team composed of people from Facebook\u2019s now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.\n\nIn terms of the timescale for its rollout, Movement is launching its public testnet, Parthenon, in the coming weeks and is aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of the year, Manche said.\n\nHow Movement's Layer 2 works\n\nThe project's team explained that Movement introduces a new, novel execution environment designed for over 30,000 transactions per second and leverages a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement to bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nReentrancy attacks \u2014 enabling malicious parties to repeatedly drain funds from smart contracts by exploiting the code execution order \u2014 are one of the most common vulnerabilities in DeFi, according to web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi. Movement's Move-EVM aims to prevent attack vectors like reentrancy from executing, allowing developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, the team added.\n\n\u201cThe two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\u201d Manche said. \u201cMy co-founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of [the Ethereum programming language] Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs is also developing the Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups like Optimism, Polygon and Arbitrum. The Movement Labs team said that it intends to collaborate with projects across the Ethereum ecosystem \u201cto scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs previously announced in September it had raised $3.4 million in a pre-seed funding round, with investors including dao5, Varys Capital, Blizzard Fund and Borderless Capital. Angel investors, including Eigenlayer\u2019s Calvin Liu, Berachain\u2019s Smokey The Bera and Avail\u2019s Anurag Arjun, also participated in the round."

        "title": "SEC Postpones Ethereum (ETH) ETF Decision, Solana (SOL) Climbs 12% as Network Issues Resolve, Furrever Token (FURR) Excels in $1M Presale - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency landscape is currently witnessing significant movements and regulatory developments that are shaping the future of digital assets. From the SEC's delayed decisions on Ethereum (ETH) ETFs to the surge in Solana's (SOL) network performance and the charming ascent of Furrever Token ( FURR ) , the dynamics within the crypto market continue to offer both challenges and opportunities for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nSEC Delays Decision on Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETFs, Extending Market Uncertainty\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decision regarding the spot Ethereum ETF applications submitted by Grayscale Investments and Franklin Templeton, casting prolonged uncertainty over the introduction of these investment vehicles on U.S. stock markets. This delay continues the trend of cautious regulatory scrutiny in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector.\n\nPreviously, in a landmark decision last January, the SEC had approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which led to significant market inflows and demonstrated a strong investor demand for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Encouraged by this development, Grayscale attempted to convert its existing Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETH ETF in October. Shortly after, in February, Franklin Templeton also submitted an S1 form, signaling a robust interest among financial giants to facilitate access to Ether, which ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nDespite the evident enthusiasm and forward momentum from these asset management firms, the path to regulatory approval remains strewn with obstacles. Industry experts, such as those from JP Morgan, express skepticism regarding the rapid approval of these ETFs, estimating the probability of a favorable outcome by the May deadline to be less than 50%. This skepticism reflects the SEC's meticulous strategy in assessing new ETFs, emphasizing the protection of investor interests above all.\n\nThe ongoing postponements prompt speculation about the broader impact on the cryptocurrency market. A denial of these applications might lead these firms to consider legal action against the SEC, highlighting the tense interaction between evolving financial innovations and traditional regulatory frameworks. Nonetheless, the final decision by the SEC will critically shape the market landscape, potentially easing the integration of crypto assets into conventional financial systems or presenting new barriers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs developments continue to unfold, the cryptocurrency community and prospective investors remain keenly focused on the SEC's actions. The forthcoming decisions will be pivotal in determining the future of Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. and will significantly influence the accessibility of digital assets to mainstream investors, marking a critical moment in the integration of blockchain technologies within formal financial systems.\n\nSolana (SOL) Sees 12% Increase as Network Congestion Clears and Block Production Stabilizes\n\nSolana has shown notable signs of recovery today, successfully breaking past the $150 resistance level, with its price now standing at $157.08 according to recent CoinMarketCap data. This 1.81% rise over the past 24 hours marks a significant turnaround for the cryptocurrency which had been struggling with network congestion issues.\n\nThe recovery in Solana's network is primarily attributed to improvements in block production, which has returned to a normal rate with an average block time of two seconds. Recent updates from SolanaFloor indicate that all 409 transactions were confirmed successfully, signaling a robust rebound in network health. This improvement has led to positive speculation about an increase in demand for Solana's native token, SOL.\n\nSolana's network had faced severe congestion problems, causing delays and operational challenges for many projects within its ecosystem. Some projects were forced to postpone their launches, while others sought alternatives, moving their operations away from Solana during the congestion period.\n\nHowever, the situation has seen a dramatic change with the latest update on block production. This development might signal a new phase of growth and stability for Solana, encouraging both current and potential project developers about the network's reliability.\n\nThe resolution of these issues can be credited to the efforts of Solana\u2019s development team, including cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko, who have been actively addressing the scalability challenges. A significant breakthrough was achieved earlier this month when a major fix was implemented on the testnet by the core development team, supported by additional enhancements from other validator clients such as Anza.\n\nThis collective effort has not only resolved the immediate technical issues but also contributed to a substantial 24.5% increase in trading volume, pushing it to over $3.14 billion. The Solana community and investors are now looking forward to a promising future, energized by the network's recovery and the potential for continued growth and enterprise adoption.\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Emerges as a Delightful Contender in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nFurrever Token ( FURR ) has made an impressive entry into the cryptocurrency market, quickly setting itself apart from more traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with its captivating, cat-themed design. Designed to resonate with cat lovers, Furrever Token offers a unique, heartwarming experience that infuses the digital currency space with a new level of cuteness.\n\nStrategically positioned for growth and long-term viability, Furrever Token allocated 65% of its tokens during the presale phase, successfully raising over $1,000,000. This significant achievement highlights the strong investor confidence in the project's vision and potential. Additionally, the decision to lock 10% of the tokens for the team underscores a commitment to the project's future prospects and stability.\n\nFurrever Token has also placed a strong emphasis on security and compliance. Comprehensive audits conducted by Securi Lab have bolstered its credibility, ensuring that the project meets high standards of safety for its participants. Beyond its financial attributes, Furrever Token has fostered a vibrant community atmosphere. Nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram contribute to a dynamic and engaging environment, turning the project into a movement that extends beyond traditional cryptocurrency dynamics.\n\nAs the presale phase draws to a close, anticipation is mounting for Furrever Token's upcoming launch on PancakeSwap. With the potential for returns up to 15X and a current trading price of $0.000648, Furrever Token is poised to capture both the hearts and investments of the cryptocurrency community. It offers a refreshing and cheerful alternative to conventional memecoins, appealing to both seasoned investors and newcomers attracted by its charming theme.\n\nFor anyone seeking further information or needing assistance with Furrever Token, official communications are advised to be conducted through the designated support channel at support(at)furrevertoken.com to ensure authenticity and avoid potential scams.

        "content": "Crypto firm Consensys is suing the SEC over Ethereum and is asking the court to declare that ETH is not a security. This case mirrors the Ripple Labs case against XRP, where the SEC was forced to admit that XRP is not a security. Consensys is one of the major backers of the Ethereum blockchain. The lawsuit was filed in Texas federal court on Thursday.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Crypto firm Consensys sues SEC and asks court to declare that Ethereum $ETH is not a security. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 25, 2024\n\nConsensys seeks to divert from an impending lawsuit by the SEC against them over the MetaMask Wallet. The 34-page legal filing features dramatic language arguing that the SEC\u2019s efforts against ETH are illegal and threaten overall blockchain technology. The debate on Ethereum\u2019s digital token, Ether, being a security has been a key argument for the SEC, especially with Spot Ethereum ETF applications pending.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if they were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring [the] use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Bracing for Bullish Trends? Exchange Reserves Hit 2-Year Low\n\nThe SEC Continues Its Battle Against Ethereum And The Crypto Industry\n\nThe SEC is currently pursuing an aggressive enforcement battle against the cryptocurrency industry. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has unleashed multiple subpoenas, asking firms for documents related to the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, many in the industry have responded negatively to these efforts, saying that the initiative violates privacy and has been totalitarian.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Expected to Deny Spot Ethereum ETF Next Month\n\nFurthermore, the Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC issued a Wells Notice in early April. This describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm. It often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint adds that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer. The SEC may follow up with a new lawsuit around the Wells Notice instead of resolving the lawsuit imposed by Consensys in court. However, their plan remains unknown."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYet another CryptoPunk has sold for an astonishing sum: On Thursday, an ultra-rare Alien Punk from the NFT collection traded hands for $12.38 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPunk #635, one of just nine Alien Punks in the influential 10,000-piece Ethereum NFT collection, sold for 4,000 ETH this morning. The sale was facilitated by crypto art brokerage Fountain, with the piece going to an anonymous collector who has yet to reveal their identity.\n\nThe eye-popping trade comes just weeks after two other Alien Punks sold for near-record shattering amounts. In early March, an anonymous crypto trader bought Punk #3100 for $16.03 million worth of ETH, in the second-largest on-chain CryptoPunk transaction ever recorded. Weeks later, Punk #7804\u2014another Alien\u2014sold for $16.42 million in ETH, taking the (silver) crown as the second-most expensive Punk sale in history.\n\nThe largest CryptoPunks sale of all time took place in NFT heyday of early 2022, when a crypto startup CEO purchased yet another Alien Punk\u2014#5822\u2014for 8,000 ETH, worth over $23.7 million at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptoPunk 635, the Alien originally owned by Larva Labs and sold at the Christie\u2019s Contemporary Art Evening Sale in May 2021, has just been acquired by an anonymous collector in a deal brokered by Fountain. We\u2019re honored to have played a small role in this sale. Congratulations\u2026 pic.twitter.com/glisy3MZpv \u2014 Fountain (@Fountainxyz) April 25, 2024\n\nWhile those Punk transactions, and today\u2019s, rank among the most expensive NFT sales of all time, they still pale in comparison to the all-time leader: \"Everydays: The First 5,000 Days,\" an on-chain work by the artist Mike \"Beeple\" Winkelmann that sold for $69.3 million at a Christie\u2019s auction in early 2021.\n\nThe recent resurgence of mind-boggling price tags for CryptoPunk NFTs, however, appears reserved for that collection alone. CryptoPunks, arguably the first NFT collection to attract substantial value and relevance after their creation in 2017, appear to have maintained their position over the last two years as rare cultural artifacts.\n\nOther once-coveted profile picture (PFP) collections have struggled to recapture dominance since the collapse of the NFT market in mid-2022. The Bored Ape Yacht Club, for instance, has seen its assets' value shrink to a floor price barely above $40,000, according to data from NFT Price Floor. That\u2019s down more than 90% from the peak USD price seen back in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther collections that previously defined the NFT landscape, like Azuki and Doodles, have similarly seen their price floors drop by over 50%.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Movement Labs , a San Francisco-based blockchain development team, has secured $38 million in a Series A financing round led by Polychain Capital. The funding will support the company's mission to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities and enhancing transaction throughput.\n\nMovement Labs Series A Funding\n\nThe investment round saw participation from prominent venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs, demonstrating strong industry confidence in the Movement ecosystem.\n\nFounded in 2022, Movement Labs aims to tackle the prevalent smart contract vulnerabilities within the Ethereum ecosystem while introducing a novel execution environment designed for 30,000+ transactions per second (TPS). By leveraging a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement, the Movement Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 blockchain will bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks. Movement's Move-EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing. The team calls this the \"Integrated Approach\", where multiple modular elements such as shared sequencing, embedded formal verification provers, alternative data availability, and Ethereum settlement can combine to power one blockchain, enhancing security and performance.\n\n\"The two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\" said Movement Co-Founder, Rushi Manche. \"My Co-Founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\"\n\nIn addition to the flagship Movement L2, Movement Labs will introduce Move Stack, an execution layer framework that is compatible with many of the rollup frameworks from companies like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The team's vision is to collaborate with other Ethereum players to scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\n\n\"While the core focus of most other rollup teams is scalability, Movement's key insight is that scalability alone is not why we are yet to see mass adoption. The MoveVM offers a developer experience that is intuitive and bug-resistant as well as highly scalable. By marrying these benefits with the network effects and base-layer security guarantees of the Ethereum ecosystem, we believe Movement can build a flourishing ecosystem that is home to a new generation of mainstream applications,\" said Polychain's Bobby Beniers in a statement.\n\nThe team had previously announced a $3.4 million pre-seed round in September 2023. Users will be able to interact with its network this Summer.\n\nFor more information about Movement Labs and a guide to participate in the devnet, please visit: movementlabs.xyz , follow on X @movementlabsxyz and on Discord .\n\nAbout Movement Labs:\n\nCo-founders, Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, early builders in the Move ecosystem, founded Movement Labs in 2022 as the first integrated blockchain network, powering the fastest and most secure Layer 2 on Ethereum. Designed to pair smart contract security and parallelization with EVM liquidity and user bases, Movement is bringing the MoveVM to Ethereum through its flagship L2 and connected rollups with the Move Stack.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\n[email protected]\n\nVideo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2396978/Movement_Labs_Fundraise_Video_Final.mp4\n\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2397018/movement_logo_full_color_rgb_2000px_72ppi_Logo.jpg"

        "content": "Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a notable crypto analyst, voiced doubts regarding the prospects of an Exchange-Traded Fund approval for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Additionally, he emphasized the resilience of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat Happened: Van de Poppe took to social media platform X to share his views on the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval. He indicated that the chances of approval are low, despite the potential for an upward trend in Ethereum\u2019s value. He also emphasized the strength of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still on edge to have one and I think people are underestimating the strength of the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe chances for an ETF approval for #Ethereum are quite low, but that doesn't mean that we're going to have an upward run on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nIt's still on edge to have one and I think people are underestimating the strength of the Ethereum ecosystem. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 24, 2024\n\nSee Also: Melania Trump Launches $245 Customizable Mother\u2019s Day Necklace, Buyers To Also Get Limited-Edition Solana-Based Digital Collectible\n\nWhy It Matters: The possibility of an Ethereum ETF has been a hot topic in the crypto world. The SEC\u2019s continued scrutiny of Ethereum ETF proposals has cast doubt on the May approval deadline. This has led to a decrease in the market\u2019s expectation of an ETF approval, with a prediction market assigning only a 16% chance of approval by May 31.\n\nNotably, the SEC issued a historic approval for a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF on January 10, 2024, pushing Wall Street into the cryptocurrency age.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, investment bank Standard Chartered remains optimistic about the future of digital assets. The bank believes that the market is well-positioned for a rebound, even if the approval is delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong are projected to accumulate $1 billion in assets within the next two years, despite China\u2019s ban on the underlying assets. This suggests a strong global interest in cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future. A seasoned Bitcoin trader and advocate recently declared a pessimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that the \u201cETH story is dying.\u201d\n\nPrice Action: Based on data from Benzinga Pro, Bitcoin is presently trading at $64,535, marking a 0.44% increase over the past 24 hours and a 46.10% surge year-to-date. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading at $3,170, with a 0.98% rise in the last 24 hours and a 34.74% increase year-to-date.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu And Other Memecoins Fueling Mass Adoption Of Base\u2019s L2 Network, Coinbase Exec Says: \u2018They Are Going To Be One Of The Biggest Drivers\u2019"

        "content": "Ex-Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says the altcoin market cap is on the verge of soaring to new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nIn a new video update, the Real Vision CEO says that the digital assets market could enter \u201ccrypto summer\u201d within a month, when Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and other alts could have massive rallies.\n\nA \u201ccrypto summer\u201d generally means increased prices, higher trading volume, bullish market sentiment, more network development and wider adoption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very normal for crypto spring for Bitcoin to outperform and then as we come into crypto summer that we\u2019re transitioning into now ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin\u2026\n\nWill it outperform Solana? I very much doubt it. Solana is earlier in the adoption curve so it means the percentage changes are larger.\n\nYou can see the start of crypto spring, which was the breakout of this pattern and the slight acceleration. That says we\u2019re getting to warmer days of spring as it were. But really, summer happens when you break the previous all-time high in market cap and things go utterly bananas. So this [chart below is altcoins] excluding Ethereum, so this is the rest of the space, really starting to accelerate and sometime in 2024 we will hit an all-time high market cap of altcoins and this chart will go truly into the banana zone.\u201d\n\nPal also predicts that the crypto market will have a \u201ccrypto fall\u201d similar to the 2013 and 2017 cycles when the market extended rallies even higher. Many analysts believe that crypto runs in four-year cycles and divides the cycles up into four seasons of the year to explain the different phases.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about crypto summer just in very simplistic terms. Here is the chart of the seasons. So spring is green. We had a great spring this year. Summer is when a lot of the gains start to happen. Fall was tricky last time around. We got a stunted cycle. If you remember that kind of double-toppy style thing.\n\nIt was highly unusual. 2017, and 2013 were typical of the fall season. And so we don\u2019t know how this one\u2019s going to play out. I think it plays out more like 2013, 2017, but it\u2019s all assessing the odds as we go. But right now this is the easy year, the summer.\u201d\n\nPal predicts that crypto summer will begin in the next month to month and a half.\n\n\u201cVery soon, like in the next month, next month and a half, we will start to hit the banana zone. And this is what happens when you hit the banana zone. Things get absolutely wild, which is the really magical part of why this is the greatest macro trade of all time is this part and it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, Pal suggests that during \u201ccrypto summer\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) could soar into the six-figure range, reaching as high as $300,000.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What Is Xai? The Rising Ethereum Layer-3 Gaming Network on Arbitrum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new gaming blockchain has entered the lobby in 2024: Xai.\n\n\u201cXai is built to enable open trade in the next generation of video games,\u201d the official site says. In its quest to do so, the network aims to reduce fees, offer account abstraction to hide some of those pesky blockchain elements, and empower game creators in the process.\n\nThe layer-3 blockchain is developed in part by Offchain Labs, the original creator and primary developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum network that Xai is built on top of. And Xai is getting help from game developer Ex Populus, which will deploy the first games planned to launch on the network in collaboration with the Xai Foundation.\n\nBut what does this really mean? We\u2019ve rounded up all you need to know.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Xai?\n\nMany crypto users are familiar with the concept of layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling networks built on top of them, but Xai brands itself as a layer-3 network. This is because it\u2019s built atop Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum.\n\nIn practicality, this means that Xai keeps Arbitrum\u2019s core functionalities the same while tweaking certain aspects of the network for a more targeted experience intended for a specific use case. While Arbitrum is a general layer-2 scaling solution that can be tapped for all kinds of apps, Xai specifically caters to the needs of gamers and game developers alike.\n\nFor example, Xai offers account abstraction\u2014meaning it\u2019ll hide confusing parts from users\u2014when it comes to the blockchain wallet and account experience. The network also provides developers with increased gas and contract limits.\n\nMost notably, the Xai site says that it \u201cintroduces parallel processing and advancements for enhanced scalability, efficiency, and cost reduction.\u201d That\u2019s on top of Arbitrum\u2019s existing layer-2 approach, which handles transactions away from the Ethereum mainnet to do so at a lower cost and greater volume via its optimistic rollup tech.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy reducing fees and increasing transaction times, Xai aims to create a smoother gaming experience while embracing the unique elements that make blockchain gaming what it is\u2014such as true ownership of unique, in-game items, as well as tokenized economies.\n\n\u201cThe cheaper and faster we can make things,\u201d Ex Populus co-founder and CEO Tobias Batton told Decrypt, \u201cthe better experience we can provide users.\u201d\n\nWhat is the XAI token?\n\nKicking off 2024 with a bang, 125 million XAI tokens (5% of the token supply) were airdropped to gamers, according to the Xai Foundation. The airdrop\u2019s total value was nearly $70 million at launch, growing to $140 million less than a week later.\n\nThe XAI token\u2019s primary purpose is to be used as the gas fee token on the layer-3 blockchain. But there are also potential benefits, as XAI tokens can be exchanged for esXAI (or escrowed XAI) tokens and staked to earn interest-like rewards.\n\nOnce you have staked your esXAI tokens, you're able to participate in staking pools. Coming in Q4 2024, you\u2019ll also be able to participate in governance as well as gain \u201cexclusive access\u201d to special events and assets associated with projects on the Xai blockchain.\n\nWhich games are building on Xai?\n\nAll of this technical stuff is great, but a gaming network is ultimately defined by the games on it. After all, no one would buy a PS5 if it had no games. So which games are being built on Xai?\n\nWith Ex Populus as a key partner, the developer has committed its suite of games to the layer-3 network. Currently, we know two of the games that are in development by Ex Populus: rogue-lite auto-battler Final Form, and hover car action shooter LAMOverse. But the studio\u2019s website also states that an open-world experience is currently in pre-production, with details still to be announced.\n\nOutside of this partnership, early this year it was announced that Crypto Unicorns and its related NFT games will migrate from Ethereum sidechain network Polygon to Xai. Crypto Unicorns NFTs have generated $35 million of trading volume. The switch was motivated primarily due to \u201cchallenges\u201d that arose when operating a game on Polygon, the team told Decrypt, namely in the form of network gas fee spikes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter that, a prominent indie gaming curator called The MIX, or The Media Indie Exchange, said that it plans to launch over 100 games on Xai before the end of 2024. While what games will be launched on the network is yet to be confirmed, Xai said that \u201cmany\u201d of the games are already on Steam and will be reworked to benefit from blockchain tech.\n\nThis means that it's likely that currently Web2 games are going to get Web3 functionality using Xai, which The MIX suggests will bear a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to how Valve allows players to buy and sell Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in-game items.\n\nMost recently, Reboot, the crypto gaming protocol powering Pixel Vault\u2019s flagship game BattlePlan, announced an alliance with the Xai Foundation to migrate the game to the network. Sometime this quarter, BattlePlan will move one layer deeper from Arbitrum Nova to Xai in an attempt to \u201cenhance player experience.\u201d\n\nHow staking works on Xai\n\nAs an incentive to keep users on the network and reward them for supporting its consensus model, Xai began rolling out staking across two waves.\n\nVersion one allowed owners of Sentry Nodes\u2014which are responsible for monitoring and flagging blocks on the Xai network\u2014to stake up to 25,000 esXAI they hold. Then, in April, version two was rolled out, which opened the gates to any holder of esXAI.\n\nNow, staking pools can be created by Sentry Key holders\u2014the NFT is used to operate a Sentry Node to support the network\u2014and then anyone can stake esXAI in the pools that have been created. Pool operators can determine the distribution of pooled network rewards, specifying the percentages allocated to themselves, Sentry Key-holding stakers, and standard esXAI stakers.\n\nXai also introduced a tier system where the higher the tier of a staking pool, based on the amount of esXAI staked, the greater the reward multiplier for the staked Sentry Keys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, if 500,000 esXAI is staked, then the Sentry Key will see a 3x reward multiplier. This starts at \"bronze\" with no bonus reward, but climbs all the way up to \"diamond,\" which has a 6x reward multiplier.\n\nThe future\n\nXai is like an onion: It has layers. As a layer-3 blockchain, it attempts to improve on the layers that came before it to optimize the gaming experience. Peel back more layers and you find a robust token and staking system with governance in layers to come.\n\nOf course, the one layer that\u2019s still a bit thin as of this writing concerns the actual games themselves build on top of the network. But based on the announcements thus far, it appears those games are coming.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Breaking: US SEC To Deny Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 Reuters - CoinGape",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deny the much-anticipated approval of spot Ethereum ETF, as per sources familiar with the matter. The SEC\u2019s mindset toward approving spot Ether exchange-traded funds was never clear as the SEC tries to classify Ethereum (ETH) as security and delays its decision on spot Ether ETF for several issuers.\n\nUS SEC to Refuse Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nIssuers of spot Ether ETFs and other firms expect denial of their applications next month by the U.S. SEC after bad meetings with the securities regulator in recent week, reported Reuters on April 25.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark Invest and other issuers have filed with the SEC to approve and list ETF tracking the spot prices of Ether (ETH), similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs. VanEck and Ark Invest are first in line for the SEC\u2019s decision on May 23 and May 24, respectively.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the SEC and its staff have shown no interest in the spot Ether ETF and its potential. Four people who participated said the discussions were one-sided.\n\n\u201cIt seems more likely that approval will be delayed until later in 2024, or longer,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF analysis at data firm VettaFi, who is tracking the issue closely. \u201cThe regulatory picture still seems cloudy.\u201d\n\nThe SEC is taking a similar stance against spot Ether ETF when Gary Gensler-led agency rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade. The Grayscale Investments\u2019 win in a lawsuit against the SEC forced the regulator to consider spot Bitcoin ETF approval, but Gensler was still not interested in it after the approval.\n\nThe denial will be a setback for the crypto market as participants believe spot ETFs pave the way for rising adoption of crypto, as seen in spot Bitcoin ETF. Also, spot XRP and SOL ETFs can be expected if the SEC approves the spot Ether ETF.\n\nThe SEC has only disclosed one meeting on spot Bitcoin ETF, which was in March. The SEC and Coinbase met to discuss Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum Trust into spot Ether ETF.\n\nETH Price Fall on This News\n\nWhile Hong Kong regulator has approved spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs and listing is expected on April 30, traders have responded immediately to the news of delay.\n\nETH price extended drop to over 5%, with the price currently trading at $3,097. The 24-hour low and high are $3,074 and $3,292, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 35% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum futures OI has also dipped in the last 1 hour, with a 24-hour fall of over 1%. There are 3.49 million ETH futures OI worth $10.82 billion, at the time of writing.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have experienced a downturn post-Bitcoin halving, marked by lower trading volumes.\n\nEthereum and Solana are struggling to break key resistance levels at $3,200 and $150, respectively.\n\nXRP remains volatile amid the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, facing hurdles at $0.52-$0.55 range.\n\nDespite a brief upward swing following last week's halving, cryptocurrency markets have dipped in the second half of the week. Lower trading volumes are characteristic of the post-halving period.\n\nAmong major altcoins, has attempted a comeback, nearing the $3,200 mark, but a clear reversal hasn't materialized yet.\n\nfaces a similar situation, battling to break above $150. remains particularly volatile as the ongoing SEC lawsuit against heats up.\n\n1. Ethereum Eyes Breakout After Correction\n\nEthereum's decline took a breather last week, finding support near $3,000. During the April 13-19 trading sessions, the daily chart suggests buying activity (reaction purchases) emerged around the $2,920 zone.\n\nThis coincides with the Fibonacci 0.618 retracement level of the Q1 rally, hinting that the recent correction might be over.\n\nHowever, ETH's week-long uptrend has struggled to overcome the $3,200 resistance due to low trading volume. In the past 24 hours, selling pressure has intensified, with $3,150 acting as a key hurdle.\n\nAnalysts warn that a daily close below $3,150 could signal a continuation of the downtrend. A potential weekly close under $2,920 could open the door for a further slide towards $2,600.\n\nConversely, a surge in buying volume that pushes ETH above $3,150 would be a significant breakout. This would signify an end to the downtrend that began in March and could pave the way for a return to the $3,600-$3,800 zone in the short term.\n\n2. Solana Breaks Support, Faces Downward Pressure\n\nSolana started April on a concerning note, breaking below the ascending channel it had followed since October 2023. This downward breakout came with significant trading volume, pushing SOL to an average price of $127 last week.\n\nThe recent price movement suggests a corrective phase for SOL. While the token has attempted a recovery since last week, it remains capped at an average of $158.\n\nThis week, the $139-$143 range becomes crucial support for SOL. Failure to hold this level could see SOL experience a significant decline, potentially dropping below $100 as the downward trend strengthens.\n\nDaily closes above $160 are essential to confirm a reversal of the downtrend. As long as SOL remains below this price point, selling pressure could push it further down.\n\nMaintaining an average of $140 would also be a positive sign, potentially slowing the decline.\n\nOn the upside, if SOL can establish a solid foundation at $160, the next potential targets could be the $180-$190 range.\n\n3. XRP Faces Volatility as Legal Battle Heats Up\n\nXRP's price has been on a rollercoaster ride this week, reflecting the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The market reacted negatively to Ripple's recent rejection of the SEC's proposed fine, halting the recovery XRP experienced last week.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, XRP dipped below its long-term upward channel earlier this month. While there were attempts to return to the channel last week, a significant resistance level emerged around $0.55, hindering further progress.\n\nThe long-term outlook for XRP presents another hurdle in the form of resistance at $0.52 (Fib 0.236). A weekly close above this crucial $0.52-$0.55 range is critical for XRP to reverse its current trend. Failure to do so could lead to a short-term decline towards the support level at $0.43 (Fib 0.144).\n\nLooking ahead, with Ripple's response submitted and the SEC's defense still to come, the XRP market is likely to experience increased volatility in the coming months. The final court decision is expected to be a major factor influencing XRP's price as we approach summer.\n\n***\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship \"Tech Titans,\" which outperformed the market by a lofty 1,745% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here and never miss a bull market again!\n\nDisclaimer: This content, which is prepared purely for educational purposes, cannot be considered as investment advice.

        "title": "Is ETH About to Plunge Below $3K or Will the Bulls Step In? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a period of consolidation and corrective movements, Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered increased selling activity, leading to a slight decline toward the 100-day moving average.\n\nThe main question now revolves around whether Ethereum sellers will manage to break below this crucial moving average.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Technicals\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart reveals that following an extended phase of corrective retracements, with the price testing the critical resistance region of $3.2K, the market experienced heightened selling pressure, resulting in a slight downturn.\n\nConsequently, the Ethereum price is now testing a crucial support level marked by the 100-day moving average at $3086. This range holds significance as it typically attracts considerable demand, potentially limiting further downward pressure from sellers.\n\nHowever, given the current market sentiment and recent price action, Ethereum appears to lack sufficient momentum and buying activity, increasing the likelihood of a new bearish trend in the short term. Nonetheless, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect towards the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that following a period of sideways consolidation near the lower boundary of the wedge pattern, which aligns with the support region around $3K, the price experienced notable buying pressure, leading to a bullish reversal.\n\nThis intensified demand resulted in a significant surge towards a critical resistance region, encompassing the 0.5 ($3234) and 0.618 ($3324) Fibonacci levels.\n\nHowever, sellers regained control and halted the upward momentum, causing a renewed bearish downturn, indicating a notable bearish sign for the market. Nevertheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to remain confined within the crucial range, bounded by support at $2.8 and critical resistance at $3.3, until a breakout occurs.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price failing to surpass the $3.7K level, investors may be interested in understanding the behavior of futures market traders.\n\nThe accompanying chart displays the 14-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that gauges the aggressiveness of buyers relative to sellers. Values above one signify buyer dominance, while values below one indicate aggressive selling pressure.\n\nAs depicted in the chart, not only has the metric failed to recover above one, but it has also been on a sharp decline over the past few weeks. Moreover, the ratio has recently been steadily decreasing, nearing its lowest point since September 2022. This downward trend is concerning and suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bearish trend could last in the mid-term if current conditions persist."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by global market cap, appears to have ignited a torrent of optimism among crypto market traders and investors globally today, April 24. As ETH\u2019s price action illustrated a considerable rebound, followed by heightened whale activity orbiting the token, the eternal Solana rival garnered noteworthy investor attention today, with crypto market participants speculating about the token\u2019s price action ahead.\n\nNotably, TRON founder Justin Sun, a prominent figure within the crypto realm, continued accumulating staggering amounts of ETH, per today\u2019s on-chain data. Meanwhile, whale activity surrounding the token has been burgeoning over the past few days, with bullish sentiments swirling around ETH. Here\u2019s a closer look at why Ethereum curates market optimism with whales buying the token despite its sideways trading over the past few days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Accumulations Note A Spike, Fuels Market Optimism\n\nAccording to Lookonchain\u2019s insights, a blockchain data analytics platform, the Justin Sun-linked wallet 0x4359 withdrew 15,389 ETH, worth $49.78 million, from Binance today, April 24, nabbing global attention. This massive accumulation by Sun underscored a heightened sense of confidence in the asset\u2019s future, birthing immediate bullish sentiments for the ETH price trajectory ahead.\n\nIntriguingly, CoinGape Media spotlighted a plethora of ETH whale accumulations yesterday, weighing in on the token\u2019s optimistic take on the market. Per the report, Justin Sun invested a staggering $1 billion in Ethereum yesterday, further anchoring the TRON founder\u2019s confidence in the asset. This, coupled with the rising Ethereum whale accumulations, paints a highly bullish outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price action ahead.\n\nAlso read: Crypto News: FTC Votes to Ban Noncompete Agreements in Employment Contracts\n\nEthereum Price Jumps\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum token\u2019s price has been noted to have gained 1.67% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,242. The ETH market cap sprung 1.58%, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume upswing of 2.16%, amassing slight optimism on the token.\n\nThis price rebound showcased by ETH primarily aligns with the colossal accumulations recorded in the past few days, as mentioned above. However, derivatives data for the token signals reduced investor interest and market activity for the token, underscoring a potential downtrend for Ethereum in the market as of press time. Coinglass revealed a 0.39% dip in the token\u2019s open interest, accompanied by a derivatives volume fall of 2.88%.\n\nThis painted an uncertain scenario surrounding ETH\u2019s price action ahead, as bulls or bears may take over the token at any moment in the future. Nonetheless, with post-BTC halving optimism, further accompanied by significant whale accumulations, crypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token, hoping to see a rising price action ahead.\n\nAlso Read: Block Inc Successfully Wraps Up Bitcoin Mining Chip Development\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "During the night we had only a small taste of the impact of a potential collapse of Ethereum\u2019s liquid restaking tokens: Renzo protocol\u2019s ezETH experienced a strong dump, due to the lack of liquidity on DEX, dropping to 700 dollars.\n\nThe ezETH-ETH ratio has dropped to the threshold of 0.2, causing several positions in the leverage of airdrop farmers who had used the coin as collateral in money markets such as ZeroLend and Gearbox to be liquidated: in total, liquidations amount to 340 million dollars.\n\nThe reaction of Renzo\u2019s competitors was not long in coming, such as Etherfi, which reiterated its superiority as a restaking protocol, as well as the disapproval comments from the Ethereum community criticizing the risks of this system.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nRenzo\u2019s LRT Depeg on Ethereum: ezETH at $700 overnight\n\nDuring the night Renzo, a famous Ethereum restaking protocol, risked collapsing after its token ezETH lost its peg with ETH reaching a price of about 700 dollars.\n\nIt all started when, immediately yesterday\u2019s announcement by Renzo regarding the launch of their governance token REZ on April 30th (with an attached Binance launchpool), many users started selling ezETH on decentralized markets.\n\nWe remind you that this liquid restaking token allows you to accumulate Renzo Points, which will soon be converted into REZ. The announcement by the Renzo team has therefore marked the end of the farming period and several airdrop hunters have preferred to sell ezETH to move to other projects.\n\nMassive sales have targeted the main DEXs where the currency is traded, leading to its devaluation due to reduced liquidity.\n\nThink that the ezETH ratio to native ETH has reached 0.2, when technically it should be fixed at 1.\n\nNow Renzo\u2019s token has fully recovered the peg, still being traded at a discount of about 1%.\n\nThe consequences of the takeoff immediately made themselves felt: many \u201cleverage farmers\u201d who have exploited money markets like ZeroLend and Gearbox woke up scorched this morning with over 340 million dollars of liquidations.\n\nOn this kind of platforms it is indeed possible to put ezETH as collateral, borrow stablecoins like USDC, buy other ezETH with the stablecoins, and potentially repeat the cycle indefinitely.\n\nThis practice allows you to accumulate many more Renzo Points, as well as other points that make you eligible for further airdrops such as those of EigenLayer, Linea, Blast, ZeroLend etc.\n\nThe problem is that if the value of the collateral (ezETH) were to fall for any reason below the borrowed value, there is a risk of liquidating the entire staked portfolio.\n\nFortunately, this time the settlements were overall contained, and part of them were covered by Gearbox\u2019s emergency fund.\n\nAnyway, the entire Ethereum community got quite a scare, as Renzo is one of the largest protocols for restaking, with a TVL of 3.4 billion dollars.\n\nI just analyzed ezETH depeg consequences for Gearbox. All passive lenders funds are safe, no bad debt was incurred \u2705\n\n\n\n115 Credit Accounts were liquidated, 10650 ezETH were sold on Balancer pool. Liquidation losses of 25.77 ETH were automatically covered by internal Gearbox\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RxxQlAtgBk \u2014 0xmikko.eth | Token 2049 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea (@0xmikko_eth) April 24, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, according to what was reported by \u201cSpotonchain\u201c, there are those who took advantage of the discounted price of Renzo\u2019s liquid restaking token to speculate on the markets, managing to earn over 193 ETH in just 2 hours of trading.\n\n\n\nWallet 0xaa1 (linked to \u201cczsamsunsb.eth\u201d) made 193 $ETH (~$600K) in only 4 hours after $EZETH (#Renzo Restaked ETH) lost peg!\n\n\n\nSo far, the whale has swapped 4,499 $ETH for 4,692 $EZETH since the depeg occurred allegedly due to poor liquidity in Uniswap 4 hours ago, now making 193\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oJmKTR6io5 \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 24, 2024\n\nThe risk of \u201cleverage farming\u201d in Ethereum restaking: Etherfi\u2019s immediate reaction\n\nThe practice of \u201cleverage farming\u201d in the context of airdrop hunters has been widely criticized by several users of the Ethereum community immediately after the incident with the token depeg of Renzo ezETH.\n\nGoing all in to generate as many restaking points as possible can indeed lead to significant financial losses as soon as the market goes into a downtrend or in case of flash crashes.\n\nLiquidation of ezETH positions on the money market. Source: https://twitter.com/DU09BTC/status/1783054456071868905\n\nIn addition to the personal risk (sometimes disproportionate to the potential return) that users take on by engaging in leverage farming, it is worth noting how all of this creates an unhealthy environment for Ethereum and its ecosystem\n\nMany Ethereum stakers who did not go on leverage, but simply locked their stake on Renzo in order to reuse the consensus stakes found themselves in the middle of an unpleasant situation.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of the liquidation, if it had been of larger amounts, could have affected the price of ETH itself\n\nFor the moment, the worst seems to be over and fortunately no major damages have been reported.\n\nezETH briefly depeg overnight and now everyone's shooting at the ambulance \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc There's nothing safe about ETH restaking!\n\nYou play this game to make money, but for the lure of gain, some people add a layer of risk with protocols that allow them to leverage their position\u2026\u2026 pic.twitter.com/VIoj6n2jVB \u2014 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2 (@0xFastLife) April 24, 2024\n\nIn the midst of the storm, Renzo\u2019s main competitor, the Etherfi protocol, took the opportunity to celebrate the superiority of its liquid restaking token eETH as much more liquid than ezETH.\n\nActually, it was the lack of liquidity in the markets that influenced the drop in the token\u2019s price, resulting in too high of a price impact for sellers.\n\nThe representatives of Etherfi have pointed out through a comment on a post criticizing the entire house of cards of Ethereum restaking, that not all LSRT protocols are the same and that there are safer alternatives."
