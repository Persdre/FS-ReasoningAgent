        "title": "Cloudflare Blocks Abusive Content on its Ethereum Gateway - TorrentFreak",
        "content": "Cloudflare is a content-neutral Internet infrastructure service. The company aims not to interfere with the traffic of its clients and users but, in some cases, it has to take action. This means responding to DMCA subpoenas and takedown requests for hosted content, for example. In addition, Cloudflare now reports it has blocked access to 'abusive' content on its Ethereum gateway.\n\nOne of Cloudflare\u2019s main aims is to make the Internet more secure while respecting the privacy of its users.\n\nThis laudable goal is broadly respected but in common with other internet services, abuse of Cloudflare\u2019s services can lead to conflicting situations.\n\nThe California-based company previously terminated service to controversial sites including the Daily Stormer and Kiwi Farms. These actions were taken voluntarily, with Cloudflare citing an immediate threat to human life as the reason for the Kiwi Farms intervention.\n\nDomain Blocking\n\nIn addition to these rare events, the Internet infrastructure company is also subject to court orders from around the globe. In some cases, these orders require the company to block access to piracy-related domain names.\n\nCloudflare mentions these blocking orders in its latest transparency report which covers the second half of 2022. The report doesn\u2019t mention the number of court orders or blocked domains, but it confirms that Cloudflare complies with legitimate legal rulings.\n\n\u201cIf we determine that the order is valid and requires Cloudflare action, we may limit blocking of access to the content to those areas where it violates local law, a practice known as \u2018geo-blocking\u2019,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\nDNS Blocking\n\nDNS blocking orders apply locally and shouldn\u2019t affect people in other countries. However, things got more complicated recently when an Italian court required Cloudflare to restrict access to three torrent sites through its public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.\n\nCloudflare fiercely objected to the order but ultimately lost the legal battle. That left the company with no other option than to take action. But, instead of blocking content through its global DNS resolver, it geo-blocked the domains for Italians.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that those websites used Cloudflare services, Cloudflare took steps following the issuance of the order to disable access to those websites for users in Italy or from Cloudflare equipment in Italy.\n\n\u201cCloudflare took action to geoblock all three domains that were addressed by the court\u2019s order and were using our service at the time the orders were issued via Cloudflare\u2019s pass-through CDN and security services,\u201d the company added.\n\nIPFS and Ethereum Restrictions\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Cloudflare further notes that it has implemented access restrictions on its public Ethereum gateway. The company doesn\u2019t store any content on the Ethereum network, nor can it remove any. However, it can block access through its service.\n\nIf Cloudflare receives valid abuse reports or copyright infringement complaints, it will take appropriate action. The same applies to the gateway for the decentralized IPFS network.\n\nIn its previous transparency report, Cloudflare already mentioned more than 1,000 IPFS actions a figure that increased slightly in the second half of last year. At the same time, Cloudflare also restricted access to 99 \u2018items\u2019 on the Ethereum network.\n\nSince these are \u2018gateway\u2019 related restrictions there\u2019s no impact on the content hosted on IPFS or Ethereum. Instead, it will only make it impossible to access content through Cloudflare\u2019s service.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of these restrictions are abuse or copyright-related, as not much context is provided. The Ethereum actions are, at least in part, a response to the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s sanctions against the cryptocurrency tumbler Tornado Cash.\n\n\u201cThose sanctions raise significant legal questions about the extent to which particular computer software, rather than individuals or entities that use that software, can be subject to sanctions,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to comply with legal requirements, Cloudflare has taken steps to disable access through the Cloudflare-operated Ethereum Gateway to the digital currency addresses identified in the designation.\u201d\n\nDMCA Notices and Subpoenas\n\nThere are more obvious copyright responses as well. While Cloudflare generally doesn\u2019t block content in response to DMCA notices for customers that use its CDN services, it does remove infringing content permanently hosted on its servers.\n\nThese hosting services have expanded over the years and the same is true for the volume of valid DMCA notices received, up from 18 to 972 in the span of a year, as shown below. That\u2019s still a fairly modest number for a company with millions of customers.\n\nFinally, Cloudflare reports that the number of civil subpoenas, including those issued under the DMCA, has decreased. Rightsholders including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) typically use these requests to obtain identifying information about Cloudflare customers.\n\nIn the second half of last year, the company received 20 civil subpoenas which targeted 57 domain names. That\u2019s the lowest number since Cloudflare first disclosed this statistic five years ago, signaling a downward trend.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of Cloudflare\u2019s latest Transparency Report is available here (pdf)"

        "title": "Weekly Highlights: Bitcoin & Ethereum Hold Strong, Altcoins Shine - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market wraps up a dynamic week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding steady after a significant drop in inflation. Despite the resilience of the market leaders, the spotlight was on altcoins, particularly Kaspa (KSP), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), showcasing notable gains and hinting at potential growth in the near future.\n\nAltcoins Take Center Stage\n\nKaspa (KSP) emerged as the week\u2019s star performer, experiencing an impressive 64% surge, reaching a peak of $0.1519. As of the latest data, KSP is trading at $0.1379, maintaining robust performance despite a slight 2.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nRender (RNDR) followed closely behind, boasting a 50% gain over the week. Currently trading at $3.58, RNDR displays a marginal 3.46% increase in price, accompanied by a 42.49% decrease in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) captured attention with a weekly increase exceeding 30%, now trading at $2.18. NEAR\u2019s impressive performance includes a 20% price increase and an 88.84% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nOther notable altcoins, including Avalanche (AVAX), Immutable (IMX), and Mantle (MNT), also reported gains in their weekly charts. AVAX showed a 24% increase, IMX rose by 22%, and MNT exhibited a 10% uptick, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum remained stable after a notable drop in inflation from a 40-year high last June, currently standing at 3.2%, slightly above the Fed\u2019s target, according to the CPI report. Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase, trading just below its annual peak at approximately $38,000 earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge marks its most robust four-week performance since January, witnessing a remarkable 42% increase from just under $17,000 to nearly $24,000. Bitcoin\u2019s price dominance has returned, albeit temporarily, with the potential for quick rebounds if market sentiment shifts.\n\nSantiment\u2019s analysis revealed fluctuations in Bitcoin wallets during the recent surge. Numerous new smaller wallets with less than 1 BTC flooded the network, while the 1-100 tier flattened out, and the 100+ tier may be experiencing profit-taking.\n\n\ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc2c\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's wallets have fluctuated during this major market-wide surge. Tons of new smaller wallets with less than 1 $BTC have flooded the network. Meanwhile, the 1-100 tier has flattened out, and 100+ tier may be in the midst of some profit taking. https://t.co/va51CcexC1 pic.twitter.com/PNZtA9ir2U \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 17, 2023\n\nAccording to Santiment, Bitcoin\u2019s NVT ratio has significantly improved, signaling a healthy circulation of unique BTC relative to current market cap levels. IntoTheBlock reported a yearly high in the new adoption rate of Bitcoin, reaching 67.62%, indicating a surge in new market participants.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Bitcoin's NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio has improved significantly, one of @santimentfeed's primary alpha #crypto market signals for traders. The metric indicates whether the amount of unique $BTC circulating is healthy relative to current market cap levels. \ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/gu4CDDxMt9 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 16, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s fees rose as ETH surpassed $2,000 last week, but transactions remain relatively cheap compared to previous levels. Santiment highlighted Ethereum\u2019s 38% market value surge in the past four weeks, driven by high network growth and an increase in addresses across different tiers.\n\nAs of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $37,159.19, showing a 1.23% increase over the past seven days and a 2.36% increase in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,023.05, displaying a 0.70% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 4.58% gain over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | Bucking Bearish Trends: Bitcoin\u2019s Unconventional Moonlit Path To A Resilient Bull Cycle"

        "title": "Cardano Founder Debunks \u201cPathological Liar\u201d Claims As New Evidence from Ethereum Days Emerges - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to clear the air after new evidence emerged about his past involvement with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nCardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has often been haunted by the experience he had in his early days in the blockchain ecosystem, especially while working on Ethereum.\n\nIn the latest development, the Cardano founder was compelled to speak in a 22-minute livestream in which he dispelled the rumors and provided clarity to listeners.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the heart of the current matter was a video and documentation shared by Steven Nerayoff. Nerayoff was an early Ethereum advisor who had access to essential communication within the team. In the documentation being sold as an NFT, Nerayoff shared previously private information on a troubling period in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum team wanted to restructure the project and called on Nerayoff for advice, leading to a lengthy call between the advisor and Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. With or without Vitalik\u2019s permission, Nerayoff recorded the call, which he now wants to monetize as an NFT.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nNotably, Charles Hoskinson was among the major subjects of the call. A transcript of the call shows that Charles was mentioned 69 times, with Nerayoff speaking favorably of the entrepreneur\u2019s involvement with Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNew Evidence Clarifies Charles Hoskinson\u2019s Reputation with Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s latest reveal suggests that Charles Hoskinson was a valuable member of the Ethereum Foundation. During the conversation with Vitalik Buterin, Nerayoff spoke highly favorably of Charles Hoskinson and urged the team to bring him back into the ranks, given his experience and strengths.\n\nReviewing this part of the conversation, Charles Hoskinson said in the recent livestream, \u201cHe [Nerayoff] was trying really hard to bring me back into the fold. At this juncture, I was already deep in the thick of things, starting Input Output [Cardano\u2019s engineering arm].\u201d\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Nerayoff\u2019s documentation and call with Vitalik dispel three main accusations that were leveled against him by naysayers. The allegations include that \u2018Charles is a pathological liar, never contributed to the crypto space, and constantly overstated his role in Ethereum\u2019s early development.\u2019\n\nThe Cardano founder, alluding to recent reports by crypto journalist Laura Shin, added that half-baked stories have helped foster those lies. However, such lies hold no water compared to Nerayoff\u2019s independently released information.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson reiterated his long-term commitment to building out Cardano and his reputation in the crypto space. He noted that he has been in cryptocurrency for over 10 years and has had no \u201cclass action lawsuit, legal issues.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the entrepreneur has sustained an impressive track record, having \u2018built a $12 billion dollar valued blockchain, collaborated on over 200 academic research papers, and written a lot of code.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the economic value of these things. [Yet] You can\u2019t disagree with the fact that I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve been building things,\u201d Charles Hoskinson added.\n\nNotably, Cardano (ADA) has consistently ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in recent years. At the same time, the blockchain has seen increased DeFi TVL in the past few months, underlining its continued growth."

        "content": "As blockchains scale, the cost of transactions and blockspace falls. The 2022-2023 bear market has been characterized by a continuous build out of infrastructure, to lay the groundwork for future growth.\n\nYet arguments about the best way to scale abound, they often fall into one of two camps.\n\nOne is \u201cmodular,\u201d with its standard-bearers Ethereum and Cosmos. The other is \u201cmonolithic\u201d which has come to be dominated in the crypto zeitgeist by Solana \u2014 although they prefer the term \u201cintegrated.\u201d\n\nAn essay published Friday by pseudonymous Ethereum advocate Polynya critiquing monolithic blockchains, while not mentioning it by name, has been interpreted by many as a veiled critique of Solana.\n\nThe critique comes against a backdrop of swelling interest in the network spurred by a significant price surge in Solana\u2019s native crypto asset (SOL), which is up 140% in the past month with a market cap approaching $25 billion\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile often praised for its high transaction speed and low fees, Solana has faced criticism in the past for network instability, including outright outages, and high hardware requirements to operate validating nodes\u200b\u200b.\n\nResponding to perceived shortcomings, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has acknowledged some network flaws, but contends the Solana community has worked diligently to mitigate them.\n\nYakovenko views these challenges as part of the network\u2019s growth, likening them to historical issues faced by other major networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nPlans include the mid-2024 launch of Firedancer, the first independent validator client software for Solana (Ethereum has 5), which is expected to increase throughput to as much as a million transactions per second (TPS) in the future.\n\nYakovenko, responding to Polynya\u2019s specific critique, argued the natural growth in computing power coupled with falling costs as hardware becomes commoditized will handle Solana\u2019s needs with aplomb.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya\u2019s essay also advocates for advanced technologies like validity proofs and data availability sampling to address scaling demands, predicting \u201cevery single monolithic blockchain seeking scale will upgrade to tech like validity proofs and data availability sampling or be risk [obsolescence].\u201d\n\nSolana developer Mert Mumtaz, CEO at Helius and co-host of Blockworks\u2019 Lightspeed podcast, responded that Solana could embrace both vertical and horizontal scaling.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya further lamented the crypto industry\u2019s disproportionate focus on infrastructure over user onboarding \u2014 and a dearth of applications with product-market fit \u2014 which Mumtaz derided as the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn response to criticism, Polynya published an addendum post on Sunday in which they acknowledge the tone of the original essay was a bit harsh, but noted \u201ccontent only gets attention in crypto if it\u2019s provocative.\u201d\n\nMonolithic chains that integrate modular components, such as validity proofs and data availability sampling, would be a welcome change, Polynya argues, suggesting they would no longer be \u201cmonolithic\u201d because \u201cper my definition you no longer need all nodes to na\u00efvely reprocess all transactions to verify integrity.\u201d\n\nEndgame\n\nUltimately, this dispute revolves around the question of what is the modus operandi of using a blockchain?\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a public blockchain is lost if you are not resistant for the worst-case scenarios,\u201d Polynya wrote. \u201c[10,000 nodes] is not enough, and we should strive to have 100,000 nodes in different types of places across the world. We need nodes at homes, schools, government offices \u2014 in large cities, in villages, in Chile, in Papua New Guinea, and eventually in space.\u201d\n\nSolana currently has between 2,000 and 3,000 nodes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to have a monolithic blockchain today, the technology to push past its crippling limitations did not exist 5 years ago,\u201d Polynya concludes, with the caveat that the industry will \u201cinevitably converge\u201d on a design using validity proofs and data availability sampling.\n\n\u201cThis is the only currently known way for the blockchain world to achieve our endgame of global scale, all verified on our mobile phones.\u201d\n\nPolynya further warns against continued \u201cPonzifying\u201d of dapps. \u201cAs an industry, collectively, we must invest in consolidating our existing applications which have product-market fit, before traditional incumbents catch up and take away market share,\u201d they said in Sunday\u2019s denouement.\n\nUpdated, Nov. 20, 2023 at 9:52 am ET, with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

To maintain this positive momentum, Bitcoin will need to clear the resistance at the $37,800 mark or risk finding support around $36,500. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Near Procol (NEAR) has marked a substantial 17 percent price increase over the past week, thanks to its partnership with the South Korean platform Zep for metaverse game development. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading around the $2,000 threshold.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate \u2014 Javier Milei \u2014 won the elections in Argentina. On this account, BTC (+2.2 percent) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37,200 levels. Analysts predict support to range between $33,000 to $34,500 with resistance at $38,000. On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF. Joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, the entry of such financial giants in embracing crypto provides positive signals for the sector.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cDogecoin soared dramatically following a groundbreaking partnership with SpaceX, propelling its value to unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, Bitcoin faces market fluctuations, prompting reflection and comparisons to its 2021 performance. Tether strategically invests $500 million in Bitcoin mining, signalling a deliberate expansion and diversification within the stablecoin sector.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. Overall, while favouring bullish trends above $36,400, the market remains cautious, with immediate resistance and support key for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap crossed the 1.4-trillion dollar mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. ETH breached the $2,000 mark per piece due to the euphoria around the Blackrock spot Ethereum ETF application. BTC crossed the $37,000 mark over the weekend and the market is expected to ride the ETF wave in the coming weeks owing to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, both BTC and ETH showed strength, each gaining more than 2.5 percent. This unexpected resilience during the usually quiet weekends might be because of the positive news about Javier Milei, a supporter of Bitcoin, winning the presidential election in Argentina. He sees Bitcoin as a way to return money to the private sector. Looking at the technical side, BTC has consistently bounced back from an important incline trendline support and the 20EMA Daily. Currently, it's trading a bit above $37,300, aiming for the next resistance at $38,000. As for ETH, it's sitting around the Support and resistance flip level of $2,011. Breaking through this could push the price to a major resistance level at $2,130, with ETH keeping above the 20-EMA Daily.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
