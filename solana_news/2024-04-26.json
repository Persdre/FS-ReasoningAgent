        "content": "Polkadot\u2019s governance is currently mulling over a proposal to activate SnowBridge, a cross-chain bridge designed to link the Polkadot blockchain with Ethereum.\n\nA cross-chain bridge essentially serves as a decentralized application (DApp), streamlining asset transfers between blockchains to enhance token utility by fostering cross-chain liquidity.\n\nMarket observers have highlighted the significant role SnowBridge would play in enabling Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem to tap into Ethereum\u2019s extensive DeFi landscape.\n\nThe SnowBridge proposal has garnered substantial support from the community due to the potential benefits, t, with all cast votes currently in favor of its implementation. If approved, SnowBridge is slated to go live in 28 days.\n\nWhat is SnowBridge?\n\nSnowBridge is one of the many bridges under development within the Polkadot ecosystem. This initiative, a collaboration between Snowfork and Parity Technologies, aims to revolutionize the movement of Ethereum assets into and out of Polkadot.\n\nCurrently, bridging ERC-20 tokens into Polkadot necessitates using bridges reliant on third-party signatures. While this method is standard in Web3 ecosystems, it poses limitations for Parachains and dApps on Polkadot due to its impact on their trust model.\n\nSnowBridge offers a solution through a trustless model that relies solely on signatures from first-party Ethereum and Polkadot validators. It operates on BridgeHub and is poised to enhance cross-chain interaction between Polkadot and Ethereum.\n\nSnowBridge has been in development for some time and was deployed on the Polkadot parachain testnet Rococo in January 2024. Subsequently, developers utilized it to transfer assets between the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and AssetHub on Rococo, with ERC-20 tokens initially being the sole supported asset type.\n\nSince its deployment, several updates to SnowBridge have been implemented based on thorough testing and audits conducted by the team and security firms.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem. While the Foundation supports our coverage, we maintain full editorial independence and control over the content we publish.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The company claims the SEC plans to treat Ethereum as a security and that the agency is attempting an \u2018unlawful power grab\u2019 through enforcement actions.\n\nBlockchain company Consensys has filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly overreaching in its plans to regulate the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum is a decentralised blockchain and development platform, which Consensys claims is \u2013 or will be \u2013 the foundation of \u201ccountless\u201d new web3 products and technologies.\n\nThe company alleges that the SEC is attempting an \u201cunlawful power grab\u201d through enforcement actions against Consensys and possibly other blockchain companies using Ethereum. Consensys also claims that Ether \u2013 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform \u2013 is a commodity and not a security.\n\nThe blockchain company claims apps that allow people to make transactions using Ethereum are not securities brokers and \u201ctherefore cannot be regulated by the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to expand its regulatory purview, the SEC would effectively destroy value for hundreds of millions of ether holders and bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling the technological evolution of the internet,\u201d the company claims.\n\nThe complaint wants a court to agree with Consensys\u2019 claims that the SEC has no legal authority to regulate ether, software interfaces built on Ethereum or \u201cthe Ethereum blockchain in general\u201d. This complaint has been filed in a US district court in Texas.\n\nThe SEC did not respond to a request for comment from Coindesk on the new Consensys lawsuit.\n\nCrypto crackdown\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on various crypto trading platforms in the US in recent years. The US agency claims that digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are subject to US securities laws because they are investment contracts. Critics of the SEC claim there the regulations around digital assets in the US are unclear.\n\nLast year, the SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance, claiming the crypto exchanges had acted unlawfully in the country. Towards the end of 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao plead guilty to US charges and the crypto exchange agreed to pay more than $4bn to resolve an investigation.\n\nLast month, the SEC scored a victory in its lawsuit against Coinbase, when a judge ruled that its claim that the cryptocurrency exchange engaged in unregistered sales of securities could be heard by a jury at trial.\n\nThe SEC is facing a hit from recent criticisms, however. Last week, two SEC lawyers resigned after a US judge sanctioned the regulator for \u201cgross abuse\u201d of power in a crypto case, Bloomberg reports.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "title": "Why Ethereum is failing to keep up with Bitcoin and how Solana could benefit - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin hit a multi-year low in April.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the gap between the two could become more pronounced.\n\nInvestors are losing their faith in Ethereum as the cryptocurrency continuously fails to keep pace with Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains.\n\nAnd things could get worse for the world\u2019s biggest altcoin.\n\nNot only have the odds for a US spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund getting approved in May dropped, but Ethereum exchange-traded products suffered $34 million worth of outflows this past week, CoinShares data shows \u2014 making them the only asset group among those CoinShares tracks to register a net outflow since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cETH sentiment is anecdotally at the lowest it has been in years, despite recent developments such as the BUIDL fund by BlackRock,\u201d Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, told DL News.\n\nThe decreasing optimism comes as smaller altcoins, like Solana, have attracted investors who don\u2019t expect Ethereum investments to yield as high returns as they did in the past.\n\nA Bitcoin-driven market\n\nIn previous bull markets, Bitcoin has outperformed other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the cycle \u2014 a trend that looks to be playing out again.\n\nThis time the focus on Bitcoin has been catalysed by inflows to the 10 US Bitcoin ETFs that launched on January 11.\n\nThey have so far seen over $12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nYet, Ethereum has not managed to capitalise on the rally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin \u2014 or ETHBTC \u2014 fell to a low of 0.046 in April, creating the biggest price gap between the two assets in almost three years.\n\nThat means that since ETHBTC peaked in 2022, an investment in Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum by 44%.\n\nThe ETHBTC trading pair shows the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin. Traders use this metric to gauge the relative strength of Ethereum against benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEven though some people may not view ETH as an altcoin per se, its over- or underperformance relative to Bitcoin is a powerful metric to try and understand what kind of market we are in,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs continue to steam ahead, the price gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more pronounced.\n\nAnd there\u2019s reason to believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue to soar. Hong Kong recently approved the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which are set to begin trading April 30.\n\nEthereum ETF approval looks unlikely\n\nWhile Hong Kong also approved a spot Ethereum ETF, the odds of US regulators approving similar funds on May 23 \u2014 the deadline for when they have to either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s application \u2014 are low.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put odds for a May approval at around 25%.\n\nSimilarly, punters on blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket put the odds of an approval at 13%.\n\nThis week, BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF application while competitor Grayscale filed to convert its futures Ethereum ETF to a spot fund.\n\nDespite this, analysts remain sceptical that any US spot Ethereum ETF will be approved.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF is almost certainly going to be rejected in May, which has dampened flows into ETH in already existing [exchange-traded] products,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSolana steals the spotlight\n\nAmong so-called altcoins, Ethereum is the largest, with a market value of $384 billion. But this success is a double-edged sword, according to Nolan.\n\n\u201cETH has a large market cap and investors have turned to lower cap alternatives,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nOne popular alternative is Solana.\n\nMost traders assume it would be difficult for Ethereum\u2019s market value to exceed that of Bitcoin. So with Bitcoin sporting a market value of $1.27 trillion, Ethereum traders see limited upside potential.\n\nDespite rallying 546% over the past year, Solana\u2019s market cap is a comparatively low $64 billion, leaving more room for it to grow.\n\nTraders are also starting to pay more attention to Solana\u2019s price compared with other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI have noticed much more attention this cycle vs. last cycle to SOL/ETH and SOL/BTC pairs,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSigns of hope\n\nThere\u2019s still hope Ethereum could stop bleeding against Bitcoin \u2014 but not for a while.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF should help drive interest. Nolan said he expects an ETF will \u201clikely\u201d be approved in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, if the current bull market repeats previous ones, Ethereum should do better as time goes on.\n\nUntil then, traders will continue to watch the ETHBTC chart closely for clues as to where the top two cryptocurrencies are heading next.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "6 Under $1 Ethereum Meme Coins To Buy This Weekend For 50X Gain - CoinGape",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market shines a spotlight on several Ethereum meme coins to buy that are currently valued under one dollar. Notable among these are Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). Each of these digital currencies has seen impressive gains recently, attracting the interest of investors aiming for significant returns. Their growing popularity may suggest they are viable options for turning a small investment into considerable profits in the volatile crypto market.\n\n1. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), a new cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, is swiftly gaining traction. It aims to match or surpass the success of iconic meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Currently holding the 35th spot in market rankings, Pepe coin boasts a market cap of $3.22 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEnhanced support from platforms like Coinbase and significant acquisitions by large-scale investors have propelled its visibility and value. Market trends and a rise in similar meme coins also contribute to Pepe bullish momentum.\n\nPresently, the Pepe price is $0.000007638, marking a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. This recent surge has positioned it as today\u2019s most popular meme coin on CoinMarketCap. Over the last week, it has witnessed a substantial 47% increase. Over the past 12 months, PEPE value has skyrocketed by 3368%, highlighting it as a potential investment for significant returns this weekend.\n\n2. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues to flourish within the decentralized finance realm. As another Ethereum-based digital asset, it has recently seen a 3% rise in its value. The current price of Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002577, suggesting continued growth. With a 146% increase over the past year, SHIB remains a strong contender in the market.\n\nRanked 11th by CoinMarketCap, SHIB has a market capitalization of $15.18 billion. Factors such as enhanced trading volume, strategic token burns, and the introduction of Shibairum are driving its upward trajectory. This makes SHIB another attractive meme coin for potential investors looking for substantial gains.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI), initially recognized as a meme coin, has evolved significantly in the web3 realm. It now engages prominently in the Metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto,\u201d Floki integrates popular internet culture with cutting-edge, practical projects.\n\nAs of now, Floki price stands at $0.0001885, marking a 4% increase in the last day. It holds the 55th position in global market capitalization, valued at $1.8 billion, and is showing promise for substantial future gains following trends seen in other Ethereum-based meme coins.\n\n4. Grok (GROK)\n\nGrok (GROK) is carving out a space in the meme coin sector. It gains its inspiration from the Grok AI project by Elon Musk\u2019s X company. This association has significantly heightened its profile, pushing it to the forefront of AI-related meme cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrok price is trading at $0.008313, reflecting a slight 2% dip over the past day. With a market capitalization of $52 million, it is ranked 596th on CoinMarketCap, highlighting its position among the top Ethereum meme coins.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK)\n\nBonk (BONK), a newly minted dog-themed cryptocurrency on the Solana network, has made a significant splash by allocating half of its tokens to the Solana community. This strategy has vaulted its market capitalization to a robust $1.74 billion. At the time of writing, the Bonk price is trading at $0.00002667, which represents an 8% increase over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis trend reflects a 79% rise over the past week and an astonishing annual gain of 4100%. Such dynamics suggest BONK could be a lucrative investment, especially as it rides the growing popularity of Solana, positioning itself as a top meme coin with the potential for exponential gains.\n\n6. CorgiAI (CORGIAI)\n\nCorgiAI (CORGIAI) has carved a niche within the artificial intelligence sphere, fueled by a vibrant community-driven project. The introduction of its Corgi Cre8r tool, enabling users to generate text-to-image NFTs, showcases its commitment to innovation.\n\nDespite a slight 1% dip in its price today, CorgiAI\u2019s token, currently valued at $0.001672, has surged 542% this year. This impressive performance highlights its appeal as a promising investment among Ethereum meme coins, hinting at substantial returns for future investors. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is 3097, with a market cap of 507 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, these selected Ethereum meme coins represent promising opportunities for investors. With their low entry price and recent upsurge in popularity, they are prime candidates for potentially lucrative investments this weekend.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume and transactions dipped last month.\n\nSOL\u2019s price action remained bearish, and indicators suggested a further price drop.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a year-long summer in its NFT ecosystem as the blockchain outperformed its competitors. However, Solana\u2019s NFT metrics started to decline in the past month. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish.\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT ecosystem is shining bright\n\nSolanaFloor, a popular X handle that posts updates related to the blockchain, posted a tweet highlighting SOL\u2019s commendable performance.\n\nAs per the tweet, SOL outperformed every other chain, including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Polygon [MATIC], in yearly NFT blockchain user adoption.\n\nWhile SOL\u2019s number of users grew by 33% in the past 365 days, MATIC, BTC, and ETH\u2019s users grew by 29%, 10%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that MadLads, Frogana, and Sharx by sharky.fi were the top NFT collections on Solana, which might have contributed towards the aforementioned achievement.\n\nDespite promising 365-day growth, things started to change in the last month. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Cryptoslam\u2019s data pointed out that SOL\u2019s NFT sales volume dropped by over 36% last month, as did its total number of buyers and sellers.\n\nIts total NFT transactions also dipped by 11%. Santiment\u2019s data also corresponded to this, as SOL\u2019s NFT trade count sank sharply over the past month.\n\nSolana investors need to worry\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s NFT metrics dipped, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL was down by over 25% last month.\n\nIn fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dropped by 7%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $145.55 with a market capitalization of over $65 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto.\n\nThe decline in price also took a toll on the token\u2019s social metrics. SOL\u2019s social volume declined over the past month, reflecting a decrease in its popularity in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s weighted sentiment also remained in the negative zone for the majority of the days. This clearly suggested that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed the token\u2019s daily chart to find whether this bearish price trend would continue longer. We found that both SOL\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline and were headed further below their respective neutral marks.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, the token\u2019s price also failed to go above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as suggested by the Bollinger Bands.\n\nAll these technical indicators hinted that investors might witness a further drop in SOL\u2019s price in the coming days or weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Whales continued to stockpile ETH despite being under water.\n\nMajority of whale positions were longing ETH in derivatives markets.\n\nEthereum [ETH] sank 4.73% over the last 24 hours of trading, reversing the bullish momentum which it gathered following Bitcoin\u2019s halving. The second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $3,125 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe slump however, failed to influence the market behavior of whale investors, as the latter still seemed bullish on ETH\u2019s prospects.\n\nWhales buy ETH\u2019s dip\n\nAccording to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain, whales accumulated hefty amount of ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nA particular wallet with address 0xe0b snapped 1,524 stETH at an average price of $3,159. With this grab, the wallet owner pushed their total stETH holdings beyond $10 million, earning an estimated 3.42% profit.\n\nIn a bigger purchase, a whale amassed 7,128 ETH, worth $22 million at prevailing prices, at $3,111. The wealthy investor reportedly sat on a huge $482 million worth of ETH stash.\n\nAs of this writing, the holder was in a state of unrealized loss.\n\nSupply held by top addresses increase\n\nThese were not isolated developments though. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, ETH whales upped their transaction activity in the last 2-3 days, as seen by the jump in large transfers exceeding $100k.\n\nMoreover, the share of total supply held by top addresses rose from 41.37% on the halving day to 41.45% on the 24th of April, suggesting accumulation by whales.\n\nWhales still betting on ETH\u2019s rise\n\nOn the derivatives markets too, majority of the whales were bullishly positioned. About 63% of the total whale positions on Binance were long on ETH, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThough, it was worth mentioning that the long exposure came down after the halving.\n\nThe market sentiment leaned towards greed, indicating the possibility of increase in buying pressure in the days to come. This could support ETH\u2019s rebound in the days ahead."

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into the pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add. Txs Per Sec. Avg. Tx Fee TVL Market Cap Ethereum ETH 264 mln 30 $4.99 $67 bln $382 bln BNB Smart Chain BNB 444 mln 2,200 $0.0982 $7.8 bln $88.8 bln Solana SOL 28 mln 4,233 $0.005 $5.7 mln $63.9 bln Cardano ADA 4.4 mln 1,000+ $0.16 $397 mln $16.7 bln Tron TRX 225 mln 2,000 $0.95 $8.6 bln $11.0 bln Avalanche AVAX 20 mln 4,500 $0.084 $1.1 bln $13.3 bln Polkadot DOT No data 1,000 Parachain specific $265 mln* $6.8 bln\n\nData collected on April 26, 2024.\n\n*Polkadot\u2019s TVL is calculated as the total sum of TVL across Polkadot parachains (Moonbeam, Acala, etc.)\n\nWhat is the next Ethereum? Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to its transaction speed and overlapping features. In recent years, Tron has also looked to expand its offering, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin, USDD.\n\n5. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of Ethereum's scalability and speed limitations. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\n6. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set, such as Ethereum, include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users. However, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."
