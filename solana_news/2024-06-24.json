        "title": "Cega Shark Bull vaults on Ethereum and Arbitrum combine stability with high returns - Blockworks",
        "content": "The promise of guaranteed high yields with downside protection is often a red flag when navigating a sea of DeFi app marketing speak.\n\nYields are often exaggerated while risks get buried. It\u2019s easy to promote sky-high APRs when you print your own token to fund temporary incentives.\n\nIn the offchain financial world, however, there is such a wild beast emerging from the depths: Shark Fin notes.\n\nDeFi app Cega Finance, a leader in exotic options and structured financial products, launched an onchain version on Ethereum and Arbitrum today.\n\nA Shark Fin is a type of structured financial product that offers a unique risk-reward profile. These notes provide investors with enhanced returns if the price of the underlying asset stays within a predetermined range. The name derives from the shape of the payoff diagram, which resembles a shark\u2019s fin.\n\nSource: Cega.fi\n\nThe potential returns sharply increase to a peak if the asset\u2019s price remains within the range, and then level off or decline if the price moves beyond the specified threshold. This structure allows investors to benefit from stable market conditions while protecting against significant downside risk.\n\nCega\u2019s launch provides conservative investors an onchain version with crypto as the underlying assets.\n\nExpansion from Solana to Ethereum\n\nCega debuted its first four vaults on Solana almost exactly two years ago, but branched out to Ethereum in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRead more: Solana options protocol Cega comes to Ethereum\n\nThe decision to launch on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was always part of Cega\u2019s roadmap, but the collapse of FTX in November 2022 prompted Cega to expedite its plans, according to co-founder Winston Zhang.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we couldn\u2019t wait, and we wanted to continue growing,\u201d Zhang told Blockworks.\n\nInitially, the team considered expanding crosschain via LayerZero or Wormhole, but ultimately decided to hire a new team of Solidity developers to rebuild on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhile that was a little bit slower, it provides the best affordance for safety and security because we\u2019re able to control the smart contracts design ourselves and not rely on a third party,\u201d Zhang explained.\n\nThis transition, which took three to six months, was particularly a response to demand from large-scale investors like DAOs, funds and high-net-worth individuals who prefer the stability of Ethereum.\n\nThe decision to add Arbitrum was driven by its strong DeFi community and significant TVL, making it an ideal target audience for Cega\u2019s products. Arbitrum\u2019s growth, fueled by platforms like GMX, aligns well with Cega\u2019s offerings, which appeals to trading aficionados and derivatives enthusiasts.\n\nIt\u2019s not a migration \u2014 Cega maintains a presence on Solana with thousands of users, and the product will continue to be developed there.\n\n\u201cWe are having conversations about what it means to reprioritize the Solana ecosystem and how to think about product parity for some of the new products that we\u2019ve launched on Arbitrum and [Ethereum] mainnet,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nMaking complex products accessible\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Cega faces is how to simplify complex financial products for their non-professional users. They made a conscious effort to create intuitive visualizations and straightforward documentation to avoid overwhelming users with technical jargon.\n\nTypically reserved for accredited investors in traditional finance, the goal is to make this class of investment tools accessible to everyone, regardless of investment size.\n\n\u201cThe products that we\u2019re building are ultimately derivatives products, but they add a number of benefits for the end user that they can\u2019t get from existing [perpetual futures] platforms or vanilla options platforms,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nThe new \u201cShark Bull\u201d vaults target users who might typically have capital on lending platforms like Aave, and want to increase their stablecoin yield without taking directional risk to crypto markets.\n\nThese vaults offer 100% principal protection with a guaranteed yield of 12.7%, and the potential for up to 30% returns under certain circumstances by combining lending and options strategies.\n\nStablecoins\u2019 lending yield forms the baseline return, while a portion of the yield is used to purchase out-of-the-money (OTM) call options on crypto assets \u2014 the \u201cbull\u201d component, driving the high bonus payouts if prices rise.\n\nThe lending counterparties in this case are not smart contracts but major crypto market makers, so this introduces some credit risk. Cega facilitates these loans but is not a custodian, and manages the risk through stringent legal agreements and ongoing credit monitoring provided by Credora.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin lenders have a new regulation-friendly option for yield\n\nCega, based in Singapore, emphasizes compliance with global regulations. These days, that requires geofencing the US-based customers.\n\nDecentralization plans\n\nThe company raised a total of $9.3 million from notable investors including Dragonfly and Pantera, and does not yet have a token.\n\nZhang said his team deliberately avoided participating in the points incentivization game popular over the past year, preferring to focus on providing real sustainable yield.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually really proud of that,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nEven without incentives, the platform has about $16.6 million in TVL currently, and about $404 million in cumulative trading volume.\n\nLooking ahead, Cega does plan to launch a token while maintaining its core values of responsibility and prudence, Zhang said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many protocols in crypto and in DeFi that just aren\u2019t built on real foundations,\u201d he said, citing the project\u2019s published values.\n\n\u201cThere just have been way too many examples in the ecosystem of carelessness, and lack of responsibility, and that is not us.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Who Holds The Most Ethereum (ETH) in 2024? - Benzinga",
        "content": "SHORT ANSWER: The Beacon Deposit Contract has emerged as the dominant force, holding a staggering 38% of all ETH.\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to power decentralized applications and fuel innovation. But who are the whales holding the vast majority of Ethereum? In 2024, the landscape of major ethereum holders might have shifted. This guide dives into the latest data, revealing the key players \u2014 from individual investors to institutional giants \u2014 who control the most ETH. Join us as we unveil the hidden forces shaping the ethereum ecosystem and explore the potential implications for the future of this dynamic cryptocurrency.\n\nWho Owns the Most Ethereum?\n\nWith the recent ethereum merge transitioning the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a new player has emerged as the biggest ethereum (ETH) holder: the Beacon Chain Deposit Contract. This contract allows users to stake their ETH on the Beacon Chain, the foundation of Ethereum 2.0. This shift to PoS likely explains the Beacon Deposit Contract's significant holding, currently sitting at over 46 million ETH, representing a whopping 38% of all ether. This translates to a staggering value of approximately $165 billion at the time of writing. Essentially, users have locked their ETH in the contract to contribute to the security and validation of transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nTop 10 Ethereum Holders\n\nLet\u2019s explore the top 10 Ethereum holder of current times:\n\n1. Beacon Deposit Contract\n\nThe Ethereum Merge to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) created a powerful new dynamic with the Beacon Deposit Contract. This contract lets users stake their ETH on the Beacon Chain, the core of Ethereum 2.0. This explains the Beacon Deposit Contract's massive holding \u2014 over 46 million ETH, a huge 30% of all Ethereum! Worth roughly $165 billion, users essentially locked their ETH to secure and validate ethereum transactions.\n\n2. Wrapped Ether Contract\n\nWrapped ether (WETH) plays a key role in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Since regular ETH isn't compatible with these platforms, WETH acts as a \u201cwrapped\u201d version that functions as an ERC-20 token. This allows users to seamlessly use their ETH on DeFi apps like Uniswap. Notably, the value of WETH remains identical to regular ETH, offering increased functionality without impacting price. Interestingly, the WETH contract holds a significant amount of ether, currently sitting at over 2.84 million ETH, making it the second-largest holder in the network.\n\n3. Binance 7\n\nBinance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is also a major Ethereum (ETH) holder. Surprisingly, just three of its main ETH addresses (Binance 7, 8, and 28) collectively hold over 3.2 million ETH, making them the network's third-largest holder. These addresses manage exchange functions and bridge ETH between Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum. The bridged ETH resides in the \u201cPeg Tokens\u201d address until it's withdrawn back to the Ethereum network.\n\n4. Arbitrum: Bridge\n\nArbitrum, a popular ethereum scaling solution, is emerging as a significant ETH holder. This technology allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy smart contracts on a faster and cheaper network compared to Ethereum's mainnet. At the heart of Arbitrum lies its bridge contract, currently holding over 1.8 million ETH. This positions the bridge as the network's fourth-largest ETH holder. As Arbitrum gains traction due to its cost efficiency, this holding will likely increase further.\n\n5. Robinhood\n\nRobinhood, the popular trading app known for its commission-free stock trading, also holds a surprising amount of Ethereum. Despite some past controversies, Robinhood is the 5th largest individual holder of Ethereum, with nearly 1.4 million ETH under a single wallet address. This means Robinhood is a major player in the ethereum world, holding a large amount of this cryptocurrency.\n\n6. Kraken\n\nDespite facing SEC charges related to staking options, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken ranks as a major Ethereum holder. Their \u201cKraken 13\" wallet alone holds over 850,000 ETH, making it the 6th largest individual holder. Given Kraken's high trading volume, they likely hold even more ETH in smaller amounts across other wallets, though these wouldn't be on the top 100 individual address lists.\n\n7. Base: Base Portal\n\nNewcomer Base Portal is making waves in the Ethereum world. This project acts as a bridge, allowing users to move their ethereum (ETH) between different blockchains easily. Interestingly, Base Portal holds a significant amount of ETH, currently ranking as the 7th largest individual holder with over 504,000 ETH. This substantial holding suggests Base Portal might play a vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem, but it's still too early to say for certain.\n\n8. Bitfinex 19\n\nAnother major exchange by volume, Bitfinex, stands at 8th position and holds a significant amount of ETH scattered across five top 100 addresses: Bitfinex 19, MultiSig 3, 20, 15, and 5. These collectively hold around 2 million ETH. Two addresses likely serve trading and exchange functions, while the \u201cMultiSig 3\" address might be their secure cold storage wallet due to its multi-signature nature.\n\n9. Gemini\n\nThe Gemini exchange, founded by the Winklevoss twins, is a major ethereum player. Their single wallet address ranks 9th largest holder, containing over 369,000 ETH. This positions Gemini as one of the top exchanges for holding ether, showcasing their confidence in this cryptocurrency.\n\n10. EthDev\n\nThe nonprofit ethereum Foundation oversees Ethereum's development. ETHDEV, a separate group of developers in cities like London and Berlin, acts as the project's development arm. As Ethereum matured, other organizations like ConsenSys joined the ecosystem to tackle specific areas. This division of labor allows focused development and benefits the entire ethereum network. Interestingly, ETHDEV holds over 309,000 ETH, ranking 10th among the largest ether holders.\n\nThe Largest Holders are Contracts, Not People\n\nThe landscape of major ETH holders has shifted significantly in 2024. The Beacon Deposit Contract, a product of the ethereum merge, has emerged as the dominant force, holding a staggering 38% of all ETH. This reflects users' commitment to securing the network by staking their ETH. Wrapped ethereum (WETH), crucial for DeFi applications, sits at number two with over 2.8 million ETH. Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kraken are also major players, holding significant amounts across multiple wallets. Interestingly, newcomer Base Portal and the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange showcase the growing involvement of diverse players in the ethereum ecosystem. While the distribution of ETH ownership highlights its decentralized nature, the Beacon Deposit Contract's dominance underscores the critical role users play in securing the ethereum network.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "content": "Episode 665\n\nThe SEC won\u2019t pursue enforcement against Ethereum 2.0, but why? How much of a role did politics play? And where does that leave staking and court cases involving companies such as Consensys and Coinbase?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nLast week, Consensys revealed that the SEC had concluded an investigation into Ethereum 2.0, referring to when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one.\n\nIn this episode, Laura Brookover, senior counsel & head of litigation and investigations at Consensys, and Sam Enzer, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, explore the implications of this decision on Ether\u2019s status as a commodity versus a security, and why the SEC dropped the pursuit, including whether the shifting political winds played a role. For instance, how much of the decision was influenced by the ETH ETF approvals, Democrats crossing party lines to vote for FIT21 and the repeal of SAB 121, and/or SEC crypto enforcement chief David Hirsch\u2019s resignation?\n\nIn this discussion, they also explained why the closure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that staking, or restaking, is safe from the SEC.

        "title": "Solana's Battle Against Bitcoin And Ethereum: Expert Analysis - TronWeekly",
        "content": "After a major run last year, Solana has struggled to sustain its previous momentum. According to market analyst, Matthew Hyland, SOL will probably underperform compared to Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. Based on indicators and market dynamics, Hyland predicts a challenging path for SOL to break new all-time highs against BTC, mirroring ETH\u2019s performance in the previous cycle.\n\nIMO SOL probably underperforms BTC and ETH going forward I could be wrong about this, but I think the idea of SOL breaking to new ATHs against BTC is similar to ETH last cycle, which it did not happen SOL had a major run; I was VERY VOCAL buying between $16-$25 last year so I don\u2019t hate it by any means and still think it has upside in USD but I don\u2019t think it is likely it will run away and outperform BTC and ETH going forward\n\nSolana's Battle Against Bitcoin and Ethereum: Expert Analysis 3\n\nDespite the challenges of outperforming the two leading crypto assets, Solana is known for its high speed and low transaction costs, attracting developers and projects. It has positioned itself as a potential \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d aiming to resolve scalability issues that plague the ETH chain. Having said that, Ethereum\u2019s transition to ETH 2.0, which promises scalability and energy efficiency, could overshadow SOL\u2019s advantages.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class in several nations and its potential to serve as a hedge against inflation bolster its long-term prospects.\n\nSolana\u2019s Downward Trend and Future Potential\n\nWhile Solana has undoubtedly emerged as a competing rival and has upside potential in USD, its capacity to outshine BTC and ETH remains uncertain. Investors should keep a close eye on market developments and be cautious about betting SOL to lead the altcoins in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nOn the price front, SOL\u2019s price has been on a downward trend in the last week. On June 15th, the price was trading close to $168. At press time, the price is around $127.50, reflecting a decrease of roughly 23.36%.\n\nNevertheless, Solana is a popular platform for decentralized applications [dApps] due to its fast transaction times and low fees. If dApps become more widely used, it could drive up the demand for Solana and increase its price."

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Set to Skyrocket to $150 Again, Ethereum (ETH) Huge Gains Ahead? Massive Reversal Pattern Formed, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Stealth 20% Surge - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana could be aiming at the $150 price threshold once again as the price starts showing reversal potential after reaching the 200 EMA. The trend flattening is often one of the first signs of an upcoming price reversal. However, it is important to stay cautious as in the midterm, Solana is still in a downtrend.\n\nThe SOL/ETH chart indicates that Solana has been steadily declining over the last several months, but there may be a shift in store as of late. The price has bounced back somewhat after touching the 200 EMA, which has served as a support level. This suggests that bullish momentum may be developing.\n\nNear the oversold area at about 35 is where the RSI is currently trading. This could mean that buyers are about to intervene and that the selling pressure is lessening. The MACD histogram also exhibits indications of a possible bullish crossover. An increase in purchasing activity is indicated by volume analysis, which may be good news for Solana.\n\nGiven the large uptick in volume bars, it appears that traders are beginning to stockpile SOL at these lower price points. Despite these encouraging indicators, it is critical to recognize the difficulties Solana may encounter while recovering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's reversal potential\n\nEthereum could be forming a ground for a price surge as the second-biggest cryptocurrency enters the falling wedge pattern formation in addition to relying on the 50 EMA. At this technical threshold, Ethereum could easily perform a reversal.\n\nThe falling wedge pattern is usually interpreted as a bullish reversal pattern indicating that an upward movement may be approaching and that the downtrend may be coming to an end. According to Ethereum's recent price action, the pattern's peak, which typically comes before a breakout, is getting closer. The blue line on the chart, the 50 EMA, has served as an important level of support. The fact that Ethereum's price has repeatedly rebounded from this level suggests that there is significant buying interest in this vicinity.\n\nEthereum's chances of a bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern are greatly increased if it can hold this support. The relative strength index or RSI is currently trading close to 46, suggesting that Ethereum is neither overbought nor oversold.\n\nEthereum has the freedom to rise from this neutral position without being under a lot of selling pressure. Volume analysis indicates that buying activity is gradually increasing, indicating that traders are starting to accumulate Ethereum at these prices. The possibility of a bullish reversal is further supported by the fact that this accumulation phase frequently comes before a notable price movement.\n\nShiba Inu's last hope?\n\nDespite the enormous 25% price drop we saw on Shiba Inu, there is still some hope for a reversal at around $0.000018. However, a quick glance at the trading volume of Shiba Inu clearly shows that it is not the most favorable asset on the market right now.\n\nRecently, Shiba Inu's price dropped by 25%, indicating a significant decline. SHIB is now at a critical support level at $0.000018 due to the drop. This stage may serve as a possible turning point in the event that buyers intervene. Nevertheless, SHIB's trading volume has been comparatively low, suggesting that there isn't currently a lot of buying interest.\n\nOne significant element that could impede a speedy recovery is this low volume. Right now, the relative strength index (RSI) is circling the oversold area. This can suggest that a reversal is imminent and that the selling pressure may have been overdone. Nevertheless, a reversal cannot be ensured by the RSI alone \u2014 higher buying volume is required.\n\nResistant moves have been made by the moving averages, especially the 50 EMA. In order to verify a reversal, SHIB must make a significant volume breakout above these moving averages.\n\nEven though the Shiba Inu market is currently difficult, there is some hope because of the support level at $0.000018. We could witness a 20% increase if SHIB can maintain this support and return toward the moving average.\n\nAn important role is also played by the larger cryptocurrency market. SHIB may benefit if Ethereum and Bitcoin begin to rebound."

        "content": "VanEck initially won\u2019t charge a fee for its Ethereum ETF.\n\nMost prospective ETF issuers haven\u2019t publicised their fees yet.\n\nEthereum ETF fees are likely to be just as low or even lower than those for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds could launch any day now. And one of the last things prospective issuers need to get right are fees.\n\nA recent filing shows that investment-management firm VanEck will be waiving the fee for its Ethereum ETF until some unspecified time in 2025, or until the fund reaches $1.5 billion in assets, whichever comes first.\n\nOnce either of those conditions is fulfilled, the fund will process a 0.20% fee.\n\nVanEck \u201caims to be a leader on crypto ETF fees even if it means we lose money at the outset,\u201d Matthew Sigel, the firm\u2019s head of digital-assets research, posted on X.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to make it up on volume; in this case, decentralised finance volume,\u201d he added.\n\nSigel laid out the gambit in another post: If the Ethereum ETFs create a renewed interest in Ethereum, then the ensuing network activity will likely push the price of Ether up \u2014 which would benefit VanEck\u2019s holdings, he said.\n\nHe also hinted that the firm could potentially take an interest in Ethereum DeFi projects such as Curve or Aave.\n\nVanEck has employed a similar approach toward its spot Bitcoin ETF. The firm is waiving fees entirely until the fund reaches $1.5 billion or March 31, 2025, whichever comes first.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nSo far, the ETF has accrued $614 million in assets \u2014 making it the sixth-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFee war\n\nOut of nine prospective issuers, VanEck and Franklin Templeton are the only two that have disclosed their Ethereum ETF fees.\n\nFranklin Templeton will be offering 0.19% fees on its ETF \u2014 the same as for its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFirms don\u2019t need to disclose their fees until very late in the ETF launch process, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. And issuers are likely waiting for BlackRock to make a move.\n\n\u201cWhat BlackRock is going to charge is probably the single most important missing variable outside of the exact launch date,\u201d Balchunas posted on X.\n\n\u201cTheir fee is the sun that the rest will need to orbit around,\u201d he added.\n\nEven so, VanEck and Franklin Templeton\u2019s opening moves will put pressure on BlackRock to issue an ETF with fees lower than 0.30%, Balchunas said.\n\n\u201cSo far, it looks like Ethereum ETFs are going to have as low or even lower fees than Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d he said.\n\nStaking\n\nOne factor in the fee calculus is that Ether investors can stake their holdings through exchanges and decentralised platforms to earn a 3% yield.\n\nBut they won\u2019t be able to do this through Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAnd this raises a question: Why would institutions want to pay fees for an asset instead of earning a solid yield for it?\n\n\u201cEven paying 0.20% without the staking element seems like a nonstarter to me,\u201d Adam Morgan McCarthy, an analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko Research, told DL News.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "title": "Securities and cryptocurrencies: The SEC drops the Ethereum case, but continues to pursue Ripple - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The latest news from the crypto market talks about new developments in the respective cases of the SEC against Ripple and Ethereum in relation to the security token issue.\n\nThe federal agency of the United States has definitively abandoned all investigations on the Ethereum Foundation, determining that ETH does not fall within the definition of security and thus preparing for the asset\u2019s entry into U.S. exchange-traded funds.\n\nIn the meantime, the dispute against Ripple continues, with the SEC requesting a fine of over 100 million dollars, awaiting the resolution of the case at the trial that will determine once and for all if XRP should be considered a financial security or not.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nThe SEC concludes investigations on ETH: everything ready for the launch of spot ETFs\n\nAccording to recent reports from the cryptographic developer Consensys, the SEC is about to drop all investigations into the Ethereum Foundation, first initiated in March 2023 with the intention of classifying ETH as a security token.\n\nAs reported within the post \u201cEthereum has survived the SEC\u201d and now the insiders of the well-known blockchain of smart contracts will be able to build freely without having to worry about regulatory limitations.\n\nThis very important milestone for the sector comes after Consensys had sued the SEC on April 25, only to renegotiate with the agency on June 7, requesting the case to be closed.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nETH no longer considered a financial commodity, after 6 years in which the SEC has repeatedly changed its mind on the matter. Initially, in fact, in 2018 it expressed opposition to this connection, only to return to accuse the issuers of the currency of selling unregistered securities after the chain\u2019s consensus mechanism transitioned from PoW to PoS.\n\nTo tell the truth, even Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commission, has never given a clear and precise definition regarding Ethereum, while he had expressed himself in a much more convinced manner for other cryptographic products such as those offered by Ripple, Cardano, and Dash.\n\nDuring a testimony to Congress last year, he indeed refused to answer the question of whether ETH fell under the definition of security and if it meets the requirements of the Howey Test.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC Chair Gensler refuses to answer if Ethereum $ETH is a commodity or a security while testifying before congress. pic.twitter.com/IkDTgNrfix \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 18, 2023\n\nNow that the SEC has closed the investigations on Ethereum, we can officially prepare for the listing of the cryptocurrency in the spot ETF markets in the United States.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission had already approved this kind of financial products with underlying ether in May, but the S-1 applications of the registrants were not given the green light.\n\nThe landing of exchange-traded funds for ETH could now be very close: indicatively the listing is expected by the beginning of autumn but it could also arrive in the coming weeks.\n\nThe asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise are getting ready by starting to release the first promotional videos of the next investment offering, implying that it is only a matter of time before Ethereum makes an appearance on Wall Street.\n\nUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024\n\nDespite the victory against the SEC in a historic lawsuit, Consensys warns that the broader web3 sector could still be under the watchful eye of the federal agency.\n\nAs reported in a post from last week:\n\n\u201cThe closure of the Ethereum investigation is important, but it is not a cure for the numerous blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under the SEC\u2019s illegal and aggressive cryptocurrency enforcement regime.\u201d\n\nThe SEC abandons Ethereum, but continues the case against Ripple: the 100 million dollar fine\n\nOne of the cryptocurrency companies still in the eye of the storm is Ripple, with the SEC motivated to classify XRP as a security despite a court having refuted this connection last year.\n\nAt this moment the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission is asking the company that manages the issuance of the cryptocurrency, for compensation of 102.6 million dollars after reducing the amount from an initial fine set at 2 billion dollars for selling XRP without a license.\n\nRipple refuses to give in to this bullismo, and has recently proposed a fine of 10 million dollars, citing the agreement with Terraform Labs as justification. However, the SEC has countered that such a low fine \u201cwould not meet the purposes of civil penalty laws.\u201d\n\nThe regulator has indeed clarified that Terraform Labs has agreed to destroy \u201cthe keys to all its securities in crypto assets\u201d, \u201creturn a significant amount to investors in those securities\u201d, and remove \u201ctwo of the board members in command at the time of the violations\u201d.\n\nAs stated by the SEC itself:\n\n\u201cRipple also confronts the dimension of the sanction of Terraform with the amount of the \u2018gross sales\u2019 of that defendant, arguing that the Court should impose the same ratio (1.27%). But this is not an apples-to-apples comparison\u201d\n\nIn the middle of this debate, last week Judge Phyllis Hamilton dismissed at least the 4 compensation claims in separate class actions, while still keeping the main case alive to label Ripple\u2019s token as an unregistered security.\n\nIn particular, Hamilton focused on the fact that Brad Garlinghouse, founder of the accused company, had insistently promoted the currency in 2017 while he himself was proceeding to sell large shares on the market.\n\nThe promotional activity of Ripple which Judge Hamilton may be treating with more weight than Judge Torres could give the expectation. There seems to be some additional evidence of promotional statements before Judge Hamilton. The whole remaining cause of action going forward\u2026 https://t.co/Cd1RS4xQgX \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2024\n\nDespite Judge Annalisa Torres having previously closed the XRP-security case, now everything seems to be back in the spotlight: the ball is now in the court of the trial, which will decide whether to classify Ripple\u2019s digital currency used for cross-border payments as a financial security.\n\nThe SEC is trying to assert itself by instilling fear in the entire digital token industry, in order to \u201cdiscourage future misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector\u201c.\n\nIn the meantime, while the federal agency limits the expansion of the crypto sector with these attempts at destabilization, more and more famous personalities and US celebrities are illegally promoting tokens linked to their name, which inevitably end up causing their investors to lose money."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Price Going To Crash Below $3,000 Support? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has faced intense selling pressure in the past couple of weeks despite starting June above $3,800. May was a bullish month for Ether which soared almost touching $4,000, thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nodding to spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe downturn to $3,300 in the last two weeks can be attributed to the larger macro environment. Investors in the crypto market have not been too amused by the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish stance on interest rate cuts.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis coupled with increased profit taking ahead off the start of the actual trading of the spot ETF has seen Ethereum price dive toward the $3,000 mark.\n\nShould the selling pressure increase this week, ETH price might fall below $3,000. Such a move could lead to cascading price dips as investors are likely to make irrational decisions to protect their capital.\n\nHowever, in an incoming inflation report in the US, the PCE price index could bring some level of relief to the crypto market. Experts are also looking toward the US election likely to be bullish for crypto later in the year.\n\nWhat To Do As Ethereum Price Grinds Toward $3,000\n\nEthereum is seen struggling to defend support at $3,300 during US business hours on Monday. Key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) validate the downtrend as it falls in the neutral area, getting closer to the oversold region.\n\nThe smart contracts token seems largely disadvantaged based on its position below two key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs); the 20-day and 50-day.\n\nA potential death cross pattern would further destabilize Ethereum. Its occurrence on the daily chart may trigger traders to consider shorting ETH, thus creating more headwinds for the token.\n\nThe area with the most potential for support lies around $3,000 as highlighted by the 200-day EMA. A dive to this level may result in two actions; the first being an immediate rebound toward $4,000 as liquidity is collected or a continued fall below $3,000.\n\nA previous retest of this support at $3,000 extended the correction to $2,800 following the crypto sell-off in April and early May. A similar move is possible and one that may stretch to $2,500.\n\nNevertheless, the expected start of spot Ethereum ETFs trading on July 2 according to insight from analyst Eric Balchunas could be of immense relief to Ethereum.\n\nETFs will expose Ethereum to new markets among institutional investors who may be pressured to seek exposure to the crypto on traditional stock exchanges. Bitcoin rallied, achieving a new all-time high in March after the SEC approved the spot ETFs in January.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the potential to gain momentum with increasing demand from the ETF. Therefore, this could be a good time to buy ETH and speculate on a stronger rebound in July and August.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF launch: Here\u2019s what you need to know - Gulf Business",
        "content": "Image credit: Supplied\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Bitcoin, the Ethereum cryptocurrency is about to get its own Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nIn May this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of 8 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by spot Ether. These include the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Franklin Templeton\u2019s Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\n\n\nThe move comes after the SEC in January approved bitcoin ETFs. A spot ethereum ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to the price of ethereum without the complications and risks of owning ethereum directly.\n\nOver the last three months, the price of Ethereum has risen by more than 5 per cent to trade at levels or around $3,590 on several cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAnd in a note published by Bybit, the world\u2019s third largest cryptocurrency exchange says that \u201cthe game-changing ETF will bring the second-largest cryptocurrency to everyday brokerage accounts and institutional investors\u201d.\n\nBybit further notes that trading in an ethereum ETF is expected to kick off in the first week of July.\n\n\u201cEthereum is the crypto product favored by traditional capital such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, both of whom have tokenised funds on the platform,\u201d said Hao Yang, head of financial products at Bybit.\n\n\u201cGiven this, the chain seems poised to become the institutional pick. With its native yield, the ETH token allows for composability, and we are seeing protocols building interesting derivatives based on ETH\u2019s stable yield, leveraging this to create crypto primitives that mimic those built on top of the US Treasury market. Finally, because a portion of ETH is burned (sent to a wallet from which no withdrawals are possible), the asset can become deflationary, which means the more network effects kick in, the scarcer the asset becomes.\u201d\n\nPublished below is the full note from Bybit, which provides an explainer of what to expect in the coming weeks and months.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum (ETH) ETF?\n\nAn exchange-traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, holding assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds. The ETH Spot ETF is unique because it is directly backed by Ethereum, meaning it holds actual ETH in its reserves. This allows investors to gain exposure to ETH\u2019s price movements without purchasing or managing the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Impact?\n\nThe potential inflows resulting from the ETH Spot ETF are substantial. Expectations are that it will capture 15-20 per cent of the assets of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, translating to around $8 \u2013 12bn and more from global markets. These anticipated inflows are driven by market interest, accessibility, and regulatory approval, enhancing overall market stability and growth.\n\nMoreover, based on Metcalfe\u2019s Law, the network effects of increased adoption and usage of Ethereum are expected to strengthen its ecosystem, further driving up its value. The introduction of the ETH Spot ETF is likely to bolster development on Ethereum, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of the digital economy.\n\nGiven these developments, many crypto analysts and experts expect ETH to reach new all-time highs by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to recent data, Bybit\u2019s institutional investors\u2019 exposure to ETH has almost tripled since the ETF announcement on May 24, 2024\u2014moving from 6.54% to a current weighting of 14.29%. This surge underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future performance and the expected positive impact of the ETF launch.\n\nInstitutional Investor Allocations Before ETH ETF Announced (Snapshot 10/5/2024)\n\nInstitutional Investor Allocations After ETH ETF Announced (Snapshot 14/6/2024)\n\nRetail investors on Bybit have also increased their ETH allocations, although not as dramatically as institutional investors. The allocation to ETH has risen from 7.40% to 9.52%, reflecting a cautious but positive response to the ETF announcement.\n\nRetail Investor Allocations Before ETH ETF Announced (Snapshot 10/5/2024)\n\nRetail Investor Allocations Before ETH ETF Announced (Snapshot 14/6/2024)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe announcement of the ETH Spot ETF has had a big impact on investment portfolios. Institutional investors have shown a significant shift in their strategies, tripling their ETH allocations, while retail investors have steadily increased their exposure to Ethereum. These changes highlight the growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and the potential of the ETH Spot ETF to drive further market dynamics."

According to top market analyst Michael van de Poppe, with the ongoing drop in the dominance of Bitcoin, Ethereum might take over these social conversations moving forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShifting investor focus\n\nAs spotted by van de Poppe, the dominance of Bitcoin has plateaued at 58%, setting the tone for Ethereum to enter the limelight. Van de Poppe noted that the spot Ethereum ETF product will shape the narrative eventually, as investors look for the next things that can drive optimism.\n\n#Bitcoin dominance continues to peak at 58%.\n\n\n\nIn that regard, it seems likely that we'll be having more eyes on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin in the upcoming period due to the Ethereum ETF. pic.twitter.com/bVRk9uwUSy \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 25, 2024\n\nBitcoin has not helped the market much lately as its price has continued to nosedive, driving bearish sentiment for other altcoins. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin has inked a minor 0.24% surge to $61,324.10 after falling as low as $60,660 in the early morning trading session.\n\nThe majority of altcoins notably decoupled from Bitcoin, with the likes of Solana (SOL) outshining on the market, with prices soaring 9.11% to $138.59. With Bitcoin failing to step up as needed, the decoupling has spread to Chainlink (LINK) and Toncoin (TON), among others, all of whom are now up 5.69% and 5.4% to $14 and $7.612, respectively.\n\nEthereum spotlight\n\nThis month thus far, the trends on the spot Bitcoin ETF market marked by the sustained outflow have marred any chances of recovery in the near term. The majority of the uptick the market has printed thus far has come from Ethereum as the U.S. SEC ended its securities investigation into the asset.\n\nAs it stands, the ecosystem is now anticipating word on the potential approval of S-1 registrations that will ultimately usher in the trading of ETFs. Though experts have predicted there might be a lower volume of the product, it is still considered the biggest catalyst that might break the current market bull-bear uncertainty."

Ethereum (ETH) follows with $33 million in liquidations. This follows the 24-hour tally rising to $330 million yesterday afternoon after Bitcoin fell below $60,000 for the first time since early May.\n\nThis sharp rise in liquidations is reflective of the heightened market volatility and bearish sentiment.\n\nThe Bitcoin price dipped by 2.2% in the last 24 hours to sell for $61,516.48, while the Ethereum price shaved off 0.7% to trade at $3,382.27 on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBTC and ETH have lost about 6.5% and 1.4% in the last seven days, respectively.

        "title": "July forecasts for the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum: analysis by Ryan Lee of Bitget - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "According to the latest forecasts, in the month of July, the price performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be strongly influenced by a series of economic and market factors.\n\nRyan Lee from Bitget offers a detailed analysis of the main elements that could determine the trends of these two giants of cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nWhat are the price predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future?\n\nAs anticipated, Ryan Lee of Bitget has released important forecasts regarding the price trend of the two well-known cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum. One of the main factors to consider, according to him, is the macroeconomic environment.\n\nRecently, in fact, the net liquidity index of the Federal Reserve (FED) has exceeded 6.5 trillion dollars, releasing 400 billion dollars of liquidity into the market since the end of June.\n\nThis level of liquidity is the highest in the last two years. Furthermore, with the prospect of future interest rate cuts, market liquidity is expected to become even more abundant. Thus favoring a bull trend in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnother positive indicator for the cryptocurrency market is the increase in the market cap of stablecoins, which went from 160 to 162 billion dollars in June. This increase indicates a net inflow of capital into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite a contraction of the overall market cap in June, the increase in stablecoins suggests that leverage in the cryptocurrency market is currently low, leaving room for further bull movements in the future.\n\nKey events: Mt. Gox refunds and spot ETFs on ETH\n\nMoving forward, we see two fundamental events that could significantly influence the prices of BTC and ETH in July. First of all, Mt. Gox has announced that it will start reimbursing BTC and BCH at the beginning of July.\n\nThis refund has raised fears of significant selling pressure, as Mt. Gox has moved 7 billion dollars of assets on the chain. A factor that could potentially cause a substantial drop in BTC prices.\n\nD\u2019altro canto, i progressi sull\u2019ETF Spot su ETH potrebbero avere un impatto positivo su Ethereum. Alla fine di maggio, la SEC ha approvato il deposito 19b-4 e recentemente, Fidelity, 21Shares e Grayscale hanno presentato i moduli S-1 dell\u2019ETH Spot ETF alla SEC.\n\nIt is very likely that the ETF ETH will be officially launched on the US capital market in July. Thus leading traditional funds to directly purchase ETH and potentially determining a bull trend for ETH.\n\nIn summary, it is expected that in the month of July the price range of BTC will be between 58,000 and 73,000 dollars, while the price range of ETH will be between 3,100 and 4,500 dollars.\n\nIt is likely that the ETH/BTC exchange rate will continue its upward rebound, supported by the macroeconomic factors and market events described.\n\nThese developments could determine an interesting dynamic for investors and enthusiasts in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nBitcoin drops to $61,000: brief analysis of the causes of the crash\n\nBitcoin has recently experienced a significant price drop, falling towards the $61,000 level and hitting a new monthly low.\n\nVarious factors have contributed to this decline, including mining activities, Federal Reserve policies, the lack of new inflows, and market indicators.\n\nBTC miners play a crucial role in the recent decline. There has been a significant increase in sales from old wallets, predominantly held by miners, following the recent Bitcoin halving event, which cut daily production from 900 to 450 Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner reserves have dropped to the lowest levels in the last 14 years, with a decrease of 50,000 units since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis month, the miners sold over 30,000 BTC, worth about 2 billion dollars, mainly on the exchanges, directly contributing to the price drop.\n\nFurthermore, the German government has moved 600 million dollars of Bitcoin to the exchanges, selling 200 million dollars in a single day.\n\nWith holdings of approximately 3 billion dollars in Bitcoin, this sudden sell-off, likely induced by financial requirements amid economic pressures, has had a significant impact on the market.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, the spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States recorded the fifth consecutive day of outflows, totaling over 900 million dollars for the week."

        "title": "Ethereum: Will ETFs push ETH to $4K or drag it down to $2.4K? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Analyst warns that ETH could dump to $2.4K after ETF launch\n\nAnother market observer blamed macro conditions, BTC and SOL, for ETH\u2019s negative sentiment.\n\nExpectations of the Ethereum [ETH] ETF have been low, and analysts have had mixed views on the topic.\n\nAs of press time, ETH retreated to a low of $3.2K, an 18% drop from its recent high of $3.9K after the partial approval of ETFs in late May.\n\nWith only days to possible ETF launch, Andrew Kang, founder of crypto fund Mechanism Capital, expected ETH to drop further to $2.4K. Part of his recent analysis read,\n\n\u2018Before the ETF launch, I expect ETH to trade from $3,000 to $3,800. After the ETF launch my expectation is $2,400 to $3,000.\u2019\n\nKang suggested that ETH ETF flows could be dismal in the first few weeks for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the SEC\u2019s 180-degree pivot and approval in late May was a surprise move that limited the time to convince large ETH holders to move to ETF.\n\nSecondly, Kang cited that moving to ETF doesn\u2019t come with staking yield perks. As a result, he estimated ETH ETF could attract only 30% of BTC ETF flows in the first six months, approximately about $1.5 \u2013 $4.5 billion.\n\nOther reasons for Ethereum\u2019s negative sentiment\n\nOn his part, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, suggested that the negative ETH sentiment stemmed from being under the shadow of BTC and Solana [SOL].\n\nThompson added that SOL\u2019s repricing relative to ETH reinforced the \u2018ETH killer\u2019 narrative.\n\n\u2018SOL has repriced 6x higher relative to ETH, so this is not as easy of a layup as it was\u2019\n\nThompson also noted that the BTC ETFs and massive interest in underpriced SOL further isolated ETH into \u2018middle child syndrome.\u2019 Moreover, the liquidity crunch made things worse,\n\n\u2018On top of that, overall prices have been stagnant to down for 3 months and market sentiment is in the gutter due to a macro/liquidity blip.\u2019\n\nDespite the negative sentiment, other analysts, like QCP Capital, maintained a bullish outlook ahead of the ETF launch in early July and noted,\n\n\u2018ETH bullishness persists with ETH vols trading at an 18% premium to BTC in expectation of an imminent ETH spot ETF launch.\u2019\n\nQCP analysts had previously projected a retest of $4K was possible after the ETF launch. As of press time, ETH traded at $3.2K, and it remains to be seen how ETF will determine volatility and price direction."

        "title": "Incoming Ethereum Price Crash: Analyst Flags Warnings of Spot ETH ETF Launch - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The reaction and market sentiment towards Ethereum spot ETFs is somewhat muted in comparison to when Bitcoin products launched earlier this year.\n\nThese are the findings of crypto entrepreneur and investor Andrew Kang, who published a lengthy analysis of the impact of Ethereum ETFs on X on June 23.\n\nBitcoin ETFs opened the door for many new buyers to make BTC allocations within their portfolios. However, \u201cthe impact of ETH ETFs is a lot less clear-cut,\u201d he said.\n\nETH Price Could Tank\n\nKang estimates that the Ethereum ETF flows will be around 10% to 15% of Bitcoin ETF flows, resulting in roughly $500 million to $1.5 billion in true net buying within six months.\n\nIt was reported last week that Fidelity will seed its Ethereum ETF With $4.7 million, so the buying has already begun. In March, Standard Chartered predicted that inflows would reach $45 billion in the first 12 months of Ethereum ETF trading.\n\nNevertheless, Kang offered several reasons why the impact of an Ethereum ETF is expected to be less significant than that of Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum is seen as more of a tech asset rather than a macro asset like BTC. Additionally, there is less institutional interest and buying pressure for it since the its current valuation metrics, such as the price-earnings ratio, make it harder to justify to traditional finance allocators, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is natural that those deep in the crypto space have a relatively high mind share and buy-in of Ethereum. In reality, it has much less buy-in as a key portfolio allocation for many large groups of non-crypto native capital.\u201d https://t.co/On2KWjAlLx \u2014 Andrew Kang (@Rewkang) June 23, 2024\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s positioning before any ETFs are launched is different from Bitcoin\u2019s as the asset is already up 4x from its lows while BTC was up 2.75x before its ETF launches, he added.\n\nTherefore, Kang expects ETH to trade between $3,000 and $3,800 before the ETF launch but potentially fall to between $2,400 and $3,000 after the launch. A dump to the lower estimate would wipe 30% off the asset\u2019s current value.\n\nHowever, if BTC increases to $100,000 at the end of this year or early next, it could drag Ethereum and altcoins up with it, he predicted.\n\nKang\u2019s bearish Ethereum stance didn\u2019t end there. He expects a continued downtrend for the ETH/BTC ratio over the next year, ranging between 0.035 and 0.06.\n\nETH Prices Dip Below $3,400\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price tumbled in the past 24 hours alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, which remains riddled with uncertainty.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is found trading below $3,400, down 3.4% on the day and 5.3% on the week.\n\nThe rest of the market is also declining. Bitcoin dropped below $63K for a 2.5% loss in the last day, while BNB and Solana lost 3% and 6.2%, respectively.\n\nNot All Bearish On Ethereum\n\nThe only bullish prediction was that large asset managers such as BlackRock could use Ethereum to tokenize real-world assets, but \u201chow much value this translates into for ETH and on what timeline is uncertain,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditionally, ConsenSys said last week that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was closing its investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThis could solidify ETH\u2019s status as a commodity rather than a security, which is also very bullish for the asset and the rest of the altcoins."

        "content": "During previous bull markets, the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated a keen ability to time the market with its ETH holdings.\n\nHowever, the foundation appears to have departed from this established pattern.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Unexpected Selling Restraint\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation was found to have executed large sales of ETH near peak valuations in the past. This strategy has allowed the organization to capitalize on high prices and potentially secure funding for ongoing development and operations.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s latest data, the foundation has yet to engage in any significant selling activity in this current market cycle.\n\nSuch a deviation raises important questions about the organization\u2019s current strategy as per the on-chain intelligence platform as well as the future direction of the market. Ethereum Foundation refraining from offloading ETH tokens could mean that it believes the cryptocurrency has more potential for growth.\n\nETH has been under significant pressure along with the broader cryptocurrency market. The asset has dropped to $3,370 this week. Hence, such a case presents bullish sentiment despite almost a 10% drawdown in its price over the past month.\n\nAlternatively, the Foundation may have adopted a new approach to managing their assets.\n\n\u201cHistorically, during each bull market, the Foundation has strategically sold substantial amounts, often aligning these sales almost perfectly with market peaks. In the current cycle, the Ethereum Foundation has yet to execute any significant sales. Does this mean the peak is yet to come, or has the Foundation changed its approach?\u201d\n\nPrevious ETH Sales\n\nIn January this year, Arkham Intelligence flagged a blockchain address associated with the Ethereum Foundation that sold $1.6 million worth of ETH.\n\nLater in April, Peckshield Alert revealed that the Foundation had converted a portion of its ETH holdings into stablecoins in April. According to the data, the foundation converted 100 ETH to 354,000 DAI. During this time, ETH was trading above $3,600."

        "content": "On-chain data suggests this signal that has historically occurred around Ethereum peaks has yet to appear in the current cycle.\n\nEthereum Foundation Wallets Haven\u2019t Made Large Outflows This Cycle So Far\n\nIn a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed a pattern that Ethereum has witnessed alongside its previous market peaks.\n\nThe pattern in question is related to the netflows for the wallets associated with the Ethereum Foundation. The ETH Foundation is a non-profit entity supporting the cryptocurrency and its ecosystem.\n\nBelow is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the net amount of ETH (in USD) moving in or out of the wallets connected to this organization.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the netflows for the Ethereum Foundation have generally taken negative values during the past bull markets. Negative netflows naturally correlate to a net amount of ETH movement away from the wallets connected to the company.\n\nInterestingly, the indicator has seen especially large red spikes around the tops of the cryptocurrency. As IntoTheBlock explains,\n\nHistorically, during each bull market, the Foundation has strategically sold substantial amounts, often aligning these sales almost perfectly with market peaks.\n\nThe chart shows that the indicator\u2019s value has been more or less neutral during the past few months, even though the asset\u2019s price has increased significantly.\n\nThis suggests that the Ethereum Foundation hasn\u2019t been making any major sales during this bull market. Given the historical pattern, this may be a sign that a top isn\u2019t yet here for the cryptocurrency, or at least the organization doesn\u2019t judge it to be so.\n\nAnother explanation, however, could be that the non-profit entity has changed its strategy for this new cycle, meaning that the past trend would no longer hold the same weight.\n\nIn some other news, the official email of the Ethereum Foundation was recently compromised, as Tim Beiko, one of the ETH developers, had revealed in an X post.\n\nThe developer had noted that the organization was trying to reach out to SendPulse, an email automation service used by the firm, to resolve the problem.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Beiko confirmed that the team sent out an update to subscribers of the Ethereum Foundation blog, warning them that the previous email, announcing a \u201cstaking platform\u201d by the organization, resulted from the compromise.\n\n\u201cWe should have locked down all external access, but we are still confirming,\u201d said the developer in the post.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum plunged under the $3,300 level yesterday, but the asset has since recovered above $3,400."

        "content": "Despite anticipation around the Ethereum ETF, ETH-based memecoins showed marginal gains.\n\nWhile some see bullish potential in Ethereum\u2019s future, Andrew Kang predicted a possible price drop.\n\nDue to the anticipated approval of the Ethereum [ETH] ETF, altcoins are enjoying a bullish surge, while Bitcoin [BTC] is hovering near the $60k mark.\n\nThis has also resulted in many foreseeing this as a bullish trend for July.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s price\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, Ethereum declined by 1.15%, showing red candles on the daily chart. But AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of IntoTheBlock data presented a contrasting view.\n\nThe data indicated that despite the price decline, bulls outnumbered bears with a 7-day average of 107 bulls compared to 95 bears, suggesting that buying pressure outweighed selling pressure at press time.\n\nImpact on Ethereum-based memecoins\n\nContrary to expectations, the upcoming approval of the ETH ETF also did not lead to substantial gains in the memecoin sector.\n\nWhile the top Solana memecoins surged by up to 14% in the last 24 hours, and the leading Base memecoins saw a 7.6% increase, ETH memecoins showed only marginal gains.\n\nFor an in-depth analysis, AMBCrypto examined the price action of Dogwifhat [WIF], a Solana [SOL]-based memecoin, Brett [BRETT], a Base blockchain memecoin, and Shiba Inu [SHIB], an Ethereum-based memecoin.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, WIF, and BRETT saw increases of 17.1% and 12.4% respectively, while SHIB was up by only 0.5%.\n\nThis disparity indicated that the positive market sentiment surrounding Solana and Base memecoins did not extend uniformly to Ethereum-based memecoins following the news of the ETH ETF approval.\n\nHowever, this did not diminish investor interest in the largest altcoin as underlined by Anomander, Founder at Legion Ventures, who said,\n\n\u201cObviously, the crypto market has topped on the Ethereum ETF approval. Keep blaming low-tier celebrities for launching their memecoins.\u201d\n\nSharing a similar line of thought, and drawing a comparison between BTC and ETH\u2019s price action, crypto analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe took to X and noted,\n\n\u201cBitcoin dominance continues to peak at 58%. In that regard, it seems likely that we\u2019ll be having more eyes on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin in the upcoming period due to the Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nEthereum ETF launch, not a good sign?\n\nHowever, not everyone was optimistic about the ETH ETF\u2019s impact on Ethereum.\n\nAndrew Kang of Mechanism Capital, in his recent post, speculated that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs may kick ETH\u2019s price down to $2,400.\n\nHe said,\n\nFurther in his analysis, he pointed out that while there is potential for growth in ETH futures, the current lack of interest from savvy traders could signal concerns about the performance of ETH ETFs in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe BTC ETFs opened the door for many new buyers to make bitcoin allocations within their portfolio. The impact of ETH ETFs is a lot less clear-cut.\u201d\n\nAll in all, these analyses suggest that the market is not as bullish on ETH ETFs as it was on BTC ETFs, potentially leading to less dramatic price movements for Ethereum."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading inside a descending wedge, and a breakout above $64,600 signals a bullish move.\n\nEthereum price is approaching its key support at $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating within a descending trendline, with a potential bullish breakout anticipated above $64,600. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices retraced to critical support levels before gearing up for a bullish upswing.\n\nBitcoin price consolidating within a descending wedge\n\nBitcoin price is trading inside a descending channel, drawn from multiple swing highs and lows between early June and mid-June, as shown in the daily chart below.\n\nIf BTC continues to decline, it could find support at $62,451, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from a swing low of $56,552 on May 1 to a swing high of $71,995 on May 21.\n\nIf the $62,451 support holds and BTC breaks above the descending channel, it could rally 7.5% to reach its previous resistance level of $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart are below their respective mean levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nThis development would provide additional momentum to the recovery rally.\n\nIf bullish sentiment prevails and the overall cryptocurrency market shows optimism, BTC may extend its rally by 6% from $67,147 to retest its previous resistance level of $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin price breaks and closes below its daily support level of $60,800, the bullish thesis could be invalidated, leading to a 4% crash to its weekly support level of $58,375.\n\nEthereum price could retest key support level\n\nEthereum's price is declining towards its support level of $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from a swing low of $2,862 on May 14 to a swing high point of $3,977 on May 27.\n\nIf this support holds, ETH price could rally 13% to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are both below their mean level of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,288 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price set for a downward correction\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.499, its daily resistance level, and is currently trading at $0.477.\n\nIf Ripple's price breaks above $0.499, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart is below the 50 mean level, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is below its zero line. If bullish momentum persists, both momentum indicators must remain above their respective thresholds of 50 and zero. This would provide further support to the recovery rally.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if Ripple's daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, establishing a lower low on the daily chart would invalidate the bullish outlook. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana and Ripple: The Biggest Crypto News of the Past Week - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 24 Jun 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAmid revolutionary announcements, technological evolutions, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a territory of limitless innovations and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here is a summary of the most impactful news from the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nElon Musk says NO to crypto on Twitter!\n\nElon Musk, well-known for his support of Dogecoin, is working on launching a payment service via Twitter called \u201cX Payments.\u201d However, this service will not include cryptos initially. Twitter Payments LLC has obtained its first money transfer license in New Hampshire, signaling advances in integrating a fiat currency payment system. The decision to exclude crypto could be related to the volatility and regulatory risks associated with cryptos. This cautious strategy has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto community, with some seeing it as a step back while others see it as a strategic move that could evolve over time.\n\nTether launches Alloy: A gold-backed stablecoin!\n\nTether, famous for its stablecoin USDT, has launched a new stablecoin called \u201cAlloy.\u201d This stablecoin is backed by physical gold via Tether Gold (XAUt) and is designed to offer the stability of gold while enabling digital transactions. Alloy by Tether is a platform that allows the creation of collateralized synthetic digital assets. Users can mint aUSDT by depositing XAUt via smart contracts and price oracles, offering a new form of stability and flexibility in crypto transactions. This initiative is part of the trend towards the tokenization of real assets, offering an innovative combination of traditional security and blockchain technology.\n\nBNB Chain reduces fees by 90% with Haber\n\nThe BNB Chain network has recently activated the Haber hard fork, resulting in an impressive 90% reduction in transaction fees. This update includes the BEP-336 proposal, inspired by Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844, introducing blob transactions to optimize data storage and processing. By grouping transactions into attached blobs, verification becomes more efficient, reducing network costs to around $0.0001. This improvement particularly benefits the layer 2 solution, opBNB, and the decentralized storage solution BNB Greenfield. Despite a period of volatility for BNB crypto, the technological innovations of the Haber hard fork could stabilize and strengthen its market position.\n\nStandard Chartered enters crypto trading\n\nStandard Chartered, one of the world\u2019s largest banks, has announced the opening of a spot trading desk for Bitcoin and Ether, marking a significant step in integrating cryptos into the traditional banking sector. Based in London, this desk will allow institutional clients to trade cryptocurrencies directly, enriching their investment portfolios. The bank has worked closely with regulators to ensure compliance and security for this new service. This strategic initiative aligns with the growing trend of financial institutions adopting cryptos, with Standard Chartered aiming to position itself as a leader.\n\nRipple partners with ten governments to develop CBDCs\n\nRipple has recently announced partnerships with ten governments for the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This strategic initiative aims to use Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology to enhance the security and efficiency of global financial institutions. Among the partner countries are Bhutan, Palau, Montenegro, Georgia, and Colombia, each exploring specific aspects of blockchain technology to modernize their financial systems. For example, Bhutan focuses on cross-border payments, while Palau emphasizes an environmentally friendly digital currency. This collaboration has elicited varied reactions within the crypto community, with some fearing increased surveillance, while others see benefits in terms of transaction speed and security.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of this week\u2019s highlights.

        "content": "Blast, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution developed by Tieshun Roquerre, is making significant strides. The platform has garnered attention with its rapid ascent since its early access launch in November 2023. Moreover, it boasts a total value locked (TVL) exceeding $2 billion.\n\nBlast Gears Up For Launch\n\nFurthermore, Blast\u2019s popularity in Blast-based games is noteworthy. Recently, Blast has also ranked among the top 10 platforms by daily fee generation.

        "content": "Solana surpassed Ethereum in terms of DEX volumes.\n\nPrice of SOL declined materially over the last few days.\n\nSolana\u2019s [SOL] performance since the beginning of the year has been extremely positive. Due to this momentum, Solana managed to outperform Ethereum[ETH] in terms of DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes.\n\nSolana DEX volumes on the rise\n\nThis DEX volume refers to the total value of cryptocurrency actually transferred between wallets on the Solana network. These transfers happen through swaps on DEXs, which utilize liquidity pools on the network and are all verified by Solana\u2019s validators.\n\nThis DEX volume metric is considered a crucial indicator of a blockchain network\u2019s fundamental value. It reflects actual usage within the network\u2019s ecosystem, as opposed to just speculation on the price of the token.\n\nBy this measure, Solana\u2019s strong DEX volume suggests it is currently outperforming Ethereum in terms of real-world use. This could be a sign of growing adoption and potential for future growth for Solana.\n\nEven though DEX volumes for Solana were on the rise, the overall activity on the network had declined significantly by 10.7% over the past month.\n\nMoreover, the number of code commits on the network had also fallen by 20% signaling a decline in development activity.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, showed growth on both these fronts. Overall active users on the network grew by 2.2% over the past month and the number of code commits surged by 10% during the same period.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $126.47 and its price had declined by 5.21% in the last 24 hours, due to the recent market correction. Since the 21st of May, the price of SOL has declined materially.\n\nDuring this period, the price of SOL exhibited multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.\n\nThe RSI (Relative Strength Index) for SOL also fell materially over the last few days. It was below the 40 mark, indicating that SOL may be slightly oversold at the time of writing and could see a reversal soon.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) for SOL had declined indicating weakening buying pressure and potentially increasing selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the volume at which SOL was trading had surged by a significant 212% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "At a time when institutional investors are bearish on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and XRP are seen as better alternatives. CoinShares claims further outflows from digital assets funds globally indicate a \u201ctrue correction\u201d is underway. Digital asset investment products have recorded $1.2 billion in outflows in two weeks.\n\nHedge funds are expected to exit Bitcoin and remain short on crypto stocks such as MicroStrategy, which could risk further selloff in Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCrypto Assets Saw Second Consecutive Week Of Selloff\n\nThe $1.2 billion outflow from digital asset investment globally reflects pessimism amongst institutional investors for interest rate cuts by the US FED this year. Digital asset investment products recorded $584 million outflow in a week, according to a CoinShares report on June 24.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said \u201cBitcoin was the primary focus, seeing US$630m in outflows, but recent negative sentiment has not seen investors add to short positions. Multi-asset products saw US$98m inflows, suggest investors seen the weakness in the altcoin market as a buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe selloff mostly came from investors in the United States and Canada, accounting for $475 million and $109 million, respectively. They are followed by Germany, Hong Kong, and Sweden. Interestingly, Switzerland and Brazil defied the selloff and saw inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Crash \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, SHIB Are Falling Today\n\nSolana and XRP Recorded Buying\n\nAltcoins such as Solana, XRP, Litecoin and Polygon saw inflows as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano remained under selling pressure. Bitcoin price fell under $59k, a recording a dip of 5% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana recorded $2.7 million in buying by investors in a week. SOL price currently trades at $137.36, up 9% today after buying from the recent dip witnessed by altcoins. The 24-hour low and high are $125.90 and $136.73, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP saw $0.7 million in investments in a week. XRP price jumped 0.34% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.475. The 24-hour low and high are $0.469 and $0.482, respectively.

        "content": "In a statement on Tuesday, ahead of the token airdrop planned for this week, Blast, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, said that it was establishing a foundation to manage the protocol. As reported by the X account of Blast, the decision was made to shift towards a more decentralized model of governance.\n\nBlast\u2019s Governance Transition to Foundation\n\nBlast, created by the founder of the NFT marketplace Blur, announced that the governance of the protocol will be handed over to the newly created foundation soon.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis transfer will also entail control over the social network pages and the webpage of Blast, that was formerly maintained by Arcade Research \u2013 a Blast\u2019s development company.\n\nUntil now this account and website was managed by @ArcadeResearch, a Blast development company. As part of the transition towards a decentralized governance structure, this Twitter, the website, and governance of the Blast protocol are being transitioned to Foundation control. \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) June 24, 2024\n\nThe foundation is being created to help the community toward the attainment of the \u2018Blast Vision,\u2019 which will be outlined further on June 26. The foundation wants to increase decentralized decision making and community participation in the future of the protocol.\n\nUpcoming Token Airdrop\n\nBased on the preparation made and anticipation of the crypto community, the token airdrop is scheduled this week. Speaking of tokens, Blast reveals that they will be categorized although the details of the categorization are still unknown. An analysis of Blast tokens in the recent past revealed that there could be up to four to five categories, with theories suggesting that Blur farmers may be on the list of beneficiaries.\n\nThe firm has revealed that 50% of the airdrop will be given to developers via Blast Gold, while the other 50% will be given to early users with Blast Points.\n\nUsers will be able to receive points in their wallets depending on their balances, which will encourage users to engage more in the platform. To foster the growth of the ecosystem, Dapps are encouraged to reward their users with Blast Gold.\n\nBlast\u2019s Eligibility and Distribution Details\n\nTo be eligible for the airdrop, users must hold Points or Gold in Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and sign in to the Blast dashboard at least once using those accounts. Points and Gold held in smart contracts will not qualify for the airdrop. Additionally, embedded wallets such as Privy need to complete the linking process to ensure eligibility.\n\nThe firm has emphasized the importance of a secure ecosystem, noting that any suspicious or insider distributions by Dapps will be reviewed, and offenders will be blacklisted from future airdrops. This rigorous vetting process aims to maintain a fair and trustworthy distribution system.\n\nBlast has been adopted widely in the DeFi space. It has also ranked at the sixth position in the DeFi network rankings, with a TVL of $2.085 billion, according to DeFiLlama. This is a strong indicator of the network\u2019s potential to become one of the leading solutions in the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem.\n\nLast month, the firm underwent an upgrade that enabled support for Binary Large Objects (blobs), enhancing the platform\u2019s data storage and transaction processing capabilities. This upgrade is expected further to boost user appeal and adoption of the Blast network.\n\nRead Also: Blast Blockchain Secures Sixth Spot In DeFi Network Rankings\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.

        "content": "Negative sentiment in the market caused the increase in outflows from BTC and ETH.\n\nProjected distribution by a defunct exchanges puts the cryptos at risk of another decline\n\nCrypto investment products saw massive inflows for the second consecutive week, CoinShares\u2019 latest report revealed. According to the digital assets management, outflows last week were worth $584 million.\n\nThis brought the total outflows in two weeks to $1.2 billion. As expected, Bitcoin [BTC] had the highest outflows with$630 million. The report explained that the gloomy perception among investors and projected interest rate cut contributed to the capital flow.\n\nIt explained that,\n\n\u201cWe believe this is in reaction to the pessimism amongst investors for the prospect interest rate cuts by the FED this year.\u201d\n\nBTC, ETH play second fiddle to other altcoins\n\nApart from the outflows, trading volume of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) fell to $6.9 billion. This was the lowest volume Bitcoin has had since the 10th of January ETF approval.\n\nEthereum [ETH] was second on the list with an outflow of $58.30 million. This was surprising considering that the broader market expect the Ethereum spot ETFs to begin trading in July.\n\nTypically, this was supposed to bring about optimism. However, that did not happen as the report stated that,\n\n\u201cEthereum did not escape the negative sentiment, seeing US$58m in outflows. While a range of altcoins saw inflows after recent price weakness, most notable were Solana, Litecoin and Polygon at US$2.7m, US$1.3m and US$1m respectively.\u201d\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $60,028 after it briefly fell below $59,000. ETH, on the other hand, changed hands at $3,349.\n\nIt\u2019s the season to apply caution\n\nThe initial decline in prices could be linked to the disclosure that Mt.Gox. intended to pay back creditors $9 billion worth of BTC from July.\n\nMt.Gox is the defunct Bitcoin exchange that was hacked in 2011. It then went bankrupt in 2014, leading to a broader market collapse. If the distribution begins in July, there is a high chance that the recipients would sell off some of the coins.\n\nShould this be the case, BTC could plunge to $54,000 as predicted in some corners. For ETH, the anticipated live trading of the ETFs could save it from another round of correction.\n\nIf this happens, ETH\u2019s price might resist another downside, and this could be the ticket to the altcoin season that has failed to appear.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s volume neared its monthly high. At press time, the volume was $42.86 billion. Volume measures buying and selling, indicating interest in a cryptocurrency.\n\nBut considering BTC\u2019s decline, it means that there was more selling than buying. While ETH\u2019s volume also increased, it was not the same as Bitcoin.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s volume on-chain was $22.76 billion. As it stands, BTC seemed to be resisting a further decline. If bulls can defend the coin, the price might rebound to $63,000.\n\nIn ETH\u2019s case, the value could revisit $3,500. However, if selling pressure increases, the prices could hit new quarterly-lows."

Despite the declining gas prices, in terms of fees paid out to validators, Ethereum outperformed other networks such as Solana [SOL] and Tron [TRX] by a large margin.\n\nThe higher validator fees, despite a gas price drop, could indicate continued strong network usage on Ethereum.\n\nEven with lower per-transaction fees, a higher volume of transactions could generate more total fees for validators.\n\nWhile validator fees might be high now, they might not be enough to offset the overall price decline of Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had fallen by 4.14% in the last 24 hours. One of the reasons for the decline in ETH\u2019s price would be its correlation to BTC which also fell considerably over the last few days.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s correlation to BTC was at high 0.78.\n\nEven with a significant decline in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price, a large portion of holders seem to be in it for the long haul.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Price Fall Below $1000 - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "While Bitcoin ETFs attracted numerous new investors, making it easier for them to include BTC in their portfolios, the influence of ETH ETFs is much more uncertain, according to Kang.\n\nThis observation comes from crypto entrepreneur and investor Andrew Kang, who shared a detailed analysis of the effect of Ethereum ETFs on X on June 23.\n\nThe response and market sentiment toward Ethereum spot ETFs have been less enthusiastic compared to the excitement seen with the launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThere are 120.14 million ETH in circulation, with a yearly supply decrease of 0.24%, meaning 292,161 ETH were removed from the supply over the past year.\n\nEthereum hit its highest price of $4,867.17 on November 10, 2021, and its lowest price of $0.42 on October 21, 2015. The lowest price since its all-time high was $897.01, and the highest since then was $4,094.18. Currently, the market sentiment for Ethereum is bearish, and the Fear & Greed Index is at 51, indicating neutrality.\n\nToday, Ethereum is priced at $3,332.52 with a daily trading volume of $24.88 billion and a market cap of $400.36 billion, holding 17.73% of the market. Its price has dropped by 5.53% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin's price has dropped to $61,500, the lowest since early May, and is down over 10% from its recent peak. At the same time, other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , XRP , and Solana have seen even steeper declines, causing the total market value to shrink by $200 billion in the past week. The second major crypto ETH is also dropping. Will ETH price fall below $1000? Let's take a look at this Ethereum price prediction article in more detail.\n\nKang predicts that the flow of funds into Ethereum ETFs will be about 10% to 15% of what Bitcoin ETFs experienced, leading to an estimated $500 million to $1.5 billion in net buying within six months.\n\nLast week, it was reported that Fidelity would start its Ethereum ETF with $4.7 million, indicating that the buying has already started. In March, Standard Chartered forecasted that inflows could reach $45 billion in the first year of Ethereum ETF trading.\n\nHowever, Kang explained why the impact of an Ethereum ETF might be less significant than that of Bitcoin. He noted that Ethereum is considered more of a tech asset, unlike Bitcoin, which is viewed as a macro asset. Additionally, there is less institutional interest and buying pressure for Ethereum. Its current valuation metrics, such as the price-earnings ratio, make it a harder sell for traditional finance investors, he said.\n\nThe limited inflows and institutional interest could mean a smaller impact on Ethereum's price compared to Bitcoin, as the expected buying pressure from ETFs will be less intense.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Drop Below $1000?\n\nTo determine whether Ethereum's price will drop below $1000, we need to analyze several key factors influencing its market dynamics. Ethereum's price has increased by 75% in the last year, indicating a strong upward trend. It has outperformed 57% of the top 100 crypto assets over the same period, showcasing its competitive edge in the market. This historical growth reflects solid investor confidence and a robust market position.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading above the 200-day simple moving average, a bullish indicator that typically signals continued strength in price action. Despite recent fluctuations, maintaining this position above a crucial moving average suggests that the market sentiment remains relatively positive. This technical strength is a reassuring factor for investors concerned about potential price declines.\n\nEthereum's supply dynamics also play a crucial role in its price stability. The yearly inflation rate is negative at -0.24%, meaning the supply of ETH is decreasing slightly over time. This deflationary characteristic can support higher prices as supply diminishes, adding another layer of price support. With a high market cap and substantial liquidity, Ethereum is less prone to severe price swings compared to smaller, less liquid assets. This stability can act as a buffer against drastic price declines, further reducing the likelihood of the price falling below $1000.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been outperformed by Bitcoin recently, which may attract some investors away from ETH, this doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a price drop below $1000 but rather a potential shift in capital allocation within the crypto market. The fact that Ethereum had only 13 green days out of the last 30 (43%) suggests some short-term bearish sentiment. This could indicate potential short-term volatility, but not necessarily a significant long-term decline.\n\nDespite lower inflows expected from Ethereum ETFs compared to Bitcoin ETFs, the initiation of these financial products still reflects institutional interest. The additional buying pressure from these ETFs, even if modest, can help sustain or increase the current price levels. Analyst Andrew Kang\u2019s prediction of lower ETF inflows compared to Bitcoin and the challenges in Ethereum\u2019s valuation metrics could result in a less pronounced price increase. However, considering Ethereum\u2019s strong performance metrics, negative inflation rate, and high liquidity, a drop below $1000 seems unlikely under normal market conditions.\n\nSo, while short-term fluctuations and bearish sentiment can lead to temporary price drops, Ethereum's strong historical performance, technical indicators, negative inflation rate, and high liquidity provide a solid foundation against a decline below $1000. Therefore, based on the current data and market conditions, it is improbable that Ethereum will drop below $1000 in the near future."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: When Will They Launch & What Will The Price Impact Be? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "TLDR\n\nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas reaffirms his prediction of a July 2 launch date for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, following a surge in amended S-1 filings.\n\nSeveral major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity, have submitted amended S-1 filings, with some revealing competitive fee structures.\n\nAnalysts have mixed views on the potential demand for Ethereum ETFs, with projections ranging from $1-3 billion to $4 billion in net inflows.\n\nSome experts, like Nate Geraci of ETF Store, suggest that Ethereum ETF approval could come as early as next week.\n\nThe SEC has already approved 19b-4 filings for eight spot Ethereum ETFs, but still needs to greenlight their S-1 filings before trading can begin.\n\nAs the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States draws near. Industry experts and analysts are closely watching developments, with some predicting an imminent launch while others remain cautious about market demand.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, has doubled down on his prediction of a July 2 launch date for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs. This forecast comes in the wake of a surge in amended S-1 (registration statement) filings observed on Friday. Balchunas noted,\n\n\u201cWe will see a bunch of amended S-1s filed today, probably later this afternoon. Then the ball\u2019s in SEC\u2019s court to let issuers know about any final changes and effectiveness (aka final approval).\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already approved 19b-4 filings for eight spot Ethereum ETFs last month.\n\nHowever, the regulatory body still needs to greenlight their S-1 filings before these ETFs can begin trading. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has indicated that spot Ethereum ETFs will launch this summer, pending the approval of their S-1 filings.\n\nMajor asset managers have been quick to respond to this opportunity. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has entered the market with a $10 million seed investment.\n\nVanEck has filed with a competitive fee of 0.20%, closely matching Franklin\u2019s 0.19%. Other significant players like Fidelity, Bitwise, 21shares, and Grayscale have also filed, although they have not yet disclosed their fees. The competitive fee structures suggest that issuers are positioning themselves aggressively in anticipation of strong market interest.\n\nMarket observers are divided on the potential demand for Ethereum ETFs. JPMorgan analysts project that these ETFs could attract about $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows in the second half of 2024.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Balchunas estimates that Ethereum ETF products could capture only 20% of the Bitcoin ETF market share, basing his projection on the current demand for ETH vs BTC in the futures market.\n\nOn the more optimistic side, K33 Research\u2019s Vetle Lunde estimates that demand for ETH ETF products could reach $4 billion in net inflows in the first five months alone. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan views the second half of 2024 as full of \u2018tailwinds\u2019 for ETH demand.\n\nA recent Deribit Insights report also painted a bullish future based on recent options data, noting significant purchases of ETH September $4,000 call options.\n\n1) Decent clip of ETH Sep 4k Calls bought ($12m premium), and BTC Jun 65k+July75k Calls rolled to increased exposure in Dec 75+90k Calls, showing increased mid-term optimism.\n\nEarly trades in the last few hours supporting range lows with Sep 60k Puts sold, and Jun RR Calls bought. pic.twitter.com/HEgCEXhzjh \u2014 Deribit Insights (@DeribitInsights) June 20, 2024\n\nThe potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s price is also a topic of speculation. QCP Capital analysts suggest that ETH could surge above $4,000 and potentially retest its record high of $4,800 if the ETFs capture 10-20% of Bitcoin ETF flows.\n\nHowever, some market participants, like Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, believe the market might be underestimating the positive impact of the upcoming ETH ETF.\n\nNate Geraci, president of ETF Store, has suggested that approval could come as early as next week. This aligns with Balchunas\u2019 July 2 prediction, which is strategically timed to coincide with the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Former SEC official Jay Clayton has also reinforced expectations for imminent approvals.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while most major players are pushing forward with their ETF plans, Hashdex, a notable player in the ETF arena, has withdrawn its application for a spot Ethereum ETF without disclosing reasons or future plans.\n\nInstead, they have presented a mixed Ethereum and Bitcoin solution.\n\nThe coming weeks promise to be crucial for the Ethereum market and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nWhether the ETFs launch on July 2 or later in the summer, their impact on market dynamics, institutional involvement, and Ethereum\u2019s price will be closely watched by investors."
