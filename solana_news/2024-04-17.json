        "content": "Facilitates the fulfilment of complex, multi-party business agreements, supporting confidentiality and helping improve time efficiency and cost reduction\n\nUtilizes public blockchain's security and accessibility with data privacy through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), enhancing contract integrity and mitigating value leakage\n\nAddresses the enterprise challenge of managing multi-party contracts across siloed systems, internally and with business partners\n\nThe EY organization today announces the launch of EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), a transformative blockchain-enabled solution for contract management. EY OCM helps enterprises to execute complex business agreements, supporting confidentiality, helping improve time efficiency, and achieving cost reduction, with automatic adherence to the agreed terms.\n\nLaunched at the annual EY Global Blockchain Summit, EY OCM helps address the enterprise challenge of managing business agreements that run across internal and external operational and technology siloes. EY OCM synchronizes data across business partners and uniformly enforces key business terms such as standardized pricing, volume discounts, rebates and strike prices.\n\nEnterprises often struggle to fully implement and capture value from their business agreements. Spend gets fragmented across internal enterprise barriers, making it hard to track and qualify for agreed-upon discounts and rebates. Smart contracts enable aggregation of spend across systems and even external business partners and then consistently applies contract terms.\n\nDriven by this value proposition, Zion Market Research predicts that the global smart contracts market will grow to an estimated US $1 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 24% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nThe solution runs on the Ethereum public blockchain, enabling truly decentralized operation in a trust-worthy environment. This helps avoid giving a strategic advantage to either a buyer or a seller and assists in eliminating the high costs of setting up and running a private network, as well as the risks that come from sharing sensitive business information with a centralized industry portal. The system maintains enterprise privacy using Zero Knowledge Circuits.\n\nThe EY OCM solution can be easily used in existing enterprise systems through a standardized API. Most business contract types can be supported including volume purchase agreements, standardized rate cards, volume discounts, rebates, and price models that depend on market data feeds. The first test users of the solution are implementing complex Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) that include market prices, strike prices with minimum and maximum purchase criteria.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified from past client work that contract automation can improve accuracy while cutting cycle times by more than 90%, and overall contract administration costs by nearly 40%. With our zero-knowledge privacy technology, we have industrialized this capability, and we can now get these benefits at a fraction of the up-front cost. Deploying on a public blockchain is not only cheaper, but also much more scalable, helping enable many-to-many integrations on an open platform with no one company having an unfair advantage by controlling the network.\u201d\n\nFor more information about EY Blockchain, visit: https://www.ey.com/en_gl/services/blockchain.\n\n-ends-\n\nAbout EY\n\nEY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people and society and build trust in the capital markets.\n\nEnabled by data and technology, diverse EY teams in over 150 countries provide trust through assurance and help clients grow, transform and operate.\n\n\n\nWorking across assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax and transactions, EY teams ask better questions to find new answers for the complex issues facing our world today.\n\nEY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity.

        "title": "BlobScriptions: A New Type of Inscription on Ethereum - Unchained",
        "content": "BlobScriptions made waves in the Ethereum community as a new type of inscription, similar to Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum blockchain underwent the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, introducing a concept called Blobs. Blobs are a novel data storage concept intended to lower transaction costs on layer 2 scaling solutions. While the concept was intended primarily to lower costs, some creators used blobs to develop \u201cBlobScriptions.\u201d\n\nRead on to learn what BlobScriptions are, how they work, and their similarities to Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\nWhat Are BlobScriptions?\n\nBlobScriptions are Ethscriptions that use EIP-4844 blobs to store additional data. Blobs, or binary large objects, were introduced to the network in the latest Ethereum network upgrade in March as a cost-effective solution for storing data on-chain. However, their \u2018misuse\u2019 is now dubbed BlobScriptions.\n\nTom Lehman and Michael Hirsch developed the concept by launching BlobScriptions.io, a platform enabling anyone to inscribe data onto a blob.\n\nTheir proposal, ESIP-8, was to use blobs to store data within the Etherscriptions Protocol, enabling data storage and allowing users to access blob data alongside other blockchain data currently utilized by the protocol.\n\nLehman said the idea was a means of democratizing blobs, making them available for everyone. For a fee of about $20, anyone, potentially including bots, can submit a BlobScription since blobs have made data storage on Ethereum 10x to 100x cheaper.\n\nHow Do BlobScriptions Work?\n\nBlobScriptions function similarly to Bitcoin inscriptions, allowing users to store various data types on Ethereum\u2019s blobs, including images, text, and even tokens. Blobs are unique because they don\u2019t interact with smart contracts, and nodes only need to store them for up to 18 days, making them cost-effective.\n\nWhen sharing data using blobs, one requires the content itself and the content type. Initially, data URIs were used to achieve this, but to make BlobScriptions cheaper; its creators implemented CBOR, which natively supports binary data.\n\nOnce the BlobScription payload is prepared, it needs to be split into one or more blobs, each consisting of 32-byte segments. These blobs are then sent as transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethscriptions indexer, Ethereum RPC, and the Beacon API are then used to retrieve blobs. Using their versioned hashes, the blobs can be associated with individual transactions.\n\nAfter retrieving a transaction\u2019s blobs, they can be decoded and concatenated into a single binary value using Viem\u2019s \u201cfromBlobs\u201d method. This decoded data includes the content and content type, forming an \u201cEthscription Attachment,\u201d also called a BlobScription. The indexer can then serve the attachment content via its API.\n\nRegarding the concern about blobs being removed from storage after 18 days, Ethscriptions indexers and other decentralized data stores retain the data, ensuring that as long as someone has it, the BlobScriptions can still be used.\n\nHow to Create a BlobScription on Ethereum\n\nTo create a BlobScription on Ethereum, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Visit the BlobScription Website\n\nYou need to first visit the BlobScription website to begin the process. Click on \u201cCreate a burner for me.\u201d This creates a new wallet and imports the private key to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.\n\nAfter importing, double-check if the displayed address matches your own.\n\nStep 2: Enter the Initial Owner\n\nThe next step requires you to specify the individual or entity credited with creating the BlobScription on the blockchain.\n\nStep 3: Choose a File\n\nYou will then select the data you want to store on the Ethereum blockchain via the BlobScription.\n\nStep 4: Create BlobScription\n\nClick the \u201cCreate BlobScription\u201d button to finalize the process, and you have successfully created your first BlobScription!\n\nBlobScriptions vs. Bitcoin Inscriptions: Similarities & Differences\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the similarities and differences between BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions.\n\nHere are some of the aspects in which they are similar:\n\nData storage purpose: BlobScriptions and Ordinal inscriptions allow users to embed data directly onto the blockchain. This data could include text, images, or any other digital content.\n\nImmutable storage: Once data on BlobSriptions and Ordinal inscriptions is embedded, it becomes part of the blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger. Hence, the data cannot be altered or deleted.\n\nStill, BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions have several differences, as outlined in the tale below.\n\nFeature BlobScriptions Bitcoin Inscriptions Blockchain Ethereum Bitcoin Data storage On Ethereum\u2019s blobs On the Bitcoin blockchain Introduced After Dencun upgrade in March 2024 After Taproot upgrade Transaction type Data is inscribed onto blobs Data is attached to individual satoshis (sats) Cost Cost-effective as blob transactions have lower fees compared to calldata transactions Bitcoin Inscription fees depend on the size of the data being inscribed Permanence Data is temporary on Ethereum\u2019s main network and may be preserved by external indexers Data remains on the Bitcoin blockchain indefinitely\n\nFinal Word\n\nMany Ethereum enthusiasts anticipate that the hype and use of BlobScriptions will be short-lived.\n\nAccording to Jim McDonald, co-founder of Ethereum staking provider Attestant, there\u2019s an expectation that the pricing of blobs for layer 2 solutions will become more reasonable for their intended purpose over time. This could render Ethereum too costly for those seeking to utilize it merely as a \u201cgraffiti wall.\u201d\n\nHowever, if BlobScriptions continue to gain traction or remain stable, the price of layer 2 solutions, significantly reduced by the March software upgrade, might increase more rapidly than anticipated. This could necessitate the development of new tools, and additional upgrades could be needed to lower the prices."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong Could Lead to 'More Progressive' Policies in China: OSL - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAt the start of the week, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were conditionally approved in Hong Kong. Alongside this news, digital assets platform OSL announced it will be a \u201csub-custodian partner\u201d for both the China Asset Management, also known as ChinaAMC (HK), and Harvest Global Investment ETFs.\n\nLooking forward, OSL's CEO believes that these ETFs could lead to a wave of \u201cmore progressive\u201d regulation in China and potentially cause a ripple effect across the region.\n\n\u201c[It] is likely to set a precedent for other financial markets in Asia,\u201d Patrick Pan, Chairman of the Board and CEO of OSL, told Decrypt. \u201cFor China, this development in Hong Kong solidifies Hong Kong\u2019s place as a unique financial center for innovations and may influence future regulatory considerations and market openness towards crypto, potentially leading to more progressive policies aligned with global standards.\u201d\n\nChina has a long and rocky history with cryptocurrencies\u2014effectively banning crypto multiple times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresently, there are rigorous regulatory controls over cryptocurrency transactions, expressly prohibiting the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges within its territory,\u201d Thomas Zhu, the ChinaAMC (HK) head of digital assets and head of family office business, told Decrypt.\n\nBut with Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region controlled by China\u2014which has been called a \u2018testing ground\u2019 for China\u2014its financial decisions may set the table for future movements on mainland China.\n\nLooking at the wider continent, both firms see the approval of spot ETFs as a catalyst for regulatory evolution.\n\n\u201cIt may prompt regulators to accelerate their own frameworks to accommodate such products, which may lead to a broader acceptance and deeper integration of cryptocurrency into the Asian financial landscape,\u201d Zhu said, \u201cpotentially setting the stage for a new era of digital asset trading and investment in the region.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, crypto-friendly countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore could be the first to be influenced, Zhu suggested.\n\nThe United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January\u201411 years after the first application for a U.S. Bitcoin ETF was filed. This is a stark contrast to Hong Kong\u2019s process, which OSL said has only taken four months.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., where the legal framework and regulatory landscape have been highly fragmented\u2014and at times, vulnerable to highly polarized political cycles\u2014the journey for spot crypto ETF products has been far more arduous.\u201d Pan told Decrypt. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s framework has managed to prove once again that it can be mobilized quickly to innovate, while ensuring robust investor protection, setting a benchmark for crypto-related financial products in Asia.\u201d\n\nDespite this, the U.S. still beat Hong Kong to the punch. That means Hong Kong regulators and potential ETF issuers have been able to study the impact that spot crypto funds might have on the market. One primary lesson: ETFs significantly drive demand. The firms that spoke to Decrypt think it will be no different this time around.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a similar uplift in Hong Kong,\u201d Pan said. \u201cGiven the structured and familiar investment mechanism of these ETFs, akin to those in traditional finance, they are likely to facilitate education and adoption among local investors. This positions the Hong Kong market to potentially experience substantial growth, tapping into a deep well of enthusiasm and capital.\u201d\n\nWith Hong Kong\u2019s population a fraction of the size of the U.S., its impact on the wider crypto ecosystem is likely to be less pronounced than January\u2019s spot ETF approvals. But the ripple effect it could have on China and the rest of Asia may dwarf anything the U.S. could muster.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott and Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a turbulent weekend for the financial markets, cryptocurrencies felt the strain of geopolitical tensions, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token ( FURR ) each navigating the upheaval in distinctive ways. Bitcoin showed resilience despite significant losses, Ethereum struggled to maintain key support levels amidst declining prices, and Furrever Token capitalized on the volatile market environment, boosting its presale figures significantly as investors looked for promising opportunities in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving.\n\nDespite a Dip Over the Weekend, Bitcoin's (BTC) Market Dominance Reaches a New High Since April 2021\n\nThis past weekend saw a downturn in asset values as traders adjusted their portfolios in response to conflicts in the Middle East. By late Saturday, it appeared that most assets had reached their lowest points.\n\nOver the weekend, while the stock market was closed and unable to react to the escalation involving an Iranian drone targeting Israel, the cryptocurrency market was active and responsive.\n\nThe general trend saw a decrease in asset prices as traders reevaluated their positions and reduced exposure to higher-risk investments. Bitcoin, despite being the least affected among major cryptocurrencies, dropped from a high of over $70,000 on Friday to just above $63,000 by the end of Saturday, marking an 11.6% decrease.\n\nBitcoin's resilience was notable compared to other cryptocurrencies. Coinglass reported that long liquidations on centralized exchanges totaled over $757 million on Saturday, with Bitcoin accounting for $261 million of those liquidations.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are considered less risky compared to more speculative ones such as Dogecoin, which experienced nearly a 30% drop from its peak on Friday to its trough on Saturday.\n\nThere was a modest recovery across most assets after hitting what seemed to be a floor late on Saturday. Theoretically, Bitcoin could have seen a surge during this turmoil, as it is often considered a \"safe haven,\" akin to gold. Recently, gold has seen significant gains due to the Middle East conflict, potentially benefiting Bitcoin, frequently dubbed \"digital gold.\"\n\nHowever, with the stock market closed, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin had to absorb the full impact of the market's reaction. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin still emerged as a top performer.\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin's market dominance\u2014its market cap's proportion relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap\u2014rose to 52.86% on Sunday, marking the highest point since April 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis increase in dominance comes after a low in February when Bitcoin's dominance fell to 43% due to a surge in altcoins, representing the smallest share since March 2023. This reversal underscores Bitcoin's renewed strength in the market, achieving its most substantial market share in three years.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Remains Above the $3,000 Support Level\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently faced challenges as its price has seen a decline of 21% between April 9 and April 14, reaching a 50-day low. Despite recovering some losses, Ether continues to struggle, especially after failing to break through the $3,200 resistance on April 14. Currently trading at $3,066, Ether has experienced a daily decrease of 1.46%. This ongoing instability raises concerns about the sustainability of its $3,000 support level.\n\nIn the derivatives market, there is a notable shift in sentiment among professional traders, indicating a decrease in risk appetite. This sentiment is reflected in the ETH options market, where the delta skew metric has reached its highest bearish level in over two months, suggesting a growing demand for downside protection.\n\nAmidst this market uncertainty, there is cautious optimism regarding the approval of a spot Ether ETF in May, although analysts remain mixed due to the conflicting signals from on-chain and derivatives data. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out the low likelihood of ETF approval given the lack of critical feedback from the SEC during recent meetings.\n\nComparatively, Ether's downturn has been more pronounced than other major cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX), but less so than that of Solana (SOL). It should be noted that Ethereum's network total value locked (TVL) has surged to its highest in 13 months on April 15, reaching 16.4 million ETH, which is a 14.8% increase month-over-month.\n\nDespite these challenges, the anticipation of a decision on the spot Ether ETF in May could still provide a positive impact on Ether's price and on-chain activity. However, the increasing risk aversion among professional traders, as evidenced on April 16, suggests that the potential for further price corrections below $2,900 should not be overlooked.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR)\u2019s Presale Raises Over $800,000 as Bitcoin Halving Approaches\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is distinguishing itself as a strong contender, demonstrated by an impressive presale that has already exceeded $800,000. As the crypto community braces for the Bitcoin halving, FURR is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increased interest and investment that typically accompany this event.\n\nOffering a compelling entry at just $0.000564 per token, Furrever Token has attracted a wide array of investors, drawn by the potential for significant returns. This vibrant investment interest is bolstered by FURR's dynamic community, which includes over 4,100 active members on its Telegram channel, providing robust support and fostering lively discussions that enhance the token\u2019s market presence.\n\nAs the market anticipates the Bitcoin halving, Furrever Token is not just riding the wave but actively preparing to leverage this period of heightened activity. The team behind FURR is pushing forward with strategic partnerships and innovative features aimed at boosting the token's adoption and enhancing its value. These efforts are designed to align FURR\u2019s trajectory with the broader market dynamics expected post-halving, ensuring that the token remains appealing to both new and existing investors.\n\nWith its strong presale performance, active community engagement, and strategic market initiatives, Furrever Token is poised for significant growth.

Here are ETH's key market movers:\n\nDespite the recent launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the US, Ethereum's correlation to the traditional market has soared above that of BTC, according to data from The Block. Compared to BTC, Ethereum showed a high correlation to indices like the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. This can be seen in Ethereum's recent price action, which has traded horizontally in tandem with these indices.\n\n\n\nWhile ETH's price stagnates, whales are making moves behind the scenes. A participant in its initial coin offering (ICO) came online to sell 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at $2,997, according to Spot On Chain. The whale bought 33,213 ETH at $0.31 during the Ethereum Genesis ICO. Since then, the whale has sold 5,110 ETH and still holds about 29,700 ETH across three wallets.\n\n\n\nAnother whale, who spent 10 million USDT to buy 3,279 ETH at $3,050 on Wednesday, withdrew 21,474 ETH \u2014 worth $64.7 million \u2014 from Binance on Thursday, according to Lookonchain.

Despite bulls showing weak hands, bears haven't been able to break below the range.\n\nThe scarcity of ETH driven by the increased attractiveness of Ethereum restaking and anticipation of the Bitcoin halving may be what's sustaining its price to stay within the range.\n\nRead more: Ethereum recovers from dip as Hong Kong ETH ETF approval sparks whale buying spree\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAs stated in a previous analysis, ETH may continue the sideways movement. Minor market triggers may see it posting tiny gains but not above or below the $3,300 and $2,852 range identified previously.\n\nThe sideways movement may prevail for weeks until days leading to the Securities & Exchange Commission's decision on a spot Ethereum ETF. This thesis would be invalidated if the Bitcoin halving triggers an unlikely rally.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,062, up 1.7% on the day."

        "title": "Furrever Token Foreseen to Deliver ROI Comparable to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)'s Success in 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The markets have been bleeding out over the past couple of days, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a 2% dip in their prices. However, amidst this downturn, Furrever Token (FURR) has emerged as a bright spot, surpassing the significant milestone of $800,000 during its sixth presale stage. This contrast highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where while some major players face temporary setbacks, newer projects like FURR demonstrate resilience and potential for growth.\n\nBitcoin Faces Geopolitical Headwinds Amidst Price Volatility: Dipped 3.4% Since Yesterday\n\nBitcoin's recent attempt at recovery was abruptly halted yesterday afternoon following renewed geopolitical risks, causing the digital asset to turn downwards once again. The largest cryptocurrency witnessed a 3.4% decline, retracing its gains from the previous day and closing around the $63,400 mark. Today, Bitcoin briefly dipped to the $61,000 range before bouncing back to the $63,000 zone with the opening of the European session. Amidst continued volatile movements in the Bitcoin market, significant liquidations persist in futures crypto trading, with $274 million worth of positions closed in the past 24 hours, 200 million of which were long positions, indicating investors' maintained optimism despite the downward trend.\n\nExternally-driven news dominates the Bitcoin market, with a brief upward movement towards $66,000 seen after the Hong Kong news yesterday, but this positive development was short-lived. However, investors are keeping a close eye on the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 20th, anticipating its potential impact on Bitcoin's supply dynamics and market sentiment.\n\nEthereum Faces Crucial Support Levels Amid Market Turmoil\n\nAmidst a widespread selloff in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) faces scrutiny as its price dips by 2% to approximately $3,059, according to coinmarketcap.com. With attention turning to critical support levels, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a pivotal zone between $2,000 and $2,430, where 9.37 million addresses collectively hold nearly 53 million ETH. Martinez's analysis underscores the significance of this range in determining Ethereum's price direction amidst market volatility.\n\nDespite the downturn, optimism persists within the crypto community, buoyed by recent regulatory approvals such as Hong Kong's green light for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Moreover, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event adds intrigue, although concerns over short-term volatility linger. As investors navigate uncertain terrain, Martinez's insights offer valuable guidance, emphasizing the importance of monitoring market dynamics and expert analyses.\n\nAmidst the price dip, Ethereum's one-day trading volume remains near the flatline at $22.42 billion, with the ETH price down 7.48% over the last 24 hours and nearly 16% over the last seven days. The Ethereum Futures Open Interest has also declined by 6.01% to $10.91 billion, indicating ongoing market turbulence.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): Riding the Wave of Market Downturn with Resilience\n\nDespite the broader market downturn, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out as a beacon of resilience, navigating the choppy waters of the crypto landscape with unwavering momentum.

        "content": "Despite Hong Kong\u2019s ETF approval, Ethereum sees increased liquidations and bearish sentiment, with shorts rising by 54%.\n\nEthereum faces price volatility due to geopolitical tensions and regulatory concerns, dipping below $3,000 briefly this week.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced significant price volatility this week, briefly dipping below the $3,000 mark. This downturn followed a combination of geopolitical tensions and market sentiments surrounding regulatory developments.\n\nTensions between Iran and Israel contributed to market jitters, suppressing the positive impact of Hong Kong\u2019s approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as previously reported by Crypto News Flash. Investors exercised caution across the cryptocurrency landscape, with Bitcoin and other altcoins also experiencing losses. Notably, Ethereum saw a 20% decrease in risk reversals on Tuesday, indicating heightened nervousness among investors.\n\nData from Santiment revealed a surge in Ethereum liquidations, totaling over $81.9 million within 24 hours. Long positions accounted for the majority of liquidations, totaling $67.4 million. The largest liquidation, valued at $6 million, stemmed from an ETH-USD swap. Moreover, discussions surrounding Ethereum intensified after the Hong Kong ETF was approved, making it the most trending token among traders. However, bearish sentiment persisted, as evidenced by a 54% rise in ETH shorts.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Issuance Reduction Proposal\n\nDespite recent developments, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s proposal to reduce ETH issuance garnered attention. Glassnode\u2019s report highlighted ongoing criticism of the proposal despite clarifications emphasizing its aim to maintain Ethereum\u2019s status as a form of currency and balance governance power within the network.\n\nGlassnode also addressed the rise of restaking and liquid restaking tokens, impacting Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate and holders. These tokens, offering significantly high yields, facilitate a wealth transfer from non-staked ETH holders to staked counterparts. Consequently, there is a potential shift in the \u201creal yield\u201d and the role of money within the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially favoring projects issuing derivative tokens.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis conducted by Changelly, a prominent cryptocurrency data provider, Ethereum could experience a notable surge in price following the Bitcoin halving. Changelly predicts that on April 21, 2024, just one day after the halving event, Ethereum could reach a price of $3,171.61. This forecast has sparked optimism among Ethereum investors, who eagerly anticipate the potential for significant gains.\n\nChangelly\u2019s analysis extends beyond the immediate aftermath of the Bitcoin halving, offering a bullish long-term outlook for Ethereum. By June 2025, Changelly suggests that Ethereum could surpass its previous all-time high and reach an impressive price of $4,964.07. Such a milestone would mark a new record for the cryptocurrency, signaling continued growth and potential for further appreciation.\n\nEthereum Struggles to Break Key Resistance\n\nETH\u2019s price trajectory has been marked by challenges in surmounting key resistance levels, particularly the $3,200 mark. The cryptocurrency remains below this critical threshold, along with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, signaling persistent bearish pressure. Additionally, a notable bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD, sourced via Kraken.\n\n\n\nFollowing a brief period of consolidation, Ethereum experienced a minor recovery attempt, briefly surpassing the $3,000 resistance zone. However, this upward momentum was stifled as bears asserted control near the $3,280 resistance zone, resulting in a subsequent downturn. The price retraced below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move from the $2,536 swing low to the $3,278 high, underscoring the prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale who accumulated a substantial amount of ETH at the market bottom in September 2022 has made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH to popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in September 2022, when the Ethereum network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus, the whale took advantage of the opportunity to buy ETH at what was considered the market bottom. The timing seemed right as the price of Ethereum was nearly $1,567 per ETH, totaling a value of $151.42 million for the bulk purchase.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the ETH whale withdrew 96,638 ETH worth $151.42 million at the time from Coinbase at $1,567 from Sept. 3 to Sept. 7, 2022.\n\nThe whale that bought $ETH at the bottom in Sept 2022 appears to be selling $ETH at a profit again.\n\n\n\nHe deposited 5K $ETH to #Kraken 56 minutes ago.\n\n\n\nHe withdrew 96,638 $ETH($151.42M at the time) from #Coinbase at $1,567 from Sept 3 to Sept 7, 2022.\n\n\n\nAnd he currently has 76,638\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5FR0TXRGF5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 16, 2024\n\nFast forward to now, and the same whale has transferred 5,000 ETH to Kraken, presumably to sell it at a profit. When whales deposit their tokens into exchanges, it typically suggests a potential sale, while withdrawals signal an intent to buy.\n\nAt the time of the deposit, the price of Ethereum had risen, indicating a significant profit margin for the investor. The whale still has 76,638 ETH worth $233.56 million remaining, for a total profit of more than $153.7 million.\n\nThe whale's action indicates that the perfect combination of timing and market sentiment can lead to significant returns. The wrong timing might lead to ultimate losses, which was the scenario of another ETH whale who saw significant losses as the ETH price dipped.\n\nEthereum saw selling pressure at the start of the week after reaching highs of $3,281 on April 15. The drop persisted, with Ethereum falling for two consecutive days before slightly rebounding. At the time of writing, ETH was up 0.43% in the last 24 hours to $3,058.\n\nAs reported, an ETH whale sold their 10,701 ETH stash worth $33 million, losing more than $4 million for the second time after going long on ETH. The first time, they lost almost $500,000."

With this new blockchain, Worldcoin\u2019s vision is to build an open and collaborative network \u201cby humanity\u201d and \u201cfor humanity.\u201d\n\nIntroducing World Chain, a new blockchain designed for humans \u26aa\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/qNb7S3vqut \u2014 Worldcoin (@worldcoin) April 17, 2024\n\nAccording to Worldcoin\u2019s blog announcement, the new blockchain is designed to prioritize humans over bots, offering verified individuals priority blockspace and a gas allowance for everyday transactions.\n\nWorld Chain aims to provide developers with access to millions of real users globally, focusing on practical applications in daily life, the team noted. The integration with the Worldcoin protocol is set to spur growth and utilize World ID\u2019s Proof of Personhood to ensure security and scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe network will be permissionless, and open-source, and is planned to be governed independently by the community. World Chain\u2019s anticipated launch is later this summer.\n\nIn just nine months, Worldcoin has achieved impressive adoption with over 10 million users across 160 countries creating World IDs and wallets, facilitating a staggering 75 million transactions, the team shared. This rapid expansion is driving the Worldcoin team to push the boundaries of blockchain technology, focusing on efficiency, user experience, and utility enhancements.\n\nAccording to the team, World Chain is being built to enhance capacity, allowing for the continued growth of its user base and providing a more efficient transaction experience.\n\nBy reducing congestion, World Chain aims to make transactions faster and less expensive.

        "content": "In a surprising shift within the cryptocurrency investment landscape, former Goldman Sachs executive and macro guru Raoul Pal has revealed a substantial reallocation of his digital asset portfolio, favoring Solana SOL/USD over other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Pal, during a conversation on the Bankless YouTube channel, disclosed that roughly 80% of his crypto investments are now in Solana, The Daily Hodl reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe macroeconomic expert has replaced his Ethereum holdings with high-end art NFTs and has also invested in Exponential Age Asset Management, a digital assets-focused fund. \"I am 80% SOL. All of my ETH is now NFTs (non-fungible tokens), I have been buying high-end art NFTs.\n\n\u201cAnd I have 1% in stupid s**t like dogwifhat, Dogecoin and Bonk. Got all of those. But that's 1%\u2026 just to be clear I've got like in all of memecoins and everything else, 1% of my portfolio. I am 80% Solana.\"\n\nHe justified his heavy investment in Solana by referring to the Solana/Ethereum chart\u2019s performance in 2022, which led him to go \u201call in\u201d on Solana, paralleling his earlier decision to invest heavily in Ethereum in September 2020.\n\nSee Also: Will Bitcoin Slump To $20K Amid Increasing Middle East Tensions? Peter Schiff Doesn\u2019t Rule Out Possibilit\n\nWhy It Matters: Pal\u2019s strategic shift to Solana comes at a time when the cryptocurrency is making significant updates to address network issues. on Monday, Solana launched a mainnet beta update to manage network congestion, which was partly due to the high demand for Solana block space from soaring meme coin transactions.\n\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency market has seen a growing interest in meme coins, as highlighted by researcher TradeTheFlow. His thesis suggests that meme coins reflect a societal shift towards high-risk, high-reward investment strategies and are not just a passing trend.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum ecosystem has faced skepticism from some market participants. A Bitcoin trader and advocate, Fred Krueger, expressed a pessimistic outlook for Ethereum, indicating that it might be losing its market position.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Markets Tumble Following Iran\u2019s Drone Attack Against Israel, Investor Warns Of Continued Selloff\n\nImage via Shutterstock"

        "content": "In a recent episode of \u201cMad Money,\u201d host Jim Cramer advised against investing in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. MARA and instead recommended Bitcoin BTC/USD or Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Cramer, in his \u201cLightning Round\u201d segment, discouraged viewers from purchasing Marathon Digital, a company involved in Bitcoin mining, reported CNBC. He suggested that investors consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as alternatives.\n\n\"If you want to own Marathon Digital, just go buy either Ethereum or buy Bitcoin, ok. Let's not fool around,\" Cramer said.\n\nMarathon Digital\u2019s stock has experienced a tumultuous period, with its value dropping by over 20% in the past month. This decline is attributed to the overall volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSee Also: NFLX, AMC,UAL, WISA, TSLA: Top Trending Stocks Today\n\nWhy It Matters: Cramer\u2019s advice aligns with the current state of the crypto market. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s $62,000 support level. Failure to maintain this level could shift focus to the next significant demand area, approximately $51,500. Conversely, a climb back above $66,250 could significantly boost the chances of a resurgence in the market.\n\nDespite concerns about the crypto market, Wall Street experts remain confident in the bull market\u2018s continuation. They cite a robust U.S. economy and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) as key drivers.\n\nOn the broader market front, Cramer has also outlined potential factors that could lead to further market decline, advising investors to be cautious about their buying and selling decisions. His recent advice regarding Marathon Digital is in line with his cautious approach to the current market conditions.\n\nPrice Action: While Marathon Digital Holdings closed at $14.63 on Wednesday, marking a modest 0.21% increase, the stock has experienced a significant decline of 36.20% year to date. In contrast, Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,562, showing a 0.48% increase in the last 24 hours and a notable 39.37% gain year to date. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading at $3,000, with a 0.61% increase in the past 24 hours and a solid 27.54% gain year to date, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Macro Guru Raoul Pal Says 80% Of His Crypto Investment Is In This Ethereum Rival: \u2018And I Have 1% In Stupid S**t Like Dogwifhat, Dogecoin And Bonk\u2019\n\nImage Via Shutterstock"

        "title": "What is Ethereum's Pectra upgrade? Bringing smart contract functionality to wallets - OKX",
        "content": "What if managing your Ethereum wallet could be as easy and secure as sending an email? The Ethereum network has introduced a big change that aims to deliver this kind of simplicity to users, called the Pectra hard fork. The update is expected to make transactions safer, bring added stability to the network, and introduce a host of new features.\n\nEIP-3074 is a key part of the Pectra upgrade. It'll change how transactions are handled, making the network more accessible and bring smart contract functionality to wallets. How will these modifications affect the blockchain community? Read on as we explore the Pectra hard fork and what it means for users of the Ethereum network.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPioneering change: The Ethereum Pectra hard fork aims to change how people use their wallets and make the network more efficient.\n\nEIP-3074 introduction: The proposal allows regular digital wallets to use smart contracts, enabling you to make more complicated transactions that are also safer.\n\nStreamlined transactions: Grouped transactions and paying fees to third parties aim to make usability easier.\n\nSocial recovery feature: The update introduces a new way to regain lost funds, using trusted contacts instead of traditional seed phrases.\n\nCommunity impact: Greater simplicity and safety from Ethereum and its wallets can help increase people's trust in and use of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Pectra hard fork?\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Pectra hard fork is a major milestone in Ethereum's history. It aims to improve wallet capabilities and the overall efficiency of the network. The update, which introduces numerous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) \u2014 and notably EIP-3074 \u2014 is scheduled for launch in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\nThis proposal is designed to change the way Ethereum handles transactions by allowing digital wallets to use smart contracts. EIP-3074 includes capabilities such as grouped transactions, which let users sign a transaction once regardless of how many tasks it contains. The proposal also allows for endorsed transactions, which enable someone other than the asset owner to pay for transaction fees.\n\nThese improvements are intended to simplify a user's interactions with the Ethereum network, greatly enhancing the overall experience by removing transaction complexities and expenses. Meanwhile, EIP-3074 comes with a new \"social recovery\" feature. The feature lets you regain access to your assets without needing the usual seed phrases.\n\nImpressive, but it doesn't end there. These latest upgrades are part of a wider plan to future-proof the Ethereum network and strengthen its status as one of the leading platforms for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.\n\nWhat are the security implications of EIP-3074?\n\nWhile EIP-3074 helps to make Ethereum more secure and easier to use, it's important to be aware of some security implications brought by the proposal's introduction. For example, the AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes allow for more flexible transaction management but do introduce potential new vulnerabilities.\n\nSecurity benefits\n\nFormal audits and verification : EIP-3074 went through security audits to ensure safety. Audits are essential for finding and fixing vulnerabilities before they're exploited.\n\nEnhanced user control and recovery: With EIP-3074, you can use digital signatures to give control of your Ethereum accounts to a smart contract. This makes it easier to get your assets back or manage them without risking the safety of your private keys.\n\nSecurity risks\n\nPotential for misuse of invoker contracts : One of the main risks associated with EIP-3074 is the potential misuse of invoker contracts. If these contracts aren't implemented securely, they could be exploited to perform unauthorized transactions or access funds without the user's consent.\n\nNeed for trusted invokers : Building on the point above, transactions made with EIP-3074 need invoker contracts that can be trusted. Developers should use measures like whitelists to allow only confirmed safe entities to be involved in transactions.\n\nComplexity in transaction authorization: Using more complex ways to approve transactions can make new and old contracts easy to attack. Greater complexity occurs because the AUTH opcode changes who's seen as the \"sender\" in transactions. Vulnerabilities can arise if this process isn't managed carefully, putting users at risk of attack.\n\nMitigation strategies\n\nComprehensive auditing: Regular checks of the EIP-3074 implementation and the invoker contracts are important to protect users. These checks can help identify and fix vulnerabilities before they're exploited.\n\nStrict validation of commits: To avoid issues like unauthorized access or replay attacks, commits must include ways to make sure each transaction is authorized correctly and can't be misused. One way to do this is by using unique identifiers or nonces.\n\nHow does the social recovery feature work with EIP-3074?\n\nThe social recovery feature brought by EIP-3074 is one of the most noteworthy updates coming to the network. Let's explore how it works in more depth.\n\nDigital signature for asset control : First, you give control of your assets to a special contract by using a secure digital signature. This step is important because it lets the contract manage the assets, but you can still get them back if needed.\n\nInvoker contract : When the assets move to the new contract, that contract will handle all future actions for you. This setup lowers the chance of losing access to your assets if you forget your private keys.\n\nOperational codes - AUTH and AUTHCALL :\n\nAUTH : This code checks that your digital signature and transaction details match your original instructions.\n\nAUTHCALL : After checking, this command lets the contract send crypto. It also allows others to know you've sent assets, so people can see the link between you and the contract's actions.\n\nSecurity and asset recovery : The digital signature contains a unique code that guarantees you can retrieve your assets if you lose or forget your seed phrase, making it an invaluable feature.\n\nEnhanced security measures: Despite the new features, there are risks of dangerous invoker contracts. To protect against losing assets without permission, the update includes ways to use invoker contracts that have been officially checked and reviewed.\n\nHow will EIP-3074 affect transaction processes on Ethereum?\n\nEIP-3074 will alter the processes involved in Ethereum transactions by adding new features that bring welcome simplicity.\n\nBatch transactions : EIP-3074 lets you combine multiple transactions into a single one. This should make transactions more efficient and may lower fees by distributing costs across multiple actions within the same transaction.\n\nSponsored transactions : Sponsored transactions are a new feature with EIP-3074. Here, a third party can pay the transaction fees instead of the asset holder. This could incentivize the use of DApps as asset holders no longer need to pay gas fees.\n\nSmart contract-like capabilities in EOAs: Now, regular user accounts can do some of the same things as smart contracts. They can give permission to smart contracts to perform actions autonomously.\n\nAlongside reducing the complexity of transactions made through the Ethereum network, the Pectra hard fork also introduces new ways for developers to make disruptive and easy-to-use apps.\n\nWhat other EIPs are included in the Pectra upgrade?\n\nVarious other proposals are set to be introduced as part of the Pectra hard fork, each bringing additional functionality to the network.\n\nEIP-7610 : This proposal is designed to make the system more secure by only letting addresses with storage space create smart contracts. In theory, this change will make it easier to upgrade the system in the future, especially via Verkle trees.\n\nEIP-7523 : EIP-7523 focuses on making the Ethereum network more efficient. With the proposal, empty accounts will be removed from the Ethereum state. This helps reduce the state's size, making the network faster and easier to use.\n\nEIP-7251 (Maxeb) : This addition aims to make the network more scalable by simplifying the management of validators. This is achieved by increasing the maximum effective balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. Doing so reduces the need to manage multiple validators, which reduces complexity.\n\nEIP-2537 : The EIP-2537 update brings new pre-built functions to the BLS12-381 curve. These functions help make cryptography processes more efficient. Better cryptography means better security and verification on the network.\n\nEIP-3074, 5806, and 7377 : Account abstraction EIPs make it easier to process transactions. EIP-3074 adds new commands (AUTH and AUTHCALL) that allow for transaction contracts to be verified and executed autonomously once certain permissions are set. This helps with complicated tasks like combining multiple transactions into one or having someone else pay for a transaction.\n\nEIP-5920 (PAY opcode): EIP-5920 provides an easier way to share ETH by sending tokens directly without activating the receiver's contract code.\n\nEach EIP contributes to the broader goal of making Ethereum more scalable, secure, and user-friendly, laying the groundwork for future advancements in the blockchain space.\n\nWhat comes after the Pectra hard fork?\n\nFurther updates are planned following Pectra's release in late 2024 or early 2025, most notably the addition of Verkle trees.\n\nAfter Pectra, Ethereum is planning more updates. One important step is adding Verkle trees, which upgrade Ethereum nodes to validate blocks without needing to store large amounts of state data. This upgrade is a significant step towards 'statelessness' for the network. A stateless client doesn't need to store a full state database to validate incoming blocks.\n\nVerkle tress and progress towards statelessness complements Ethereum's wider ambitions to improve scalability through advanced technologies like sharding, which aims to increase the number of transactions the network can process at once. This scalability solution has been a major focus following the network's move to Proof of Stake with the 'Merge' event.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Pectra hard fork promises to permanently alter how users make transactions on the network and manage their wallets. Efficiency, safety, and uprated features are all key benefits set to be brought about by the development and the arrival of the EIP-3074 proposal.\n\nAlthough this next phase of evolution for the network isn't without its challenges \u2014 notably, concerns over potential security vulnerabilities \u2014 it marks fresh change for Ethereum and added competitiveness for the network."

        "content": "Ethereum is on the verge of a significant price decline, according to a recent technical analysis by Alan Santana, a well-known crypto analyst. Santana forecasts that Ethereum will reach a price of $2,000 within a few days or weeks, advising investors to brace for the impending decline.\n\nThe analyst points out that Ethereum has been drooping for six weeks straight, yet many investors are still waiting for new highs. Santana presents a compelling five-step sequence that draws parallels between the current market situation and the events that unfolded in November 2021.\n\nAlso read: Can Ethereum (ETH) Hit All-Time High After Bitcoin Halving?\n\nFrom All-Time High to Bearish Momentum\n\nIn early November 2021, Ethereum reached a new all-time high (ATH) but immediately turned red, signaling a potential reversal. Santana emphasizes that while the market is at its most bullish when hitting a new ATH, it also opens up the highest bearish potential.\n\nHe notes that the best time to sell is when prices are trading high and near resistance, as waiting for full confirmation from the market often leads to missed opportunities.\n\nFast forward to early March 2024, Ethereum once again produced a peak, reaching a multi-year high before turning red and starting to drop with bearish momentum growing last week. This pattern closely resembles the events that followed the November 2021 ATH.\n\nAlso read: Can Solana (SOL) Hit $200 After Bitcoin Halving?\n\nEthereum EMA10 Breakdown Confirms Top Is In\n\nFollowing the November 2021 ATH, Ethereum dropped below the 10-week exponential moving average (EMA10) as it turned red. The break and close below EMA10 confirmed that the top was in, and a new bearish wave had begun, leading to the \u201cfirst drop.\u201d Similarly, last week, on April 8, 2024, Ethereum moved below the EMA10 on the weekly timeframe, confirming that the top is once again in.\n\nFollowing the top confirmation, Santana now anticipates the \u201cfirst drop,\u201d which could lead to a target range of approximately $2,222 to $2,400. A dead-cat bounce, a temporary recovery in a declining trend, may follow this drop, ultimately leading to a lower low and a bearish impulse.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction This Week\n\nThe analyst suggests that the major flush could reach $2,000, around the 200-week moving average (MA200), which is considered a significant support level. While the price could potentially go lower, Santana identifies this as the key support area to watch."

        "content": "The Ethereum price faces turbulence as it witnesses a decline of nearly 4% amid the broader crypto market fluctuations. Meanwhile, the recent dip in the ETH price has fuelled discussions in the crypto market, with investors speculating over the potential price movements in the coming days.\n\nNotably, the recent whale activities, especially from an ICO whale, have heightened speculations about Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, adding to investor concerns.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Activities Sparks Concerns Over Ethereum Price\n\nThe Ethereum price has witnessed a notable decline over the last few days, especially after the U.S. SEC potentially delayed approving the Ethereum ETF approval. In addition, the investigation by the U.S. SEC over Ethereum\u2019s security status has further dampened the investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the topsy-turvy scenario in the market, Spot On Chain, an on-chain data provider, revealed significant activity from an Ethereum ICO participant. This participant sold 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at $2,997, indicating a sizable offload of Ethereum assets.\n\nNotably, the whale, who initially acquired 33,213 ETH during Ethereum\u2019s Genesis ICO in 2015, has already deposited 5,110 ETH to Kraken or sold via DEX at approximately $2,545. However, despite this sell-off, the whale still holds approximately 29.7K ETH, valued at $89.4 million, across three wallets, primarily within staking platforms.\n\nIn addition, Whale Alert reported additional Ethereum transactions suggestive of potential whale dumps. An unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH, worth $32.13 million, to the Coinbase exchange, while another whale moved 10,726 ETH, valued at around $31.90 million, to the same exchange.\n\nThese sizable transfers to the leading crypto exchange have intensified concerns among investors regarding increased volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. However, amid these worries, analysts are cautiously optimistic about a potential market resurgence, driven by anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event.\n\nAlso Read: Cardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson Believes RFK Jr Is The Best Presidential Candidate\n\nPrice Performance & Market Sentiment\n\nIn a noteworthy development, the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong has injected optimism into the market. This regulatory milestone has uplifted sentiment among market participants, offering a glimmer of hope amid the current market turbulence.\n\nWhile uncertainties loom over Ethereum\u2019s short-term performance due to whale activities, the broader crypto market remains buoyed by positive developments such as regulatory approvals and anticipation of significant events like the Bitcoin Halving. It\u2019s worth noting that several analysts have also warned about potential short-term volatility during the Halving event.\n\nMeanwhile, as of writing, the Ethereum price traded at $2,978.31, down 3.45% from yesterday, while its trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 10.77% to $18.58 billion. Notably, the Ethereum price has plunged over 16% over the last seven days, while noting a monthly decline of around 18%.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s L2 Merlin Chain Unleashes Half of MERL Airdrop Tokens at TGE\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "title": "You Might Be Surprised By the 2 Cryptos That Billionaire Mark Cuban Is Buying for His Portfolio - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The search is on for cryptocurrencies with real-world utility.\n\nFor many investors, billionaire Mark Cuban may be best known as one of the investors on the popular ABC program Shark Tank. But for crypto enthusiasts, Cuban is best known as a champion of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin during the previous crypto bull market rally.\n\nSo what is Cuban buying during the recent crypto bull market? The names might surprise you. He's expanding beyond just the two big cryptocurrencies -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- in search of utility coins that promise to deliver real-world use cases. Let's take a closer look at what he's adding to his portfolio.\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon (MATIC -1.70%) is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, helping it to run cheaper, faster, and more efficiently. You can think of Polygon as a secondary blockchain that sits on top of the core Ethereum blockchain. By doing so, it can mitigate some of the pricing and congestion issues typically faced by Ethereum users.\n\nThat's a clear example of utility, and it's easy to see why Cuban is all aboard the Polygon train. After Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin laid out the blockchain's strategic roadmap for 2024, he made it a point to highlight the growing role played by Layer-2 scaling solutions. Right now, the future growth story for Ethereum is all about enabling these Layer-2 scaling solutions to do even more. So if Polygon can hitch its growth to that of Ethereum, it should be good news for investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that the Layer-2 blockchain niche has become especially crowded during the past 12 months. As a result, Polygon hasn't seen the types of price gains initially expected by investors. Around the time of Ethereum blockchain update knowns as The Merge in 2022, Polygon was trading near the $1 mark. But in the 18 months since, Polygon has dropped below $1 . It is currently trading for less than $0.70, and is down more than 30% for the year. Nonetheless, with a $6.6 billion market cap, it remains one of the top 20 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nInjective\n\nInjective (INJ 2.71%) is a Layer-1 blockchain that was purpose-built for decentralized finance (DeFi). In theory, core DeFi activities -- such as being able to create new DeFi lending protocols, or swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges -- should be faster, cheaper, and easier on Injective than on rival blockchains. In terms of utility, Injective is the blockchain you use if you want to build new financial applications or participate in DeFi.\n\nAnd, indeed, as measured by one important metric, total value locked (TVL), Injective is gaining ground in the DeFi world. In February, Injective set a record with more than $110 million in TVL, suggesting that more and more crypto users are embracing Injective as an on-ramp to DeFi. Right now, there are more than 100 projects on the Injective blockchain, and a reported 150,000 community members.\n\nBut, as with Polygon, the results just haven't been there this year for Injective. After soaring in price from $1.25 in January 2023 to over $50 in March 2024, Injective is now down about 35% year to date. With a $2.4 billion market cap, though, Injective still ranks as a top 50 crypto in terms of valuation.\n\nThe ongoing search for utility in crypto\n\nDuring a January AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\") on X (formerly known as Twitter), Cuban shared an important insight about investing in crypto: \"I hate the speculation but love when there is utility.\" Like many longtime crypto investors, he's seen the extreme volatility in the crypto market, and has warned against believing too much in the hype and speculation surrounding certain coins.\n\nTo mitigate some of that risk, one option is to focus on utility. If you don't understand what a crypto does, or what purpose it serves, it might just be that there is no purpose. If that's the case, then you probably shouldn't be adding it to your portfolio. Trying to chase a speculative meme coin may be fun, but it will rarely be profitable. There's no guarantee that you will be profitable with utility coins either, but understanding the core use cases of a crypto can help you make smarter long-term investment decisions."

        "title": "Pepe vs Shiba Inu: Which Ethereum Memecoin To Buy Before Halving? - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the crypto community prepares for the fourth Bitcoin halving on February 20, 2024, the question of which Ethereum-based meme coin\u2014Pepe Coin or Shiba Inu\u2014to invest in becomes a significant topic of discussion. Both tokens share some common traits such and dedicated community and meme-inspired origins, yet their market performance and technical indicators set them apart in terms of their potential as an investment before the halving. In this article we share insights to empower you in making investment decisions, between PEPE and Shiba Inu.\n\nPEPE vs Shiba Inu: Price Market Performance\n\nPepe and Shiba Inu are two popular digital currencies that have attracted a lot of interest in the cryptocurrency market. Despite their similarities as memecoins, they exhibit differences in their price market performance and metrics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, SHIB boasts of a market cap of $13.23 billion, earning its position as the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In contracts, PEPE has a market capitalization of $2.23 billion, securing the 47th position, among the top 50 cryptocurrencies. This shows that Shiba Inu has a significantly greater market presence than PEPE.\n\nPEPE saw a 4.21% rise in price daily and a 24.87% increase weekly, yet encountered a significant 31.33% decline in the past month. On the other hand, Shiba Inu experienced a less significant daily gain of 2.87% and a monthly decline of 10%. SHIB\u2019s weekly decrease was also 18.86%. This implies that although PEPE has faced substantial short-term fluctuations, its long-term results have been more inconsistent.\n\nWhen it comes to daily and weekly performance, Pepe coin experienced an increase of 4.21% in its value over the last week, and a 31.33% drop in the past month. On the other hand, Shiba Inu tokens recorded a slight gain of 2.87%, although it experienced losses of 18.86% and 10% over the past week and month respectively. This implies that although PEPE has faced substantial short-term fluctuations, its long-term results have been more inconsistent.\n\nIn terms of volume, both tokens have been actively traded in the market. PEPE had a trading volume of $722.3 million over a 24-hour period, whereas Shiba Inu\u2019s volume was higher at $846.18 million. PEPE has a volume-to-market cap ratio of 32.53%, showing a greater level of trading compared to its market cap. SHIB\u2019s ratio sits at 6.43%, indicating decreased trading activity in relation to its market cap.\n\nPEPE achieved its all-time high of $0.00001074 just slightly over a month ago, on March 14, 2024, but has since dropped in value by 50.68% to its current price of $0.000005293. On the other hand, Shiba Inu price reached its all-time high of $0.00008845 two years ago, in October 2021, and likewise, it has witnessed a dropped of approximately 74.67% to record $0.00002246.\n\nPEPE vs Shiba Inu: Price Forecast\n\nIn comparing the technical analysis of Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu, we observe distinct trends and patterns in terms of moving averages, oscillators, MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci support and resistance levels.\n\nBeginning with the moving averages, both Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu are showing decreasing patterns in their short-term signals. The 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) for Pepe Coin is 0.000005928279, while the simple moving average (SMA) is 0.000006150416. Shiba Inu has a 10-day EMA of 0.00002415 and an SMA of 0.00002476. Both sets of data indicate a bearish signal since the current prices fall below the short-term averages. In addition, the 100-day and 200-day EMAs and SMAs suggest a possible change in trend, with Pepe Coin displaying a more robust buy signal than Shiba Inu.\n\nRegarding oscillators, both cryptocurrencies present a neutral outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of PEPE stands at 40.21, while Shiba Inu\u2019s RSI rests at 39.99. This shows that both coins are not experiencing any overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nLooking at MACD analysis, both the Ethereum meme coins indicate \u2018sell\u2019. SHIB exhibits a MACD level of -0.00000126, while PEPE\u2019s MACD level is at -0.000000471995. This indicates a potential downward trend coming soon for both coins.\n\nWith regards to Fibonacci levels, should the price of Pepe Coin drop, it will find a strong support level at 0.000007435425, and Shiba Inu will find its support level 0.00002964 should its price drop. Both cryptocurrencies have various levels of support and resistance, but Pepe Coin is closer to its support levels, indicating potential price volatility. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, seems to have more distant support levels, which could imply greater stability in its price movements.\n\nWhich Ethereum Meme Coin Should you Buy?\n\nPepe Coin and Shiba Inu both provide distinct investment opportunities, but they appeal to varying levels of risk tolerance. Pepe Coin\u2019s potential for future expansion makes it an appealing option for individuals looking for greater returns despite the increased risk involved. The market presence and stability of the Shiba Inu coin could attract investors looking for a safer and more consistent choice. In the end, choosing between Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu will be determined by personal investment objectives and willingness to take risks as the halving event nears."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s disregard of L1s raises questions once again.\n\nLayer 2 security concerns challenge Ethereum\u2019s decentralization commitment.\n\nAmidst the ongoing crypto bloodbath, Ethereum [ETH], the leading altcoin, mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] downward trajectory, with its daily and weekly charts awash in red.\n\nWhile it records a modest 3% dip in one day, the past week has seen more significant losses, with double-digit declines exceeding 16%.\n\nHowever, amidst these volatile swings, an unexpected question arises: Does Ethereum\u2019s architecture hold the top spot?\n\nConcerns surrounding ETH\u2019s architecture?\n\nIn a recent article, David Hoffman, co-owner at Bankless, highlighting the lasting impact of the Bitcoin block size wars on today\u2019s crypto community said,\n\n\u201cA lot of people\u2019s arguments about how you should build crypto or what crypto should look like can be characterized as like a big blocker or a small blocker argument.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, outlining the modern-day scenario he added,\n\n\u201cSolana is the big blocker and Ethereum is the small blocker.\u201d\n\nThis underscores the ongoing debate wherein Solana [SOL] advocates for L1 scalability, aiming for instant, free transactions. While Ethereum prioritizes L1 decentralization, emphasizing L2 scaling.\n\nFurthermore, delving into the concept of block complexity, comparing blockchains with and without a virtual machine, Hoffman said,\n\n\u201cAll chains before Ethereum were missing this key element, and instead tried to add functionality as individual op-codes, rather than a fully expressive virtual machine.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, reiterating the importance of finding a balance between scalability and decentralization, Vitalik Buterin, in his 2019 article noted,\n\n\u201cKeep layer 1 simple, make up for it on layer 2\u2033 is NOT a universal answer to blockchain scalability and functionality problems.\u201d\n\nButerin said this because this approach fails to consider that L1 blockchains themselves must have a sufficient level of scalability and functionality for this \u2018building on top\u2019 to be possible\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s more to it?\n\nNeedless to say, this has resulted in ETH becoming less affordable for individual users but more suitable for entities like chains, exchanges, and funds.\n\nRemarking on the same, @RyanSAdams highlighted,\n\n\u201c\u2019Ethereum is too expensive\u2019 is a really bad take.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, comparing Ethereum L2 solutions with the Cosmos chains, Sam Hart noted,\n\n\u201cCosmos isn\u2019t a technology or an ecosystem, it\u2019s the choice to build a sovereign application that seeks to interoperate with others.\u201d\n\nIn fact, recent allegations of top Layer 2 solutions potentially mishandling user funds have raised doubts about Ethereum\u2019s commitment to decentralization, echoing concerns voiced by Justin Bons,\n\n\u201cETH gives decentralization lip service, but actions speak louder than words.\u201d\n\nAll this brings forth a question: Does Ethereum\u2019s architecture need a revamp?"

        "content": "DOGE surges 4% with Elon Musk tweet amid memecoin frenzy.\n\nDeFi regulations could boost DOGE, paving the path to ETF eligibility.\n\nIn light of the recent crypto bloodbath stirring the crypto market, Dogecoin [DOGE] was amongst a few altcoins that spiked a little amidst the market crash.\n\nThe dog-themed cryptocurrency saw a slight uptick of over 4% in its price following a recent tweet from Elon Musk.\n\nThe memecoin craze\n\nRecently, Musk humorously compared mainstream media to characters from \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Life of Brian,\u201d who have been struggling to report on Dogecoin\u2019s rise amongst the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis playful portrayal highlighted the nature of Dogecoin\u2019s success and the influence of social media culture on financial markets.\n\nAs the market turns on the path to recovery, social media is abuzz with memecoin mania, as highlighted by @ApeCryptos in his recent X post,\n\n\u201cU Can\u2019t Stop #Meme Coins.\u201d\n\nShedding light on the regulatory actions against DeFi projects, Will Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research in conversation with Laura Shin, host of \u201cUnchained\u201d podcast, saw this as a potential benefit for meme coins.\n\nHe said,\n\n\u201cI think the one that has the highest likelihood could actually be Dogecoin because it\u2019s a commodity right? I mean I would argue that it\u2019s a much purer commodity profile than like Ethereum.\u201d\n\nClemente believes that if DeFi projects face shutdowns or regulatory hurdles, investors might turn to meme coins as an alternative investment option.\n\nAdditionally, he outlines that the regulatory environment could pave the way for meme coins to gain traction and potentially become eligible for inclusion in cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nWhat lies ahead for DOGE?\n\nNotably, Even though DOGE has seen losses recently, there are still many holders who refuse to waver.\n\nOn-chain data reveals a notable 18% decline in value over the past week, yet Dogecoin\u2019s long-term investors stand strong while navigating the market with resilience.\n\nMoreover, insights from IntoTheBlock reveal that a staggering 81% of DOGE wallet addresses are still basking in profitability, even amid the recent downward spiral.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Crypto Daily Trade Signals, added,\n\n\u201c#Dogecoin will do this soon $1 #Doge coming faster than you think!!\u201d\n\nErgo, despite DOGE currently treading water in its consolidation phase, its potential to shift market sentiments from bearish to bullish remains positive."

        "content": "Exec claims Ethereum L2s can \u201csteal user funds.\u201d\n\nIndustry figures propose multi-signatories to eliminate single points of failure.\n\nIn a surprising disclosure, it has been revealed that the safety of user funds in Ethereum [ETH] L2s is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to founder and CIO of crypto-focused Cyber Capital, Justin Bons, L2s like Arbitrum [ARB], Optimism [OP], Base, Blast, Starknet [STRK], and ZkSync can all \u201csteal user funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cArbitrum, Optimism, Base, Blast, Starknet & ZkSync all have admin keys! All of the top L2s can steal all user funds right now.\u201d\n\nThis is even more disturbing because, according to VanEck analysis, the space is projected to reach a $1T value by 2030.\n\nThe exec compared the current state of L2s to legacy banking and took a swipe at Ethereum for being a \u201clip service\u201d to decentralization.\n\n\u201cIf this is considered safe, then we might as well go back to legacy banking. ETH gives decentralization lip service, but actions speak louder than word\u201d\n\nReaction to safety concerns in Ethereum L2s\n\nSolana [SOL] co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko suggested a \u201cmulti-sig\u201d shared sequencer as a solution to the \u201csingle admin key.\u201d He stated,\n\n\u201cEach one should volunteer a tribute to be a member of the multi-sig for the shared sequencer.\u201d\n\nMulti-sig means having multiple signatories to increase decentralization, transparency, and eliminate the risk of a \u201csingle admin key.\u201d\n\nRaj Gokal, another Solana co-founder, called for an expedited solution,\n\n\u201cHope this gets fixed soon\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, the founder and CEO of Helius Labs, a Solana developer platform, vouched for Ethereum [ETH] L2s and preferred them over Binance [BNB], Cardano [ADA], or Ripple [XRP].\n\nHe reiterated,\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll say something positive about L2s: I\u2019d be much happier if they were in the top 10 instead of Cardano, XRP, and BNB.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Solana should consider some L2s as well, the Helius Labs\u2019 exec quipped,\n\n\u201cCould make sense in some cases.\u201d\n\nA recent AMBcrypto analysis established increased transactions within L2s post-Dencun upgrade, which could tip ETH\u2019s value.\n\nHowever, ETH faced key headwinds, including the SEC\u2019s silence on spot ETFs and ongoing Middle East tensions. At the time of writing, it was barely holding above $3K."

Created by Worldcoin Foundation, this platform is designed to prioritize real human users over bots by offering them priority in block space allocation and complimentary gas allowances. This innovation not only bolsters the Worldcoin ecosystem but significantly enhances transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability for its users.\n\nAs I shared in my recent tweet, Worldcoin, envisioned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is gearing up for the summer launch of World Chain. This platform is set to enhance scalability within the Superchain ecosystem and will operate under the security framework provided by its role as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution.\n\n#Worldcoin, the brainchild of# OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is gearing up to unveil World Chain this summer! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd17 This innovative project is set to be safeguarded by #Ethereum as an L2 solution and designed for scalability within the Superchain ecosystem. It's going to be\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9lZ7cw4JZ8 \u2014 Marcel Knobloch aka Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) April 17, 2024\n\nThis initiative emphasizes Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to open-source development and its ambition for community-led governance in the future.\n\nEnhancing User Experience with World ID\n\nAccording to a recent YouTube video from CNF, World Chain will further integrate with World ID\u2019s Proof of Personhood, which uses iris scans to verify individual identities, subsequently rewarding verified users with WLD tokens. Amidst increasing regulatory scrutiny, Worldcoin is also enhancing privacy protections. These enhancements include more robust personal data management options and the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs to ensure network integrity without compromising privacy.\n\nScaling and Interoperability Advancements\n\nAs highlighted in a recent TradingView post, World Chain is engineered to expand capacity and streamline transactions, reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. The integration of World ID allows users to anonymously prove their identity, securing priority processing and even complimentary gas.\n\nIn alignment with a recent CNF post, Worldcoin has introduced an \u201cunverify\u201d function aimed at giving users greater control over their personal data. This feature, which was developed in response to heightened regulatory scrutiny, allows users to manage their data privacy proactively. Despite these changes, Worldcoin (WLD) has managed to maintain a stable market position.\n\nFurthermore, the blockchain community, including the Optimism team, has expressed enthusiasm for the introduction of World Chain. Notably, Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 network, Base, also utilizes the OP Stack, underscoring the growing acceptance and implementation of these advanced scaling solutions within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe project\u2019s success could serve as a pivotal moment for Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions and their role in broader blockchain adoption. Current trading data shows Worldcoin (WLD) at $4.83, marking a 3.73% decrease over the past day and a 27.30% drop over the last week, reflecting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nNo coins selected\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "content": "Market picture\n\nThe crypto market avoided sharp moves on Tuesday, showing low volatility over the 24 hours and remaining near $2.3 trillion. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index added 2 points to 67 (greed) by Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s share of the entire crypto market capitalisation exceeded 54%, maintaining its upward trend since December 2022. This is the clear impact of the Bitcoin-ETF, but we also note the diminishing enthusiasm for altcoins.\n\nThe technical picture for Bitcoin is rather worrying, as we saw no rebound after the price drop on Friday and Saturday. On the contrary, the market seems to be getting used to current prices in anticipation of a halving.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum sold off powerfully at the end of last week from the 50-day MA. Now, the second largest cryptocurrency holds near the psychologically significant $3000 level.\n\nThe pattern of cryptocurrency behaviour this week indicates that we are more likely to be in the eye of the storm, i.e. a temporary lull between violent gusts of wind. If this prediction is correct, Bitcoin could fall towards $52-55K, and Ethereum \u2013 to $2500.\n\nNews background\n\nThe crypto market is \u201chalfway to bitcoin euphoria,\u201d according to CryptoQuant. New bitcoin miners, who have held their assets for less than 155 days, hold up to 9% of the circulating BTC volume and continue to build up inventories in anticipation of rising prices. The imbalance between BTC supply and demand will increase over the next six months, potentially driving prices higher.\n\nHong Kong-listed cryptocurrency ETFs will be \u201clucky\u201d if they manage to raise $500 million in aggregate, Bloomberg said. The agency called Matrixport\u2019s projected $25bn \u201cinsane\u201d.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, there are more than 2.52 million crypto assets in existence today, which is 5.7 times the number at the end of 2021. The pace of new coins accelerated in 2024 when 0.54 million tokens have already been created, which means an average of 5,300 pieces launched per day.\n\nBlockchain team The Open Network (TON) has announced the launch of the Memelandia hub for meme coin developers. The project is part of The Open League\u2019s programme, which was created to support new meme coins and raise awareness of them."

Did this latest announcement move the price of WLD in any way?\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s Layer 2\n\nIn its announcement on the 17th of April, Worldcoin revealed the launch of what it termed the \u201cWorld Chain.\u201d This new platform is described as a Layer 2 solution built on the network.\n\nNotably, the World Chain will be secured by Ethereum [ETH]. The announcement also mentioned the presence of bots on the platform, with some deemed necessary.\n\nTo address potential network congestion caused by unnecessary bots, Worldcoin plans to leverage World ID to distinguish between bots and human users.\n\nAdditionally, the post highlighted the prominent role of WLD, Worldcoin\u2019s native token, which will be utilized for gas fees alongside ETH.\n\nDid Worldcoin react?\n\nThe latest announcement from Worldcoin introduced a new utility for WLD, yet it failed to prevent the observed decline.\n\nAnalysis of the daily timeframe chart reveals that WLD concluded the day with a negative performance despite the announcement.\n\nBy the end of the trading session on the 17th of April, WLD experienced a decline of over 6%, trading around $4.7.\n\nAt the time of writing, it fluctuated between gains and losses, exhibiting a less than 1% increase while still trading around $4.7.\n\nThe long Moving Average (blue line) currently acts as support around $4. Still, a breach below it could initiate a more significant decline.\n\nFurthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirmed a bear trend, with the RSI below 40, indicating a strong bearish sentiment.\n\nThis trend suggested that WLD had its trajectory, and the recent announcement failed to generate any positive impact.\n\nActive addresses show reduced activity\n\nBesides the price movement, analysis of the 24-hour and 30-day active addresses metrics indicated a lack of excitement surrounding Worldcoin.\n\nRead Worldcoin\u2019s [WLD] Price Prediction 2024-23\n\nAccording to Santiment, the 24-hour active addresses metric shows no significant change between the 17th of April to press time, with a slight decline observed.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are 321 active addresses. Additionally, the 30-day active addresses metric reveals significant declines over the past few weeks, with only 6,483 active addresses at the time of writing."

        "content": "Ethereum resumed selling pressure this week after experiencing a little retracement last. While on the verge of breaking down a key price level, it has posted roughly 7% loss in the past week.\n\nRejecting $4,100 and $3,700 in the past weeks, Ethereum has found it difficult to push above the $3,300 level in the recent bounce as it lost momentum again due to the latest decline.\n\nTaking that bounce as a retracement of last week\u2019s drop, the price is now on the verge of dropping off the important $3,000 level. A successful bridge from there could drive the price back to $2,852 \u2013 the current holding support.\n\nTechnically, that holding support recently acted as a sub-level to the crucial $2700 level that flipped as resistance during February\u2019s surge. Once the crucial level is retested (probably as this week\u2019s low) in this leg down, we can expect a quick price recovery in no time.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ETH may extend bearishness below this key retest level if the weekly supply continues to outweigh demand. The $2,500 \u2013 $2,400 zone would be an oversold area to watch for a major buyback.\n\nAs of now, there are no signs of the bulls. A reversal pattern above the mentioned holding support could bring them back into the market. But as it stands, the bears are taking charge.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nWhile the bulls are in disbelief of the recent price movement, they may suffer more losses if the price slides through the vital $3,000 support level. Breaking the $2,850 support will activate more drops.\n\nThe $3,202 level now stands as immediate resistance. If the price recovers above $3,300, the resistance levels to watch above it are $3,450 and $3,723.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $3,202, $3,450, $3,723\n\nKey Support Levels: $3,000, $2,852, $2,712\n\nSpot Price: $3,042\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction : Analyst Lark Davis Predicts ETH Price Will Hit $15K This Bull Run, Here\u2019s Why\n\ncrypto analyst Lark Davis forecasted Ethereum price soaring to an astounding $15,000 this crypto cycle.\n\nHis prediction is backed by compelling catalysts that could propel the leading smart contract platform to new heights.\n\nCoinbase Base Chain Onboarding Surge\n\nThe first reason Davis highlights is that Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain as a pivotal catalyst driving Ethereum\u2019s price surge. With Coinbase\u2019s imminent launch of Base Chain and its smart wallet, the platform is set to onboard its vast user base of 120 million customers, creating an unprecedented surge in Ethereum demand.\n\nAs users flock to Base Chain, Ethereum stands to benefit immensely, with every transaction requiring ETH as fuel, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation.\n\nLayer Two Narrative and Ethereum\u2019s Dominance\n\nBeyond the Coinbase hype, Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in layer two scaling solutions further strengthens its bullish case. Davis emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s integral role in the broader layer two narrative, with projects like Arbitrum and ZK Sync gaining traction.\n\nAs users embrace layer two solutions for scalability and cost-effectiveness, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space solidifies, driving investor confidence and adoption.\n\nEthereum Staking and Wealth Creation\n\nAnother key catalyst highlighted by Davis is Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem, which promises substantial returns and wealth creation opportunities. With the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain and the upcoming integration of staking protocols like Igen, Ethereum holders are incentivized to lock up their ETH, further reducing circulating supply and driving up prices.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s thriving DeFi ecosystem and burgeoning NFT market contribute to the platform\u2019s overall economic activity, reinforcing its status as a blue-chip asset in the crypto space.\n\nAlso Check Out : Crypto Expert Lark Davis Reveals 9 Altcoins Set for 9x Growth in 2024\n\nThe ETF Potential\n\nDavis underscores the significance of an Ethereum ETF approval, despite the expected denial of BlackRock\u2019s application in May. While initial rejections may dampen short-term sentiment, Davis remains bullish on the eventual approval of an Ethereum ETF, citing BlackRock\u2019s track record and legal precedents.\n\nOnce approved, an Ethereum ETF could unleash a flood of institutional capital into the market, driving prices to unprecedented levels.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWith a confluence of bullish catalysts on the horizon, Ethereum\u2019s journey to $15,000 appears increasingly plausible. Davis\u2019s forecast sheds light on the fundamental drivers behind Ethereum\u2019s potential surge, offering investors valuable insights into the platform\u2019s long-term growth prospects."

        "content": "Worldcoin, a pioneering biometric digital identity project utilizing iris scanning, has announced a strategic partnership with Alchemy, a prominent Web3 development platform.\n\nThis collaboration aims to fortify the infrastructure of the World Chain ecosystem, facilitating a more robust framework for developers. The announcement was made on June 26, marking a significant development in the integration of biometric technology within blockchain applications.\n\nThe partnership provides World Chain developers immediate access to Alchemy\u2019s extensive suite of Web3 development tools.\n\nThis suite includes core and data APIs, indexing solutions, and a sophisticated account abstraction infrastructure, which enhances the safety and security of self-custodial wallets.\n\nAlchemy\u2019s integration will also extend to incorporating World ID, Worldcoin\u2019s digital ID technology, offering millions of developers worldwide an opportunity to engage with this cutting-edge technology.\n\nWorld Chain was initially introduced in April 2024 as a part of a larger initiative by Tools for Humanity, spearheaded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nSource: Worldcoin\n\nAlex Blania, who is centrally involved in the development and promotion of the Worldcoin project, plays a crucial role in the ongoing development of this blockchain network.\n\nDesigned explicitly with human-centric principles, World Chain intends to operate alongside other major blockchain ecosystems such as Optimism, Coinbase, and the broader Ethereum network, collectively known as the Superchain.\n\nThis blockchain is particularly tailored to prioritize human interactions over automated processes. By leveraging verified World IDs, World Chain offers holders priority block space and a free gas allowance for regular transactions, thereby reducing the prevalence of bots.\n\nThis design not only secures the network against automated interferences but also ensures that developers have clearer access to real users, enhancing the overall user experience and reliability of blockchain applications.\n\nStrategic Partnership Bolsters World Chain\u2019s Ambitions\n\nSteven Smith, the head of protocol at Tools for Humanity, emphasized the importance of this partnership with Alchemy.\n\nHe noted that Alchemy has demonstrated proven expertise in ensuring guaranteed uptime and reliability for major enterprises, a crucial element as World Chain aims to establish itself as the first human-centered blockchain and the largest entry point for human participation in the blockchain space.\n\nJust in: Worldcoin is partnering with @AlchemyPlatform to bring World Chain to life \u26aa\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/ECKikbkXby \u2014 Worldcoin (@worldcoin) June 26, 2024\n\nThe partnership is expected to make significant strides toward achieving Tools for Humanity\u2019s goal of bringing a billion users into the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nIt aims to increase opportunities for developers to create applications that are not only effective but also intuitively align with human needs and experiences in digital spaces.\n\nWorldcoin Expands Operations Globally\n\nIn addition to its technological strides, Worldcoin is expanding its operational footprint globally. As part of its expansion efforts, Worldcoin has initiated its European operations by launching World ID orb verifications in six locations across two European cities.\n\nThis move marks the project\u2019s initial steps into Europe following successful implementations in various Latin American countries and represents a critical phase in Worldcoin\u2019s strategy to broaden its global influence.\n\nDespite these positive strides, Worldcoin has experienced a minor setback in market dynamics. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a slight decline in open interest by 0.85%, bringing its current valuation to $107.9 million.\n\nSource: Worldcoin\n\nFurthermore, the price of Worldcoin\u2019s token (WLD) has seen a decrease of 1.22% during the same period, with its price currently standing at $2.83 and a trading volume of $193.8 million.\n\nThis partnership between Worldcoin and Alchemy represents a transformative step in making blockchain technology more accessible and tailored to human needs, potentially leading to widespread adoption and innovation in the blockchain sector.\n\nAs World Chain continues to develop, it holds the promise of becoming a pivotal platform in the evolution of blockchain technology, focused on enhancing user engagement and security."
