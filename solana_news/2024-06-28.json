Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nZhu Su , a founder of the infamous Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, recently highlighted the performance of the Grayscale Solana Trust, suggesting it could imply the future value of Solana to $1,000 per SOL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis projection is based on a comparison with the historical performance of Ethereum and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), used as a benchmark.\n\nWhy is no one talking about how Grayscale Solana trust is implying $1k per sol already\n\n\n\nThe numbers are very similar to when eth was $200 but ethe implied $1k, in 2020 Advertisement June 28, 2024\n\nGrayscale's trusts work by allowing investors to gain exposure to digital currencies through a traditional investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing and safekeeping digital assets directly.\n\nEach share of the trust represents a fraction of the cryptocurrency held by the trust, and the value of the shares can trade at a premium or discount to the underlying asset's market value.\n\n\"Every four years...\"\n\nThus, four years ago, when Ethereum was trading at around $200, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust implied a value of $1,000 per ETH. This significant premium indicated strong investor confidence and future price expectations.\n\nEthereum's price eventually caught up with these projections, experiencing substantial growth in subsequent years. This pattern suggests a potential roadmap for Solana.\n\nThe comparison of Solana to Ethereum's early days, when it was also emerging as a significant platform, is noteworthy. If SOL follows a similar trajectory, the implied value suggested by the Grayscale Solana Trust could be realized.\n\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, the historical context offers a compelling narrative of Solana's growth prospects, making the $1,000 target a topic of interest in the community."

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Ethereum While It's Under $4,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the second half of 2024. Here's why.\n\nThrough the first six months of the year, Ethereum (ETH -5.70%) has largely kept pace with Bitcoin (BTC -3.10%). Both are now up about 45% year to date, and the big question on the minds of many investors is which is going to outperform during the rest of 2024.\n\nIn early May, the easy no-brainer answer would have been Bitcoin. But Bitcoin has stumbled of late, and that has opened the door for Ethereum. There are now four compelling reasons Ethereum could soar higher, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nBitcoin, of course, has had spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since January. And the introduction of this new investment product has arguably been one of the most important crypto narratives of 2024. But there's a new twist to that narrative. At the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved new spot ETFs for Ethereum.\n\nIt is still uncertain how much of a boost these new ETFs are going to provide. The current thinking is that they will start trading sometime this summer and that they could lead to $3 billion flooding into the new ETFs. That's a bull case scenario, though. According to JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.81%), the bear case scenario is closer to $1 billion. That's barely a blip on the radar compared to the $30 billion that has flowed into the new Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, they are still likely to move the needle for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum as the market leader\n\nEthereum continues to be the clear market leader in every important blockchain sector. Take decentralized finance (DeFi), for example, where Ethereum still accounts for more than 60% of all total value locked (TVL) in the blockchain world. No other blockchain even comes close. So we can start to downplay any notion that a challenger such as Solana (SOL -5.36%), Cardano (ADA -6.00%), or Avalanche (AVAX -7.38%) has any clear-cut path to toppling Ethereum anytime soon.\n\nThe market seems to agree. Ethereum is significantly outperforming all of its peers. For example, Solana is up 35%, and Sui (SUI -2.02%) is up 9%. Other top competitors are reeling. Aptos (APT -2.47%) is down 28%, Cardano is down 32%, and Avalanche is down 33%.\n\nRegulatory clarity\n\nThere's another big reason to cheer on Ethereum, and that is regulatory clarity. Just about anyone who has ever heard of Ethereum considers it to be a cryptocurrency. However, through the first six months of the year, there were rumbles and murmurs about a pending SEC investigation into Ethereum, due to uncertainty over whether it might actually be a security.\n\nBut those rumors now appear to be quashed, with the SEC saying that it is closing down any investigation into Ethereum. That's important because it could turn on the money spigots for risk-averse institutional investors. Crypto is risky enough without the added risk of an SEC probe.\n\nLong-term disruptive potential\n\nAnd, finally, there's the long-term disruptive potential of Ethereum. For the past decade, Ethereum has been a true innovator, pioneering niches of the blockchain world that had never existed before. And, judging by all the tech upgrades that have been made to the Ethereum blockchain over the past two years, this trajectory should continue.\n\nIn fact, investment firm VanEck expects Ethereum to grow dramatically in several key areas, led by DeFi. It's here that the Ethereum blockchain can offer the greatest disruptive potential. It's simply faster, cheaper, and more transparent to manage financial assets on a blockchain. And that could lead to Ethereum gaining market share at the expense of traditional financial rivals.\n\nIn fact, VanEck has run the numbers and determined that Ethereum could soar to a value of $22,000 per token by 2030. That would give Ethereum an implied market cap north of $2 trillion. Given that the top companies in Silicon Valley are now worth anywhere from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, a market cap of $2 trillion for Ethereum is not as unreasonable as it might sound at first.\n\nWhat to look for over the next six months\n\nFrom my perspective, the biggest threat to Ethereum remains the rise of blockchain challengers such as Solana. The economic moat that once surrounded Ethereum seems to be getting smaller and smaller with each passing year.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments you can make in the second half of 2024. If the new ETFs perform as expected, then it could be off to the races for the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency."

        "title": "What Are Blobs? Improving Ethereum\u2019s Scalability - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOfficially introduced to the Ethereum network on March 13, 2024 in the Dencun upgrade, blobs are a new type of data storage space designed to make rollups cheaper and more efficient.\n\nThe consensus within the Ethereum community is that the best way to scale Ethereum is through rollups, also known as Layer 2s or L2\u2019s, and that the best way to scale rollups is via the introduction of blobs.\n\nBefore blobs, if Ethereum went through a period of congestion, that would also affect the price of transactions on all of its Layer 2s. The introduction of blobs removes the correlation between Ethereum congestion and the cost of transactions on Layer 2s.\n\nWhat are blobs?\n\nBlobs are a new data structure introduced to Ethereum in EIP-4844, more colloquially referred to as \u201cProto-danksharding\u201d. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal\u2014the process by which Ethereum core developers suggest improvements to Ethereum.\n\nProto-danksharding is the precursor to full-danksharding, and sets the foundation for it by introducing blobs. It does so in the same format in which they\u2019ll be used when full-danksharding is implemented, in order to simplify the transition to full-danksharding.\n\nFull-danksharding, or just Danksharding, is an upcoming Ethereum protocol update. It represents what Ethereum core devs believe will be the last step (for now) in making Ethereum a truly scalable blockchain, by making transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nProto-danksharding is a step towards implementing Danksharding\u2014it introduces concepts from Danksharding, such as blobs, to Ethereum. Starting with proto-danksharding and the introduction of blobs, instead of diving straight into full-danksharding, reduces the risk created by introducing drastic changes to a network too quickly.\n\nHow do blobs work?\n\nBefore blobs, when a Layer 2 needed to verify its transactions, it would batch up transactions, and send them to Layer 1 (Ethereum) to verify. The problem was, after the data was verified, it was still stuck on the Ethereum blockchain, taking up blockspace, forever.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis contributes to state bloat, and makes Ethereum more congested\u2014which, in turn, also made Layer 2s more congested.\n\nWith blobs, when the data is sent to the Layer 1 for verification, it\u2019s sent in a blob, short for \u201cBinary Large Object.\u201d Each blob has 4096 field elements and can hold up to 32 bytes of data per field element, which equates to around 75 MB per blob. You can think of it as a giant table of data, or\u2026 a big blob of data.\n\nBlobs improve on the previous method of verifying data in that once data has been verified from a blob, it can be deleted. This way, all the transaction data from every rollup built on top of Ethereum doesn\u2019t have to live permanently on the Ethereum blockchain, taking up valuable space.\n\nBlobs also operate using a separate blob fee market\u2014introducing \u201cblob gas\u201d. Blob gas is independent of gas on Ethereum mainnet, meaning the only things that use blob gas are blobs themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about blobs?\n\nDespite the funny names involved in Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, it\u2019s a serious improvement. Blobs help to make Ethereum less congested, and they make rollups cheaper and faster to use.\n\nThis is because the data that\u2019s verified in blobs can be deleted after use. As such, it doesn\u2019t cause state bloat on Ethereum mainnet. \u201cState bloat\u201d refers to the fact that the more data that is processed by Ethereum, the more data lives permanently on its blockchain\u2014and the more intensive maintaining that network\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d becomes.\n\nSeparating the blob gas market from the existing gas market is also a marked improvement. Because blobs have a separate gas market, congestion on Ethereum doesn\u2019t affect them. In the past, if there was a large event on Ethereum such as a highly anticipated NFT mint, the congestion caused by this event would leak onto Layer 2s and make transactions there more expensive as well. Separating blob gas markets from traditional ethereum gas markets removes the correlation between Ethereum network congestion and Layer 2 transaction costs and speed.\n\nBlobs also make Layer 2s much more profitable. Before blobs, when gas fees on them correlated with Ethereum network congestion, the cost of operation for Layer 2s, and the Dapps built on top of them, were much higher. Lowering transaction fees make it so that builders and operators are able to run complex smart contracts or products at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlobs at work\n\nLooking at onchain data from rollup.wtf, we can see that the majority of Layer 2s with the highest transactions per second are already using blobs.\n\nIn a tweet, Jesse Pollak, founder of Layer 2 network Base, revealed that after Dencun, the cost of a simple swap transaction on Base dropped from $0.31 to $0.0005.\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nHowever, it hasn't been all sunshine and rainblobs. Blobs have been slower than anticipated when it comes to actually posting transactions to Layer 1. Creating a new gas market for blobs succeeded in decoupling Ethereum congestion from rollup transaction costs, but the gas market itself needs some fine-tuning before it\u2019s everything it\u2019s been hyped up to be.\n\nIn one example in June 2024, blob transactions became more expensive than their predecessor\u2013 but that can be seen as a sign that blob adoption is still in progress, and hopefully, as L2\u2019s become more efficient at using blobs, more block builders start accepting blocks that include blobs, and blob capacity increases\u2014 the costs will go down.\n\nVitalik Buterin addressed both of these issues in a March 2023 blog post published shortly after Dencun\u2019s release. In it, Buterin cites two core areas of focus that are needed to continue scaling blobs: \u201cProgressively increasing blob capacity, eventually bringing to life the full vision of data availability sample with 16MB per slot of data space,\u201d and \u201cImproving L2s to make better use of the data space that we have.\u201d\n\nSo while blobs have seen some growing pains, they were for the most part anticipated, and solutions are underway."

During the same time, Ethereum eclipsed Bitcoin, thanks to final approvals for token-focused funds. Ethereum has grown by 51% since the beginning of the year, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 45% increase.\n\nAt the time of this writing, SOL is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, having a bullish year till now. Currently, SOL is trading at $145.6, and a year ago it was trading at $20, and at its peak in 2024, it was $200.\n\nSolana Chart\n\nBitcoin\u2019s initial run this year, aided by the launch of the first U.S. spot ETFs in January, saw it hit a new high of $73,798 by March. However, demand and price have subsequently slowed, and Bitcoin\u2019s performance is being overshadowed by increased interest in Ethereum and Solana.\n\nETF excitement is responsible for Solana\u2019s recent rise, especially when exchange-traded fund company VanEck applied for a cryptocurrency-based product.\n\nThe SOL token experienced its largest spike since late May after VanEck filed the necessary paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the new Solana ETF. The boost reached as high as 11%.\n\nThe VanEck Solana Trust is the company\u2019s newest product and the first Solana ETF to be registered in the US. This submission comes after spot Ether (ETH) ETFs were approved by the SEC for the United States on May 23, 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum price has held relatively well in the past few days as the odds of spot ETF approvals rose. ETH token was trading at $3,455 on Friday, a few points above this week\u2019s low of $3,233. It remains in a correction zone after falling by 13% from its highest point this month.\n\nThe main catalyst for Ethereum is the anticipated spot Ethereum ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As we reported on Thursday, there is a rising possibility that spot Ethereum ETFs will start trading soon.\n\nThe rising anticipation happened after VanEck filed form 8-A, which is an important document in the ETF application process. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg believes that these funds will start trading on July 2nd.\n\nVanEck just filed 8-A form for spot Eth, which is just part of process, but.. should be noted that they filed their 8-A for spot bitcoin exactly 7 days before launch. Good sign for our July 2nd over/under (7 days from now). But again, anything poss. Sure we'll hear more soon.. https://t.co/2BlkDnWhrz \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 25, 2024\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would be a big deal. As we saw with Bitcoin, there is a strong demand for cryptocurrencies from institutional investors.\n\nSimilarly, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has a management fee of 2.50%, has over $10 billion in assets. As such, lower-priced funds will likely see heavy demand from retail and institutional investors.\n\nEthereum ETFs will also start trading at a time when balances in exchanges continue dropping, as shown below.\n\nEthereum reserves in exchanges\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem is still doing well even as the crypto sell-off continued. The network has over $108.95 billion in total value locked (TVL) and almost $80 billion in stablecoins. It has collected fees worth $1.65 billion, higher than Tron\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s combined.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Ethereum price\n\nSome of the top crypto analysts believe that Ethereum is on the cusp of a bullish breakout. In an X thread, Rekt Finance noted that Ethereum\u2019s open interest in the futures market was rising, which is a sign of institutional demand ahead of the ETF approval.\n\nHe also noted that Ether was a deflationary asset that has constantly been reducing its supply over time. Altogether, he expects that ETH will jump after the ETF approval, then move to a consolidation or pullback as many Grayscale Ethereum Fund holders move to cheaper options, and then it will resume its bullish trend.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \"ETH IS GOING TO ZERO\" \u2013 that's what everyone's saying.\n\n\n\nBut I'll prove them wrong.\n\n\n\nI dug into the data and what I found was shocking.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5: When & why $ETH is heading to $10K (+ trigger altseason) \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/nnlUDJlbNz \u2014 Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) June 25, 2024\n\nIn another Tweet, Crypto Rover, who has over 700k followers, noted that Ethereum had formed a descending channel that resembles a falling wedge pattern. In most cases, this is one of the bullish patterns that supports upside potential. He expects that the breakout could happen soon."

NFTs can be an excellent way to develop a brand and improve its awareness and popularity.\n\nStep-by-Step Process of NFT Creation\n\nThe first, and arguably the hardest, step is considering what you want to create. You might be a music creator who just completed an amazing song. Or you made an animated video or used AI to design a unique picture.\n\nThe important thing is that the NFT is unique \u2014 that\u2019s where its value lies. And it\u2019s worth noting that you need to be certain you are the rightful owner. Otherwise, you could end up having legal issues regarding the asset ownership.\n\nOnce you are ready to create an NFT on Ethereum, here is how to complete the process.\n\n1. Set Up an Ethereum Wallet\n\nEthereum is the favorite destination for NFT creation. Azuki, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Pudgy Penguins are some examples of popular tokens. According to statistics, Ethereum NFTs often reach a six-figure value during sales.\n\nYour first step is to get an NFT wallet. While there\u2019s a huge range of wallets supporting Ethereum, here are your best options:\n\nMetaMask . It offers NFT smart contract support and is compatible with Ethereum and other blockchains. MetaMask is an excellent option for effortlessly storing and managing your NFTs and crypto coins. You can use it via a web browser and on your mobile devices.\n\n.

You can use it via a web browser and on your mobile devices. Enjin . If you need a non-custodial wallet that gives total NFT control, Enjin is a good pick. You can use it on the go with a free mobile app.\n\n. If you need a non-custodial wallet that gives total NFT control, Enjin is a good pick. You can use it on the go with a free mobile app. Alpha Wallet. The developers created the wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFT collection is impressive, and the product offers complete control with the non-custodial feature.\n\nHead to the chosen platform to download and set up a crypto wallet.\n\n2. Purchase Ethereum (ETH)\n\nYou will need some Ethereum in your wallet because the network requires gas fees for transactions. The actual charges depend on the moment your listing is published. It should be easy to acquire some ETH coins since most exchanges support this altcoin. It\u2019s possible to purchase it with fiat currencies or trade cryptos already stored in your wallet for ETH. You can use this ETH calculator to learn more about the asset value and potential.\n\n3. Choose an NFT Marketplace\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nWe suggest picking a popular marketplace with generous existing NFT collections. The reason is that these platforms attract more users, indicating a better chance to sell your token. Some popular options include the following:\n\nOpenSea . The platform has an excellent reputation among traders. You can find art, gaming, photography, music, and other NFTs. They are well-sorted into different categories, and there are helpful sections like current top buys and trending lists.\n\n. The platform has an excellent reputation among traders.

It\u2019s a decentralized exchange that supports NFT creation on different blockchains. If you are a crypto trader, you might have had previous experience with OKX, which means you\u2019ll be familiar with the interface when creating NFTs.\n\n. It\u2019s a decentralized exchange that supports NFT creation on different blockchains. If you are a crypto trader, you might have had previous experience with OKX, which means you\u2019ll be familiar with the interface when creating NFTs. Rarible. Rarible is a user-friendly marketplace where you can create and sell non-fungible tokens. It has a list of the latest drops in a visible position, so you\u2019ll get some attention from potential buyers right away.\n\n4. Create Your Digital Asset\n\nThe actual steps might vary slightly depending on the chosen marketplace. You begin by connecting the wallet to the platform. After opening the registration page, the platform will ask for your wallet details. It will be necessary to verify your wallet before continuing.\n\nMake a final decision regarding your digital content. Get everything ready, whether it\u2019s a single item or an NFT collection.\n\n5. Mint Your NFT\n\nThe next step of the process is to create a smart contract, which actually means generating your NFT collection. Begin by adding the media to the website. Now, pick the token symbol and use the wallet to sign the contract.\n\nWe suggest double-checking everything and adding as many details as possible. For example, some marketplaces allow inserting an external link with more info about the NFT. In the description field, write some catchy lines to capture the potential buyer\u2019s attention.\n\n6. List Your NFT for Sale\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe non-fungible token should now be in your wallet. Click a \u201csell\u201d button next to it, and you\u2019ll have the option to pick the token\u2019s price. The sale can be time-limited, so set the desired duration.\n\nIf everything is ready, you can proceed to publish the listing. Your wallet will be used to sign several transactions. Some chains and marketplaces charge listing fees, but these are usually affordable. You can check Bitcoin NFTs if you\u2019d like to explore non-fungible tokens on this blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe most important part of NFT creation is devising a unique and attractive idea of the digital content that the token will represent. If you have a unique item, creating an NFT shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes. Once you have a wallet ready, pick an Ethereum NFT marketplace and sign up to make your first collection.\n\nAfter listing the NFT for sale, consider advertising it on social networks or promoting it in another way you see fit. That will increase the chance of the token getting sold, as well as the fee you receive."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nDespite the depressing performance Ethereum has been showing us lately, the potential behind it is greater than it may seem. The Glassnode analyst believes we have not yet seen everything Ethereum has to offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comparable trend that emerged in the early months of 2021 can be seen if we examine Ethereum's past. The current market structure is consistent with this historical pattern, indicating that Ethereum may have a price target of about $7,500. Based on the current structures and 161.8 Fibonacci extension level, the projection has been made by the analyst.\n\nETH to ~7500 USD as a Final Top?\n\n\n\nIf we look to ETH history, we observe how we in early 2021 had similar pattern for ETH developing. See YELLOW MARKINGS!\n\n\n\nWe believe Market moves in structures. And this structure gives us a target at ~7500 as a Final High for #ETH.\n\nThat is the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FID62C9uyt \u2014 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0 (@Negentropic_) June 27, 2024\n\nA similar Fibonacci extension level signaled a notable rally and large price gains in 2021. According to the analyst, the market moves in predictable patterns, and the current pattern indicates that ETH's high will occur at $7,500. Additionally, the chart shows a bull flag pattern, which traditionally denotes the continuation of a bullish trend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum might be ready for a big increase in the near future if this pattern continues. Additionally, there is a surge in interest and investment on the larger cryptocurrency market. This situation, along with Ethereum's impending updates and growing institutional traction, may create the ideal conditions for a robust rally.\n\nIn order to reach this goal, Ethereum must overcome multiple obstacles. The $4,000 threshold, which corresponds to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the previous cycle, is the first significant obstacle. Achieving this level would confirm the bullish structure and open the door to higher objectives.\n\nAs for potential catalysts and the overall sentiment on the market, we are currently seeing a recovery after the most recent plunge, witnessed a few days ago, when Bitcoin plummeted below the $60,000 level. The best fuel for Ethereum and the market in general would be the approval of the Ethereum ETF and some technological advancements, similar to those we have seen from Solana."

        "content": "Bitcoin price faces pullback resistance at the lower band of the descending wedge around $62,000.\n\nEthereum price finds support at $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) encounters resistance near the $62,000 mark, while Ripple (XRP) mirrors BTC's challenge around the $0.500 level. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) finds solid support around the critical price point of $3,288.\n\nBTC faces resistance at the lower band of the descending wedge\n\nBitcoin's price broke below the descending wedge on Monday, declining approximately 7.5% to retest its crucial weekly support near $58,375 and rebounded by 5.8% on Tuesday.\n\nSince Tuesday, BTC has faced resistance at the lower boundary of the broken descending wedge. At the time of writing, it trades around $61,704 on Friday.\n\nIf the lower boundary of the descending wedge around $62,000 holds as resistance, BTC could decline roughly 5% to reach its weekly support near $58,375.\n\nOn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are below their respective neutral levels of 50 and zero. This indicates that, according to these momentum indicators, the bearish sentiment prevails, suggesting the potential for further decline in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC closes above the $63,956 level and forms a higher high in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bullish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 5% rise in Bitcoin's price, revisiting its next weekly resistance at $67,147.\n\nEthereum price looks promising\n\nEthereum price retested its support level of $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from a swing low of $2,862 on May 14 to a swing high point of $3,977 on May 27. ETH rebounded by 5% from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and trades at around $3,457, edging up approximately 0.3% on Friday.\n\nIf this support at $3,288 holds, ETH price could rally 8% from its current trading level of $3,457 to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are both below their neutral level of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,288 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price shows resilience\n\nRipple's price currently trades at $0.476, below the daily resistance level of $0.499. Despite Monday's fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price, XRP has shown resilience in its price action.\n\nIf Ripple's price surpasses the barrier at $0.499, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nIn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 mark, indicating neutral to bearish sentiment, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains below zero, suggesting bearish momentum. Both indicators must rise above their critical thresholds of 50 for RSI and zero for AO for a sustained bullish trend. Such a development would bolster the ongoing recovery rally in the market.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if the Ripple price daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, it would invalidate the bullish outlook by establishing a lower daily low. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

Following the submission of eight S-1 amendment filings, this swap of funds has emerged, portraying optimism for ETH\u2019s future price movements. Meanwhile, it\u2019s worth noting that Pepe coin has also recently emerged as the talk of the crypto town, surging to unprecedented levels.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the whale\u2019s strategic investments and what it could mean for future market performances.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Diverts Funds To ETH\n\nAccording to data revealed by EmberCN on June 28, the whale 0x837 has been recorded switching 1.4 trillion PEPE to 2,646 ETH.\n\nThe trader transferred 1.4 trillion PEPE, worth $18.01 million, to Binance. Subsequently, a withdrawal of $9.04 million worth of ETH took place from the same exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these accumulations happened at an average price of $3,416. Also, market sentiments have tilted towards optimistic for Ethereum, primarily with the whale\u2019s massive accumulation.\n\nThe whale activity also comes in light of recent optimism on the ETH ETF. As mentioned above, eight firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, iShares, and Invesco, have submitted S-1 amendment filings.\n\nNate Geraci, ETFstore President, further took the stage to claim that the ETH ETF launch is imminent, expected to be in 2-3 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH & PEPE prices experienced considerable gains today.\n\nAlso Read: AVAX Price Rally To Surpass Solana Price Surge: Santiment\n\nETH & PEPE Price Performance\n\nWhile writing, PEPE\u2019s price showed a 1.39% upswing to trade at $0.00001244.

Over the last 12 months, the token has increased by more than 770% according to CoinMarketCap, despite its recent dip to the $141 level.\n\nAlternatively, Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown 100% and 82% in the same time frame, respectively. The development has firmly established SOL alongside both BTC and ETH as the top three cryptocurrencies in the market. That fact has led two firms to file for Spot Solana ETFs this week alone.\n\nSource: Bitcoin.com\n\nAlso Read: Solana June End Prediction: Solana Blinks To Help SOL Cross $180?\n\nSOL Beats Both Bitcoin and Ethereum in Yearly Gains So Far\n\nThroughout 2024 thus far, the US has approved two crypto-based ETFs.
