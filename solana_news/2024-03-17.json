        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit a New All-Time-High of $5,000 by the End of 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum has two solid catalysts in place for 2024, but will they both deliver as planned?\n\nNow that Bitcoin (BTC 0.30%) has hit a new all-time-high, could Ethereum (ETH -0.08%) be next?\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at just under $4,000, within striking distance of its all-time-high of $4,891.70. Given that Ethereum is already up about 70% for the year, it wouldn't seem to require much for Ethereum to rise another 25% before the end of 2024.\n\nAnd indeed, there are two potentially major catalysts in place this year. If Ethereum is going to soar to an all-time-high of $5,000, it's likely that both of these are going to be needed. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNew tech upgrade\n\nThe first major catalyst is a brand-new tech upgrade (Dencun). It is the biggest change to the Ethereum blockchain since The Merge, which took place nearly 18 months ago. So understandably, analysts are getting excited about what this new upgrade might mean for Ethereum's growth prospects.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has two major goals: to improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain (which can still suffer from congestion and slow throughput times), and to lower the costs of transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. If Dencun can deliver on both, it would help to cement Ethereum's role as the preeminent smart contract platform in the world. Even better, Dencun is setting the stage for Ethereum's next upgrades, all of which have been carefully laid out by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in the blockchain's latest annual roadmap.\n\nSo far so good, right? You have a tech upgrade promising major performance enhancements, and you also have a roadmap for future growth. But not so fast. A number of blockchain analysts are taking issue with the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAs they see it, Dencun is not a long-term fix because it relies too much on third parties (known as Layer 2 scaling solutions) to make all the performance enhancements work. In a worst-case scenario, reliance on these Layer 2 scaling solutions could lead to all kinds of interoperability issues, fragmentation within the Ethereum ecosystem, and a loss of cohesion among Ethereum developers.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe second big catalyst is the potential launch of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as early as May. Given all the enthusiasm and excitement around the spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's easy to see why a new spot ETF investment product could send Ethereum soaring.\n\nAs in the case of Bitcoin, it would become remarkably easy for any investor to buy Ethereum. If these investors decide to allocate even 1% of their portfolios to Ethereum, that could send the crypto soaring.\n\nThe only problem, from my perspective, is that analysts seem to be vastly overstating how easy this process is going to be. As they see it, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already bought into the idea of spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies, and thus, new approvals are going to be coming on a regular basis from here on out.\n\nBut what they fail to take into account is that the spot Bitcoin ETF process took years to achieve, and only after very specific milestones had been met. Even up until final approval in January, there were serious doubts about the SEC finally approving them.\n\nAnd we're starting to see the same thing with the spot Ethereum ETFs now. The probability of an SEC approval taking place in May has recently been lowered from 70% to 30%, according to a top Bloomberg analyst.\n\nThat's because the SEC has maintained what can only be described as radio silence ever since the spot Ethereum ETF applications were filed. There has been no outreach to the investment firms trying to bring them to market, and no indication that regulators are now ready to sign off on other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.\n\nIs the glass half-full or half-empty?\n\nIf you're an optimist and see the glass as half-full, the new Ethereum tech upgrade in 2024 is worthy of the same type of acclaim as The Merge was back in 2022. You probably also think that a fresh batch of spot Ethereum ETFs are on their way before the start of summer.\n\nHowever, if you're a skeptic and see the glass as half-empty, the new Dencun upgrade is at best a temporary fix for problems that have been plaguing Ethereum for years: high transaction fees and slower transaction processing speeds compared to many other blockchains. Moreover, you're probably also thinking the SEC will take its time with the spot Ethereum ETF approvals, much as it did with the Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nMy concern right now is that the optimistic scenario has already been baked into the price of Ethereum. How else to explain the fact that Ethereum is up just as much as Bitcoin this year?\n\nThus, if either of these two catalysts fail to deliver as expected, we could see a pullback in the price of Ethereum. For that reason, I'm taking a wait-and-see approach with Ethereum right now."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s CREATE2: A Double-Edged Sword in Blockchain Security - Check Point Research",
        "content": "By Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, Roman Zaikin\n\nEthereum\u2019s CREATE2 function is being exploited by attackers to compromise the security of digital wallets, bypassing traditional security measures and facilitating unauthorized access to funds.\n\nThe attack method involves tricking users into approving transactions for smart contracts that haven\u2019t been deployed yet, allowing cybercriminals to later deploy malicious contracts and steal cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the need for enhanced security measures in wallet security products to adapt to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets in the face of innovative exploits.\n\nIn the digital realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, Ethereum stands out as a platform of innovation and versatility. Its capacity for adaptation and development makes it a critical player in the tech space. However, the very features that make Ethereum remarkable also expose it to potential vulnerabilities. One such feature is the CREATE2 function, which, while showcasing Ethereum\u2019s advanced technological capabilities, has unfortunately also opened the door to new security threats against digital wallets.\n\nThe Intricacies of CREATE2\n\nIntroduced in Ethereum\u2019s Constantinople upgrade, the CREATE2 function has been hailed for its ability to deploy smart contracts with deterministic addresses even before the creation of the contract\u2019s bytecode. This function significantly enhances the predictability and efficiency of smart contract interactions, offering a boon for the complex ecosystems of decentralized applications (dApps). It allows for the pre-orchestration of interactions between multiple contracts, a feature critical for the seamless operation of dApps.\n\nThe Security Concern\n\nHowever, the innovative CREATE2 function also presents a significant security loophole. Cybercriminals have quickly leveraged this function to bypass conventional wallet security measures, creating a new method for exploiting unsuspecting victims. The core of the vulnerability lies in CREATE2\u2019s ability to deploy a smart contract at a known address in the future, enabling attackers to deceive users into approving transactions with a contract that doesn\u2019t yet exist. Once the user grants approval, the attacker can deploy a malicious contract to that address, hijacking the transaction and draining the victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nA Closer Look at the Attack Mechanism\n\n1. The attacker begins by convincing the victim to approve or increase the allowance for a yet-to-be-deployed contract.\n\n2. Since the contract hasn\u2019t been deployed at the time of approval, it evades detection by security solutions, which cannot identify potential threats in non-existent contracts.\n\n3. After securing the victim\u2019s authorization, the attacker deploys the malicious contract, exploiting the victim\u2019s funds.\n\nThis method not only underlines the creative misuse of Ethereum\u2019s features by malicious entities but also highlights a critical challenge for security products. Most security solutions are calibrated to analyze and validate transactions based on existing contracts and known behaviors. CREATE2, by facilitating interactions with future contracts, effectively bypasses these security frameworks, leaving digital assets at risk.\n\nThe Technical Side of CREATE2\n\nDelving into the technical aspects, CREATE and CREATE2 are both opcodes in Ethereum blockchain development that support the deployment of smart contracts. They differ primarily in how the address of the new contract is determined. While CREATE bases the contract\u2019s address on the creator\u2019s address and a nonce, CREATE2 allows for a more flexible approach by incorporating a user-specified salt, the creator\u2019s address, and the contract\u2019s initialization code into the address computation.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum blockchain development, both CREATE and CREATE2 are opcodes that facilitate the deployment of smart contracts, but they differ in how the address of the new contract is determined.\n\nThe CREATE opcode generates the address of the new contract based on the address of the creator (the sender of the transaction) and the nonce. On the other hand, CREATE2 offers a more flexible approach by allowing the contract\u2019s address to be determined based on a user-specified salt, the creator\u2019s address, and the contract\u2019s initialization code.\n\nThe address of the contract in CREATE2 is computed by using 4 parameters:\n\nkeccak256(0xff + sender_address + salt + keccak256(initialization_code))\n\nConstant prefix \u2013 A fixed prefix that is part of the hashing process, which is 0xff. This is used to differentiate CREATE2 addresses from those created with the CREATE opcode. Sender\u2019s Address \u2013 The address of the account creating the contract, typically a smart contract itself when using CREATE2. Salt \u2013 A 32-byte (256-bit) value chosen by the creator. The salt allows the creator to deploy multiple contracts with the same initialization code to different addresses. Initialization Code \u2013 The bytecode of the contract being created. This includes the bytecode that results from compiling the smart contract source code, along with any constructor arguments encoded into it.\n\nTo demonstrate how CREATE2 can deploy another contract with a deterministically computed address, we will use the below simple example that includes two Solidity contracts: Factory and Child. The Factory contract uses the CREATE2 function to deploy the Child contract to a specific precomputed address.\n\nBy deploying the Factory contract to the testnet and using 123456 as a salt, we will be able to precompute the child contract address:\n\nFactory Contract Address is (https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb74025567acdc922507821516014dc5fe659483f):\n\nNow by using computeChildAddress function, we will be able to precompute the child address which is\n\n0xe41Ba18D5e667b0B391b33b848520FA6F041C092:\n\nThis address does not exist yet because we didn\u2019t deploy the contract:\n\nNext, the attacker will try to trick the victim into approving this contract as a spender for a specific token he wants to steal, and because the contract has not been created yet, this transaction evades all forms of wallet security measures the victim possesses, which rely on the historical record of the contract address.\n\nAfter the attacker tricks the user to sign the approval request, he will be able to deploy the contract by using the same salt 123456 in the function deployChild:\n\nAn Example from the Wild\n\nA stark illustration of this vulnerability in action involved a user losing $3.5 million due to such an exploit. The victim approved a transaction for a contract that hadn\u2019t been created yet. The contract was deployed shortly after the approval, and the attacker executed a function to transfer the victim\u2019s funds to their own address.\n\nAt the time of the transaction, the contract a01dee645e4dbaaa8aa2089cc4b1cc34d36fa71c which is approved for the allowance had not been created yet:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xb5f03259859c10243a85f7a9ca27d8b45e67ce6463800193634d27718ba162a0\n\nThis transaction executes an unverified function that performs various checks and then creates the approved contract address by using CREATE2 as we demonstrated before:\n\nTarget \u2013 Which is, in this case, SUPER token\n\ncallData \u2013 This is the bytedata of the function the attacker wants to perform.\n\nin this situation, the attacker performs the transferFrom function and uses the allowance from before to transfer the balance from the victim to the following address 0x8f9278aab84290fe6e78515b7938b3136b89a1e2:\n\nSecuring the Digital Frontier\n\nThe exploitation of the CREATE2 function underscores the ongoing battle between innovation and security in the blockchain space. As Ethereum continues to evolve, so too must the security mechanisms designed to protect users from such sophisticated attacks. Awareness and education are the first steps in safeguarding digital assets against emerging threats. Blockchain developers and users alike must remain vigilant, continuously updating their knowledge and security practices to navigate this ever-changing landscape securely.\n\nThe Threat Intel Blockchain system, developed by Check Point, continues to accumulate valuable information on emerging threats, and this intelligence will be shared in the future. In this collaborative effort, we aim to empower investors with the knowledge needed to navigate the crypto space securely and protect themselves from potential pitfalls.

        "content": "Solana Surpasses Ethereum in User Activity Amidst Surge in Memecoins like \u2018Book of Meme\u2019\n\nThe Solana network experienced a surge in activity over the weekend, surpassing Ethereum in total trading volume. However, the network struggled to keep up with the influx, leading to frequent transaction failures and delays.\n\nSolana's 24 hour trading volume reached nearly $3 billion on March 17, beating out Ethereum's daily volume of $2.04 billion. The network also reached a new record of $3.79 billion in trading volume on March 15. The surge in activity was driven by a speculative frenzy for new Solana-based memecoins. Book of Meme (BOME) rallied from near-zero to a market capitalization of $1.45 billion in just 56 hours.\n\nThe surge in trading activity overwhelmed the Solana network, causing ping times to spike and transaction failures to increase. According to data from Solana Validator, Solana's ping time ran as high as 46 seconds on March 18, resulting in approximately 30-40% of transactions failing.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped the price of Solana (SOL) rallying to $203, up 8.69% over the past 24 hours and 45% in the last week alone. Solana's market capitalization also reached a new all-time high of $89.3 billion, overtaking BNB (BNB) to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap."

        "content": "New demand for Ethereum now sits at a year-to-date high.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors, however, witnessed declines in the past week.\n\nThe daily count of new addresses on Ethereum [ETH] assessed on a seven-day moving average reached a year-to-date (YTD) high of 116,000 on 14th March, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nThis marked a 35% increase from the 86,000 unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction of the native coin in the network on 1st January.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rally in new demand to a YTD high came amidst a surge in its on-chain volume. AMBCrypto found that transaction volume on the network, also assessed using a seven-day moving average, attained a YTD high of $7 billion on 11th March.\n\nAs transaction volume rallied, the average fee paid per transaction on the network also climbed. According to The Block\u2019s data, this reached a YTD high of $25 on 11th March.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT sector fails to react\n\nDespite the recent uptick in demand for the Ethereum network, its decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token ecosystems have witnessed declines.\n\nFor example, the total value of assets locked (TVL) across the DeFi protocols housed within the chain declined by 5% in the last week. Per DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $53.4 billion.\n\nOut of the top 10 DeFi protocols on Ethereum, only one (ether.Fi) recorded a TVL hike in the past seven days. The rest of them witnessed a decline.\n\nThe network\u2019s NFT sector recorded a 21% decrease in sales volume in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, despite the 90% uptick in the number of traders trading NFTs on the network during that period, the transaction count fell by 2%.\n\nIn the last seven days, 166,000 NFT transactions worth $130 million were completed on the Ethereum network.\n\nLook before you leap\n\nThe network\u2019s native coin ETH sold for $3,721 at press time. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value dropped by 6% in the last week. The decline followed a sharp fall in Bitcoin\u2019s value on 14th March, when its value was below $68,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that its Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator has posted red upward-facing histogram bars since 11th March.\n\nAn asset\u2019s AO measures market trends and changes in momentum. When it displays red upward-facing bars, it suggests increasing negative momentum in the market. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or entering short positions."

        "content": "The price activity of Ethereum is reducing the supply of the crypto to the lowest levels recorded since August 2022. Furthermore, the decline in ether supply has marked its fastest decrease since May 2023.\n\nAt the same time, several on-chain metrics are approaching or even reaching new twelve-month highs. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe rapid decline in Ethereum supply and price trends\n\nAs we know, the latest Dencun update of Ethereum was implemented on March 13th.\n\nHowever, it was the previous major update that significantly impacted the total availability of ether.\n\nMid last week, the total amount of ether dropped to the lowest level recorded since August 2022, as indicated by data provided by CryptoQuant and reported by CNBC.\n\nIt is precisely during that period that Ethereum introduced its most significant upgrade to date, moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, known as The Merge.\n\nFurthermore, the rate of decrease in the supply of ether is currently the fastest since the beginning of May 2023.\n\nIn the recent 30 days, the supply of ether has decreased at an annual rate of 0.872%, according to data from ultrasound.money. For comparison, since the Merge itself, the rate of decrease has been 0.246%.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted that the high activity on the Ethereum network has led to high transaction costs and, consequently, to a greater amount of ether being burned.\n\nIn concrete terms, over 1.56 million ether have been burned by the Merge, while less than 1.12 million ether have been issued.\n\nThis has caused a sharp decrease of over 446,000 ether, equivalent to almost 1.62 billion dollars at current prices.\n\nActivity record and on-chain transparency\n\nAlthough the focus is mainly on activity on the Solana network, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to show distinctive signs of vitality.\n\nA seven-day moving average of transactions on Ethereum is approaching its annual peak recorded in January, with 1.26 million transactions recorded just yesterday, according to recent data.\n\nJulio Moreno highlighted that \u201ctotal daily transactions are at record levels, not seen since May 2023\u201d, pointing out an increase in network fees, an increase in burned fees, and a reduction in the total supply of ether.\n\nAt the same time, the number of active addresses on Ethereum is at its highest since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with approximately 540,000 active addresses registered just yesterday.\n\nFurthermore, the number of new addresses on the Ethereum network is also at its highest since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with more than 120,000 new Ethereum addresses.\n\nFinally, the on-chain volume of Ethereum has reached new highs since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with over $7 billion in volume recorded just yesterday, according to data from The Block.\n\nBearish correction for Ethereum: potential recovery towards $4,000?\n\nThe price of Ethereum has started a correction lower below $3,650, but is currently attempting a decent recovery wave in the short term.\n\nThe correction of Ethereum has crossed the levels of $3,800 and $3,700, following Bitcoin, and then dropped below the key support at $3,650, entering a temporary bearish phase.\n\nThe price has even exceeded the critical threshold of $3,500, touching a minimum of 3,414 dollars, but now shows signs of recovery. Ether has recovered above 3,500 dollars and the Fibonacci retracement of 23.6% from its high to low.\n\nCurrently, the price of Ethereum is below $3,700 and the 100-hour simple moving average, with immediate resistance around $3,650 and a clear downtrend line at $3,660.\n\nFuture prospects indicate a possible recovery towards $3,750 or a 50% Fibonacci retracement at $3,830, beyond which it could gain momentum towards $3,925 and, eventually, $4,000."

        "title": "Bitcoin Rebounds But Concerns Mount as Ethereum\u2019s Perpetual Funding Turns Negative - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Over the past weekend, the crypto market experienced a tumultuous blend of emotions, characterized by fear and greed, as Bitcoin plunged to lows of 64,500. However, it swiftly rebounded, with the leading asset surging back above the 67,000 mark.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has exhibited significant resilience, the same cannot be said for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rocky Road Amidst Bitcoin\u2019s Resilience\n\nThe heavy selling of BTC put options indicated a dissipation of fear among investors, who seemed eager to capitalize on the dip.\n\nInterestingly, amidst this sentiment shift, there\u2019s a notable inclination towards greed, evidenced by the increasing interest in long-dated Sep and Dec BTC calls targeting lofty price levels of $100-150k. According to the latest analysis by QCP Capital, this optimism reflects a bullish outlook despite recent volatility.\n\nThe Singapore-based digital assets trading firm said Ethereum presents a contrasting narrative as concerns loom as perpetual funding rates turn negative and risk reversals portray a \u201cdownside skew,\u201d signaling apprehension within the market about a potential downturn in the crypto asset\u2019s price despite the continuing rally in alts.\n\nDespite Ethereum reaching a peak of over $4,000, its highest value in two 3years, QCP previously observed a change in market sentiment, evident in the negative risk reversals. These reversals indicate the contrast in implied volatility between call and put options, a shift likely attributed to the decreased chances of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US in the near future.\n\nFollowing the long-awaited Dencun upgrade, which QCP had anticipated, the crypto asset saw a decline to under $3,500 over the weekend amid a market-wide slump.\n\nIs Ether Overvalued?\n\nA different analysis by CryptoQuant revealed that ETH\u2019s total supply is diminishing as a result of heightened network activity and the utilization of transaction fees for burning. The subsequent uptick in staking participation was also observed, with over 31 million ETH staked, indicating growing confidence in the asset\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nIts network also witnessed a notable surge in activity, characterized by increased daily transaction volumes and ETH transfers. However, the current elevated MVRV Ratio implied that ETH might be overvalued.\n\n\u201cThe current high MVRV Ratio suggests that ETH might be overvalued, which calls for a cautiously optimistic approach. Despite these challenges, the Dencun upgrade reinforces Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals. Yet, the market\u2019s recent preference for SOL over ETH signals that we might see some adjustments ahead.\u201d"
