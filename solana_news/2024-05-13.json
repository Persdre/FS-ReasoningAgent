        "title": "Two Reasons Why Ethereum ($ETH) Is Underperforming Bitcoin ($BTC) As an Asset - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has long faced issues with scalability, particularly during high activity periods that lead to network congestion, slow transaction times, and high gas fees. These challenges affect user experience and limit the network\u2019s capacity to support a diverse range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, introduced in March 2024, represents a significant advancement towards resolving these issues by laying the groundwork for future scalability improvements.\n\nDencun, which combines elements from the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, does not provide an immediate solution to all scalability problems. However, it is a crucial milestone in Ethereum\u2019s development. Central to the Dencun upgrade is the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which sets the stage for future sharding implementations. Sharding involves partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This parallel processing is expected to substantially increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput in the future. While Dencun does not implement sharding directly, it establishes the necessary technical foundation for its eventual deployment.\n\nThe primary focus of Dencun is not directly reducing transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead, it aims to optimize fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions function on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aggregating transactions off-chain before submitting them back to the mainnet. This process helps mitigate congestion on the main network and can potentially lower fees for users.\n\nA significant feature of Dencun is EIP-4844, which lowers the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. This improvement is expected to enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions, potentially reducing fees for their users. However, the actual fee reductions observed may not be as substantial as initially projected, and the long-term effects on fees will need further monitoring.\n\nOne unintended consequence of the Dencun upgrade has been its impact on the Ethereum supply. The reduction in transaction fees led to a decrease in the amount of ETH burned. Previously, higher network activity and fees resulted in more ETH being burned, contributing to a deflationary effect on its total supply. Following the Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this deflationary mechanism was an anticipated benefit. However, with fewer fees being burned and the natural increase in supply, the total supply of ETH has started to grow at a faster rate, shifting back towards an inflationary model.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum\u2019s progression towards becoming an \u201cultra sound money\u201d \u2013 a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.\n\nSee our full analysis \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/6KYAcn0KQ8 \u2014 Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) May 13, 2024\n\nThe other problem for Ethereum is that once the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, many people thought that probably within a few months, the SEC would start approving some, if not all, of the several pending spot Ethereum ETF proposals. Unfortunately, with the SEC\u2019s recent crackdown against the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. Uniswap receiving a Wells notice last month), it seems that SEC Chair Gary Gensler sees Ether (ETH) as a security (which is what Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin suspects) and therefore the expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved in the U.S. sometime in 2024 have been dramatically lowered. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do not see an approval until 2025.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the U.S. SEC may reject Ethereum spot ETF on May 23, and approval may not be until the end of 2025. If Trump wins, the SEC will likely face a change in leadership that may be friendlier than Gary Gensler's.

        "title": "Is Ethereum Still a Millionaire-Maker Crypto? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, focus on future growth potential, not historical track record.\n\nSince its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH 0.10%) has skyrocketed in price from just $0.31 to $3,000 today. That's a nearly 10,000-fold return on your investment! If you had invested just a few hundred dollars in Ethereum a decade ago, you'd likely be a millionaire today.\n\nBut does Ethereum still have the power to make you a millionaire? While it's hard to argue with Ethereum's historical track record, things get a bit dicier when you consider its future prospects.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nWhen Ethereum launched back in 2015, it stood alone as the only smart contract blockchain platform. And, as such, it had an incredible first-mover advantage. Arguably, it was not until 2020, when blockchain upstart Solana (SOL -1.47%) appeared, that Ethereum saw its first legitimate rival.\n\nTo put that into perspective, imagine if your favorite Silicon Valley tech company had an incredible five-year head start on the competition. After that time period, it would probably appear to have an insurmountable lead when it comes to market share, intellectual property, and customer lock-in. Quite frankly, it would look unstoppable.\n\nThat's why I think Ethereum's ability to replicate its historical track record is limited at best. There's simply too much competition now, and Ethereum is no longer the only major Layer-1 blockchain. Check for yourself -- three of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap are direct Ethereum rivals. That type of competition simply did not exist back in 2015.\n\nIncremental vs. disruptive innovation\n\nMoreover, I've soured a bit on Ethereum's endless blockchain upgrades. Yes, the 2022 blockchain upgrade known as The Merge was impressive. People have compared that technical feat to changing the engine of an airplane while in mid-flight. The Merge resulted in a total transformation of Ethereum. In the process, Ethereum became faster, cheaper to use, and more efficient in processing transactions.\n\nHowever, Ethereum originally promised us 1 million transactions per second, and we're nowhere close to that. Of even more concern, Ethereum now relies on a complicated mix of Layer 2 blockchains for scalability and functionality. The core Ethereum blockchain (i.e., the Layer 1) just isn't fast or efficient enough to handle current transaction volumes. So, we have several more upgrade cycles to go, each filled with new tweaks and upgrades.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with incremental innovation, of course. But there's a big difference between incremental innovation and truly disruptive innovation. And that's what has me concerned about Ethereum -- we may have witnessed the end of disruptive innovation with The Merge. And that's going to open up the door for fast, nimble competitors to challenge Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC and regulatory risk\n\nFinally, there's the pesky little matter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ever since The Merge, the SEC hasn't quite made up its mind about whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security. When Ethereum converted into a proof-of-stake blockchain as part of The Merge, it changed the way that people interact with the blockchain, with possible regulatory consequences.\n\nFor example, the process of staking crypto could be interpreted by some as \"the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\" According to the SEC, that would make Ethereum a security.\n\nThis might sound incredibly wonky from a legal perspective, but it matters for investors. There are some Bitcoin maximalists delighting right now in Ethereum's potential regulatory quandary, and there is a very real risk that the SEC could deem Ethereum to be a security. If that happens, all bets are off. I don't think it would pose an existential risk for Ethereum, but it would certainly scare away a lot of investors.\n\nThe myth of the 1,000x crypto\n\nIf you have $1,000 to invest in crypto today, you would need a 1,000-fold return on your investment to become a millionaire. So, let's reframe the original question of Ethereum being a millionaire-maker crypto in the following way: Can Ethereum increase 1,000 times in value from its current price of $3,000?\n\nThat would suggest a stratospherically high $3 million price tag for a single Ethereum coin sometime in the near future. Given Ethereum's circulating supply of 120 million coins, that would imply a total market cap of $360 trillion! By comparison, the total market cap of the S&P 500 these days is about $50 trillion.\n\nAt the end of the day, investing based only on past performance is like driving a car by only looking in the rearview mirror. So stop focusing so much on Ethereum's historical track record, and focus more on how it's going to create value in the future."

        "title": "Why A Drop In The Price Of Ethereum Will Be Bullish Long Term - Investing Haven",
        "content": "There is a lot of fear for a decline in the Ethereum price. While the expectation of a drop is justified, confirmed by our latest Ethereum outlook research, it would not be a bad thing. Here is why an Ethereum price drop could be very bullish, long term that is.\n\nRelated \u2013 Can Ethereum Hit $100,000? An In-depth Analysis.\n\nThe way to think of financial markets, Ethereum being no exception, is in terms of structures. Particularly, chart structures with areas defined by support and resistance is the most simplified way to approach financial market analysis.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2024 support and resistance\n\nWe highly recommend not getting lost in the wild wild west of social media. Check this, it\u2019s pure noise.\n\nEveryone has an opinion nowadays. Those who are able to collect lots of likes seem to be the smartest in the room. Very often it\u2019s the exact opposite.\n\nIn order to understand the investment opportunity for Ethereum, we do the simplest possible thing, i.e. zoom out and remove all annotations.\n\nBelow is the weekly chart, no trendlines nor annotations.\n\nWhat do you see? How does it compare to the pattern in 2019?\n\nThere is tons of resistance even if ETH would rise to $4400. There is amazing support right above $1750, arguably in the $2200 area.\n\nIn case ETH drops in the coming months, it could be setting a gigantic cup and handle pattern. That\u2019s not bullish, that\u2019s a very bullish pattern!\n\nFrom our ETH predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s Ethereum price forecast for 2024 is based on the bullish cup and handle chart formation. ETH should drop to its 50% Fibonacci level $2,250 in order to be bullish. A drop to $2,250 should offer an epic buy opportunity in 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2025 chart pattern\n\nAs explained above, the $2250 area is a key Fibonacci level.\n\nNow, what follows may be counterintuitive to most, but it\u2019s a reality \u2013 a drop may not feel good, but a drop to specific levels may be very good!\n\nProvided Ethereum respects $2250, on an 8 to 13 day closing basis, it will come with a very bullish outcome in 2025.\n\nA bullish cup and handle formation, which is what we forecast will be the outcome in case of an Ethereum price drop, has the intention to move much higher than resistance. For ETH, we expect a breakout to ATH, with targets well above former highs.\n\nFrom our Ethereum predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s top analyst has a very bullish ETH forecast 2025. If the area $2,050 to $2,300 holds strong on a 3-week closing basis, ETH will resolve higher in 2025. The current long term bullish chart pattern has bullish targets in the $5,000 to $9,000 area provided support is respected.\n\nInvalidation considerations\n\nNow, there is always the possibility of an invalidation. In the case of ETH, what if it continues to rise to $5000 in 2024?\n\nWe don\u2019t see this happening, there is not enough momentum in markets.\n\nMoreover, a rise to $5000 would qualify as a breakout, so the targets in that scenario would be much higher.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rise to $5000, it\u2019s another thing to continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nA rise to $5000 will be confusing for investors and traders alike \u2013 which decision do you take at $5000 in 2024?\n\nHowever, with a cup and handle formation, a rise to $5000 (which we anticipate will occur in 2025) will be very bullish. The take-away: it will continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nWhen does our bullish cup and handle forecast invalidate? If ETH will have risen well above $5000 by Sept of 2024. Unlikely to happen, also not good, long term, if it would happen.\n\n10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OFFER: Go to our anniversary deals >> InvestingHaven.com celebrates 10 years.

        "content": "Expectations for an Ethereum spot ETF has gotten significantly low in the community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market performance continues to lag behind the majority of its peers.\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s SEC is known for playing power games with the cryptocurrency industry, like taking their time to approve any kind of application for crypto products.\n\nThey eased up a bit this year with the approval of eleven spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF, when?\n\nNow, all eyes have turned to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate sibling, Ethereum [ETH]. Applications have been filed quite some time ago for what the community sees as Gensler\u2019s only preferred crypto to have its own spot ETF.\n\nNone has been approved, and the SEC has been noticeably quiet about it all. Just a few days ago, Grayscale withdrew their application for the ETH ETF., and didn\u2019t reveal their reasons for it either.\n\nThe lack of engagement from the SEC with applications from ETF issuers plus Grayscale\u2019s withdrawal have fueled speculation in the community that approval is not on the horizon.\n\nThis sentiment is mirrored in the market, with outflows totaling $14 million last week, according to data by CoinShares.\n\nFurthermore, ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, removing plans to engage in staking.\n\nIn the latest filing, submitted on Friday, the previous clause that allowed 21Shares to stake a portion of the fund\u2019s assets through third-party providers was omitted.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that this update could be an attempt to refine the application based on possible feedback from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/\n\nHowever, there have been no official statements.\n\nBalchunas also proposed that this amendment might be a strategy to minimize the details the SEC could use to potentially deny the application.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market movements\n\nTurning our attention to Ethereum\u2019s market, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world is not having a good time at the moment.\n\nThough all the other cryptos in the top ten have seen modest rises in the past twenty-four hours, Ether hardly budged. At press time, it is still way below its critical support level of $3,000.\n\nData from Santiment reveals that there is a lot of bearishness among Ethereum traders.\n\nTrading volumes have gone down, liquidations are low, but not because investors are staying put, but likely because they\u2019re bored.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn\u2019t made any kind of major price movements this year. And the bulls are now unimpressed.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at the ETH/USDt pair on TradingView and discovered extreme volatility with multiple ups and downs.\n\nThe highest peak approaches the $3,340 level, indicating strong buying interest, while the lowest nears $2,840, where selling pressure intensifies.\n\nThe price repeatedly tested support around $2,900 this past month, as indicated by multiple touches on this line but without actually breaking it, showing resilience at this level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nRecently, the price shows a slight upward movement around $2,968, suggesting a tentative recovery or consolidation phase. But still, it failed. Ethereum was worth $2,958 at press time.\n\nGiven this context, the short-term prediction for Ethereum would lean towards a continuation of bearish trends."

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Will Reach $5,000 by the End of 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Ethereum is going to hit a new all-time high of $5,000 in 2025, here's what needs to happen.\n\nIt's been a strange year for Ethereum (ETH 0.02%). The world's second-largest crypto exploded out of the gate early, soaring from $2,200 in January to $4,000 by mid-March. It looked like Ethereum was easily going to reach the $5,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut that's not what happened. Ethereum fell in value after hitting its high-water mark of $4,000, and now sits right at the $3,000 level. The good news, though, is that there are two key catalysts that could help Ethereum reach the $5,000 level by the end of 2025.\n\nThe arrival of altcoin season\n\nFirst and most importantly, there's the arrival of \"altcoin season.\" This refers to the period of the crypto bull market cycle when lesser-known altcoins explode in value. This typically happens during the early stages of a Bitcoin halving cycle, when investors start to diversify their holdings in search of higher returns.\n\nConsider what happened during the previous altcoin season, which lined up nicely with the start of the previous Bitcoin halving cycle in May 2020. On the date of the halving, Ethereum was trading under $200. One year later, it was trading for $3,800. It eventually went on to hit an all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that this same pattern will happen again in 2024, it's clear that investors are starting to look around for other places to invest their money beyond just Bitcoin. Thus far, meme coins and AI crypto tokens have gotten all the attention, but the time could be coming soon for larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe other big factor would be SEC approval of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) similar to the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. Admittedly, these spot Ethereum ETFs would likely not see the same types of inflows as the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, but the influx of new money would still be significant. And that new influx of money would presumably help to push the price of Ethereum higher over the next 18 months.\n\nAs in the case of the Bitcoin ETFs, there are a number of influential Wall Street players fighting to make them a reality. These include the likes of Ark Invest and BlackRock, both of which now have extraordinarily successful spot Bitcoin ETFs. Approval for these new spot Ethereum ETFs was supposed to come in May, but it now looks like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will push off approval for these ETFs until the end of the summer.\n\nThe impact of these new spot Ethereum ETFs could be huge. Arguably, the primary reason why Ethereum soared in price from $2,200 to $4,000 earlier this year was the expectation that the new spot Ethereum ETFs were coming soon. Wall Street got a bit ahead of itself, and was already starting to price in their impact. So, it's not out of the range of possibility that Ethereum could soar from its current price of $3,000 to $4,000 once these new investment products are approved.\n\nBeware the SEC\n\nThe only problem, of course, is that there's something about Ethereum that the SEC does not like. Ever since Ethereum transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain in September 2022 as part of The Merge, the SEC has been looking for reasons to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nRecently, the concerns about potential SEC oversight have returned, and that has had a chilling effect on Ethereum's price. That's why I don't think Ethereum will reach the $5,000 mark this year -- investors need to have absolute clarity about regulatory risk before Ethereum can skyrocket in price.\n\nThe good news here is that the regulatory climate appears to be shifting in Washington, D.C., in favor of pro-crypto legislation. And some lawmakers have spoken out publicly about the potential overreach of the SEC and the need to change crypto's regulatory framework after the 2024 election.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nThe future price trajectory of Ethereum will depend, to a considerable degree, on the price trajectory of Bitcoin. If you assume that Bitcoin can hit a price of $150,000 by the end of 2025, as many crypto investors now do, then Ethereum has the potential to soar in value to $7,500.\n\nUsing just a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, it's easy to see why this is possible. A $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin implies a $3 trillion market cap. If you then multiply that figure by 0.3 (which is the ratio of Ethereum's current market cap to Bitcoin's current market cap), you arrive at a market cap figure of $900 billion for Ethereum by the end of 2025. Given Ethereum's circulating coin supply of 120 million, that implies a price of $7,500.\n\nSo, while $5,000 might sound at first like a pie-in-the-sky price forecast, it's really not. In fact, it's a bit conservative. As long as the SEC doesn't get involved, Ethereum has a real chance to hit $5,000 by the end of 2025."

        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, U.K., May 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency is a growing interest for the world's financial institutions and massive investment establishments. Digital finance is no longer just about testing the waters and gaining a broader presence on online portfolios, they are an everyday reality for the majority of the world\u2019s individuals and businesses.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the digital asset class has evolved into a global phenomenon. What started as an experimental concept has now become a burgeoning industry, with a market capitalization surpassing trillions of dollars. The proliferation of cryptocurrencies has sparked a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, offering decentralized solutions and disrupting conventional models of banking and commerce.\n\nCryptocurrency and the Mass Institutional Adoption\n\nIn recent years, the industry has witnessed a significant uptick in institutional adoption, signaling a seismic shift in mainstream acceptance. Institutions, ranging from hedge funds to multinational corporations, are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles and store of value.\n\nThis mass institutional adoption is driven by several factors, including growing confidence in the technology, hedging against inflationary pressures, and diversification of investment portfolios. Moreover, regulatory clarity and enhanced infrastructure have bolstered both institutional and individual confidence, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network have seen a surge in value this year, driven by recent developments in the financial sector.\n\nIn a notable move, some of Wall Street's biggest banks are collaborating with Visa and Mastercard to experiment with tokenizing their assets. This initiative, predicted by Citi analysts to grow into a $5 trillion market by 2030, involves banks like JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, alongside Visa, Mastercard, and Swift. This could mean a significant step toward mass institutional adoption.\n\nTokenization of assets is considered the \"next generation for markets\" by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who has embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the past year. BlackRock has quietly begun the second stage of its plan for a crypto-based \"revolution in financial markets\" by launching a tokenized private equity fund. Sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in digital currencies, with potential trading activity expected in the coming months, according to BlackRock executives.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin: Leading the Way\n\n\n\nAt the forefront of this cryptocurrency revolution stands Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency that ignited the spark of decentralization. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, becoming synonymous with the concept of digital gold. With its finite supply, decentralized nature, and immutable ledger, Bitcoin has emerged as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nIn March 2024 Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching around $73,000 per BTC, boosting the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies to approximately $2.5 trillion. Analysts speculate that former U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve could trigger a massive price boom for Bitcoin.\n\nBlockDAG Network: A Promising Contender\n\nAmong the emerging contenders in the cryptocurrency space, BlockDAG Network has garnered attention for its innovative approach to blockchain scalability and efficiency and real-world use. Leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG Network aims to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional blockchain architectures, offering high throughput and low latency solutions for decentralized applications. With recent funding of up to $25 million and a growing community of supporters, BlockDAG Network is poised to challenge existing digital projects and reshape the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum: The Surge in Value\n\nAnother key player in the cryptocurrency market experiencing a surge in value is Ethereum, the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, has witnessed a remarkable rally, driven by the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to attract developers, investors, and users, cementing its position as a fundamental pillar of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the mass institutional adoption of cryptocurrency represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of finance, with Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum leading the charge. As institutional investors flock to digital assets, this 2024 cryptocurrency market stands poised for unprecedented growth and innovation. While challenges and regulatory hurdles remain, the trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption points towards a future where decentralized finance becomes the cornerstone of global finance.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "ETH faces immense odds as the ETF deadline approaches\n\nAnalysts predict BTC or SOL as potential beneficiaries of ETH woes\n\nEthereum [ETH] could face a bumpy ride and even a massive bloodbath if recent analysts\u2019 outlook comes true.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst James Van Straten, ETH could lose more ground against Bitcoin [BTC] if the SEC rejects spot ETH ETF applications at the end of May.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks like it\u2019s going to the grave. A rejection of the spot ETF sends the ETHBTC ratio lower from 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decisions on most ETH ETF filings are due between late May and August. VanEck and Hashdex\u2019s decisions are due on the 23rd and the 30th of May, respectively.\n\nThese are the immediate dates the markets are tracking from next week. Straten projects that an ETF rejection could further lower the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nThe ratio tracks the value of ETH against BTC. If the ratio is 0.047, it means ETH is worth 0.047 BTC.\n\nIn an ETF rejection scenario, negative market sentiment and sell pressure could make ETH worth less in BTC terms.\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflationary \u2018state\u2019 could worsen price prospects\n\nEthereum is currently \u201cissuing\u201d more ETH than it \u201cburns,\u201d making it inflationary. This is the complete opposite of BTC\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million coins.\n\nStraten added that ETH\u2019s inflationary nature and a dip in transaction fees after the Dencun upgrade tipped Bitcoin to lead on the fees front,\n\n\u201cBitcoin fees continue to outpace ETH, with very little activity occurring on BTC. ETH has now transitioned into an inflationary state (lol). Dencun upgrade reduces transaction fees, and the ETH burn rate increases the supply.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto evaluated ETH\u2019s inflationary state using Ultra Sound data. It showed that 4.2K ETH was burnt in the past seven days, but 17.6K ETH was issued over the same period.\n\nThat means Ethereum issued four times the token burnt last week, a massive surge in supply that could drag ETH prices down.\n\nBitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger shared the same sentiment. Krueger stated that ETH was \u201cheaded lower\u201d after Solana [SOL] outcompeted it through lower fees.\n\n\u201cBut then, they (Ethereum) get clobbered by Solana with the low fees. So, enter Phase 2. The new upgrade lowers fees and makes ETH inflationary again.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas maintained a pessimistic view on May approval for ETH ETF filings.\n\nIf rejection plays out, ETH could witness a massive bloodbath on the price charts and affect its long-term holders, who are yet to book profit.\n\nIt remains to be seen how BTC or SOL will benefit from ETH woes if the SEC rejects the ETFs starting next week."

On a seven-day scale, most of the cryptocurrencies are trading in the red.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum is now consolidating below the critical psychological level of $3K, and it\u2019s very interesting to see if the buyers will be able to reclaim it soon.\n\nMeanwhile, today\u2019s best performers are Immutable (IMX) \u2013 up 4.7%, and Ribbon Finance (RBN) \u2013 up 3.3%.\n\nOn the other hand, the cryptocurrencies that performed the worst are Zebec Protocol (ZBC) \u2013 down 7.8%, and Kaspa (KAS) \u2013 down 4.8%."

        "content": "In a development echoing one of the largest crypto heists in history, Cyvers Alerts has reported that a hacker, who exploited a vulnerability in Parity's multi-signature wallet in 2017, has now moved a substantial sum of Ethereum (ETH). The hacker, responsible for the theft of 150,000 ETH, valued at $30 million at the time, has initiated the laundering of a portion of their loot, transferring 3,050 ETH, equivalent to $9 million, through the eXch platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis marks a significant chapter in the saga, underscoring the enduring impact of cyber breaches in the digital asset realm. Cyvers Alerts took to X to highlight the unfolding events, reminding followers of the 2017 incident that shook the crypto community. The vulnerability in Parity's Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ had allowed the perpetrator to abscond with a staggering amount of Ethereum , causing substantial financial losses.\n\n\ud83d\udea8ALERT\ud83d\udea8 In 2017, a vulnerability in Parity Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ led to the theft of over 150K ETH, valued at approximately $30M USD at the time.\n\n\n\nThe hacker behind this theft has demonstrated remarkable patience, marking a significant chapter in crypto history. Today,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/JPD5nJcmrJ \u2014 \ud83d\udea8 Cyvers Alerts \ud83d\udea8 (@CyversAlerts) May 13, 2024\n\nThe latest maneuver by the hacker underscores a strategic and patient approach to their illicit activities. By utilizing eXch and consolidating multiple addresses under \"0x5167052b,\" they have successfully laundered a portion of the stolen funds. However, what's more concerning is the sizable sum still under their control. With 83,017 ETH, valued at a staggering $246.6 million, remaining untouched at the primary address \"0xb3764761,\" the hacker retains significant leverage within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOngoing threat\n\nThis recent activity reignites discussions surrounding security measures within the crypto space and the persistent threat posed by vulnerabilities in blockchain platforms. Despite efforts to enhance security protocols and mitigate risks, incidents like the Parity Wallet breach are stark reminders of the ever-present danger of cyber attacks .\n\nAs stakeholders assess the implications of this latest development, attention turns to broader implications for investor confidence and regulatory oversight within the crypto market. The ability of hackers to exploit weaknesses in infrastructure and maneuver substantial sums of digital assets shows the need for continued vigilance and collaboration within the industry to safeguard against such threats."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, major tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing significant fluctuations, presenting both challenges and opportunities for investors. Amidst this dynamic environment, the Furrever Token (FURR) emerges with an innovative marketing strategy aimed at attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, further diversifying the crypto ecosystem with its unique thematic focus and competitive initiatives.\n\nNavigating Bitcoin's \"Danger Zone\": Market Dynamics and Speculations\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing considerable volatility, currently trading at approximately $61,229.50, marking a slight increase of 0.65% from the previous day. This instability is particularly evident as BTC recently tested the critical $60,000 support level, a move that has heightened caution among investors. This phase is often described as the \"danger zone,\" a term used to denote the turbulent period following Bitcoin's halving events.\n\nDuring trading on May 10, Bitcoin's price momentarily dipped to an intraday low of $60,190 on Bitstamp, down from attempts to stabilize around $63,000. This sudden decrease has sparked widespread speculation among traders and analysts. Many believe that large-volume institutional actions, coupled with the temporary closure of the BTC ETF market, might have driven the drop.\n\nDespite this recent dip, market experts like Rekt Capital remain optimistic, suggesting that the end of this challenging \"danger zone\" could be in sight. Historically, such periods have been marked by sharp downturns followed by eventual stabilizations. The current market scenario of BTC demonstrates the complex interplay between market sentiment and institutional influences, which continues to dictate the cryptocurrency's price movements. As Bitcoin navigates through these fluctuations, the broader crypto community watches closely, anticipating the cryptocurrency's next moves in this unpredictable market landscape.\n\nEthereum Faces Market Headwinds and Analyst Scrutiny\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently been trading at $2,927.63, marking a slight decrease of 0.25% from the previous day. This modest drop is part of a broader trend of challenges that have caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.\n\nA significant event stirring the market was a major sell-off by an Ethereum whale who liquidated 6,714 ETH at a price of $2,903 each, culminating in a loss of approximately $6.5 million. This large-scale transaction has intensified concerns over Ethereum's future price direction. Market indicators are not promising, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a decrease in investor interest and key averages indicating a bearish outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Ethereum's substantial trading volume of $10.1 billion over the last 24 hours, the price has declined by 4.07%, fluctuating between $2,935.95 and $2,894.15. Analysts have pinpointed the $3,017 level as a crucial resistance point; surpassing this could potentially shift the momentum to a bullish trend and help Ethereum break out of its current descending channel pattern.\n\nHowever, several factors are complicating this outlook. The cryptocurrency has been in a descending channel since mid-March, and the delayed approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added to the bearish sentiment. Moreover, the recent Dencun hard fork, which was intended to enhance Ethereum's scalability, did not have the expected positive impact on its price, leading to further speculation about its effectiveness and future impact on Ethereum's market performance.\n\nThese developments paint a complex picture for Ethereum as it navigates through ongoing market challenges and investor scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Attract Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors\n\nThe Furrever Token (FURR) has introduced an exciting $20,000 competition, targeting holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to diversify into its presale phase, which prominently features cat-themed imagery and an engaging, playful ecosystem. Operating on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token is currently offering 65% of its approximately 9 billion token supply to early investors, signaling a strong start with over $1 million raised in just two months.\n\nAs the presale progresses, Furrever Token continues to captivate the community's interest, with its current price set at a modest $0.000648. A notable aspect of this token is its absence of buy and sell taxes, which enhances its accessibility and affordability, appealing especially to new entrants in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe centerpiece of Furrever Token's promotional activities is the \"Furrever Token $20,000 Highest Total Buys Competition.\" This contest is designed to spur enthusiasm and investment by rewarding the top 10 participants who purchase the most FURR tokens during an 18-day period from May 9, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, to May 27, 2024, at 12:00 UTC. The top purchaser will be awarded $5,000, with descending prize amounts for the other top buyers.\n\nThis initiative not only underscores Furrever Token's commitment to building a robust and engaged community but also positions the token as a potentially lucrative opportunity for investors in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, looking to leverage their holdings into new and promising digital assets.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nJoin $20,000 Furrever Token Giveaway\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

The past week\u2019s downtrend saw the funding rate hover around the baseline +0.01 mark.\n\nA slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on the 9th of May saw the Open Interest and the funding rate jump higher.\n\nThis did not repeat with Bitcoin despite a similar price bounce, which suggested that speculators were more eager to long ETH than BTC.\n\nWhat are the next liquidity pockets that could attract prices?\n\nThe 7-day liquidation heatmap of Bitcoin showed a bright cluster of liquidations at the $60k area. To the north, $61.8k and $63k are the next bullish targets.\n\nOn the 5th of May, we saw prices jump above the $64k mark to collect liquidity before a brutal short-term reversal.\n\nSimilarly, we might see a downward plunge on Monday to collect the liquidity at $60k before rebounding higher. Hence, BTC traders would want to buy the dip to the $50.6k-$60k region.\n\nHowever, traders must also be prepared for a move below $59.4k for BTC, and set their stop-losses accordingly in the event of a dip to $60k.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has a cluster of liquidity nearby to the north at $2950. This was close to the current market price of $2928. A dip to the $2860 region would likely present a buying opportunity.\n\nThe liquidation levels around the $3.1k-$3.2k area present an attractive target. A drop below $2.8k would likely herald a strong short-term downtrend, and traders can cut their losses in this scenario."

        "content": "Mon 13 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the order of platform supremacy seems established. But the emergence of new players is challenging this current order. This is the case for Solana (SOL), which has just overtaken Ethereum (ETH) in terms of DEX volume.\n\nSolana Surpasses Ethereum in Decentralized Exchange Volume https://t.co/JMiP2HmQL8\n\n\n\nFollow us and stay up to date with the latest developments for #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Ripple #cryptomarket #cryptocurrencynews \u2014 COINTURK NEWS (@Cointurknews) May 10, 2024 Crypto: Solana surpasses Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nSolana overtakes Ethereum in terms of DEX trading volume\n\nLaunched in 2020, the cryptocurrency platform Solana stands out for its transaction speed and low fees. This makes it particularly attractive to DeFi users. This crypto blockchain has experienced exponential growth in recent months, attracting many investors and developers.\n\nAccording to recent data, DEX trading volume on Solana has reached $1.3 billion. For the first time, this volume exceeds that of Ethereum, which is at $1.29 billion. This remarkable performance marks a turning point in the competition between the two crypto platforms. It indicates the potential of Solana to emerge as a promising alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana: a crypto ecosystem in full expansion\n\nIn addition to the DEX trading volume of Solana, its transaction fees have also increased. These have reached 50% of the fees generated on the Ethereum crypto network lately. Analysts also predict that soon, transaction fees on the Solana network could surpass those of Ethereum.\n\nSpeaking of increases, the price of SOL has also seen a rise of over 6% in 24 hours. This situation propels Solana to the rank of the most performing altcoins in the crypto market.\n\nA new order is emerging in the world of cryptocurrencies\n\nSolana\u2019s surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume is a strong signal of its potential to become a major player in the DeFi space. Its speed, negligible fees, rapidly expanding ecosystem, and innovative technology make Solana an attractive alternative for users and developers.\n\nAlthough Ethereum maintains its dominance in terms of market capitalization, Solana is now positioning itself as a serious contender, ready to shake up the established crypto order.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
