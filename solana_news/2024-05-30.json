        "content": "BlackRock amended the S-1 registration statement for its spot Ethereum ETF in a May 29 filing, marking a step toward approval.\n\nThe filing builds on BlackRock\u2019s original registration statement, which was initially filed in November 2023.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart called the filing a step toward launch after the SEC approved 19b-4 listing rule changes on May 23.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cThis is almost certainly the engagement we were looking for \u2026\u201d\n\nSeyffart reaffirmed his belief that the S-1 statements could gain approval in the coming weeks, leading to spot Ethereum ETF launches, but admitted that the \u201cnorm is months.\u201d\n\nPlaceholder data filled\n\nThe S-1 filing fills several placeholder fields, including details about seed funding.\n\nAccording to the filing, the fund has generated $10 million in proceeds via a seed capital purchase by BlackRock Financial Management of 400,000 shares at $25 per share.\n\nThe sponsor, iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor, may collect up to $500,000 in fees per annum. The latest filing does not calculate a percentage-based sponsor fee.\n\nThe trust will issue and redeem shares only in blocks of 40,000. The fund\u2019s ticker is ETHA.\n\nWilmington Trust, National Association will act as the Delaware trustee. Bank of New York Mellon will act as trust administrator and cash custodian.\n\nIn-kind redemptions considered\n\nThe new S-1 also reintroduces the possibility of in-kind creation and redemptions, which would allow for crypto rather than cash transactions among authorized participants.\n\nIt acknowledges that approval of in-kind transactions is not guaranteed and that timing is uncertain.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s original S-1 statement mentioned the possibility of in-kind creations and redemptions in passing. However, an amendment notice to Nasdaq\u2019s 19b-4 filing in April said that authorized participants would rely solely on cash when creating and redeeming shares in the fund.\n\nThe latest S-1 also explicitly states that BlackRock will not engage in ETH staking, aligning with Nasdaq\u2019s second May 22 19b-4 amendment on behalf of BlackRock.\n\nAll other ETH ETF issuers have also removed the possibility of staking from their applications.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "EigenLayer raises the stakes for ethereum - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThis article is an onsite version of our Cryptofinance newsletter. Premium subscribers can sign up here to get the newsletter delivered every week. Standard subscribers can upgrade to Premium here, or explore all FT newsletters\n\nHello and welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we\u2019re taking a look at a fast-growing new trend in decentralised finance.\n\nThe excitement over the arrival of stock market funds investing directly in cryptocurrencies this year has obscured the rapid changes taking place in the world of decentralised finance, or DeFi.\n\nThe hottest thing in the market at the moment is the emergence of EigenLayer, a new network that lets holders of the ether cryptocurrency simultaneously lend out the same coin multiple times.\n\nUnderscoring its appeal, its Seattle-based parent company Eigen Labs in February raised $100mn from Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s a16z, one of the most influential crypto venture capitalists.\n\nThe concept behind EigenLayer is \u201crestaking\u201d, a new concept for the crypto market. At present holders of ether can earn interest, in the form of more tokens, if they deposit or \u201cstake\u201d their ether on ethereum, allowing the system to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThey earn a reward for it but that keeps their coins locked up and immobile. EigenLayer takes the staked ether and allows it to be reused in other applications that are also built on ethereum \u2014 earning them further yield in the process.\n\nIt may well sound familiar. That\u2019s because, fundamentally, it is rehypothecation, or the practice of lending the same asset over and over again. It\u2019s something global financial regulators have clamped down on since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, when it emerged that the US bank had used collateral posted by clients to help fund its own trades. It took years for customers to be reunited with their assets.\n\nIn the world of crypto, this vice is turned into a virtue. Other services such as Lido Finance also rehypothecate assets but hand out tokens that represent the value of the staked ether.\n\nThe twist with EigenLayer is that it is trying to extend the security that underpins the ethereum network to other applications that are also being built on ethereum. EigenLayer sits in the middle, connecting people who want to use their staked tokens to lend with new applications that are being built. EigenLayer uses automated algorithms and smart contracts to manage the process.\n\nThe advantage of EigenLayer is that, at least in theory, it solves a major issue for the ethereum network. Every application built on ethereum has to sort out its own security with its own validation, and that makes it a highly inefficient, fragmented and costly system that is difficult to scale. EigenLayer can help the network grow by piggybacking on the complex and effective system that validates it.\n\nFrom a standing start in December there are now just under 5mn ether coins, valued at $18.6bn, locked up in EigenLayer, according to data provider DefiLlama. That makes it the second-largest application in the DeFi market, between longtime players Lido on $36bn and AAVE on $13bn.\n\nBut in a research paper this week, Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex in the UK, argued that restaking was creating a major, new risk in the market.\n\nShe said the $18.6bn figure was \u201cvastly overestimated\u201d because some of the numbers had been counted multiple times. The true figure backing the activity is closer to two-thirds of that, she thinks.\n\nThat matters because, she said, each new application needs to rely on highly leveraged tokens backed by very little in a thin market.\n\nThe EigenLayer system is designed to punish bad actors such as hackers by confiscating a portion of staked tokens or deposits as a penalty. It relies on algorithms that unilaterally decide when malicious activity is happening.\n\nThat leaves the leveraged staking market exposed if there are deliberate attacks to steal funds, if prices are manipulated or if lenders simply have poorly coded algorithms, light borrowing standards or poor risk controls. And all built on an IOU of ether, she says.\n\n\u201cBecause the vast majority of staking is on ethereum, any stress events . . . have the potential to spread credit contagion throughout the DeFi ecosystem, and this could precipitate another DeFi winter,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAlready the multiplication of layers is dizzying. Applications such as Renzo restake staked ether tokens on EigenLayer \u2014 and mint another token to represent that transaction. Applications such as Renzo \u201care taking on a very large credit risk\u201d, Alexander warned.\n\nThat could lead to a cascade of liquidations in the market and tokens could depeg from other tokens whose value they are supposed to track, she said.\n\nIt has happened before. The collapse of the terra stablecoin, which triggered the crypto market crash of 2022, began with staked ether tokens in the DeFi market and spread because bigger traders and lenders were interlinked with other markets.\n\nHowever some have argued that introducing layers of applications on top of staked ether is \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of the ethereum network.\n\nEither it can be a protocol for open innovation, more akin to a commodity, or it can be an investable asset that will deliver a yield for investors, said the head of research at one staking service who declined to be identified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really possible for them to do both. If you optimise ether as the financial asset . . . you\u2019re encouraging the creation of this kind of layers and going further out in the risk curve to maximise yield.\u201d\n\n\n\nYet market demand is potentially pushing ether and ethereum towards it being an investable asset, just when US lawmakers and financial regulators are leaning towards ether being a commodity.\n\nIf the Commodity Futures Trading Commission becomes the main US regulator for crypto as expected, then the agency may find itself going down a very deep rabbit hole when piecing together the aftermath of the next market crash.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Email me at philip.stafford@ft.com\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nFormer FTX senior executive Ryan Salame was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after pleading guilty last year to election fraud charges and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business while at Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s failed cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT became the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange traded fund even though it only launched in January. Its holdings of just under 300,000 bitcoin pipped those of Grayscale, even though its rival held more than 619,000 at the start of the year.\n\nUsers of Gemini\u2019s Earn lending programme will get nearly $2bn of their crypto that was stuck at Genesis, following the digital asset trader\u2019s bankruptcy in January 2023.\n\nSoundbite of the week:\n\nElon Musk dismissed stories that he had talked to Donald Trump about digital assets. He wrote on his X social media site:\n\n\u201cPretty sure I\u2019ve never discussed crypto with Trump, although I am generally in favor of things that shift power from government to the people, which crypto can do.\u201d\n\nData mining: the rise of ethena\n\nAmong the signs of soaring optimism in DeFi is the emergence of a stablecoin called ethena. It is pegged to the ether cryptocurrency rather than the US dollar, and offers buyers a yield of 36 per cent. From nothing in January, it is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest stablecoin with nearly $3bn in circulation. Its backers argue that it is fully decentralised \u2014 pegged to the price of ether so there are no deposited assets sitting in a bank. Instead it uses derivatives to keep the value in balance. This week it overtook First Digital USD, which has $5.29 in circulation and now sits behind Dai, which has $5.3bn in circulation.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Laurence Fletcher.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin reveals five ways he\u2019d rebuild Ethereum from scratch - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum's architect shares thoughts on smart contracts, EVM, and other features.\n\nButerin says Ethereum developers should have shipped Proof of Stake sooner.\n\nEthereum is going mainstream with advent of ETFs.\n\nWhen 620 weary developers emerged after three days of nonstop coding at this year\u2019s ETHBerlin event last week, few expected Vitalik Buterin to be speaking on stage.\n\nThe co-founder and prime architect of Ethereum was a surprise guest.\n\nWhat was even more surprising were some of his reflections on building the industry\u2019s second-largest blockchain. Buterin described some of the regrets he had about the initial design of Ethereum in detail.\n\nFor many in the audience, his discourse not only evoked the halcyon days of the network\u2019s birth in 2014, but it also helped fill in the road map for what comes next for a cryptocurrency now worth $448 billion.\n\nThe US has just approved a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has launched its own tokenised fund on the blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum network has spawned a sprawling ecosystem of developers and financial applications worth more than $63 billion, and it has become a byword for decentralised finance.\n\nList of things\n\nStill, Buterin, a 30-year-old Canadian-Russian programmer, said he has a list of things he would have done differently. They range from the development of Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine to smart contracts to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nAnd he remarked that even as Ethereum goes more mainstream, it\u2019s still misunderstood.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a simple narrative which is digital gold,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut like with Ethereum, it\u2019s like \u2018Whoa, what the heck is Ethereum?\u2019\u201d\n\nETHBerlin04 in numbers \ud83e\uddee\n\n\n\n- 802 super humans in total\n\n- 627 hackers\n\n- 83 project submissions\n\n- 56 volunteers\n\n- 40 experience hosts\n\n- 33 judges\n\n- 18 mentors\n\n- 15 core team\n\n- 13 speakers\n\n- 20ish dogs \u2014 ETHBerlin04 (@ETHBerlin) May 26, 2024\n\nETHBerlin04 in numbers \ud83e\uddee\n\n\n\n- 802 super humans in total\n\n- 627 hackers\n\n- 83 project submissions\n\n- 56 volunteers\n\n- 40 experience hosts\n\n- 33 judges\n\n- 18 mentors\n\n- 15 core team\n\n- 13 speakers\n\n- 20ish dogs \u2014 ETHBerlin04 (@ETHBerlin) May 26, 2024\n\nSeated on comfy couches on stage with ETHBerlin organisers Afri Schoedon and Franziska Heintel, Buterin opened his chat by sharing his fondest memories of the German capital over the years \u2014 hacking in the old office with Ethereum co-founders Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke, launching Devcon Zero, and celebrating the Merge upgrade in 2022.\n\nThen Schoedon popped the question.\n\n\u201cWith everything you know and everything you learned over the last 10 years, how would you build Ethereum differently today if you could start from scratch?\u201d Schoeden asked.\n\nVitalik Buterin (centre) discussed Ethereum's vision, then and now, in a discussion at ETHBerlin. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/DL News.\n\nToo many bits, too early\n\nButerin\u2019s first qualm concerns Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine, which is key to making the network function as a kind of decentralised mega crypto computer.\n\nHe explained that Ethereum\u2019s original EVM design used 256-bit processing instead of 64- or 32-bit.\n\nIn computer architecture, the size of computing is measured in bits, with larger bits offering better efficiencies and processing more data. But 256 bits is very inefficient for most operations, and can create a lot of bloat on a blockchain, even for simple tasks.\n\nFor a network in its early days, Ethereum didn\u2019t need to optimise for this.\n\n\u201cThe original design was way too overfitted for 256-bit,\u201d Buterin told the audience.\n\nOptimise smart contracts\n\nSecond, Buterin said the early Ethereum developers should have focused on making it easier to write smart contracts with fewer lines of code.\n\nThe reason? Added transparency.\n\nWith fewer lines of code, he said, \u201cpeople can properly see and check what\u2019s going on inside of them.\u201d\n\nVolunteers and developers playing music at a hackathon in Berlin. Photocredit: ETHBerlin.\n\nSwitch to a \u2018crappier\u2019 version of staking\n\nInstead of custom-built computers \u2014 called miners \u2014 running nonstop to secure a blockchain network, Ethereum switched to a different model.\n\nEthereum\u2019s switch from a Proof of Work consensus mechanism \u2014 the way nodes in a blockchain like Bitcoin\u2019s agree on the state of transaction data \u2014 to Proof of Stake in 2022 should have happened much earlier, Buterin said.\n\n\u201cWhen we switched to Proof of Stake, we should have been willing to switch to a somewhat crappier version of Proof of Stake earlier on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ended up wasting a lot of cycles on really trying to make Proof of Stake perfect.\u201d\n\nInstead of miners, Ethereum is now secured by validators who have staked 32 Ethereum, worth roughly $124,000, to do the same thing \u2014 and be rewarded for it. If they misbehave by validating fraudulent transactions, for example, they are penalised.\n\nIn sum, the switch swapped out raw, energy-intensive computing power with economic incentives.\n\n\u201cWe could have saved a huge amount of trees if we had a much simpler proof-of-stake in 2018,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nIssue logs from day one\n\nFrom big-money token transfers to backdoor honey pots, users can follow the money quite easily in crypto. That\u2019s thanks in part to automatic logging.\n\nBut as the industry advances, notably moving from externally owned accounts like MetaMask to smart wallets like Safe, certain aspects of that crucial logging are lost.\n\nNotably, automatic logs for Ether transfers.\n\n\u201cIt should have been in there from the beginning,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cIt could have been like 30 minutes of coding from myself, Gav and Jeff. Instead, it\u2019s an EIP.\u201d\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals are formal proposals made by developers to change certain aspects of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-7708, which Buterin submitted on May 17, would make this precise change.\n\nAmeen Soleimani, strategic advisor at 0xbow and co-founder of MolochDAO and Reflexer Finance, discussing the Tornado Cash case. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/DL News.\n\nDrop Keccak\n\nButerin also said he would have used SHA-2 for Ethereum\u2019s hash function rather than the current function called Keccak.\n\nTo understand the difference, one must dig into a bit of cryptography lore, specifically about how SHA-3 became a standard. Remember, before crypto became synonymous with celebrity memecoins and nine-figure initial coin offerings, it was about complicated math.\n\nWhen Ethereum was being built, the hash it used was in a \u201chash function competition\u201d \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a thing.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology organised the competition to create a new hash standard alongside SHA-2.\n\nPrevious standards had been attacked and debunked. But SHA-2 was unscathed and the NIST simply wanted a safe alternative. After all, variety is the spice of life (and apparently cryptography).\n\nKeccak was just one of several contestants that entered the competition. During the competition, the team made some minor changes to its algorithms, eventually leading to them being crowned the winner. In other words: SHA-3.\n\nThe early Ethereum team had, however, already implemented a non-standardised version of Keccak. Essentially, Ethereum is using a pre-SHA-3 iteration.\n\nCo-founder and CPO of ChainSafe Gregory Markou and founder and CEO of Phylax Systems Odysseas Lamtzidis speaking on stage at ETHBerlin. Photocredit: ETHBerlin\n\nBig whoop, right?\n\nWell, this meant that Ethereum developers needed a custom library \u2014 collections of reusable code that needn\u2019t be rewritten from scratch \u2014 to accommodate both SHA-3 and Keccak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not compatible with other systems using SHA-3,\u201d Marius van der Wijden, a core Ethereum developer, told DL News. \u201cWe have to support both algorithms in the EVM.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s essentially been solved. Today, big libraries support both encryption mechanisms.\n\nSo, yeah, big whoop indeed.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things, and current development is definitely not impacted by it,\u201d said van der Wijden.\n\nEthereum\u2019s crack team\n\nDespite the list of minor design misses, Buterin said it\u2019s inevitable for any project to have a few.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really happy that I feel like our core devs and their execution capacity feels like it just keeps increasing with each passing year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position to effectively and safely correct some of these mistakes.\u201d\n\nLiam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Solana \u2014 why Ethereum's lesser-known rival is steadily rising - Yahoo Finance UK",
        "content": "Solana claims its blockchain platform offers faster transactions for a fraction of the cost compared with ethereum. (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nSolana has long been heralded as the main contender to knock ether (ETH-USD) from its perch as the world\u2019s pre-eminent network for decentralised finance.\n\nThe Swiss-developed \u201chigh-performance, permissionless\u201d blockchain was launched in March 2020, by lead designer Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\nIts sol (SOL) token has soared in value by more than 88% since the beginning of this year, now trading at $168.46 (\u00a3132.35). However, this is still significantly lower than the token's all-time-high of $260 (\u00a3204.27) on 7 November 2021.\n\nApproximately 63% of sol is staked on the solana blockchain \u2014 this limits the supply of the token and has acted as a tailwind on the price. The market capitalisation for the blockchain has grown to over $77bn, ranking fifth in terms of cryptocurrency market cap, just behind Binance's BNB (BNB-USD).\n\nRead more: Ether price rallies on spot-ETF launch speculation as solana surges\n\nThis week, PayPal (PYPL) announced that its stablecoin PYUSD would launch on the solana network, nearly a year after debuting on the ethereum blockchain. PayPal senior vice-president of blockchain, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, praised solana's cost and speed efficiencies, stating: \"Ethereum works well enough, but if you\u2019re interested in retail payments as we are, basically you need at least 1,000 transactions per second and you need transaction costs in the pennies, not in the dollars.\"\n\nThe ability of solana to handle large-scale blockchain movements is key to its value proposition. Solana can average 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). When compared with Ethereum\u2019s 30 TPS, it becomes evident that the Swiss-developed blockchain is a major challenger to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s brainchild, Ethereum.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin. (John Phillips via Getty Images)\n\nSolana has many key innovations that could see its native SOL flip Binance's BNB token, which is next in line in the market capitalisation rankings. However, Solana is more decentralised than Binance, with over 1,000 validators, compared to only 21 validators on the BNB smart chain (BSC). The lack of decentralisation on the BSC leaves it vulnerable to manipulation or even a blockchain-wide hack, which in the long-term makes institutional players wary of deploying smart contracts on it.\n\nThus, the real target for solana is ethereum and it is expected to continue munching away at large chunks of ethereum\u2019s market share because of its advanced transaction speed, lower transaction costs and attractive programming language.\n\nEase of use for application development accelerates the wider adoption of a blockchain by users and developers, a key factor in long-term success.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price dips ahead of FTX and Mt Gox bankruptcy payouts\n\nThe developers of the solana blockchain have a mechanism for validating transactions called \"proof of history.\" This involves a cryptographic time-stamping mechanism that speeds up the settlement of on-chain (recorded on the main blockchain) transactions. This fundamental innovation in solana\u2019s blockchain validation method, where every block is time-stamped, allows a multitude of transactions to be processed simultaneously.\n\nThe Solana Foundation\u2019s website states that it maintains \u201ca single global state as the network scales and never deals with fragmented layer two systems or sharded chains.\u201d Thus, it does not need a layer two solution as its main blockchain can settle transactions at high speeds and with a fraction of the costs required on the ethereum network.\n\nRead more: What is a spot bitcoin ETF and why has it sparked a crypto rally?\n\nEthereum must rely on layer two solutions to handle large-scale transactions, as its layer one main network, where monetary settlements are recorded, experiences crippling congestion when a large number of transactions need to be verified. Layer two solutions can handle transactions at high speeds and with a fraction of the usual gas-fees, but are settled 'off-chain.' and then validated on the main blockchain network in a singular bundle at a later time.\n\nYahoo Finance asked Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, to explain why solana\u2019s transaction speeds are faster than ethereums.\n\nHe said: \u201cSolana is a proof of stake blockchain whose architecture unlocks network speeds and transactional capacity comparable to NASDAQ. It leverages proof of history, a decentralised clock before consensus, to timestamp incoming transactions, allow for faster block finalisation and increased transaction throughput.\u201d\n\nFedera described how solana\u2019s 'proof of history' consensus mechanism has a low energy requirement when compared to the 'proof of work' method used to validate bitcoin settlements. He said that: \u201cSolana's consensus mechanism is greener because it doesn't use energy and it allows for the next generation of optimisations in technology improvements to make these networks much faster and scalable.\u201d\n\nThe programming language that solana is based upon is attractive to developers \u2014 a key factor in accelerating the rate of blockchain adoption.\n\nIf many decentralised applications are developed for a blockchain, then the proportion of users who flock to the network will appreciate.\n\nRead more: What are bitcoin runes?\n\nFedera described solana as being \u201cbuilt on Rust, one of the most-loved programming languages by developers. It can be used to create smart contracts on solana using a universal coding language that possesses a powerful toolkit of community resources developed by Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB). Combining these tools with Rust\u2019s compiler means developers can use less energy thinking about technical errors and spend more time focusing on smart contract logic, so it\u2019s easier to write safe code for DeFi.\u201d\n\nAnother reason why capital is pouring into Solana is because the platform has exploited the growing interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Purchasing these one-of-a-kind digital artefacts on solana is much cheaper than the gas-fees that must be forked out to buy equivalents on the ethereum network.\n\nThe ethereum network has average gas fees of $16 per transaction. On the solana network, the average gas fee is $0.00025 per transaction.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nSome critics of ethereum suggest that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s network is hanging on solely because of its first-mover advantage, which has seen it consolidate the majority of all known DeFi applications (dApps). But there are reasons to hesitate before concluding that solana will supersede its older rival.\n\nLast December, Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, took to X.com to shoot down any descriptions of the solana network as an \"ethereum killer.\" He doesn\u2019t \u201csee a future where solana thrives and somehow ether dies.\u201d\n\nHe wrote on X.com: \"Don\u2019t bring back last cycle 'eth killer' bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto-efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I am such a techno-optimist that I am certain that eventually danksharding will have enough bandwidth for all of solana\u2019s data.\"\n\nAlso, hardware costs to run a solana node could see a diminishing number of validators on the network over time, making it less decentralised and at a higher risk of network weaknesses long-term.\n\n* This story is an updated version of the original article published in November 2021.\n\nWatch: What London Stock Exchange debut of Bitcoin ETNs mean for Europe's crypto market\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "The Ethereum Classic halving has cut token rewards paid to miners by about 20%.\n\nThe automatic reduction means miners are less profitable than they used to be.\n\nEthereum Classic \u2014 a 2016 fork from the main Ethereum blockchain \u2014 just completed its third halving, reducing the tokens paid out to miners on the network by around 20%.\n\nThe reduction on the $4.4 billion blockchain occurred at block 20,000,001, or 12:00 am London time on May 31.\n\nMiners now earn 2.048 ETC for every successful block they mine, compared to 2.56 ETC previously.\n\nInvestors often see the reduction in a token\u2019s supply as a positive \u2014 the token should increase in value if the supply decreases while demand stays the same.\n\nSuch events can be double-edged swords, as they also impact the profitability of miners.\n\n\u201cMining revenue will decrease if price remains at the same level,\u201d Red Luo, a content manager at crypto mining pool operator F2pool, told DL News.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s ETC token trades at around $29.70, down 5.8% over the past week.\n\nEthereum Classic's ETC token falls ahead of the network's third halving.\n\nMiners usually turn off their machines when they are no longer profitable, hurting the network\u2019s decentralisation.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nF2pool runs the biggest Ethereum Classic mining pool, with over 44% of the network\u2019s known hashrate.\n\nCan miners stay profitable?\n\nSome Ethereum Classic miners subsist on thin margins.\n\nWith a 20% reduction in rewards, small miners, or those in areas with more expensive electricity, may stop mining because it\u2019s no longer profitable.\n\nThe reduction could also hurt large miners running older, less-efficient mining machines.\n\nStill, according to Luo, the impact should be minimal.\n\n\u201cWe find that most popular machines can operate profitably even after the reward reduction,\u201d Luo said, adding that the reduced rewards should not significantly impact the network\u2019s hashrate.\n\nThe hashrate is the number of hashes \u2014 or guesses \u2014 per second of all mining machines trying to solve equations and process blocks on a blockchain network.\n\nA higher hashrate means more computing power is required to process transactions.\n\nThis makes that blockchain more secure because it would take more miners \u2014 and cost more in energy and time \u2014 to attack the network.\n\nHow Ethereum Classic works\n\nEthereum Classic is a Proof of Work blockchain. It split from the main Ethereum network after the DAO hack in 2016.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic requires miners running powerful computers to solve complex equations, which, when solved, allow them to add blocks of transactions to the blockchain.\n\nIn return, successful miners receive token rewards.\n\nSolving these equations is difficult. Many miners choose to team up in so-called mining pools and split the rewards if one of them solves an equation.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Classic is programmed to reduce token rewards by 20%, many in the community still refer to it as a \u201chalving,\u201d because it resembles Bitcoin\u2019s halvings.\n\nBitcoin halvings cut the rewards paid to miners in half about every four years.\n\nEthereum Classic halvings occur every five million blocks, or about every two years.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Babylon, a crypto startup co-founded by Stanford University engineering Professor David Tse, has raised $70 million in its latest funding round.\n\nWhat Happened: The round was led by crypto venture capital firm Paradigm and included investments from Polychain and Bullish Capital, the company announced on Thursday, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThis follows an $18 million raise in December from investors such as Hack VC and Framework Ventures.\n\nAlthough Babylon did not disclose its current valuation or investment details, a representative confirmed that the funds will be used to expand staff and further research and development.\n\nThis latest investment highlights a renewed interest in Bitcoin-focused projects among venture capitalists.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum ETH/USD and other blockchains have been favored for software development, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nHowever, the success of Ordinals, a type of nonfungible token (NFT) on the Bitcoin blockchain, has sparked renewed interest in building within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\"So Bitcoin is kind of really undergoing a renaissance in the sense that now there's a new wave of projects building on Bitcoin,\" Tse said.\n\n\"Historically, Bitcoin was the first blockchain, but over the years the developer community has shifted away from Bitcoin BTC/USD to new chains\u2026Recently, for multiple reasons, there has been a shift of attention back to Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe increased interest also follows the approval and launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. earlier this year, as well as the Bitcoin \"halving\" event in April, which reduced the mining rewards by half.\n\nThese developments have contributed to a growing focus on Bitcoin projects.\n\nAlso Read: Robinhood Unveils Crypto Trading API For Advanced US Users\n\nWhy It Matters: Babylon\u2019s primary aim is to enable Bitcoin to be used as a staking asset to secure other blockchains.\n\nStaking, a mechanism used by proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, involves locking up cryptocurrency deposits to validate transactions and secure the network, earning rewards in return.\n\nBitcoin, traditionally a proof-of-work blockchain, uses miners to solve complex puzzles for transaction validation.\n\nBabylon seeks to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in transaction validation on proof-of-stake networks, thereby earning yields on their idle Bitcoin.\n\n\"You can think of our project as analogous to Ethereum's staking, but for Bitcoin,\" Tse explained.\n\nFor Babylon and its investors, making Bitcoin a staking asset presents a significant opportunity, as many Bitcoin holders have long sought ways to generate yield from their assets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent transition to a proof-of-stake model, known as the Merge, has increased the appeal of staking as a revenue-generating activity in the digital asset sector.\n\n\"In our mind, in the crypto Web3, a very important value is security,\" said Tse.\n\n\"So it is this security that drives this underlying decentralized world that we're building. And so what we're trying to advocate is that Bitcoin being such a large asset can sort of underwrite the security layer for essentially the entire Web3 ecosystem.\"\n\nStaking remains one of the most lucrative areas in decentralized finance.\n\nAccording to data tracker DefiLlama, Lido Finance and EigenLayer, two of the top three DeFi projects by total value, fall under the staking category.\n\nUsers have collectively sent over $50 billion in cryptocurrencies to these platforms to generate returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: These developments and their implications for the digital asset market will be key topics at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next: BlackRock Moves Closer To Launching First Spot Ethereum ETF"

        "title": "Ethereum: Charting The Ascendancy Of The Second-Largest Cryptocurrency - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "With a market capitalization of 468.42 billion USD, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency network, trailing only Bitcoin. Experts suggest Ethereum is poised to maintain its dominance in the crypto world for years to come. What makes Ethereum stand out, and what has fueled its significant growth recently? This article delves into these questions, guided by the insights of experts at Octa, a globally licensed financial broker.\n\nIn the week ending May 26, Ethereum\u2019s price surged nearly 25%, reaching up to 3,900 USD. The 4,000 USD mark, last crossed in March, seems within reach following the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Long-term prospects for the Ethereum ecosystem look promising, bolstered by growing adoption across various sectors and a strong developer community. Since becoming the second-largest cryptocurrency in 2018, Ethereum has held this position firmly. But what makes it so resilient in the volatile cryptocurrency market?\n\nA New Era of Blockchain Technology\n\nVitalik Buterin, a visionary entrepreneur, and cryptocurrency enthusiast, conceptualized Ethereum. His interest in blockchain technology began in 2011, and by 2013, he proposed Ethereum as a blockchain platform capable of more than just financial transactions. Ethereum was crowdfunded in 2014, raising over 18 million USD in Bitcoin, and the network launched on July 30, 2015. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed as a decentralized digital currency, Ethereum aimed to expand blockchain technology\u2019s capabilities.\n\nEthereum supports smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with terms written into code. This feature allowed users to create new cryptocurrencies on Ethereum using the ERC-20 token standard, enabling a wide range of applications. One notable example is Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized Oracle network that allows Ethereum smart contracts to interact with real-world data.\n\nPractical applications of Ethereum include:\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum-based applications aim to replicate traditional financial systems using blockchain technology, offering services like lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Unique digital assets representing ownership of specific items, often used in digital art and gaming.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum supports various applications across industries, including gaming, social media, and digital marketplaces.\n\nIdentity and Authentication: Decentralized identity solutions give users control over their personal data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s versatility and the wide range of applications it supports have driven its adoption and growth. The development of DeFi, NFTs, and dApps on the Ethereum blockchain has created a robust ecosystem that attracts developers, investors, and users alike.\n\nEthereum 2.0: A Leap Forward\n\nOn September 15, 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Ethereum 2.0, introducing several significant improvements:\n\nNew Consensus Mechanism: Ethereum 2.0 switched from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which is more secure, energy-efficient, and better suited for scaling.\n\nImproved Scalability: Ethereum 2.0 increased scalability by introducing shard chains, allowing the network to handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nEnhanced Network Efficiency: Shard chains work alongside a central beacon chain to distribute processing loads, improving overall efficiency.\n\nSustainability: The PoS mechanism reduced energy consumption by approximately 99.95%, making Ethereum more eco-friendly.\n\nDespite these advancements, Ethereum 2.0 faces challenges such as accessibility limitations, potential centralization, and untested security aspects. Interested users must own ETH tokens to become validators, requiring significant investment, which may limit accessibility. Additionally, PoS could lead to centralization if larger nodes dominate the validation process.\n\nAccessibility Limitations\n\nBased on the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain requires users to own the native cryptocurrency before becoming validators. This means that they must purchase ETH tokens using fiat currency or exchange tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges. To become a validator, users need to raise at least 32 ETH, which translates to about 50,000 USD. This high entry cost is unaffordable for most users, potentially limiting the number of validators and reducing the decentralization of the network.\n\nPotential Centralization\n\nThe PoS mechanism relies on delegates chosen to validate transactions, raising concerns about potential centralization. Larger nodes, with more substantial holdings of ETH, could dominate the validation process, controlling the selection of delegates and preventing smaller nodes from participating. This could lead to a concentration of power among a few influential delegates or validators, undermining the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nWhile PoS offers many advantages over PoW, it is still relatively new and untested. The low entry cost for becoming a validator could potentially expose the network to personalized attacks against prominent players, decreasing overall security. As the PoS mechanism matures, it will be crucial to identify and address any emerging security challenges to maintain the integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nContinuous Innovation\n\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to innovation is not limited to the PoS transition. The network is also exploring layer-2 scaling solutions and other upgrades to enhance its performance and user experience. Layer-2 solutions, such as rollups, aim to increase transaction throughput by processing transactions off-chain and then settling them on the main Ethereum chain. These solutions can significantly reduce transaction fees and improve the scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nLong-Term Outlook\n\nEthereum\u2019s continuous evolution and commitment to innovation make it an attractive platform for developers and investors. As the network grows and new applications emerge, Ethereum\u2019s relevance and influence in the cryptocurrency space are likely to increase. Some experts predict that Ethereum will surpass its current record peak due to the launch of spot ETF products in the US, potentially triggering significant market movements. Investors trading Ethereum CFDs on platforms like Octa may capitalize on these predicted trends.\n\nOcta: A Global Financial Broker\n\nOcta is an international broker offering online trading services worldwide since 2011.

        "content": "According to Glassnode cofounder Yann Allemann, capital rotation within the cryptocurrency market has begun .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllemann has noted that Solana (SOL) is currently dominating Ethereum (ETH). His assessment comes after the former gained roughly 10% against the latter since May 27.\n\nThe SOL/ETH pair experienced a significant decline following the approval of several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month. On May 27, the price of Ethereum peaked at $3,973 on the Bitstamp exchange. However, the excitement surrounding the SEC's much-coveted nod quickly dissipated, with ETH shedding 7% in several days. The SEC is yet to approve S-1 registration statements for these ETFs to go live.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin's market dominance has collapsed more than 4% since May 6 after breaching the 56% mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce a certain cryptocurrency rallies, it tends to cool off, while traders take profits and place bets on other assets. Capital rotation within cryptocurrencies can also take place internally, meaning that the same cryptocurrency gets acquired at different prices.\n\nDespite its recent weakness, Bitcoin is still neck-and-neck with Ethereum on a year-to-date basis. The two cryptocurrencies are up 77.71% and 79.38%, respectively.\n\nSolana ETF?\n\nAfter Bitcoin and Ethereum have benefited from the ETF hype, analysts are now eyeing other potential cryptocurrency contenders.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , CNBC contributor Brian Kelly has predicted that Solana could end up being the next major digital asset to get its own ETF. This view is also shared by American financier Anthony Scaramucci and British bank Standard Chartered .\n\nAt the same time, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recently shut down rumors about potentially launching Solana-based futures."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA crypto startup seeking to use Bitcoin for native staking on other blockchain networks has secured $70 million in fresh funding to fuel its ambitious goals.\n\nBabylon, which is aiming to do something never accomplished before, secured the cash from lead investor Paradigm, a prominent crypto venture capital firm. Other contributions came from Bullish Capital and Polychain Capital.\n\nThe startup wants to use Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, as a resource for staking. Previously, the firm told Decrypt that it\u2019s building infrastructure to use Bitcoin staking to validate nodes on networks such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis funding will accelerate our mission to make Bitcoin the security backbone of proof-of-stake systems,\u201d Babylon founder David Tse said in a statement. \u201cOur team is dedicated to advancing the utility of Bitcoin beyond its traditional roles and enhancing the security of the entire blockchain ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin runs on a very different system to staking protocols because it uses a system called proof-of-work.\n\nProof-of-work requires lots of computing power\u2014in the form of miners\u2014to process transactions. It\u2019s an expensive and energy intensive process.\n\nBut with proof-of-stake, anyone can participate by \u201clocking up\u201d their assets to power a crypto network. Staking networks include the likes of Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano.\n\nBabylon wants those holding Bitcoin to be able to earn a yield by pledging their coins to staking networks. It\u2019s a bold challenge, but the startup\u2014led by a Stanford professor and a former Dolby engineer\u2014says it has found a way. Last year, it raised $18 million from investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf it does achieve what it wants, those sitting on satoshis (aka the smallest denomination of Bitcoin) will soon be able to earn yield.\n\n\u201cBabylon will be the catalyst that redefines the utility of BTC and paves the way for a new era of Bitcoin-native applications,\u201d said Luke Pearson, General Partner at Polychain Capital, in a release.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "It could be a paradigm shift, not just for Ethereum, but cryptos in general\n\nIndustry insiders believe the approval of Ethereum ETFs could see a slew of othger crypto-based ETFs\n\nLate last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared the way for the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe SEC approved 19b-4 forms for the ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy and Franklin Templeton.\n\nThe approval takes Ethereum-based ETFs one step closer to reality. Once available, traditional investors will be able to buy shares that track the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cEthereum (ETH) is currently in the spotlight as the SEC asked applicants for the ETH ETF to update their filings this week, increasing the odds of approval,\u201d says Hao Yang, head of financial products at crypto exchange Bybit. \u201cAlthough ETH has faced challenges in recent months, this move suggests a potential turnaround for the second-largest cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe surprise approval is sort of a volte-face at the SEC. In fact, virtually everyone was expecting the SEC to decline the applications.\n\n\u201cThe green light for Ethereum ETFs is a landmark decision that highlights Ethereum\u2019s status as a non-security,\u201d says Zina Ashour, founder, Women in Crypto Arabia.\n\nRead | Cryptocurrency market set to surpass $5 trillion in 2024: Ripple CEO\n\nShe explains that this distinction is pivotal \u201cas it exempts Ethereum from the strict regulations that govern traditional securities, thereby broadening the avenues for both institutional and retail investment\u201d.\n\nBroader impact\n\nAshour believes the SEC\u2019s move could set a precedent for the classification and regulation of other cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s endorsement of Ethereum ETFs marks a significant turning point not only for Ethereum but also for the wider cryptosphere,\u201d says Ashour.\n\nShe argues the approval will drive the entry of institutional investment into Ethereum. The Ethereum ETFs, Ashour explains, will take away the complexity of directly purchasing and storing the crypto. Secondly, they\u2019ll also offer a regulated and familiar path for investors to buy the crypto. This leads Ashour to believe that Ethereum ETFs could potentially have a positive impact on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the Ethereum ETFs could amplify market liquidity by drawing in more participants,\u201d says Ashour. \u201cEnhanced liquidity could stabilize prices and temper volatility, rendering Ethereum a more attractive investment proposition.\u201d\n\nShe also points out that there are over 20,000 altcoins in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. \u201cThe approval of Ethereum ETFs could indirectly influence these altcoins, potentially sparking increased interest and investment in them,\u201d argues Ashour.\n\nOpen the floodgates\n\nSECs approval of the Ethereum ETF forms follows approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January. These spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively hold more than 1 million Bitcoin, worth over $70 billion.\n\nRead | Bitcoin ETFs approval: A game-changer for cryptocurrency market\n\nAs the news of the approval made its way into the markets, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum actually dropped. Experts believe this was the classic case of traders selling the news after buying the rumor, earlier in the week.\n\nWhile the price of both cryptos has gone up since, Yang believes the prices will continue to fluctuate until the ETF decision is finalized.\n\nInterestingly, market analysts believe the approval of Ethereum ETFs could open the door to more crypto-based ETFs. In a note last Friday, Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, speculated that Solana and XRP might soon get their own ETFs.\n\nChanging political winds\n\nThe SEC approval of the Ethereum ETFs is just the first step of a long-winded process. Experts estimate that could take weeks, or even months, before the actual ETFs land on the trading floor.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF approval is being hailed as a symbolic victory for crypto.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin (BTC)'s $1.3T Market Cap and Ethereum (ETH)'s Innovations Make Furrever Token a Must-Watch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is in a dynamic phase, with Bitcoin and Ethereum at the forefront of innovation and growth. Bitcoin's market cap has surged to an impressive $1.3 trillion, reinforcing its status as the digital gold standard. Ethereum, meanwhile, continues to drive blockchain advancements with its robust smart contract capabilities and the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aimed at improving scalability and reducing transaction costs. Amidst these giants, Furrever Token (FURR) is carving out its own niche, offering unique appeal and significant growth potential.\n\nBitcoin's $1.3T Market Cap: The Digital Gold Standard\n\nBitcoin, the first and most prominent cryptocurrency, has reached a market cap of $1.3 trillion, nearing the value of silver. This milestone reinforces Bitcoin's position as a digital store of value, often likened to gold. Bitcoin's growth is driven by increasing institutional investment, mainstream adoption, and its finite supply of 21 million coins. Its decentralized nature and robust security through proof-of-work consensus make it a reliable asset. As more companies and financial institutions integrate Bitcoin, its influence on the broader cryptocurrency market grows, driving interest and investment in alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum's Innovations: The Backbone of Decentralized Finance\n\nEthereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem due to its versatile blockchain, which supports a myriad of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. The recent statements from Vanguard, a $7 trillion company, highlight Ethereum's potential and limitations. Although Vanguard has no immediate plans to support Ethereum ETFs, the blockchain's ongoing upgrades aim to address scalability issues and enhance transaction efficiency. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), is expected to significantly improve transaction speeds and reduce fees. This evolution is crucial as Ethereum powers a substantial portion of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space, making it indispensable for developers and investors alike.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: A Unique and Promising Contender\n\nAmidst the well-established Bitcoin and Ethereum, Furrever Token (FURR) is emerging as a unique player with its charming and engaging approach.

The token integrates adorable cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals, fostering a warm and friendly community.\n\nStrategic Tokenomics and Growth Potential\n\nFurrever Token's tokenomics are structured to ensure long-term growth. With 9 billion tokens in total, 65% are allocated for presale, 25% for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and 10% for the team, which will be locked for a year. This strategic allocation aims to provide liquidity while ensuring the team is committed to the project's longevity.\n\nThe presale has already raised over $1.1 million, and with the current price at $0.000648, there is an expectancy of up to 15X returns for early investors. The upcoming launch on PancakeSwap is generating significant excitement and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), making Furrever Token an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nWhy Furrever Token is a Must-Watch\n\nUnique Appeal: Furrever Token's whimsical approach with cat-themed visuals and community engagement stands out in the crypto market. Strong Community: A growing and active community on platforms like Telegram ensures continuous engagement and organic growth. Significant Growth Potential: With a presale price of $0.000648 and potential for substantial returns, Furrever Token offers an enticing opportunity for investors. Upcoming Launch: The planned launch on PancakeSwap and future exclusive content create a sense of anticipation and excitement.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin's impressive market cap and Ethereum's ongoing innovations underscore the dynamism of the cryptocurrency market. Amid these developments, Furrever Token presents a unique and promising investment opportunity.

        "content": "Ethereum whales have once again reinforced their faith in the smart contract network. Onchain data revealed that over half a billion dollars worth of ETH was staked in a single transaction. Etherscan captured the transaction worth a whopping 146 ETH, valued at over $580 million. This is likely the record for the most amount of ETH staked in a single transaction, one market observer noted.\n\nThis colossal move is a testament to the growing trust and interest in Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanism, especially as the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is on the horizon.\n\nEthereum Whale Stakes $580M ETH in One Epic Move 3\n\nMoreover, whales, individuals, or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrency have been the key players, as their significant stakes highlight the evolving landscape of decentralized finance [DeFi] and the increasing role of Ethereum as a foundational layer for various DeFi applications.\n\nDigging deeper, the amount of 146,110 ETH was staked via Lido, as revealed by the Lido DAO Bot on social media. The whale\u2019s contribution through Lido not only boosts the total value locked [TVL] in the platform but also highlights the growing trend of using liquid staking solutions to maximize returns while retaining flexibility.\n\nIn a decentralized staking solution such as Lido, users can earn staking rewards while maintaining the liquidity of their assets through stETH, a tokenized form of staked ETH. This dual benefit is that it attracts whales, entities, or individuals with substantial holdings, to contribute large amounts to the staking pool.\n\nEthereum Fork In Q1 2025\n\nAs reported by TronWeekly, core developers announced their plan to implement the Pectra upgrade by the first quarter of 2025. This decision emerged from a recent execution layer meeting, marking Pectra as the next pivotal advancement for ETH, following the successful Dencun upgrade of March 2023.\n\nPectra is slated to bring several critical enhancements, led by the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format [EOF]. The EOF will bring forth approximately 11 improvement proposals aimed at refining the ETH Virtual Machine [EVM] code on both Layer 1 and Layer 2 levels. These enhancements are expected to optimize the efficiency and functionality of the EVM, which is the backbone of ETH\u2019s smart contract operations."

        "content": "BlackRock has submitted a revised registration statement for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF. The updated S-1 filing also included details about the company\u2019s seed capital investor.\n\nNow, analysts suggest that U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could launch by late June.\n\nBlackRock Reveals Seed Capital Investor Information\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager submitted an amended S-1 registration statement nearly a week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 19b-4 forms for eight Ethereum ETFs, including its proposed iShares Ethereum Trust. Both filings need approval before the ETF can begin trading.\n\nIn the updated one, BlackRock disclosed information about its seed capital investor, who committed to acquiring $10 million worth of shares on May 21, 2024. The investor ultimately received 400,000 shares priced at $25.00 each. The asset manager also said the shares will be listed and traded under the ticker symbol \u201cETHA.\u201d\n\nEric Balchunas offered insights on the development, expressing optimism about its significance. He anticipated others to follow soon, likely accompanied by another round of fine-tuned comments from Staff. While Balchunas suggested an end-of-June launch as feasible, he emphasized higher approval odds around July 4, regarding an earlier approval as a \u201clong shot.\u201d\n\nGood sign.

End of June launch a legit possibility altho keeping my o/u date as July 4th https://t.co/WymshkTvat \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 29, 2024\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart remarked that BlackRock\u2019s updated S-1 is \u201calmost certainly the engagement we were looking for on the S-1s following the 19b-4 approvals. Issuers and SEC are working towards spot Ethereum ETF launches.\u201d\n\nHashdex Withdraws Spot Ethereum ETF proposal\n\nThis development comes the same day as a filing showing Hashdex recently withdrew its proposal for a spot Ether ETF, a day after its competitors, including BlackRock and seven other issuers, received approval for it.\n\nNo information has been provided regarding the reasons for Hashdex\u2019s decision or whether it plans to resubmit its proposal. According to its initial September 2023 filing, Hashdex\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF combined spot Ether holdings with Ether futures contracts within the same product to reduce potential manipulation risks.\n\nHashdex also aimed for its spot Ether ETF to reflect daily changes in the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price to address regulatory concerns about market manipulation.\n\nCompetitors like Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton have focused solely on spot-based Ether ETFs, making late amendments such as removing support for ETH staking in response to SEC feedback."

        "content": "Ethereum ETH/USD was the most targeted blockchain by hackers and fraudsters in May, constituting nearly 43% of the total losses.\n\nWhat Happened: The world's largest network for decentralized apps and services suffered the most individual attacks, totaling 9, in the month, according to a report released by Web3 security firm Immunefi.\n\nThe second on the list was BNB Chain BNB/USD with 4 incidents. Together, Ethereum and BNB Chain accounted for a massive 62% of the total losses across major chains.\n\nAmong the most sensational of Ethereum losses was the $21 million exploit on the Web3 game Gala Games GALA/USD.\n\nOverall, total cryptocurrency losses to hacks and rug pulls dropped 20% this year compared with the same period in 2023. Additionally, losses in May declined 28% month-over-month.\n\nWhy It Matters: Ethereum was the most targeted chain last month, and also during the first quarter.\n\nWith a vast array of decentralized finance projects, the network has been vulnerable to attacks from bad actors. It is the largest DeFi chain, with upwards of $64 billion in deposits as of this writing, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nThe Immunefi report specifically underlined that DeFi projects were the main target of exploiters, representing 100% of all the losses.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,743.49, marginally down 0.38% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Foresees XRP, Solana, Cardano ETFs Amid Bitcoin, Ethereum Approvals\n\nPhoto by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash"

But that wasn\u2019t the case, and she was actually behind the project in tandem with crypto promoter Sahil Arora. Jenner claims that she didn\u2019t have custody of any of the tokens and that Arora owes her \u201clots of money\u201d after he went \u201cradio silent.\u201d\n\nJENNER spiked in value and led to a growing wave of celebrity-backed meme coins, including from rapper Iggy Azalea and musician Davido, but Jenner's own token took a dive on Wednesday after she tried to expand upon that initial success.\n\nLate Wednesday, the decathlon gold medal winner launched a new version of the JENNER token on Ethereum, but with some tweaks to the formula.

        "content": "Bitcoin price is unable to overcome the $69,712 to $71,907 area of resistance.\n\nEthereum price will likely pullback into the major support level of $3,360.\n\nRipple price could end the consolidation between $0.463 and $0.572 range.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate in a range that offers a buying opportunity, while other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), look set for a potential price correction. ETH and XRP rallied 10% and 5%, respectively, right after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Ethereum\u2019s spot Exchange Traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin price eyes for a rally\n\nBitcoin price rallied 8% on May 20, but such an impulsive move could lead to a retracement. As seen in the chart below, BTC is currently being rejected by the order block between $69,712 and $71,240, which also harbors the weekly close at $71,280.\n\nSideline investors looking for buying opportunities could do so at the following levels:\n\nThe volume profile high node range that extends from $67,090 to $66,035. The 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is currently at $62,533, coinciding with the bullish order block range between $62,985 and $61,427.\n\nIf BTC bounces off the $62,533 level, it could rally 10% to the local top formed at $69,712.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators support the aforementioned bounce, which are firmly present above their respective mean values of 50 and 0, suggesting that the bulls are in control.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin's price closes below $58,271, it would invalidate this bullish thesis by producing a lower low in the higher timeframe, leading BTC to crash an extra 10% and hitting the previous support level of $52,400.\n\nEthereum price wants to move higher\n\nEthereum price broke above the falling wedge pattern and the 50 EMA level at $3,144 on May 20 and rallied 21%. Currently, ETH is being rejected by the bearish order block of March 12, ranging from $3,980 to $4,093.\n\nEthereum price could rally upwards in two ways:\n\nA break out above the daily bearish order block, extending from $3,980 to $4,093, flipping it into a support zone. ETH could pullback into the major support zones of 50-day EMA at $3,558, which roughly coincides with the bullish order block, stretching from $3,393 to $3,119.\n\nIf the conditions mentioned above are to play out, then the Ethereum price could revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $4,868.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $2,864 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 8% crash to the previous support level of $2,600.\n\nRipple price likely to end its consolidation phase\n\nRipple price is currently consolidating between $0.572 and $0.463 after a major 33% fall in mid-April. This 46-day consolidation has seen XRP forming higher lows in the daily time frame, indicating a decrease in selling pressure.\n\nIf Ripple price breaks above the $0.561 \u2014$0.572 range, it could rally 8% to revisit the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.621.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Ripple price breaks below the range of $0.463, then XRP would crash an additional 10% to its previous support at $0.419."

It's got a long track record as a crypto early adopter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Singapore bank has seen its market capitalization grow substantially since the start of the year, from $63 billion to $75 billion at the time of writing. It added support for China's CBDC, the e-CNY, last summer. And in 2020, when many banks were still blocking crypto transactions, the Singapore firm launched its DBS Digital Exchange.\n\nAnd when the exchange proved popular with its clients, the bank added a custody service as well.\n\n\"In 2022, DBS reported an 80% increase in the volume of Bitcoin traded on its DBS Digital Exchange,\" the bank wrote last year. \"Capitalizing on this momentum, the bank expanded its services to include digital asset custody, which resulted in a doubling of the number of Bitcoins under custody.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, DBS's shares are trading for $35.85 Singapore dollars, or approximately $26.55 in U.S. dollars. And Ethereum is currently trading for $3,756.96. That's a 1.5% drop since yesterday, but a 25% gain since last week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved Ethereum spot ETFs to trade on exchanges."

        "content": "ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has stated that cryptocurrency has become a significant political issue in U.S. elections, leading to the unexpected approval of key Ethereum ETH/USD ETF filings.\n\nWhat Happened: Wood made this remark at Consensus 2024, as reported by CoinDesk, attributing the sudden approval of Ether ETF filings to the growing importance of cryptocurrency in U.S. election debates.\n\nWood expressed surprise at the approval, stating, \u201cThe read was it was not going to be approved. It was absolutely not going to be approved.\u201d She further explained that the sentiment around the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) evolved in the House, leading to its recent bipartisan approval.\n\nWood also pointed out former President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing comfort with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including his recent decision to accept campaign donations in crypto, as a factor that has drawn attention to the sector.\n\nSee Also: Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat Post Double-Digit Gains As Memecoins Shrug Off Dips In Bitcoin, Ethereum: What\u2019s Goi\n\nWhile Wood suggested that a Solana SOL/USD ETF could be approved, she deemed meme coin-focused funds unlikely, stating that large brokerage firms and investment advisory companies would not accept more than \u201cthe majors.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters: Wood\u2019s comments come in the wake of her earlier predictions about the potential of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin ETF/USD. In April 2024, she raised her Bitcoin prediction by $2.3 million, suggesting that a $1,000 investment could be worth a significant amount by 2030.\n\nDespite Ether\u2019s recent spotlight due to the ETF approvals, Wood maintained her bullish sentiment on Bitcoin, stating, \u201cBitcoin, hands down. No question about it. It is a global monetary system. It is a technology, and it is a new asset class.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, she also highlighted how El Salvador\u2019s push for Bitcoin and AI could potentially increase its GDP 10X in five years.\n\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB attracted inflows of $4 million on May 29, and around $ 3 billion since the ETFs started trading in January, according to SoSo Value.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Edge Lower As Inflation Fears Grip Investors: Less And Less Of King Crypto Available For Masses, An \u2018Enormous\u2019 Bull Market Inevitable, Says Analyst\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors."

        "content": "KangaMoon (KANG) raises over $7.2 Million and reaches 32,000 Users\n\nNear Protocol crypto on the rise as network surpasses $200M in issued USDC\n\nEthereum Classic Price at an uptrend following latest updates\n\n\n\nEthena (ETA) rises 27% \u2013 How far can it climb in 2024?\n\n\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF has been listed on top of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) with the ticker symbol ETHA.This listing follows the SEC\u2019s approval of a total of eight spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Following this major move for ETFs in the Web3 space, traders have begun to diversify their holdings in order to get the most out of the market. Out of the thousands of available altcoins, five have stood out the most as cryptos that can surge in value immensely, and these include KangaMoon (KANG), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Chainlink (LINK) and Ethena (ETA). Let\u2019s take a look at these cryptocurrencies:KangaMoon ( KANG ) will revolutionise the meme coin landscape through the construction of a sustainable ecosystem that fosters significant token utility, one that transcends hype-driven trends. This is achieved through a strategic fusion of Social-Fi elements and Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics, which cultivates long-term value beyond just hype.In addition, the token\u2019s blockchain ICO has garnered significant traction, as the project now boasts a user base surpassing 32,000, while the token has experienced a growth of 400%. The presale itself also secured over $7.2 million in funding, which further solidifies investor confidence, as it is projected to break past $8 million by the end of the month. Moreover, KANG\u2019s initial price point was at $0.005 but now trades at $0.025 during the bonus presale stage.Not only does this reflect significant growth but the round also represents a limited-time opportunity to get KANG at a discount before it explodes in value. In addition, KangaMoon has already established its presence on prominent platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, facilitating investor analysis, and will soon get listed on BitMart, a major CEX. As a result, analysts are now projecting a 100x price increase following its launch.NEAR Protocol (NEAR) surpassed $200 million in natively issued USDC , which is a major milestone that can send the ecosystem demand and utility further. This will also have the effect of increasing demand for the NEAR Protocol crypto, which can result in a price uptrend.The on-chart metrics for the crypto are now bullish, as the NEAR Protocol price has found support at $7.70 after briefly passing the $8 price barrier. Now, the RSI and MACD data showcase a positive price momentum, and according to the NEAR Protocol price prediction, it can end Q4 of 2024 at $11.46.Ethereum Classic (ETC) is also experiencing an upswing in trader interest following its most recent integrations. For example, now anyone can mint the Ethereum Classic crypto through the usage of the F2Pool The on-chart metrics for the Ethereum Classic price are bullish, as the weekly price increase was by 20%, further solidifying it as a major contender. Based on the Ethereum Classic price prediction, by Q4 of 2024, the crypto can end the year at $45.71. Chainlink (LINK) expands services in nine different blockchainsChainlink (LINK) is consistently expanding the offering of its ecosystem, as within the past week, it saw 12 integrations of six chainlink services, all across nine different blockchains, including Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Linea, Metis, Optimism, Polygon, Scroll and zkSync.The Chainlink crypto has also increased in value as its weekly chart suggests a 10% uptrend, and could soon result in further gains. Based on the Chainlink price chart, it recently surpassed the $17 price barrier, indicating that $20 marks a major resistance point that it now needs to pass in order to reach new heights. According to the Chainlink price prediction however, the crypto can end Q4 of 2024 at $25.08.Ethena (ETA) is also at an uptrend as it experienced a 27% price increase during the past week fueled by ecosystem expansion. The team recently announced that USDe is the first integration, with the new UX layer of DeFi , Infinex. As a result, anyone can now deposit USDe and earn from Ethena while also earning Infinex governance Points (GP). The Ethena crypto could see a major uptrend as a result, further appealing to traders.According to the Ethena price chart, it broke above the $0.90 price barrier, and is closer than before to passing even above $1. According to the Ethena price prediction, it can end Q4 of 2024 at $1.33.With Ethereum ETFs being approved, the race is now on for more cryptocurrencies to get the same treatment. Out of the many cryptocurrencies available, the key ones that stood out the most include NEAR Protocol, Ethereum Classic, Chainlink and Ethena.However, the biggest growth was seen with KangaMoon as it's up 400% on the charts, and it has raised over $7.1 million so far. With a unique blend of Play-to-Earn (P2E) features, Social-Fi elements, and a community-driven approach, it is poised to dominate the charts in 2024 .

        "content": "The recently approved Spot Ethereum ETFs have been predicted to launch in June after updated filings from both BlackRock and Grayscale. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas forecasted the arrival of a crypto-based investment vehicle that will be the second such offering in the United States.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) surprised the entire finance sector with its rather abrupt approval of the ETH ETF. Although they did receive approval in May, the market is awaiting the products to go live, with some expectations arriving as June nears.\n\nAlso Read: XRP, Solana, Cardano ETFs Are Inevitable, Ripple\u2019s CEO Asserts\n\nEthereum ETF Could Go Live in June, Experts Predict\n\nThroughout this year, ETFs have dominated the digital asset sector. The industry\u2019s landmark approval arrived in January, with Spot Bitcoin ETFs launching. The impact was near-immediate, as BTC would reach an all-time high just three months after its debut.\n\nNow, the industry is awaiting whether the second-largest cryptocurrency could experience a similar success story. Subsequently, the recently approved Spto Ethereum ETFs are predicted to go live in June after recent filings. Specifically, Bloomberg\u2019s Balchunas noted when in the month the product could officially launch.\n\nGood sign. Prob see rest roll in soon. Then prob one more round of fine-tune comments from Staff. End of June launch a legit possibility altho keeping my o/u date as July 4th https://t.co/WymshkTvat \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 29, 2024\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Calls Bitcoin ETF Approval a \u2018Psychological Turning Point\u2019\n\nBalchunas forecasted that the ETFs could arrive by the end of the month. However, he also noted that he is maintaining an over/under date of July 4th. Furthermore, he relayed his expectation that there should be \u201cone more round\u201d of comments between issues and the SEC.\n\nThere is a belief that the SEC\u2019s approval was more political than anything else. Moreover, its political motives were to dispel the perception that the agency was ant-crypto. With the Ethereum product being approved, that has been achieved. Therefore, analysts don\u2019t expect any reason for the agency to rush the official launch of the offering."

The coin, which is backed by top executives from Telegram, has more than doubled in value over the week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nNOT logged a trading volume of $928 million in the last 24 hours, with its market cap surpassing $1 billion.\n\nThe rally outstripped the broader market's performance as Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD traded lower as of this writing.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded at 10:00 p.m. EDT) Notcoin NOT/USD +17.06% $0.01071 Worldcoin WLD/USD +4.75% $4.89\n\nAlongside, biometric-based cryptocurrency, Worldcoin, rose significantly in the last 24 hours, with trading volume more than doubling to $525 million.\n\nWhy It Matters: NOT's exponential growth comes as users hop on to mine the cryptocurrency through the play-to-earn Web3 game hosted on Telegram. The game's cryptocurrency offerings have grabbed the attention of Telegram's massive user base.\n\nMeanwhile, WLD's gains snapped a losing streak, as the project launched by OpenAI Chief Sam Altman, faces opposition over privacy concerns.

This follows the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) initial approval of Form 19-b last week.\n\nBlackRock Leads with New Ethereum ETF Filing\n\nThe SEC recently approved spot ether ETFs from major financial entities, including VanEck, Fidelity, and others, with BlackRock\u2018s iShares Ethereum Trust at the forefront.

They speculated that the bank holds the ETH on investors\u2019 behalf rather than it being direct bank assets.\n\nDBS Bank is no stranger to the cryptocurrency sector. It offers various services, including digital asset custody, a trading exchange for security tokens, and a portfolio management app that integrates traditional and crypto assets.\n\nIn 2020, DBS Bank launched a crypto trading and custody service and a platform for conducting security token offerings. At the time, the bank emphasized that it would not hold any assets on the exchange but would provide custody services for investors. \u201cAll digital assets are kept at DBS Bank, which is globally recognized for its custodial services,\u201d the bank stated. The services supported major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Ether.\n\nDBS\u2019s Digital Currency Initiatives\n\nSince then, DBS Bank\u2019s crypto sector has witnessed significant growth. In 2022, it reported a four-fold increase in Bitcoin purchases on its digital exchange, doubling total trades between April and June 2022. In 2023, it reported an 80% increase in Bitcoin trading volume, attributing this growth to the market instability following the crypto collapses of 2022.\n\nDBS has broadened its digital currency efforts beyond cryptocurrencies, engaging in government-related Web3 projects in Singapore like Project Guardian. This initiative successfully acquired tokenized Singapore dollars using tokenized Japanese yen.\n\nAdditionally, DBS is involved in Project Orchid for government vouchers and conducted a cross-border e-Chinese yuan transaction test for shipments between Singapore and India.\n\nFurthermore, its Chinese subsidiary, DBS Bank China, introduced an e-CNY merchant solution for businesses to accept payments in the central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bank also provides trading exchanges for security tokens and a portfolio management app catering to traditional and DeFi assets."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been gaining bullish momentum recently after experiencing a correction in the last couple of months.\n\nWith the asset approaching its recent high, investors are hoping for new records, but breaking the $4,000 resistance seems tougher than expected.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nIn the daily timeframe, the price blasted through the higher boundary of the large descending channel a while ago. The market has been consolidating since, but there is no sign of a deep correction.\n\nWith the $3,600 area turning into a support level, the market will likely break through the key $4,000 resistance zone. In this case, market participants can be optimistic that a mid-term rally toward the $4,800 all-time high might begin soon.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart is also demonstrating some bullish signs. The price has been declining inside a bullish flag pattern this week. However, it seemingly breaks the flag to the upside, a classic bullish continuation signal.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index also on the verge of rising above 50%, the momentum is also shifting in favor of a bullish move. Therefore, if things do not change drastically, it could only be a matter of time before the price breaks above the $4,000 resistance level.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nOpen Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a rapid impulsive surge last week, nearing the $4K mark. This uptrend has sparked renewed demand and heightened buyer activity as traders chase substantial profits.\n\nThe accompanying chart highlights Ethereum\u2019s open interest, a crucial metric for gauging futures market sentiment. Generally, higher open interest values are associated with bullish sentiment, while extremely high values can lead to increased volatility and potential liquidation cascades.\n\nThe chart reveals a steep rise in open interest alongside the recent bullish run. While this surge in open interest typically signals strong bullish sentiment, it also introduces potential volatility and the risk of sudden, unexpected price movements in either direction. Given the high open interest values and the inherent risks of heightened volatility, it is advisable for investors to manage their risk carefully in the short term."

Better security and sustainability. By switching to PoS, the ETH ecosystem reduced energy consumption by approximately 99.95%, making it a more sustainable and eco-friendly network.\n\n\n\nAccessibility limitations. Based on the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain requires interested users to own the native cryptocurrency before becoming validators, so they must buy ETH tokens using fiat currency or exchanging tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges. Users interested in becoming validators have to raise at least 32 ETH, which translates to about 50,000 USD, which is hardly affordable to most users.\n\nBased on the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain requires interested users to own the native cryptocurrency before becoming validators, so they must buy ETH tokens using fiat currency or exchanging tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges.

The PoS mechanism can also lead to a lack of decentralisation. Since it relies on delegates chosen to validate transactions, it's always possible for larger nodes to overpower smaller ones. The large nodes could potentially control the process of selecting delegates and prevent smaller ones from participating, eventually making the PoS less decentralised. Some ecosystem users are concerned about the possible centralisation of power in case a small number of influential delegates or validators gain control over the authority to approve and validate transactions.\n\nThe PoS mechanism can also lead to a lack of decentralisation.

This continuous evolution makes Ethereum an attractive platform for developers and investors, ensuring its continued relevance and growth.Some experts predict ETH will pass its current record peak as a response to the launch of spot ETF products in the US. This much-anticipated event is also expected to trigger price changes in the currency exchange market. With that in mind, those trading in Ethereum CFDs on investment platforms such as Octa may be able to capitalise on the predicted market movements.\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 31 May 2024 - With the current capitalisation of 468.42 billion USD, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalisation after Bitcoin. As many experts point out, Ethereum is well-positioned to remain a crypto powerhouse for many years to come. What makes this digital asset so unique, and what drove its robust growth over the recent years? In this article, the experts at Octa, a financial broker with globally recognised licences, give a rundown of the ETH's impressive ascent in the world of cryptocurrencies.In the week ending on 26 May, the price of Ethereum (ETH) gained nearly 25%, rising as high as 3,900 USD. The 4,000 USD price mark, crossed last in March, is clearly in sight after the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing and trading of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In the long-term perspective, the situation also looks highly promising for the ETH ecosystem as its prospects are buoyed by the growing adoption in various sectors and the strong developer community. Since becoming the second-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin in 2018, ETH has maintained this position. But what makes it so successful in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market?The idea of Ethereum was born in the mind of Vitalik Buterin, a visionary entrepreneur and cryptocurrency enthusiast. He first became engrossed in blockchain technology in 2011 and two years later proposed his own blockchain platform, Ethereum, as a new type of digital environment that can go beyond financial transactions.The Ethereum project was crowdfunded in 2014, raising over 18 million USD in Bitcoin, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. While Bitcoin was created as a decentralised digital currency to serve as an alternative to traditional currencies, ETH aimed to extend the capabilities of blockchain technology.In comparison to Bitcoin, Ethereum offers a more versatile blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. The new blockchain allowed for revolutionary possibilities: users could build new cryptocurrencies based on Ethereum by creating an ERC-20 token, which is a technical standard for establishing fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Many altcoins were created based this way, allowing for a wide range of applications. For example, one of the top Ethereum-based altcoins is Chainlink, or LINK\u2014a decentralised Oracle network that allows smart contracts on Ethereum to securely interact with real-world data, APIs, and other external sources.The new versatile framework facilitated the development of various decentralised solutions. The existing practical applications of Ethereum include:On 15 September 2022, Ethereum introduced a new phase in the development and evolution of its blockchain by transitioning to Ethereum 2.0. The upgraded platform boasted the following advantages:The Ethereum ecosystem can expand almost indefinitely with various new applications mushrooming in different sectors. However, in practice, some significant bottlenecks impede this progress. The main concerns that Ethereum 2.0 might have to address include:"

        "content": "The legitimisation of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has had a positive effect on cryptocurrencies. So, it\u2019s not surprising that an Ethereum ETF approval is towing the same line. It ushered in an influx of new investors, which boosted crypto token prices.Raboo ($RABT), a new kid on the block, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of this boost. Now, in presale, Raboo has raised an astonishing $1.5 million, which has been up 40% since its launch. Industry watchers expect $RABT to make a 100x gain before the end of the presale. That\u2019s why investors are rushing it.Crypto enthusiasts always believed that ETFs would boost crypto adoption. They allow traditional investors to get exposure to the tokens without directly owning them.The SEC took almost a decade to okay the first Bitcoin ETF application. But once approved, it boosted crypto prices. Ethereum ETF applications didn\u2019t take as long, and as expected, they\u2019ve had a positive impact on the market.Crypto prices have soared significantly in response to this development. ETH itself appreciated by 12% and drew near $4,000, which is remarkable. The Ethereum ETF approval is expected to spur the market on, with ETH set to appreciate further.To Michael Saylor, Ethereum ETFs are good news for Bitcoin. According to him, they \u2018serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin,\u2019 and would make the blue-chip asset more stable price-wise.Michael Saylor also thinks the development would accelerate institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Going by history, this would further boost crypto prices. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 in the last seven days. . It\u2019s a considerable increase when compared with its price action last year. The general feeling is that BTC will appreciate further and hit new all-time highs before the year runs out.Raboo is an enterprising new project primed to make substantial price gains, thanks to the Ethereum ETF approval. It infuses artificial intelligence with meme culture, birthing a dynamic space filled with engaged users. In essence, it provides a platform where crypto meme lovers connect, earn, and prosper.The ecosystem boasts NFTs, AI-generated memes, exclusive merchandise, and other mouth-watering rewards. Even more, the smart contract has been examined by leading crypto audit firm Solidproof. This guarantees security, eradicates worries, and puts investors' minds at ease.These unique offerings put Raboo ahead of the pack. Since it\u2019s still in presale, there\u2019s a decent chance it will appreciate significantly when it launches on exchanges. That\u2019s why experts say it's poised to hit a 100x profit once the presale ends.As Michael Saylor fancies a BTC boom following recent Ethereum ETF approval, Raboo is primed for huge price gains. That\u2019s because it offers several benefits for investors and has significant moon potential. It\u2019s still in presale, and for $0.0042, you can partake in this movement and benefit from the impending 100x price gain.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL (Times Internet Limited) hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.
