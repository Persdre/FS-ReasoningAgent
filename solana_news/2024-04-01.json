        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Prediction: Bitcoin $110,000, Ethereum $6,000 and O2T $100 Before Q4 2024 - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "Dubai, UAE, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As we navigate through the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, the horizon is bright with predictions of substantial growth for leading tokens. Among these, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the innovative newcomer Option2Trade (O2T) are set to experience remarkable surges in their value. With industry experts forecasting Bitcoin to hit $110,000, Ethereum to reach $6,000, and O2T to skyrocket to $100 before the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation. This article delves into the factors behind these bold predictions and what they mean for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Trailblazer's Trajectory to $110,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) , the original cryptocurrency, has always been a bellwether for the market. Its journey from a novel idea to a global financial phenomenon is nothing short of spectacular. The prediction of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $110,000 is rooted in its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Institutional investment, the halving events that reduce the supply of Bitcoin over time, and increasing global economic uncertainties all contribute to its bullish outlook. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to position itself as digital gold, its trajectory towards $110,000 seems not only plausible but inevitable.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Setting the Stage for $6,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) has carved its niche as the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, contributing significantly to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), promises improved scalability, security, and sustainability. These enhancements, coupled with the ongoing development within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, provide a solid foundation for ETH to climb to $6,000. As more developers and enterprises adopt its technology, Ethereum's influence and value are expected to soar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): The Dark Horse Racing to $100\n\nOption2Trade (O2T) emerges as the dark horse in the crypto race, with predictions placing its value at an astonishing $100 before Q4 2024. This A.I-driven trading platform distinguishes itself by democratizing access to sophisticated trading strategies and market insights, traditionally reserved for the realm of high-frequency trading firms and hedge funds. By leveraging artificial intelligence, O2T can analyze market data in real-time, predict trends, and execute trades with precision, offering an unprecedented advantage to individual investors. The potential of A.I in transforming the trading landscape, combined with O2T's innovative approach, sets the stage for its meteoric rise to $100.\n\nDriving Factors Behind the Predictions\n\nTechnological Advancements: For all three cryptocurrencies, continuous technological innovation is a key driver of their predicted price increases. BTC's enhancements in scalability, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) transition to Ethereum 2.0, and O2T's application of A.I in trading are pivotal developments.\n\nAdoption and Integration: The growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by institutions and their integration into traditional finance, along with O2T's potential to attract a new demographic of traders, contribute significantly to their bullish forecasts.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Sentiment: The cyclical nature of the crypto market, historical trends, and current investor sentiment play crucial roles in shaping these price predictions. The anticipation of increased demand against a backdrop of limited supply, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) , underpins these optimistic valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is poised for significant growth, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Option2Trade (O2T) leading the charge. As we look towards Q4 2024, the predictions of BTC reaching $110,000, Ethereum (ETH) climbing to $6,000, and O2T soaring to $100 reflect not just speculative optimism but a belief in the fundamental value and potential of these digital assets. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming months present an unparalleled opportunity to be part of a financial revolution that continues to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale:\n\n\n\nUse promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonus\n\nVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\n\n\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\n\n\nhttps://t.me/O2TOfficial\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Could This New Trillion-Dollar Market Opportunity Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Keep an eye on Wall Street's new asset tokenization trend. If it takes off, it could unlock enormous value for Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock (BLK 0.02%), the company that led the push for the first spot ETF for Bitcoin, is back at it again, this time with an entirely new investment product for the Ethereum (ETH -2.20%) blockchain. If all goes according to plan, this new product could revolutionize the way Wall Street does business.\n\nThat's a lot to ask, of course, but I think Ethereum could be ready to take full advantage of this potential new trillion-dollar market opportunity. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at what this new product is, why it launched on Ethereum, and how it could transform the world of finance.\n\nWhat is a tokenized asset fund?\n\nThe new product, called the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is a tokenized asset fund, and it's part of a long-term trend on Wall Street called asset tokenization. While the term \"asset tokenization\" might sound a bit intimidating, it simply refers to the process of transforming a real-world financial asset into a blockchain-based digital asset.\n\nIn this case, BlackRock is \"tokenizing\" nearly $100 million worth of cash, T-bills, and repos. When institutional investors buy into the fund, they receive a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain that has several unique properties. For example, it behaves much like a stablecoin, except that it also has the potential to pay out a daily yield. Stablecoins, which are usually pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, aren't supposed to be able to do that! The reason BlackRock's crypto token can do this is the result of the efficiencies made possible by blockchain technology.\n\nThat's why this product -- even though it might be a bit difficult to fully wrap one's head around it -- could be so revolutionary. In theory, blockchain-based digital assets should be superior to traditional, real-world assets. And thus, by extension, they should be more attractive to investors. According to BlackRock, the new tokenized asset fund boasts several key advantages for institutional investors when it comes to transparency, liquidity, and settlement time.\n\nLooking long term, a number of very smart people think asset tokenization could be a huge, multitrillion-dollar trend. Citigroup, for example, recently called asset tokenization a $4 trillion market opportunity. And the Boston Consulting Group has been even more bullish, calling it a potential $16 trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nWhy Ethereum?\n\nSo you can see where I'm going with this, right? Any blockchain that is leading this new multitrillion-dollar trend could see a huge spike in valuation, once investors realize what's happening and how significant it could be.\n\nThat's why it's so significant that BlackRock chose Ethereum for its first-ever tokenized asset fund. The Wall Street giant could have picked any other blockchain, but it picked Ethereum. And that's clearly due to the fact that Ethereum is the 800-pound gorilla of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. According to the total value locked metric (TVL), which measures how much DeFi activity is taking place on a particular blockchain, Ethereum currently accounts for a whopping 57% of all DeFi activity in the blockchain world.\n\nOf course, it's fair to push back and say: Hey, this is just one product. So what? Well, the bigger context is that BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with nearly $10 trillion in assets under management. Moreover, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is on record as saying that asset tokenization is an absolute megatrend for Wall Street. As soon as the new Bitcoin ETFs launched, he told CNBC that asset tokenization was coming next. So there's clearly more to come.\n\nPotential impact on valuation\n\nIf you agree that asset tokenization is the future of finance, and if you think that Ethereum will remain the DeFi leader, then it makes sense that Ethereum could soar in value as this trend gains legs. But by just how much?\n\nOne approach might be to track the TVL metric for Ethereum over time, to see if it is moving upward as expected. As more tokenized asset funds launch, and as Ethereum gets more and more involved with the asset tokenization trend, it should start showing up in the numbers. Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion and a market cap of $425 billion. Roughly speaking, every $1 billion gain in TVL is worth an additional $8 billion in market cap.\n\nOf course, it's not a slam dunk that Ethereum will be able to get in front of this trend. After all, blockchains are by their very nature decentralized. There's no CEO at company headquarters running the numbers, demanding Ethereum leap headfirst into this market opportunity.\n\nInstead, it's much more the case of thousands of Ethereum developers around the world steadily making new improvements to the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn, make the blockchain more attractive to companies like BlackRock when they launch new products. So, while you should definitely keep your expectations for Ethereum in check, this could very much be a trend worth monitoring."

        "content": "Larry Fink believes in the potential of tokenized assets in institutional business. \u00abHis\u00bb company Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, has launched a new money market fund based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAmong major asset managers, Blackrock is the one that is the most courageous in the crypto space. Last year, CEO Larry Fink said at a conference in New York that he believes \u00abthe tokenization of securities will define the next generation of markets\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe distributed ledgers [on blockchain technology] will enable real-time settlement of transactions and change the entire ecosystem,\u00bb Fink added.\n\nBlackrock's Second Crypto Fund\n\nIn early January 2024, Blackrock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust, an investment fund for Bitcoin, and aimed at investors who do not want to or cannot buy the cryptocurrency directly themselves. The fund already has a net worth of $17.9 billion. With its second product, Blackrock diving much deeper into the mechanics of the crypto world.\n\nA week ago, the asset manager launched its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund on the Ethereum blockchain under the name \u00abBuidl\u00bb. In the first few days, the inflows amounted to $240 million, according to the financial website \u00abBloomberg\u00bb (article subject to payment).\n\n1 Token = 1 Dollar\n\nThe product is a money market fund that works on a blockchain basis: shares are bought and sold via authorized wallets of Securitize Markets. Securitize Markets is a blockchain-based trading system that holds a broker-dealer license from the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra). \u00abBuidl\u00bb is aiming for a stable value of $1 per token. The dividends are distributed directly to the investors' wallets daily, as well as tokens.\n\nThe new product allows investors in the crypto space to invest in the money market. It bridges the growing ecosystem of crypto investors and the traditional money market.\n\nAround $360 million at Franklin Templeton\n\nA year ago, Franklin Templeton launched the Fonchain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), a crypto-based money market fund. So far, it has recorded deposits of around $360 million."

        "title": "Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price falls for a second consecutive day as bears ignite $91.91 million of liquidated positions.\n\nPast gains during the year\u2019s second quarter can be a positive amid uncertainty in SEC's Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin explains key steps for \"The Purge\" on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nDaily digest market movers: liquidations, historical Q2 gains, and The Purge\n\nEthereum's chances of seeing a significant price boost face uncertainty as the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to show any positive sign of approving applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. As a result, much of its price movements in the past months have largely been due to its high correlation with Bitcoin rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin shed almost 6% of its value, triggering similar losses in Ethereum, which has seen more than a 6.7% decline. Losses in the two largest cryptocurrencies saw over $500.6 million liquidated from the entire crypto market in the past 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $7.48 million. The total ETH liquidations sit at $91.91 million, with long positions accounting for $75.1 million.\n\nHowever, historical records show Ethereum may still have a positive second quarter despite the downbeat start. A chart by crypto analyst @ali_charts on X shows Ethereum's Q2 results have always been positive except in 2022, when it recorded a 67.34% loss. According to the charts, ETH's Q2 historical performance has an average of 66.59% and a median of 15.29% in gains.\n\nEthereum returns in Q2 chart\n\nAlthough, he also noted that the \"high probability\" of the SEC delaying approval for a spot Ethereum ETF can cause \"turbulence in the market.\" On the contrary, a green light from the SEC would give Ethereum more institutional backing and exposure to a large number of retail traders, which may cause a rally in its price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided insights that indicate long-term progress for the cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. On Monday, he highlighted in a blog post that a lesser-known Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the EIP-6780, was introduced during the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. He mentioned that EIP-6780 is a huge part of what he terms \"The Purge.\"\n\nThe Purge would help \"slim down Ethereum and clear technical debt,\" said Buterin. In essence, it would shift workload from the main chain, reducing the computational and technical resources of running an Ethereum node while boosting decentralization and security in the process, Buterin said.\n\nIn other news, Vitalik Buterin reposted on Tuesday a former blog post he wrote squashing Layer 3s that serve the same purpose as L2s. He mentioned that L3s only make sense if they serve a different scaling purpose from an L2.\n\nAlso read: Vitalik Buterin announces next step in simplifying Ethereum protocol, ushers in the Purge\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH could fall below $3,000\n\nIn an analysis on Monday, @ali_charts said in an X post that Ethereum could crash to $2,800 if it breached the $3,400 support level. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,362.1. However, another X user noted a strong historical bidding at the $3,200-$3,000 area.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis aligns with earlier predictions by FXStreet analyst Akash Girimath, who stated that Ethereum's price could sweep the range low at $3,054 if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity run."

        "title": "Debate on L3 networks' impact to Ethereum ensues after Polygon CEO comments - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Polygon CEO Marc Boiron thinks that L3s take away value from Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nRecent comments made by Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron have ignited a debate on the necessity and potential consequences of Layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing that they may divert value and security away from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe growth of adoption and development for L3 networks like Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and Degen Chain, have attracted significant activity across a number platforms, prompting key figures in the crypto space such as Boiron to voice their opinion on the matter of Layer 3 networks.\n\n\u201cL3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,\u201d Boiron said.\n\nBoiron argues further argued that if all L3s settled to one L2, Ethereum would capture little value, putting its security at risk.\n\nThe L3 debate has been brewing for some time now. In 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin began the argument that the purpose of L3s were to provide a \u201ccustomizable functionality\u201d towards L2s, although not necessarily operating as extensible layers of the core functionality designed for L2s. To Buterin, a third layer on the blockchain ecosystem would only be practical if its function fundamentally differs to what L2s already serve.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Boiron\u2019s assessment. Some respondents argued that L2 value is inherently tied to Ethereum\u2019s value, while others pointed out the potential benefits of L3s, such as lower bridging costs and specialized functionality.\n\nPeter Haymond, senior partnership manager at Offchain Labs, countered Boiron\u2019s claims. According to Haymond, advantages such as low-cost native bridging from L2, custom gas tokens, and specialized state transition are functions that don\u2019t necessarily \u201ctake value\u201d away from Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum Foundation researcher Patrick McCorry expressed surprise at Boiron\u2019s take, suggesting that L3s could allow L2s to become settlement layers and ultimately rely on Ethereum as a \u201cglobal ordering service [and] final judge of settlement.\n\nDegen Chain, a recently launched L3 running on top of the Base L2 network, is one of the L3 networks that have gained a significant traction (and volume), with one anonymous trader reportedly making as much as a $2 million profit over a $7,000 investment.\n\nDegen Chain, notably, was built using Arbitrum Orbit, a new offering from the Arbitrum ecosystem that enables developers to create \u201cmodular\u201d or customizable Layer 2 and Layer 3 chains. In this context, Orbit chains operate by connecting to the core ecosystem of Arbitrum, with the ability to settle transactions over Ethereum L2 solutions."

With the Fed expected to begin cutting rates again at some point this year, the analyst suggests that a similar scenario could play out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how [Ethereum] plays out here, if it does just continue to mimic sort of a bigger version of [its pattern in 2019] or if it does something completely different\u2026\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t like the fact that I compare it to 2019 because it\u2019s gone up, because it\u2019s been taking a lot longer, but still, because ETH/BTC continues to drop, and because the Fed has not yet pivoted, why would we assume that it\u2019s not following the same thing?\n\nNothing has changed, right? It\u2019s still bleeding against Bitcoin, the Fed has not yet cut rates, and that was the turning point for it at the midcycle top last cycle.\u201d\n\nCowen says that if Ethereum repeats its 2019 correction, then a multi-month consolidation may be in store before the Fed begins a quantitative easing (QE) and crypto markets bounce again near the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cIf you have a hard time with that \u2013 sort of a six to nine-month lull in the market \u2013 what\u2019s fascinating is that if everything\u2019s been shifted by about three quarters, what if you shift this again?\n\nYou go three quarters out, you get to the end of the year and then QE (quantitative easing) returns and you get another bull market \u2013 I mean maybe, maybe that\u2019s how it plays out.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,530 at time of writing, a 2.28% decrease on the day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Future of Finance: Coinbase\u2019s Alesia Haas on why Ethereum isn\u2019t a security and the crypto industry rebuilding trust after the FTX \u2018travesty\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Welcome to Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their roles in this vast, ever-changing ecosystem\u2014and what it all means for how we use money.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in the U.S., posting $273 million in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023, putting the firm\u2019s net profitability for all of 2023 at $95 million.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has always taken a long-term approach focusing on building in a compliant manner, even when it wasn\u2019t the popular choice,\u201d CEO Brian Armstrong said on a February earnings call. \u201cMany of our competitors cut corners and broke laws to get big fast, and we\u2019ve seen how that strategy played out.\u201d\n\nAlesia Haas joined the company in April 2018. She previously was CFO for Sculptor Capital Management (formerly Och-Ziff Capital Management Group), a global institutional alternative asset manager. She also served as CFO and head of strategy for OneWest Bank.\n\nIn a conversation with Fortune, Haas shared insights on Bitcoin\u2019s record high, the latest crypto bull market, the SEC\u2019s take on Ethereum, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing, and what drew her to the world of crypto from traditional finance.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin reached a record high above $72,000. Can you share some insight on what this means in a larger sense?\n\nI think it\u2019s important with crypto to zoom out and look at what has happened since the Bitcoin white paper and crypto first came on the scene. You\u2019ve seen four price cycles. What I love about looking at these price cycles is that every peak is higher than its last peak. And every trough is higher than the last trough.\n\nIf you look at this, you have a lot of volatility, but there is this steady up and into-the-right curve. When you look at the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year return of Bitcoin against every other asset, it has been one of the top performing assets over any other comparable.\n\nA lot of this was driven by the Bitcoin ETFs. What I think is important to note is that ETFs unlock new demand for this asset class. Previously, a lot of investment advisors couldn\u2019t access Bitcoin because of their investment mandates. Now they can buy Bitcoin in an ETF wrapper, and so it opens up new available capital.\n\nWhat does Bitcoin\u2019s rise mean for other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum?\n\nI think that we\u2019re starting to see differentiation between different cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, where Bitcoin is a store-of-value asset, and people are putting it in their portfolio as an important store-of-value in wealth creation.\n\nEthereum has become the protocol that developers are increasingly choosing to build decentralized applications on top of. While Bitcoin is the largest asset, we generally see \u201ca rising tide lifts all ships\u201d effect where crypto then comes up. But you\u2019re starting to see differentiation because people are choosing Ethereum, and it is increasingly going to change depending on developer activity and user activity of that platform. Stablecoins and NFTs are built on Ethereum. There are just a lot of new use cases built on top of that protocol.\n\nSpeaking of Ethereum, what\u2019s the latest with this SEC now attempting to define it as a security?\n\nEthereum is not a security. Historically, the SEC has repeatedly said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] has said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The core problem here is that we still do not have comprehensive crypto regulation at the federal level in the United States. And this is something that we feel passionately about. It\u2019s so critical to get regulatory clarity so we can have a clear, equitable, applied regulatory framework that will protect consumers and ensure responsible markets\u2014and also protect businesses like Coinbase, so we know how we can bring compliant products to the market and continue innovation here in America.\n\nWhat can we learn from the latest crypto bull market?\n\nIn general, what we\u2019re seeing is similar to past bull markets, whereas crypto prices rise, you see an increase in volatility, then you see an increase in engagement. As we shared on our Q4 earnings call in February, we saw elevated engagement, net inflows across the board in retail institutional, and we saw higher trading volumes.\n\nWith almost $12 billion of net inflows into ETFs, we\u2019ve seen a market cap of over $2.5 trillion. What this does is it puts crypto back in the headlines. It has become a topic of conversation in households. And we\u2019re seeing really great engagement from customers who sort of went dormant a little bit in 2021, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, this asset class is back.\u201d\n\nThe crypto sector nosedived after FTX imploded and cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested. He was just sentenced to 25 years in prison. Has the industry finally turned a page?\n\nWell, fraud is fraud. And I\u2019m pleased to see the process being followed when you have fraud in the markets. It\u2019s a travesty that occurred. But I think we\u2019ve moved on, and I think the market has largely moved on. Coinbase was always focused on compliance. We are excited to build and regain the trust of our customers. But there has been a flight to quality. We\u2019ve seen that flight to quality now over the past year. And we\u2019re pleased to continue to see people\u2019s focus and growth on good companies here.\n\nBefore joining Coinbase, you worked in asset management, as a CFO, and held senior roles at Merrill Lynch and General Electric. What most attracted you to your current company?\n\nI\u2019m old enough that I grew up in the early internet era and have just watched the transformation of how technology creates new use cases. When I learned about blockchain, I could see that if you tokenize real-world assets\u2014and send value peer to peer\u2014that was going to create a more inclusive, faster, and cheaper financial system. And that was such an exciting thing to be a part of.\n\nI have worked for banks and asset managers, and I saw how many people touch the transaction just to move money from me to you, and how many different steps and different market participants it takes. I saw the cost. I saw the friction. And I said, \u201cIf technology solves this, it will be adopted. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if.\u201d I wanted to be part of that excitement in the journey to build trusted products in this ecosystem.\n\nComing from traditional finance, I knew that if you\u2019re holding customers\u2019 assets, their wealth, their investments, you need to become a trusted brand. I thought I could really contribute value to Coinbase.\n\nHow would you describe the role of digital assets in the future of finance?\n\nWell, first of all, it\u2019s already here: 52 million Americans own crypto. We now have ETFs for anybody with a retirement account to own crypto. You can now send a U.S. dollar in the form of a stablecoin to anyone in the world, anywhere, anytime, cheaply and instantly. It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re already here.\n\nI think what we\u2019ll see is an increasing number of transactions happening on the blockchain. We\u2019ll tokenize more real-world assets. Just last week, BlackRock announced they\u2019re tokenizing a money-market fund. Now we have money-market funds where you can earn high yields but in tokenized form.\n\nThese are new ways that we can bring the global world together in a peer-to-peer way\u2014fewer intermediaries, lower costs\u2014and tokenize real-world assets, which makes those assets more available to more people in more markets. I think that\u2019s really exciting."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has revealed the next significant phase in the evolution of the Ethereum (ETH) network, termed as \"The Purge.\" In a recent communication, Buterin shared insights into the ongoing efforts to simplify the Ethereum protocol while enhancing its security measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of this evolution is EIP-6780, a lesser-known but pivotal improvement introduced in the Dencun hard fork. This enhancement aims to streamline the protocol by reducing the functionality of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, thereby enhancing implementation efficiency and bolstering security measures.\n\nThis move, as elucidated by Buterin, is part of a broader mission to declutter Ethereum's infrastructure and alleviate technical burdens. The Purge initiative entails eliminating redundancies, reducing resource loads and fortifying security protocols to bolster Ethereum's efficiency and resilience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nAmong the key transformations initiated under The Purge, Ethereum clients have witnessed a substantial reduction in code lines, with the elimination of support for pre-merge (PoW) networks. Additionally, Ethereum's storage mechanism has undergone optimization, significantly reducing storage requirements for node operators.\n\nThe Purge by Vitalik Buterin\n\nHowever, Buterin does not stop there. He outlines potential areas for further refinement, including the revaluation of precompiles and the optimization of historical data storage. These steps are aimed at enhancing the functionality of ETH while simultaneously reducing barriers to entry for node operators and developers.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin hints at the transition to SimpleSerialize (SSZ), a more efficient block structure, heralding a simpler and cleaner future for Ethereum's data management.\n\nThe overarching goal of \"The Purge\" is to streamline Ethereum's architecture, reduce technical complexities, and enhance its scalability and decentralization. By prioritizing protocol simplification and security enhancements, Ethereum aims to solidify its position as a leading blockchain platform capable of supporting diverse decentralized applications and use cases."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market entered April on a bearish note with leading digital asset Bitcoin showcasing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. The supply pressure spread across the market tumbled the top altcoins like Ethereum which recorded a 5.7% drop. This downturn breaks the support of week-long consolidation, indicating coin holders may witness a prolonged correction.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Price Prediction: BTC Sheds 2%, ADA & DOGE Drop 5% Amid Pre-Halving Uncertainty\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Faces Key Support Challenge Amid Emerging Bearish Pattern\n\nAmid the recent market consolidation, the Ethereum price wavered in a narrow range between the horizontal level of $3675 and $3445. The price rejection from both sides indicated a clear dominance from bulls and bears toward the asset.\n\nHowever, a deeper analysis of the 4-hour time frame chart showcased the price developing a bearish reversal pattern called double top. The chart setup is commonly spotted at the market top, bolstering a notable correction in the near future.\n\nThus, with an intraday loss of 5.77%, the ETH price gave a bearish breakdown from the neckline support of $3444. Sustaining this breakdown will intensify supply pressure and plunge the altcoin to $3250 or $3057, coinciding with the 38.2% and 50% retracement levels respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Skywards Proposes To Add Ethena\u2019s sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nEthereum Eyes $4500 Target in April Amid Historical Bullish Trends\n\nLooking at the historical data, Ethereum has shown predominantly positive behavior in April, with high returns in five out of the eight years listed. Notable surges in 2017 (+67.77%), 2018 (+70.29%), and 2020 (+55.04%) highlight this pattern, contributing to an impressive average April return of +23.66%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are exceptions, like in 2016 and 2022, when there were significant declines.\n\nAnyhow, if we consider the average return for Ethereum in April, the buyers may drive the asset to a high of $4500 by the end of the month.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBB Indicator: The converging bands of the Bollinger band indicator reflect increasing volatility in this asset.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) lines reflects an active correction trend in play.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs may overwhelm Ethereum ETFs if they are approved in May, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says.\n\nEthereum ETF delay may not imply rejection from the SEC.\n\nEthereum may see a decline if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) prices loses some ground on Monday, paring back some of the gains seen during the weekend, as traders continue to speculate over the possibility of an approval of the spot Ether ETF in May.\n\nBitwise Asset Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said in a Forbes interview published on Sunday that a delay to December would make the launch more successful. This comes at a time when other key market players have provided different views that lean towards the idea that the SEC will likely delay the approval of the seven spot Ethereum ETF filings.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Latest Ethereum ETF applicant wants 12-month delay\n\nMatt Hougan disclosed to Forbes that the recent demand for Ethereum ETFs is a \"natural pathway that crypto investors have followed for 15 years.\" He mentioned how investors usually follow a pattern of wanting exposure to Bitcoin and, eventually, other crypto assets. This follows the significant growth of Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, as they have attracted more than $10 billion in less than three months, making them the fastest-growing ETFs in history.\n\nWhile Hougan believes an Ethereum ETF will also attract investors, he suggested a 12-month delay will make it more successful. \"I think the Ethereum ETFs will be more successful if they launch in 12 months than (...) in May,\" said Hougan.\n\nHe further stated that traditional finance investors are still trying to master Bitcoin and the crypto market. \"I know that sounds goofy, but I think TradFi is still digesting Bitcoin and if you give TradFi time to get comfortable with Bitcoin and crypto, they will be ready for the next thing,\" Hougan emphasized.\n\nBitwise filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF on March 28, joining other giant institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC has refused to engage with these applicants and delayed any spot Ethereum filings. VanEck's filing is due for a decision on May 23 as a final deadline.\n\nAs a result, many analysts, including Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have lowered their odds of spot ETH approval. Still, the chief legal officers of Coinbase and Grayscale are optimistic of a May approval, citing Ethereum's commodity status.\n\nAmid the delay, the SEC has also issued subpoenas to three firms that transacted with the Ethereum Foundation, according to a Fortune report, in a bid to classify Ethereum as a security. While many have expressed concerns that such classification would hurt the chances of an Ethereum ETF, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview with Fox Business that a spot ETH ETF can still be possible even if the underlying asset is designated a security.\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH may crash if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nETH\u2019s price recently tagged the $3,574 mid-point of the $3,054 to $4,095 range it set up during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. While the move may be attractive to trade, \u201ca breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived,\u201d said FXStreet Analyst Akash Girimath.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s short-term range forecasts $4,000 but with a warning for eager ETH bulls\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAkash further emphasized that if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity collection, ETH may crash to the $3,000 psychological level."

Discover SCENE\n\nBase, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, hit a daily record of $1.22 billion worth of trading volume at decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Saturday. The frenzied surge in trading is due to a gold rush for meme coins that has Base-native coins like DEGEN and BRETT hitting over half a billion dollars each in market cap.\n\nThe network set a record for unique daily wallets interacting with a DEX on Saturday with 172,000, according to public blockchain data curated by Dune, and nearly matched that total again on Sunday.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Base has dropped into the new week\u2014but is still holding significantly higher than previous months, with about $965 million in volume on Sunday, and already $847 million worth so far on Monday as of this writing. As of this writing, Saturday's record is the only day that Base DEX volume has topped the billion-dollar mark.\n\nThe vast majority of that volume is coming from Uniswap, the cross-chain decentralized exchange, which sucked up $1.14 billion worth of the Saturday total. Uniswap has held a roughly 90% daily share of Base DEX volume over the past several days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBroadly, the Base network has seen a \"parabolic\" surge in overall transactions, tweeted Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of crypto analytics platform Nansen. The platform's data points to an all-time daily peak of nearly 2.39 million transactions on Friday, the most recent day shown on its Base dashboard.\n\nWith the increase in volume and a significant surge in daily active users, Base might end up being the go-to destination for meme coins for this cycle\u2014at least in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOther meme coins have even started migrating to Base, with HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu launching a Base version of their token last week. The price briefly spiked to over $10 before coming back down to parity with its Ethereum mainnet counterpart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nme 3 days ago - base season? can you guys just shut up, you just missed sol me today - were buying memecoins on a base L3 memechain strap in boys \u2014 moon (@MoonOverlord) March 31, 2024\n\nMany traders are calling for \u201cBase season\u201d in an effort to match the momentum of layer-1 network Solana. For the past few months, Solana has been the go-to destination for meme coins, with tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF) hitting over a billion dollars in market cap, and many others with hundreds of millions in market cap as well.\n\nWill the crypto gods give degens a chance to run it all back on Base?

That said, there are more efficient ways of cutting costs compared to layer-3s, according to Buterin.\n\nIn his article, which was published a year and a half ago, Buterin singled out three main visions for layer-3s: customized functionality for different use cases, customized scaling in various forms, and weakly-trusted scaling in the form of validiums, which are significantly cheaper compared to rollup but offer better security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin acknowledged that all of these three visions were \"reasonable.\" He was skeptical of a three-layer scaling architecture with the same scaling scheme, but the Ethereum co-founder also added that a third layer could work if it has a different purpose. \"Validiums on top of rollups do make sense, even if they're not certain to be the long-term best way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nThe debate surrounding layer-3s\n\nButerin's recent comment came after some prominent community members started debating the viability of layer-3 solutions.\n\nMert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO at Helius, recently opined that L3s were basically \"centralized servers settling on other centralized servers.\" \"The audacity some of you have to call Solana centralized for YEARS just to use literal web servers settling on other centralized web servers is absolutely wild,\" he added.\n\nUniswap CEO Hayden Adams was quick to criticize him, arguing that the Solana community should refrain from posting \"arrogant takes on scaling.\""

Analysts at the crypto trading firm QCP Broadcast said on Tuesday that the liquidations in the derivatives market signaled the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price decline below $66,000 and Ethereum (ETH) price drop to $3,320.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana-based meme coins yielded gains in the past day despite the market-wide correction.\n\nOptions market predicts correction in BTC, ETH prices\n\nBitcoin price declined to as low as $66,000 early on Tuesday on Binance, one of the largest centralized exchanges. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly dropped to $3,319, and cryptocurrencies suffered $157 million in liquidations.\n\nAnalysts at QCP Broadcast said in a Telegram post that the speed of Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price decline on Tuesday was due to large-volume liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges. Further, the perpetual funding rate on platforms like Binance dropped from as high as 77% to flat, stressing asset prices in the spot market.\n\nBTC/USD 15-minute price chart\n\nQCP Broadcast analysts expect Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to trade sideways after the correction.\n\nMeme coins gain from whiplash in Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe correction in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices was followed by likely capital rotation into meme coins as Solana-based assets noted double-digit gains on Tuesday. Data from CoinGecko shows Tombili the Fat Cat (FATCAT), catwifbag (BAG), BaoBaoSol (BAOS), Cat in a dogs world (MEW) and Book of Meme (BOME) prices rallied between 10% and 52% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana-based meme coins\n\nIn the ongoing market cycle, meme coins have yielded consistent gains for traders during corrections in large assets.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent report by CoinShares, the digital asset investment landscape has shown signs of recovery, with total inflows reaching $862 million last week. This nearly offsets the previous week's record outflows of $931 million. Despite the encouraging recovery, the report indicates a slowdown in ETF activity, hinting that the initial market hype might be cooling down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) emerged as a major player on the digital asset market, recording inflows of $865 million last week. This renewed interest is attributed to new ETF issuers in the U.S., which contributed $1.8 billion in inflows. However, these gains were partially offset by Grayscale's outflows of $967 million. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $2 million.\n\nThe standout performer on the altcoin market last week was Solana (SOL), which saw an impressive $6.1 million in inflows. This surge reflects growing investor confidence in Solana's blockchain platform and its potential to offer innovative solutions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, this surge in inflows for Solana aligns with a bullish trend in SOL's price performance.\n\nDespite experiencing a 6.52% dip in the last 24 hours, bringing the Solana price down to $182.49, the cryptocurrency has shown impressive resilience and growth. Over the past 30 days, Solana has surged by 40.33%, demonstrating rising confidence and optimism in the platform's capabilities and future prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum struggles amid altcoin surge\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced its fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $19 million. This pattern is often observed following major network upgrades, indicating investor apprehension about the success and stability of these updates.\n\nOutside of Solana, altcoins witnessed a total inflow of $18.3 million last week. Other notable performers included Filecoin (FIL) with inflows of $3.9 million, Polkadot (DOT) with $2.4 million, and Chainlink (LINK) with $1.9 million. The latest data from CoinShares underscores the dynamic and often divergent nature of the digital asset market."

        "content": "In the last 30 days, Ethereum is down by 4%. Notwithstanding this, ETH holders demonstrate a tendency for liquid restaking protocols to be preferred over the likes of the traditional platform of Lido Finance. The data collected by the Dune Analytics dashboard, developed by researcher Hildobby, points to a substantial change. It shows that Lido Finance has the biggest outflow of Ethereum (ETH) regarding other peers withdrawing more than 284,800 ETH.\n\nLido, however, remains the leader in the Ethereum staking market, with a share of 29.7%. The flow of stakers is in the direction of platforms with liquid restaking options. These, among others, include Ether fi and Renzo Protocol, which received an impressive amount of inflows. Ether fi and Renzo have received over 400,000 and 280,100 Ether, respectively, making them the preferred platforms for stakers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Stakers Prefer Eigenlayer\u2019s Flexible Solutions\n\nEther fi and Renzo are currently the largest liquid restaking platforms identified by DefiLlama. Fi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) is $3.1 billion. At the same time, the investments in Renzo exceeded $2.1 billion. In total, users have locked over $8 billion in these protocols. This tendency shows a certain dominance of platforms that use mutually exclusive capabilities of Eigenlayer, thus providing for wider staking opportunities.\n\nMoving from Lido to Ether fi and Renzo is a characteristic of the increasing popularity of Eigenlayer points among the participants of DeFi. These liquid restaking protocols use the Eigenlayer framework to allow stakers of their ETH to assist other networks and solutions. This approach came into favor when the Ethereum blockchain changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September 2022.\n\nEigenlayer Expands Use of Staked ETH Widely\n\nWith the transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, the staking practice was revolutionized. Stakers are involved in securing the Ethereum chain by depositing the ETH with validators. Eigenlayer has evolved this model by enabling the staked ETH to be employed across a larger range of protocols and chains that are interconnected with Ethereum.\n\nRead Also: ProShares Introduces First Bitcoin ETF To Target 2x Daily BTC Return\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Tue 02 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nEthereum remains a major player in the blockchain space, but challenges in scaling persist. Recently, Vitalik Buterin has reignited the debate on \u201cLayer 3\u201d while discussing promising lighter alternatives for cost optimization. Let\u2019s explore these avenues brimming with opportunities for the future of Ethereum.\n\nDecrypting Layer 3 in Ethereum\n\nLayer 3, or additional layers, are built on top of existing Layer 2 scaling solutions. They raise many questions about their true contribution. Indeed, they can reduce certain fixed costs associated with batch settlements and deposits/withdrawals. However, they do not \u201cmagically\u201d improve the overall transaction throughput. Therefore, their real added value in optimizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the long term should be carefully assessed. Moreover, adding this extra layer raises legitimate concerns about its potential complexity.\n\nFurthermore, some question the possible trade-offs between cost reduction and other crucial factors such as decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nThe Emergence of Lighter Alternatives\n\nHowever, in his recent statements, Vitalik Buterin highlighted the existence of lighter alternative approaches capable of offering similar cost savings to those promised by Layer 3. In other words, there may be simpler and more effective solutions. These could solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues without adding a complex new layer. Although few concrete details have been provided so far, this perspective opens the door to promising new thoughts.\n\nIndeed, lighter solutions could potentially offer better compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s existing architecture. This would facilitate their adoption and integration. Moreover, they might prove easier to understand, develop, and maintain for the developer community.\n\nIn the face of scaling challenges, Ethereum must choose its path wisely. Layer 3 promises cost reduction but raises questions about their complexity and compatibility with foundational principles. The lighter alternatives mentioned by Vitalik Buterin, although not detailed, offer promising avenues for potentially simpler and more flexible solutions.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum & Milei Moneda soar as Solana eyes $260 peak - crypto.news",
        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA) targets Uniswap launch, with investors excited about the 100% price surge from $0.010 to $0.020 in its ongoing presale.\n\nSolana integrates CCTP for blockchain interoperability; the price dips from $200 to $180, with the April 2024 outlook at $260.Ethereum addresses validator concerns, but Buterin proposes failure rate penalties.\n\nThe price rises to $3,000 and may reach $5,000 by May. In the world of cryptocurrency, Solana, Ethereum, and Milei Moneda are making waves with their recent developments. From integrations to proposals and upcoming launches, each holds the promise of shaping the future of the market in unique ways.\n\nYou might also like: Developer activity rises on Cardano; Milei Moneda eyes growth\n\nSolana integrates circle\u2019s CCTP, sees decline\n\nIn a move set to enhance interoperability across blockchain ecosystems, Solana has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).\n\nThis partnership enables developers on the Solana ecosystem to seamlessly exchange USDC tokens with Ethereum and other leading blockchains directly. The integration underscores Solana\u2019s commitment to fostering a more interconnected DeFi landscape as one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this positive development, SOL experienced a decline from the $200 region to the $180 region in March 2024. This dip reflects broader market volatility, with several other cryptocurrencies also witnessing declines. Experts still set an optimistic eye on the $260 mark by April 2024.\n\nNotably, Solana\u2019s recent integration with CCTP positions it as a top ten cryptocurrency in the ongoing efforts to improve cross-chain interoperability and expand the utility of digital assets.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, partnerships like this one by Solana highlight the importance of collaboration in driving innovation and adoption within the industry.\n\nEthereum validators face decentralization challenges\n\nRecent discussions among Ethereum stakeholders have highlighted concerns regarding the increasing number of validators on the network. Venture investor Evan Van Ness and staking pool operator Gabriel Weide caution that an overabundance of validators could lead to failed transactions, potentially undermining the Ethereum network\u2019s reliability.\n\nPeter Kim, head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, acknowledges the impressive growth in the number of validators but notes that the current limit of 32 ETH per validator may be artificially inflating this figure. However, he suggests that changes to this limit on the Ethereum network may be imminent.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a solution to enhance network decentralization. Buterin\u2019s proposal involves penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate, aiming to level the playing field between large and small Ethereum stakers.\n\nYou might also like: Milei Moneda sees investor interest as Solana, Toncoin, surge\n\nDespite these controversies, Ethereum moved from the $2,000 region to the $3,000 region between February and March 2024. Experts are optimistic that the project will continue soaring to even the $5,000 region again by May 2024, hence creating a new ATH.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to navigate issues of scalability and decentralization, Buterin\u2019s proposal offers a potential path forward to address these concerns and ensure the network\u2019s long-term viability, proving to be the best crypto to buy.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA): A rising project with innovation\n\nMilei Moneda, one of the top DeFi projects of 2024, is poised for a significant milestone as it prepares to debut on Uniswap in May 2024.\n\nWith a focus on economic freedom and peer-to-peer markets, Milei Moneda stands out as one of the top crypto coins for its deflationary token model and integration of popular NFTs, making it the best crypto investment.\n\nAnticipation is high among investors, who expect a 100% surge in price from $0.010 to $0.020 once it launches. By boasting a total token supply of 500,000,000, the project prioritizes accessibility, liquidity, and rewards, aiming to carve out a top spot among the top altcoins.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, Milei Moneda emerges as a compelling option, offering both profit potential and alignment with current market trends in DeFi.\n\nWith Solana eyeing $260, Ethereum addressing decentralization, and Milei Moneda promising an economic revolution, the crypto frenzy continues.\n\nWhether it\u2019s exploring established giants or betting on rising stars, the journey through the crypto space promises both challenges and rewards for those willing to embrace its dynamic nature.\n\nTo learn more about this project, visit the Milei Moneda presale or join the community"

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction: Ethereum, Solana & Bitcoin \u2013 European Wrap 2 April - FXStreet",
        "content": "The US Dollar\u2019s strength is one of the reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) is showing weakness. A spike in buying pressure for the Greeback suggests that the market is risk-off, which could result in a negative impact on risky assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nSolana\u2019s (SOL) price falls sharply on Tuesday, influenced by the steep decline in Bitcoin prices, even though the altcoin registered $6.1 million in inflows from institutional investors last week. While the recent meme coin frenzy may have benefited Solana and attracted capital last week, a recent drop in on-chain activity and a slowdown in inflows could be behind the recent price decline.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum 'Purge' Plans - Blockhead",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has laid out new steps for Ethereum's 'Purge' to improve the blockchain's efficiency.\n\nIn a blog post written by Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder detailed how upcoming initiatives, known as The Purge, will refine the protocol.\n\nThe Purge removes excess and obsolete network history to simplify its process while introducing new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to streamline operations and security.\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nEIP-6780 is central to the Purge and aims to reduce \" the functionality of the 'selfdestruct' opcode, which destroys the contract that calls it and empties its code and storage, so that it only works if the contract was created during the same transaction. \"\n\nEliminating the selfdestruct code will enable each Ethereum block to have more storage slots.\n\nBuilding upon Ethereum's recent update, Dencun, the blockchain will see Ethereum blocks being removed from Ethereum nodes through EIP-4444.\n\n\u201cPotentially, if each node stores small percentages of the history by default, we could even have roughly as many copies of each specific piece of history stored across the network as we do today,\u201d Buterin said, attaching a meme to his blog post:\n\nBy reducing the amount of storage needed to run an Ethereum node will in turn reduce the amount of people required to do it. EIP-4444 simplifies the workflow of node operators and increases Ethereum node decentralization.\n\nA LOG reform is proposed by Buterin to address inefficiencies in decentralized applications.\n\n\u201cOur current mechanism is too slow, pushing dApps towards centralized solutions. By simplifying the LOG opcode and leveraging ZK-SNARKs, we can create a more efficient and decentralized framework for accessing logs,\u201d Buterin says.\n\nHe also announced that Ethereum consensus layer is moving to SimpleSerialize (SSZ).\n\nSSZ offers simplicity, efficiency, and compatibility with various applications. It offers shorter and more efficient Merkle proofs, ensuring better performance and reducing computational load.\n\n\"These efforts are about more than simplification; they\u2019re about ensuring Ethereum\u2019s resilience and adaptability in the face of future challenges,\u201d Buterin concludes.\n\nAs Ethereum improves its technical capabilities, institutions are highly anticipating the SEC's approval of ETH ETFs.\n\nA few days ago, Bitwise filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC but expressed hope for the regulator to delay their decision until the end of the year."

        "content": "Skywards, a prominent entity within the DeFi ecosystem, has put forth a proposal to integrate the staked version of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar, sUSDe, into Aave V3 on Ethereum. This proposal follows a consensus reached during the TEMP CHECK stage, signaling potential enhancements to the Aave protocol.\n\nSkywards Seeks To Add sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nsUSDe offers a stable crypto-native solution with lucrative yield-earning opportunities, making it an attractive asset for borrowers within the Aave ecosystem. The proposed contract address for sUSDe is 0x9d\u2026 with plans to implement an oracle through CAPO to ensure reliable price feeds.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRisk parameters for the integration will be provided by Chaos Labs, underscoring Aave\u2019s commitment to robust risk management practices. Notably, Skywards is driving this proposal, emphasizing community-driven decision-making and transparency in governance processes.\n\nThe proposal marks a significant step forward in expanding Aave\u2019s offerings and attracting a diverse range of users seeking stable and yield-generating assets within the DeFi landscape. As the proposal advances, community and service provider feedback will play a crucial role in shaping the final decision.\n\nIf the response remains positive, the proposal will progress to the ARFC snapshot stage, followed by an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement. If the proposal passes the governance process of Aave V3 on Ethereum, potentially reshaping the DeFi landscape.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Co-Founder Unveils Protocol Simplification Strategy \u201cThe Purge\u201d\n\nProposal For Adding Renzo Protocol\u2019s ezETH to Aave V3\n\nEarlier, Aave revealed that a temporary check on community sentiment is underway to gauge interest in adding support for Renzo Protocol\u2019s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH on Aave V3 Ethereum. The proposal aims to introduce a new asset class to Aave and enhance the diversity of the lending and staking category.\n\nLiquid Restaking tokens (LRTs) have gained significant popularity recently due to their productivity as staking assets. These tokens are highly correlated with Ethereum and are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH for yield leveraged staking strategies, particularly with the introduction of eMode.\n\nThe integration of ezETH into Aave is expected to increase demand for ezETH, resulting in boosted revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol. Moreover, it\u2019s anticipated to enhance liquidity and peg stability for ezETH. The proposal highlights relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) for Renzo Protocol, including Total Value Locked ($1.9 billion), Total supply (526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH), and 24-hour trading volume ($80.2 million).\n\nIf consensus is reached during this temporary check, the proposal will escalate to subsequent stages, including Snapshot and ARFC, before final confirmation through an AIP vote. For further details and documentation, interested parties can refer to Renzo Protocol\u2019s resources, including their website, documentation, GitHub repository, audits, and Chainlink Data Feed.\n\nAlso Read: Hacker Calls for Live Apology from Prisma Finance Post $11M Heist\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
