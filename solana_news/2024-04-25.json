        "title": "SEC sued over Ethereum, crypto firm asks court to state token is not a security - Fortune",
        "content": "A bitter legal fight between the crypto industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission grew more intense on Thursday as Consensys, a major backer of the Ethereum blockchain, filed a lawsuit against the agency in Texas federal court. The complaint seeks to head off an impending SEC lawsuit against the company over features of its popular MetaMask wallet, but also asks the court to resolve one of the biggest legal uncertainties hanging over the crypto industry by stating that Ethereum\u2019s digital token, Ether, is not a security.\n\nIn its 34-page legal filing, Consensys uses dramatic language to argue that the SEC\u2019s efforts to exert jurisdiction over Ethereum is both illegal and a threat to blockchain technology more broadly.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if he or she were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nThe new lawsuit comes as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler pursues an aggressive enforcement campaign against leading companies in the crypto sector, including Coinbase and Uniswap. In recent weeks, this campaign has involved a wave of subpoenas asking firms and developers for documents related to their dealings with the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, which supports the blockchain\u2019s development.\n\nGensler\u2019s tactics have angered many in the crypto industry who have complained the SEC has failed to provide clear rules or to create a regulatory model that accounts for the distinct features of blockchain technology. Gensler has disputed this, claiming existing securities laws are clear and sufficient, and that the crypto industry refuses to comply with them.\n\nThe controversy over Ethereum has been especially heated since the SEC has signaled repeatedly in the past that the blockchain\u2019s tokens, like Bitcoin, are not securities and therefore outside its jurisdiction. This includes a landmark 2018 speech where a senior official stated that Ethereum had become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s decision last year to allow Ethereum futures trading\u2014an implicit acknowledgement that Ether is a commodity. Meanwhile, video has surfaced of Gensler himself, in his role as a private citizen, telling hedge funds in 2018 that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nThese precedents, however, have failed to dissuade Gensler, who appears to be using a recent feature of Ethereum, known as staking, as grounds for the recent legal campaign.\n\nA warning notice and a preemptive lawsuit\n\nThe Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC earlier this month issued a so-called Wells Notice, which describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm, and often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint added that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker dealer.\n\nAccording to Consensys, the SEC objects to MetaMask offering users a means to stake Ethereum on their behalf. Staking is a relatively new process for Ethereum, introduced on a blockchain-wide basis in September 2022, that replaced energy-intensive mining with a system of validators who pledge collateral in order to become a trusted validator.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Consensys founder Joe Lubin described as \u201cpreposterous\u201d the theory that staking transformed Ethereum from a commodity into a security.\n\n\u201cThe act of staking is really just posting a security bond so you can get paid to contribute labor and resources to help operate the Ethereum protocol. Now they\u2019re trying to turn that into some sort of investment contract,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune about the lawsuit or on the agency\u2019s view of the legal status of staking.\n\nLubin also stated that Gensler\u2019s legal position appeared to be an attempt to halt the overall growth of crypto, and to justify the SEC blocking pending applications by companies to launch spot ETFs for Ethereum following the huge popularity of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to regulate a technology on its merits, which the SEC shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re trying to stifle certain kinds of innovation. And they\u2019re trying to do that because probably they see Ether spot ETFs as a floodgate that\u2019s going to bring a lot of capital into our ecosystem,\u201d said Lubin.\n\nThe Consensys lawsuit was filed in Texas, which dovetails with a broader strategy of the crypto industry to tee up eventual legal appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The circuit has shown greater skepticism of agency actions than other courts and, if the industry can win a favorable judgment, it would likely tee up an appeal for the Supreme Court.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear for now what will happen in the event the SEC chooses to file a lawsuit on its own to follow up on the Wells Notice instead of resolving the issues with Consensys in the Texas court.\n\nThe complaint itself asks the court for a number of additional rulings beyond declaring that Ethereum is not a security. Those include declarations that MetaMask is not a broker dealer, and that the SEC is violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process. It also seeks an injunction barring the SEC from conducting any investigations on the premise that Ethereum is a security."

        "content": "Stripe Enables Merchants To Accept USDC Payments on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon\n\nPayments giant Stripe has announced its return to the cryptocurrency space after co-founder John Collison revealed their plan to allow merchants to receive funds in the form of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin. According to Collison, the \u201ctransactions instantly settle on-chain and automatically convert to fiat\u201d and will begin as soon as this summer.\n\nBusinesses utilizing Stripe's technology will have the capability to accept payments made in USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market and the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. By embracing USDC, Stripe aims to empower its users by facilitating global transactions and providing customers with easy, fast, and secure payment options, regardless of their access to traditional banking services or credit cards.\n\nJohn Egan, the head of crypto at Stripe, expressed enthusiasm about the integration of stablecoin payments, highlighting the potential to enhance merchants' reach and offer their customers a seamless payment experience. Stripe plans to initially support USDC transactions on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks, with additional network compatibility to be announced closer to the launch date.\n\nThis move marks Stripe's reentry into the crypto landscape after its initial foray in 2014 when it became one of the earliest major companies to accept Bitcoin payments. However, the company discontinued its crypto services in 2018 due to rising costs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite this setback, Stripe remained optimistic about cryptocurrencies as a whole."

        "content": "Polkadot\u2019s governance is currently mulling over a proposal to activate SnowBridge, a cross-chain bridge designed to link the Polkadot blockchain with Ethereum.\n\nA cross-chain bridge essentially serves as a decentralized application (DApp), streamlining asset transfers between blockchains to enhance token utility by fostering cross-chain liquidity.\n\nMarket observers have highlighted the significant role SnowBridge would play in enabling Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem to tap into Ethereum\u2019s extensive DeFi landscape.\n\nThe SnowBridge proposal has garnered substantial support from the community due to the potential benefits, t, with all cast votes currently in favor of its implementation. If approved, SnowBridge is slated to go live in 28 days.\n\nWhat is SnowBridge?\n\nSnowBridge is one of the many bridges under development within the Polkadot ecosystem. This initiative, a collaboration between Snowfork and Parity Technologies, aims to revolutionize the movement of Ethereum assets into and out of Polkadot.\n\nCurrently, bridging ERC-20 tokens into Polkadot necessitates using bridges reliant on third-party signatures. While this method is standard in Web3 ecosystems, it poses limitations for Parachains and dApps on Polkadot due to its impact on their trust model.\n\nSnowBridge offers a solution through a trustless model that relies solely on signatures from first-party Ethereum and Polkadot validators. It operates on BridgeHub and is poised to enhance cross-chain interaction between Polkadot and Ethereum.\n\nSnowBridge has been in development for some time and was deployed on the Polkadot parachain testnet Rococo in January 2024. Subsequently, developers utilized it to transfer assets between the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and AssetHub on Rococo, with ERC-20 tokens initially being the sole supported asset type.\n\nSince its deployment, several updates to SnowBridge have been implemented based on thorough testing and audits conducted by the team and security firms.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

        "content": "The blockchain race is about to get even more crowded: Movement Labs, a San Francisco\u2013based software development team that\u2019s building a layer 2 Ethereum blockchain, has closed a $38 million funding round, Fortune has exclusively learned.\n\nPolychain Capital, the crypto VC mega firm led by Coinbase alum Olaf Carlson-Wee, led the Series A, with participation from other digital-assets-focused investors including Hack VC, dao5, and Robot Ventures.\n\nMovement\u2019s raise comes on the heels of more sizable rounds for other companies building new blockchains, including Monad Labs, which raised $225 million to build a layer 1, and Berachain, another layer 1 developer that recently announced a $100 million Series B.\n\nWhile the flurry of fundraises reflects a return to crypto-focused venture investments, the concentration of capital around blockchains also indicates an increasingly competitive landscape for companies hoping to build the next Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Movement cofounders Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon said they hope to differentiate Movement by building the first layer 2 blockchain atop Ethereum that utilizes Move, a programming language originally built by Facebook for Diem, its ill-fated stablecoin project.\n\nRead more: We\u2019re Gen Z college dropouts who raised $41.4M for our blockchain startup. Here\u2019s how we did it\n\n\u201cWe are delivering Move to the front door of Ethereum, and it\u2019s this ecosystem that we\u2019re serving,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cA lot of folks who never wanted to leave Ethereum are, for the first time, going to be able to benefit from the security performance of a next-generation virtual machine.\u201d\n\nAccording to Scanlon and Manche, Movement Labs will soon announce its devnet and aims to launch its mainnet in the late summer or early fall. The company also plans to launch its own token, tentatively named Move.\n\nThe Ethereum movement\n\nTo outside observers, the proliferation of new blockchains may seem like overkill\u2014a view often shared by those in the industry. The first, Bitcoin, created the concept of cryptocurrency in 2009; the next major advance came in 2015 with the launch of Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications ranging from exchanges to money-lending protocols.\n\nDevelopers since then have been vexed by blockchains\u2019 speed and cost, with a series of layer 2s built atop Ethereum, as well as new layer 1s such as Solana, promising faster and cheaper transactions. As evidenced by the recent congestion issues plaguing Solana amid its memecoin mania, the problems remain.\n\nTwo recently launched blockchains, Aptos and Sui, came with a new value proposition: Each boasted teams of developers from Facebook who helped build the crypto-focused programming language called Move. They also created the Move Virtual Machine, a kind of computer program undergirding a blockchain that would represent a next-generation update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nAs Manche and Scanlon explained, while Move and its new virtual machine would come with better security and capabilities than EVM, most developers were still building for Ethereum, which had much stronger community backing. Even if Sui and Aptos could boast better performance, they couldn\u2019t necessarily build a thriving new ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAptos and Sui raised a lot of money,\u201d Manche told Fortune. \u201cBut they failed to execute on the community aspect.\u201d\n\nMovement, in contrast, is building its layer 2 on top of Ethereum but while using the Move programming language and the MVM. It\u2019s also building a tool called Move Stack, which will allow the Move Virtual Machine to be adoptable by other blockchain networks outside of Ethereum. Scanlon said they\u2019ve been contacted by \u201cquite a few\u201d different blockchains, including Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nTheir thesis is that developers will want to build using Move, which they say is more intuitive than other languages, such as Solidity, but still be part of the Ethereum community. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to bring Facebook on-chain,\u201d Manche said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the language that Facebook built to Ethereum.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin hit a multi-year low in April.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the gap between the two could become more pronounced.\n\nInvestors are losing their faith in Ethereum as the cryptocurrency continuously fails to keep pace with Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains.\n\nAnd things could get worse for the world\u2019s biggest altcoin.\n\nNot only have the odds for a US spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund getting approved in May dropped, but Ethereum exchange-traded products suffered $34 million worth of outflows this past week, CoinShares data shows \u2014 making them the only asset group among those CoinShares tracks to register a net outflow since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cETH sentiment is anecdotally at the lowest it has been in years, despite recent developments such as the BUIDL fund by BlackRock,\u201d Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, told DL News.\n\nThe decreasing optimism comes as smaller altcoins, like Solana, have attracted investors who don\u2019t expect Ethereum investments to yield as high returns as they did in the past.\n\nA Bitcoin-driven market\n\nIn previous bull markets, Bitcoin has outperformed other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the cycle \u2014 a trend that looks to be playing out again.\n\nThis time the focus on Bitcoin has been catalysed by inflows to the 10 US Bitcoin ETFs that launched on January 11.\n\nThey have so far seen over $12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nYet, Ethereum has not managed to capitalise on the rally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin \u2014 or ETHBTC \u2014 fell to a low of 0.046 in April, creating the biggest price gap between the two assets in almost three years.\n\nThat means that since ETHBTC peaked in 2022, an investment in Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum by 44%.\n\nThe ETHBTC trading pair shows the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin. Traders use this metric to gauge the relative strength of Ethereum against benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEven though some people may not view ETH as an altcoin per se, its over- or underperformance relative to Bitcoin is a powerful metric to try and understand what kind of market we are in,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs continue to steam ahead, the price gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more pronounced.\n\nAnd there\u2019s reason to believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue to soar. Hong Kong recently approved the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which are set to begin trading April 30.\n\nEthereum ETF approval looks unlikely\n\nWhile Hong Kong also approved a spot Ethereum ETF, the odds of US regulators approving similar funds on May 23 \u2014 the deadline for when they have to either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s application \u2014 are low.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put odds for a May approval at around 25%.\n\nSimilarly, punters on blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket put the odds of an approval at 13%.\n\nThis week, BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF application while competitor Grayscale filed to convert its futures Ethereum ETF to a spot fund.\n\nDespite this, analysts remain sceptical that any US spot Ethereum ETF will be approved.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF is almost certainly going to be rejected in May, which has dampened flows into ETH in already existing [exchange-traded] products,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSolana steals the spotlight\n\nAmong so-called altcoins, Ethereum is the largest, with a market value of $384 billion. But this success is a double-edged sword, according to Nolan.\n\n\u201cETH has a large market cap and investors have turned to lower cap alternatives,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nOne popular alternative is Solana.\n\nMost traders assume it would be difficult for Ethereum\u2019s market value to exceed that of Bitcoin. So with Bitcoin sporting a market value of $1.27 trillion, Ethereum traders see limited upside potential.\n\nDespite rallying 546% over the past year, Solana\u2019s market cap is a comparatively low $64 billion, leaving more room for it to grow.\n\nTraders are also starting to pay more attention to Solana\u2019s price compared with other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI have noticed much more attention this cycle vs. last cycle to SOL/ETH and SOL/BTC pairs,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSigns of hope\n\nThere\u2019s still hope Ethereum could stop bleeding against Bitcoin \u2014 but not for a while.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF should help drive interest. Nolan said he expects an ETF will \u201clikely\u201d be approved in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, if the current bull market repeats previous ones, Ethereum should do better as time goes on.\n\nUntil then, traders will continue to watch the ETHBTC chart closely for clues as to where the top two cryptocurrencies are heading next.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Consensys also claims that Ether \u2013 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform \u2013 is a commodity and not a security.\n\nThe blockchain company claims apps that allow people to make transactions using Ethereum are not securities brokers and \u201ctherefore cannot be regulated by the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to expand its regulatory purview, the SEC would effectively destroy value for hundreds of millions of ether holders and bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling the technological evolution of the internet,\u201d the company claims.\n\nThe complaint wants a court to agree with Consensys\u2019 claims that the SEC has no legal authority to regulate ether, software interfaces built on Ethereum or \u201cthe Ethereum blockchain in general\u201d. This complaint has been filed in a US district court in Texas.\n\nThe SEC did not respond to a request for comment from Coindesk on the new Consensys lawsuit.\n\nCrypto crackdown\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on various crypto trading platforms in the US in recent years. The US agency claims that digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are subject to US securities laws because they are investment contracts. Critics of the SEC claim there the regulations around digital assets in the US are unclear.\n\nLast year, the SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance, claiming the crypto exchanges had acted unlawfully in the country. Towards the end of 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao plead guilty to US charges and the crypto exchange agreed to pay more than $4bn to resolve an investigation.\n\nLast month, the SEC scored a victory in its lawsuit against Coinbase, when a judge ruled that its claim that the cryptocurrency exchange engaged in unregistered sales of securities could be heard by a jury at trial.\n\nThe SEC is facing a hit from recent criticisms, however. Last week, two SEC lawyers resigned after a US judge sanctioned the regulator for \u201cgross abuse\u201d of power in a crypto case, Bloomberg reports.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "content": "San Francisco-based blockchain development firm Movement Labs has raised $38 million in a Series A round led by Polychain Capital.\n\nVenture capital firms Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5 and Aptos Labs also participated in the round for the Move programming language-based project.\n\nMovement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche could not disclose a valuation or the structure of the round but told The Block that \u201cthe substantial capital raised speaks volumes about the immense potential our investors see in our ability to revolutionize the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement shared with The Block, the funding will support Movement Labs\u2019 mission to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum. This project aims to address smart contract vulnerabilities and enhance transaction throughput via the Movement zero-knowledge Layer 2 blockchain.\n\n\u201cThis Series A funding enables us to aggressively hire top talent in engineering, research, product, business development and other key functions to execute our roadmap. [It] allows us to significantly scale our 40+ person team,\u201d Manche said.\n\nMore specifically, Manche told The Block, Movement Labs would be expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region and making significant investments in building out its formal verification and security research team. \u201cWe are also doubling down on our zero-knowledge proof engineering capabilities to push the boundaries of scalability and privacy,\u201d Manche added.\n\nMovement\u2019s Layer 2 would expand the usage of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed at Meta by a team composed of people from Facebook\u2019s now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.\n\nIn terms of the timescale for its rollout, Movement is launching its public testnet, Parthenon, in the coming weeks and is aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of the year, Manche said.\n\nHow Movement's Layer 2 works\n\nThe project's team explained that Movement introduces a new, novel execution environment designed for over 30,000 transactions per second and leverages a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement to bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nReentrancy attacks \u2014 enabling malicious parties to repeatedly drain funds from smart contracts by exploiting the code execution order \u2014 are one of the most common vulnerabilities in DeFi, according to web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi. Movement's Move-EVM aims to prevent attack vectors like reentrancy from executing, allowing developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, the team added.\n\n\u201cThe two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\u201d Manche said. \u201cMy co-founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of [the Ethereum programming language] Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs is also developing the Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups like Optimism, Polygon and Arbitrum. The Movement Labs team said that it intends to collaborate with projects across the Ethereum ecosystem \u201cto scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs previously announced in September it had raised $3.4 million in a pre-seed funding round, with investors including dao5, Varys Capital, Blizzard Fund and Borderless Capital. Angel investors, including Eigenlayer\u2019s Calvin Liu, Berachain\u2019s Smokey The Bera and Avail\u2019s Anurag Arjun, also participated in the round."

Discover SCENE\n\nPayments processor Stripe is back in the crypto game after announcing today that it will soon allow merchants to receive funds in the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin.\n\nStarting this summer, the San Francisco-based firm will let companies that use its technology accept USD Coin (USDC) for online payments. USDC is the second biggest stablecoin in the crypto space and the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about empowering Stripe users to accept stablecoin payments, helping them expand their global reach and give their customers access to easy, fast, and trustworthy transactions even if they don\u2019t have a bank account or credit card,\u201d John Egan, head of crypto at Stripe, said in a press release.\n\nStripe will initially support USDC transactions on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks, a Stripe spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt, adding that \u201cthe final, more expansive list will be announced close to launch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in 2014, Stripe became one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin payments. Its crypto initiatives fizzled in 2018, however, when the company shuttered the option citing rising costs on the world's biggest blockchain.\n\nDespite dropping the service, the company said at the time that it was still \u201cvery optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall.\u201d\n\nIn March 2022, Stripe edged back toward the crypto space by making its payment platform available for NFT purchases and other Web3 companies, promising fraud prevention features like know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Last year, the company was rumored to be working with Twitter on payment features.\n\nToday, Stripe says that it will allow merchants to accept USDC and settle transactions on chain. Payments made in the stablecoin will automatically be converted into fiat for deposit into the merchant\u2019s Stripe account, the company explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that have a value pegged to another asset, like dollars or gold. They are designed to be less volatile than Bitcoin or other digital assets that notoriously go up and down in price.\n\nThese coins and tokens are typically used by crypto traders to quickly enter and exit positions in other coins or tokens without converting them directly into a fiat currency like U.S. dollars\u2014epecially when access to such currencies is either restricted or prohibited.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "SEC Postpones Ethereum (ETH) ETF Decision, Solana (SOL) Climbs 12% as Network Issues Resolve, Furrever Token (FURR) Excels in $1M Presale - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency landscape is currently witnessing significant movements and regulatory developments that are shaping the future of digital assets. From the SEC's delayed decisions on Ethereum (ETH) ETFs to the surge in Solana's (SOL) network performance and the charming ascent of Furrever Token ( FURR ) , the dynamics within the crypto market continue to offer both challenges and opportunities for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nSEC Delays Decision on Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETFs, Extending Market Uncertainty\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decision regarding the spot Ethereum ETF applications submitted by Grayscale Investments and Franklin Templeton, casting prolonged uncertainty over the introduction of these investment vehicles on U.S. stock markets. This delay continues the trend of cautious regulatory scrutiny in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector.\n\nPreviously, in a landmark decision last January, the SEC had approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which led to significant market inflows and demonstrated a strong investor demand for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Encouraged by this development, Grayscale attempted to convert its existing Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETH ETF in October. Shortly after, in February, Franklin Templeton also submitted an S1 form, signaling a robust interest among financial giants to facilitate access to Ether, which ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nDespite the evident enthusiasm and forward momentum from these asset management firms, the path to regulatory approval remains strewn with obstacles. Industry experts, such as those from JP Morgan, express skepticism regarding the rapid approval of these ETFs, estimating the probability of a favorable outcome by the May deadline to be less than 50%. This skepticism reflects the SEC's meticulous strategy in assessing new ETFs, emphasizing the protection of investor interests above all.\n\nThe ongoing postponements prompt speculation about the broader impact on the cryptocurrency market. A denial of these applications might lead these firms to consider legal action against the SEC, highlighting the tense interaction between evolving financial innovations and traditional regulatory frameworks. Nonetheless, the final decision by the SEC will critically shape the market landscape, potentially easing the integration of crypto assets into conventional financial systems or presenting new barriers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs developments continue to unfold, the cryptocurrency community and prospective investors remain keenly focused on the SEC's actions. The forthcoming decisions will be pivotal in determining the future of Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. and will significantly influence the accessibility of digital assets to mainstream investors, marking a critical moment in the integration of blockchain technologies within formal financial systems.\n\nSolana (SOL) Sees 12% Increase as Network Congestion Clears and Block Production Stabilizes\n\nSolana has shown notable signs of recovery today, successfully breaking past the $150 resistance level, with its price now standing at $157.08 according to recent CoinMarketCap data. This 1.81% rise over the past 24 hours marks a significant turnaround for the cryptocurrency which had been struggling with network congestion issues.\n\nThe recovery in Solana's network is primarily attributed to improvements in block production, which has returned to a normal rate with an average block time of two seconds. Recent updates from SolanaFloor indicate that all 409 transactions were confirmed successfully, signaling a robust rebound in network health. This improvement has led to positive speculation about an increase in demand for Solana's native token, SOL.\n\nSolana's network had faced severe congestion problems, causing delays and operational challenges for many projects within its ecosystem. Some projects were forced to postpone their launches, while others sought alternatives, moving their operations away from Solana during the congestion period.\n\nHowever, the situation has seen a dramatic change with the latest update on block production. This development might signal a new phase of growth and stability for Solana, encouraging both current and potential project developers about the network's reliability.\n\nThe resolution of these issues can be credited to the efforts of Solana\u2019s development team, including cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko, who have been actively addressing the scalability challenges. A significant breakthrough was achieved earlier this month when a major fix was implemented on the testnet by the core development team, supported by additional enhancements from other validator clients such as Anza.\n\nThis collective effort has not only resolved the immediate technical issues but also contributed to a substantial 24.5% increase in trading volume, pushing it to over $3.14 billion. The Solana community and investors are now looking forward to a promising future, energized by the network's recovery and the potential for continued growth and enterprise adoption.\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Emerges as a Delightful Contender in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nFurrever Token ( FURR ) has made an impressive entry into the cryptocurrency market, quickly setting itself apart from more traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with its captivating, cat-themed design. Designed to resonate with cat lovers, Furrever Token offers a unique, heartwarming experience that infuses the digital currency space with a new level of cuteness.\n\nStrategically positioned for growth and long-term viability, Furrever Token allocated 65% of its tokens during the presale phase, successfully raising over $1,000,000. This significant achievement highlights the strong investor confidence in the project's vision and potential. Additionally, the decision to lock 10% of the tokens for the team underscores a commitment to the project's future prospects and stability.\n\nFurrever Token has also placed a strong emphasis on security and compliance. Comprehensive audits conducted by Securi Lab have bolstered its credibility, ensuring that the project meets high standards of safety for its participants. Beyond its financial attributes, Furrever Token has fostered a vibrant community atmosphere. Nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram contribute to a dynamic and engaging environment, turning the project into a movement that extends beyond traditional cryptocurrency dynamics.\n\nAs the presale phase draws to a close, anticipation is mounting for Furrever Token's upcoming launch on PancakeSwap. With the potential for returns up to 15X and a current trading price of $0.000648, Furrever Token is poised to capture both the hearts and investments of the cryptocurrency community. It offers a refreshing and cheerful alternative to conventional memecoins, appealing to both seasoned investors and newcomers attracted by its charming theme.\n\nFor anyone seeking further information or needing assistance with Furrever Token, official communications are advised to be conducted through the designated support channel at support(at)furrevertoken.com to ensure authenticity and avoid potential scams.

The 34-page legal filing features dramatic language arguing that the SEC\u2019s efforts against ETH are illegal and threaten overall blockchain technology. The debate on Ethereum\u2019s digital token, Ether, being a security has been a key argument for the SEC, especially with Spot Ethereum ETF applications pending.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if they were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring [the] use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Bracing for Bullish Trends? Exchange Reserves Hit 2-Year Low\n\nThe SEC Continues Its Battle Against Ethereum And The Crypto Industry\n\nThe SEC is currently pursuing an aggressive enforcement battle against the cryptocurrency industry. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has unleashed multiple subpoenas, asking firms for documents related to the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, many in the industry have responded negatively to these efforts, saying that the initiative violates privacy and has been totalitarian.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Expected to Deny Spot Ethereum ETF Next Month\n\nFurthermore, the Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC issued a Wells Notice in early April. This describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm. It often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint adds that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer. The SEC may follow up with a new lawsuit around the Wells Notice instead of resolving the lawsuit imposed by Consensys in court. However, their plan remains unknown."

Discover SCENE\n\nYet another CryptoPunk has sold for an astonishing sum: On Thursday, an ultra-rare Alien Punk from the NFT collection traded hands for $12.38 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPunk #635, one of just nine Alien Punks in the influential 10,000-piece Ethereum NFT collection, sold for 4,000 ETH this morning. The sale was facilitated by crypto art brokerage Fountain, with the piece going to an anonymous collector who has yet to reveal their identity.\n\nThe eye-popping trade comes just weeks after two other Alien Punks sold for near-record shattering amounts. In early March, an anonymous crypto trader bought Punk #3100 for $16.03 million worth of ETH, in the second-largest on-chain CryptoPunk transaction ever recorded. Weeks later, Punk #7804\u2014another Alien\u2014sold for $16.42 million in ETH, taking the (silver) crown as the second-most expensive Punk sale in history.\n\nThe largest CryptoPunks sale of all time took place in NFT heyday of early 2022, when a crypto startup CEO purchased yet another Alien Punk\u2014#5822\u2014for 8,000 ETH, worth over $23.7 million at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptoPunk 635, the Alien originally owned by Larva Labs and sold at the Christie\u2019s Contemporary Art Evening Sale in May 2021, has just been acquired by an anonymous collector in a deal brokered by Fountain.

CryptoPunks, arguably the first NFT collection to attract substantial value and relevance after their creation in 2017, appear to have maintained their position over the last two years as rare cultural artifacts.\n\nOther once-coveted profile picture (PFP) collections have struggled to recapture dominance since the collapse of the NFT market in mid-2022. The Bored Ape Yacht Club, for instance, has seen its assets' value shrink to a floor price barely above $40,000, according to data from NFT Price Floor. That\u2019s down more than 90% from the peak USD price seen back in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther collections that previously defined the NFT landscape, like Azuki and Doodles, have similarly seen their price floors drop by over 50%.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

The funding will support the company's mission to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities and enhancing transaction throughput.\n\nMovement Labs Series A Funding\n\nThe investment round saw participation from prominent venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs, demonstrating strong industry confidence in the Movement ecosystem.\n\nFounded in 2022, Movement Labs aims to tackle the prevalent smart contract vulnerabilities within the Ethereum ecosystem while introducing a novel execution environment designed for 30,000+ transactions per second (TPS). By leveraging a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement, the Movement Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 blockchain will bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks. Movement's Move-EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing. The team calls this the \"Integrated Approach\", where multiple modular elements such as shared sequencing, embedded formal verification provers, alternative data availability, and Ethereum settlement can combine to power one blockchain, enhancing security and performance.\n\n\"The two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\" said Movement Co-Founder, Rushi Manche. \"My Co-Founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\"\n\nIn addition to the flagship Movement L2, Movement Labs will introduce Move Stack, an execution layer framework that is compatible with many of the rollup frameworks from companies like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The team's vision is to collaborate with other Ethereum players to scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\n\n\"While the core focus of most other rollup teams is scalability, Movement's key insight is that scalability alone is not why we are yet to see mass adoption. The MoveVM offers a developer experience that is intuitive and bug-resistant as well as highly scalable. By marrying these benefits with the network effects and base-layer security guarantees of the Ethereum ecosystem, we believe Movement can build a flourishing ecosystem that is home to a new generation of mainstream applications,\" said Polychain's Bobby Beniers in a statement.\n\nThe team had previously announced a $3.4 million pre-seed round in September 2023. Users will be able to interact with its network this Summer.\n\nFor more information about Movement Labs and a guide to participate in the devnet, please visit: movementlabs.xyz , follow on X @movementlabsxyz and on Discord .\n\nAbout Movement Labs:\n\nCo-founders, Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, early builders in the Move ecosystem, founded Movement Labs in 2022 as the first integrated blockchain network, powering the fastest and most secure Layer 2 on Ethereum.

That says we\u2019re getting to warmer days of spring as it were. But really, summer happens when you break the previous all-time high in market cap and things go utterly bananas. So this [chart below is altcoins] excluding Ethereum, so this is the rest of the space, really starting to accelerate and sometime in 2024 we will hit an all-time high market cap of altcoins and this chart will go truly into the banana zone.\u201d\n\nPal also predicts that the crypto market will have a \u201ccrypto fall\u201d similar to the 2013 and 2017 cycles when the market extended rallies even higher. Many analysts believe that crypto runs in four-year cycles and divides the cycles up into four seasons of the year to explain the different phases.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about crypto summer just in very simplistic terms. Here is the chart of the seasons. So spring is green. We had a great spring this year. Summer is when a lot of the gains start to happen. Fall was tricky last time around. We got a stunted cycle. If you remember that kind of double-toppy style thing.\n\nIt was highly unusual. 2017, and 2013 were typical of the fall season. And so we don\u2019t know how this one\u2019s going to play out. I think it plays out more like 2013, 2017, but it\u2019s all assessing the odds as we go. But right now this is the easy year, the summer.\u201d\n\nPal predicts that crypto summer will begin in the next month to month and a half.\n\n\u201cVery soon, like in the next month, next month and a half, we will start to hit the banana zone. And this is what happens when you hit the banana zone. Things get absolutely wild, which is the really magical part of why this is the greatest macro trade of all time is this part and it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, Pal suggests that during \u201ccrypto summer\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) could soar into the six-figure range, reaching as high as $300,000.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Breaking: US SEC To Deny Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 Reuters - CoinGape",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deny the much-anticipated approval of spot Ethereum ETF, as per sources familiar with the matter. The SEC\u2019s mindset toward approving spot Ether exchange-traded funds was never clear as the SEC tries to classify Ethereum (ETH) as security and delays its decision on spot Ether ETF for several issuers.\n\nUS SEC to Refuse Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nIssuers of spot Ether ETFs and other firms expect denial of their applications next month by the U.S. SEC after bad meetings with the securities regulator in recent week, reported Reuters on April 25.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark Invest and other issuers have filed with the SEC to approve and list ETF tracking the spot prices of Ether (ETH), similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs. VanEck and Ark Invest are first in line for the SEC\u2019s decision on May 23 and May 24, respectively.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the SEC and its staff have shown no interest in the spot Ether ETF and its potential. Four people who participated said the discussions were one-sided.\n\n\u201cIt seems more likely that approval will be delayed until later in 2024, or longer,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF analysis at data firm VettaFi, who is tracking the issue closely. \u201cThe regulatory picture still seems cloudy.\u201d\n\nThe SEC is taking a similar stance against spot Ether ETF when Gary Gensler-led agency rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade. The Grayscale Investments\u2019 win in a lawsuit against the SEC forced the regulator to consider spot Bitcoin ETF approval, but Gensler was still not interested in it after the approval.\n\nThe denial will be a setback for the crypto market as participants believe spot ETFs pave the way for rising adoption of crypto, as seen in spot Bitcoin ETF. Also, spot XRP and SOL ETFs can be expected if the SEC approves the spot Ether ETF.\n\nThe SEC has only disclosed one meeting on spot Bitcoin ETF, which was in March. The SEC and Coinbase met to discuss Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum Trust into spot Ether ETF.\n\nETH Price Fall on This News\n\nWhile Hong Kong regulator has approved spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs and listing is expected on April 30, traders have responded immediately to the news of delay.\n\nETH price extended drop to over 5%, with the price currently trading at $3,097. The 24-hour low and high are $3,074 and $3,292, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 35% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum futures OI has also dipped in the last 1 hour, with a 24-hour fall of over 1%.

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana, Ripple on the Brink of Critical Breakouts: How to Trade Them - Investing.com",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have experienced a downturn post-Bitcoin halving, marked by lower trading volumes.\n\nEthereum and Solana are struggling to break key resistance levels at $3,200 and $150, respectively.\n\nXRP remains volatile amid the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, facing hurdles at $0.52-$0.55 range.\n\nDespite a brief upward swing following last week's halving, cryptocurrency markets have dipped in the second half of the week. Lower trading volumes are characteristic of the post-halving period.\n\nAmong major altcoins, has attempted a comeback, nearing the $3,200 mark, but a clear reversal hasn't materialized yet.\n\nfaces a similar situation, battling to break above $150. remains particularly volatile as the ongoing SEC lawsuit against heats up.\n\n1. Ethereum Eyes Breakout After Correction\n\nEthereum's decline took a breather last week, finding support near $3,000. During the April 13-19 trading sessions, the daily chart suggests buying activity (reaction purchases) emerged around the $2,920 zone.\n\nThis coincides with the Fibonacci 0.618 retracement level of the Q1 rally, hinting that the recent correction might be over.\n\nHowever, ETH's week-long uptrend has struggled to overcome the $3,200 resistance due to low trading volume. In the past 24 hours, selling pressure has intensified, with $3,150 acting as a key hurdle.\n\nAnalysts warn that a daily close below $3,150 could signal a continuation of the downtrend. A potential weekly close under $2,920 could open the door for a further slide towards $2,600.\n\nConversely, a surge in buying volume that pushes ETH above $3,150 would be a significant breakout. This would signify an end to the downtrend that began in March and could pave the way for a return to the $3,600-$3,800 zone in the short term.\n\n2. Solana Breaks Support, Faces Downward Pressure\n\nSolana started April on a concerning note, breaking below the ascending channel it had followed since October 2023. This downward breakout came with significant trading volume, pushing SOL to an average price of $127 last week.\n\nThe recent price movement suggests a corrective phase for SOL. While the token has attempted a recovery since last week, it remains capped at an average of $158.\n\nThis week, the $139-$143 range becomes crucial support for SOL. Failure to hold this level could see SOL experience a significant decline, potentially dropping below $100 as the downward trend strengthens.\n\nDaily closes above $160 are essential to confirm a reversal of the downtrend. As long as SOL remains below this price point, selling pressure could push it further down.\n\nMaintaining an average of $140 would also be a positive sign, potentially slowing the decline.\n\nOn the upside, if SOL can establish a solid foundation at $160, the next potential targets could be the $180-$190 range.\n\n3. XRP Faces Volatility as Legal Battle Heats Up\n\nXRP's price has been on a rollercoaster ride this week, reflecting the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The market reacted negatively to Ripple's recent rejection of the SEC's proposed fine, halting the recovery XRP experienced last week.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, XRP dipped below its long-term upward channel earlier this month. While there were attempts to return to the channel last week, a significant resistance level emerged around $0.55, hindering further progress.\n\nThe long-term outlook for XRP presents another hurdle in the form of resistance at $0.52 (Fib 0.236). A weekly close above this crucial $0.52-$0.55 range is critical for XRP to reverse its current trend. Failure to do so could lead to a short-term decline towards the support level at $0.43 (Fib 0.144).\n\nLooking ahead, with Ripple's response submitted and the SEC's defense still to come, the XRP market is likely to experience increased volatility in the coming months. The final court decision is expected to be a major factor influencing XRP's price as we approach summer.\n\n***\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship \"Tech Titans,\" which outperformed the market by a lofty 1,745% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here and never miss a bull market again!\n\nDisclaimer: This content, which is prepared purely for educational purposes, cannot be considered as investment advice.

        "title": "Is ETH About to Plunge Below $3K or Will the Bulls Step In? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a period of consolidation and corrective movements, Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered increased selling activity, leading to a slight decline toward the 100-day moving average.\n\nThe main question now revolves around whether Ethereum sellers will manage to break below this crucial moving average.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Technicals\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart reveals that following an extended phase of corrective retracements, with the price testing the critical resistance region of $3.2K, the market experienced heightened selling pressure, resulting in a slight downturn.\n\nConsequently, the Ethereum price is now testing a crucial support level marked by the 100-day moving average at $3086. This range holds significance as it typically attracts considerable demand, potentially limiting further downward pressure from sellers.\n\nHowever, given the current market sentiment and recent price action, Ethereum appears to lack sufficient momentum and buying activity, increasing the likelihood of a new bearish trend in the short term. Nonetheless, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect towards the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that following a period of sideways consolidation near the lower boundary of the wedge pattern, which aligns with the support region around $3K, the price experienced notable buying pressure, leading to a bullish reversal.\n\nThis intensified demand resulted in a significant surge towards a critical resistance region, encompassing the 0.5 ($3234) and 0.618 ($3324) Fibonacci levels.\n\nHowever, sellers regained control and halted the upward momentum, causing a renewed bearish downturn, indicating a notable bearish sign for the market. Nevertheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to remain confined within the crucial range, bounded by support at $2.8 and critical resistance at $3.3, until a breakout occurs.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price failing to surpass the $3.7K level, investors may be interested in understanding the behavior of futures market traders.\n\nThe accompanying chart displays the 14-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that gauges the aggressiveness of buyers relative to sellers. Values above one signify buyer dominance, while values below one indicate aggressive selling pressure.\n\nAs depicted in the chart, not only has the metric failed to recover above one, but it has also been on a sharp decline over the past few weeks. Moreover, the ratio has recently been steadily decreasing, nearing its lowest point since September 2022. This downward trend is concerning and suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bearish trend could last in the mid-term if current conditions persist."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market shines a spotlight on several Ethereum meme coins to buy that are currently valued under one dollar. Notable among these are Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). Each of these digital currencies has seen impressive gains recently, attracting the interest of investors aiming for significant returns. Their growing popularity may suggest they are viable options for turning a small investment into considerable profits in the volatile crypto market.\n\n1. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), a new cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, is swiftly gaining traction. It aims to match or surpass the success of iconic meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Currently holding the 35th spot in market rankings, Pepe coin boasts a market cap of $3.22 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEnhanced support from platforms like Coinbase and significant acquisitions by large-scale investors have propelled its visibility and value. Market trends and a rise in similar meme coins also contribute to Pepe bullish momentum.\n\nPresently, the Pepe price is $0.000007638, marking a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. This recent surge has positioned it as today\u2019s most popular meme coin on CoinMarketCap. Over the last week, it has witnessed a substantial 47% increase. Over the past 12 months, PEPE value has skyrocketed by 3368%, highlighting it as a potential investment for significant returns this weekend.\n\n2. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues to flourish within the decentralized finance realm. As another Ethereum-based digital asset, it has recently seen a 3% rise in its value. The current price of Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002577, suggesting continued growth. With a 146% increase over the past year, SHIB remains a strong contender in the market.\n\nRanked 11th by CoinMarketCap, SHIB has a market capitalization of $15.18 billion. Factors such as enhanced trading volume, strategic token burns, and the introduction of Shibairum are driving its upward trajectory. This makes SHIB another attractive meme coin for potential investors looking for substantial gains.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI), initially recognized as a meme coin, has evolved significantly in the web3 realm. It now engages prominently in the Metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto,\u201d Floki integrates popular internet culture with cutting-edge, practical projects.\n\nAs of now, Floki price stands at $0.0001885, marking a 4% increase in the last day. It holds the 55th position in global market capitalization, valued at $1.8 billion, and is showing promise for substantial future gains following trends seen in other Ethereum-based meme coins.\n\n4. Grok (GROK)\n\nGrok (GROK) is carving out a space in the meme coin sector. It gains its inspiration from the Grok AI project by Elon Musk\u2019s X company. This association has significantly heightened its profile, pushing it to the forefront of AI-related meme cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrok price is trading at $0.008313, reflecting a slight 2% dip over the past day. With a market capitalization of $52 million, it is ranked 596th on CoinMarketCap, highlighting its position among the top Ethereum meme coins.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK)\n\nBonk (BONK), a newly minted dog-themed cryptocurrency on the Solana network, has made a significant splash by allocating half of its tokens to the Solana community. This strategy has vaulted its market capitalization to a robust $1.74 billion. At the time of writing, the Bonk price is trading at $0.00002667, which represents an 8% increase over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis trend reflects a 79% rise over the past week and an astonishing annual gain of 4100%. Such dynamics suggest BONK could be a lucrative investment, especially as it rides the growing popularity of Solana, positioning itself as a top meme coin with the potential for exponential gains.\n\n6. CorgiAI (CORGIAI)\n\nCorgiAI (CORGIAI) has carved a niche within the artificial intelligence sphere, fueled by a vibrant community-driven project. The introduction of its Corgi Cre8r tool, enabling users to generate text-to-image NFTs, showcases its commitment to innovation.\n\nDespite a slight 1% dip in its price today, CorgiAI\u2019s token, currently valued at $0.001672, has surged 542% this year. This impressive performance highlights its appeal as a promising investment among Ethereum meme coins, hinting at substantial returns for future investors. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is 3097, with a market cap of 507 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, these selected Ethereum meme coins represent promising opportunities for investors. With their low entry price and recent upsurge in popularity, they are prime candidates for potentially lucrative investments this weekend.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Solana tops Bitcoin, Ethereum in NFTs, but should SOL prices worry you? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume and transactions dipped last month.\n\nSOL\u2019s price action remained bearish, and indicators suggested a further price drop.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a year-long summer in its NFT ecosystem as the blockchain outperformed its competitors. However, Solana\u2019s NFT metrics started to decline in the past month. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish.\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT ecosystem is shining bright\n\nSolanaFloor, a popular X handle that posts updates related to the blockchain, posted a tweet highlighting SOL\u2019s commendable performance.\n\nAs per the tweet, SOL outperformed every other chain, including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Polygon [MATIC], in yearly NFT blockchain user adoption.\n\nWhile SOL\u2019s number of users grew by 33% in the past 365 days, MATIC, BTC, and ETH\u2019s users grew by 29%, 10%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that MadLads, Frogana, and Sharx by sharky.fi were the top NFT collections on Solana, which might have contributed towards the aforementioned achievement.\n\nDespite promising 365-day growth, things started to change in the last month. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Cryptoslam\u2019s data pointed out that SOL\u2019s NFT sales volume dropped by over 36% last month, as did its total number of buyers and sellers.\n\nIts total NFT transactions also dipped by 11%. Santiment\u2019s data also corresponded to this, as SOL\u2019s NFT trade count sank sharply over the past month.\n\nSolana investors need to worry\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s NFT metrics dipped, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL was down by over 25% last month.\n\nIn fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dropped by 7%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $145.55 with a market capitalization of over $65 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto.\n\nThe decline in price also took a toll on the token\u2019s social metrics. SOL\u2019s social volume declined over the past month, reflecting a decrease in its popularity in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s weighted sentiment also remained in the negative zone for the majority of the days. This clearly suggested that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed the token\u2019s daily chart to find whether this bearish price trend would continue longer. We found that both SOL\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline and were headed further below their respective neutral marks.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, the token\u2019s price also failed to go above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as suggested by the Bollinger Bands.\n\nAll these technical indicators hinted that investors might witness a further drop in SOL\u2019s price in the coming days or weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Whales continued to stockpile ETH despite being under water.\n\nMajority of whale positions were longing ETH in derivatives markets.\n\nEthereum [ETH] sank 4.73% over the last 24 hours of trading, reversing the bullish momentum which it gathered following Bitcoin\u2019s halving. The second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $3,125 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe slump however, failed to influence the market behavior of whale investors, as the latter still seemed bullish on ETH\u2019s prospects.\n\nWhales buy ETH\u2019s dip\n\nAccording to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain, whales accumulated hefty amount of ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nA particular wallet with address 0xe0b snapped 1,524 stETH at an average price of $3,159. With this grab, the wallet owner pushed their total stETH holdings beyond $10 million, earning an estimated 3.42% profit.\n\nIn a bigger purchase, a whale amassed 7,128 ETH, worth $22 million at prevailing prices, at $3,111. The wealthy investor reportedly sat on a huge $482 million worth of ETH stash.\n\nAs of this writing, the holder was in a state of unrealized loss.\n\nSupply held by top addresses increase\n\nThese were not isolated developments though. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, ETH whales upped their transaction activity in the last 2-3 days, as seen by the jump in large transfers exceeding $100k.\n\nMoreover, the share of total supply held by top addresses rose from 41.37% on the halving day to 41.45% on the 24th of April, suggesting accumulation by whales.\n\nWhales still betting on ETH\u2019s rise\n\nOn the derivatives markets too, majority of the whales were bullishly positioned. About 63% of the total whale positions on Binance were long on ETH, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThough, it was worth mentioning that the long exposure came down after the halving.\n\nThe market sentiment leaned towards greed, indicating the possibility of increase in buying pressure in the days to come. This could support ETH\u2019s rebound in the days ahead."

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into the pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add. Txs Per Sec. Avg. Tx Fee TVL Market Cap Ethereum ETH 264 mln 30 $4.99 $67 bln $382 bln BNB Smart Chain BNB 444 mln 2,200 $0.0982 $7.8 bln $88.8 bln Solana SOL 28 mln 4,233 $0.005 $5.7 mln $63.9 bln Cardano ADA 4.4 mln 1,000+ $0.16 $397 mln $16.7 bln Tron TRX 225 mln 2,000 $0.95 $8.6 bln $11.0 bln Avalanche AVAX 20 mln 4,500 $0.084 $1.1 bln $13.3 bln Polkadot DOT No data 1,000 Parachain specific $265 mln* $6.8 bln\n\nData collected on April 26, 2024.\n\n*Polkadot\u2019s TVL is calculated as the total sum of TVL across Polkadot parachains (Moonbeam, Acala, etc.)\n\nWhat is the next Ethereum? Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to its transaction speed and overlapping features. In recent years, Tron has also looked to expand its offering, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin, USDD.\n\n5. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of Ethereum's scalability and speed limitations. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\n6. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set, such as Ethereum, include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users. However, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."
