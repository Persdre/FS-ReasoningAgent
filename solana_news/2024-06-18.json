        "title": "SEC drops investigation into Ethereum studio Consensys - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum fans can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its investigation into the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nEthereum development studio Consensys shared the news on X overnight.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0,\u201d the company posted.\n\n\u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIndications of an SEC probe into Ethereum and entities supporting the protocol circulated in March, when Fortune reported the agency was investigating three unnamed related companies for potential securities violations.\n\nConsensys then sued the SEC one month later, alleging regulatory overreach. The suit claimed chairman Gary Gensler sought to grab power over the crypto space, using legal maneuvers that would force ETH into a security definition following its switch to proof of stake in September 2022.\n\nPart of those filings disclosed that Consensys had received a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating the agency\u2019s intent to sue. The Fort Worth firm, which owns popular web3 infrastructure including crypto wallet MetaMask and API provider Infura, was founded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.\n\nWhile the SEC probe was expected to be dropped following approval of a suite of spot ether ETFs last month, the formal notice puts to bed one of crypto\u2019s primary existential threats, at least for now.\n\nFormer SEC chair Jay Clayton had initially backed SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman\u2019s notion that ether was no longer a security in 2019, as there was no central entity in control of the cryptocurrency at the time. No official statement had been given by the agency, however, and Gensler had seemingly been walking back those thoughts ever since.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Alexander Grieve, government affairs lead at venture capital firm Paradigm, tweeted a copy of the SEC\u2019s letter to Consensys. It reads:\n\n\u201cWe write to provide notice that we have concluded the investigation in the [matter of Ethereum 2.0]\u2026. based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc. with respect to this investigation.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe letter added that the notice was given under guidelines in the Securities Act which state that it \u201cmust in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nAll good news for Consensys but other legal threats still loom over crypto. So far, there\u2019s no word of the SEC\u2019s Uniswap probe being dropped, although a lawsuit has not yet been filed.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What Will Allocations Look Like in Combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? - Unchained",
        "content": "After the first combined ETF was filed today, what will other issuers do regarding the allocation to BTC and ETH?\n\nAs the first combined BTC/ETH ETF was filed, what can we expect from future allocations?\n\nOn Tuesday, as the market eagerly anticipates the full approval of spot Ether ETFs, Nasdaq filed for a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. This new ETF, managed by Hashdex, will allocate 70.54% to bitcoin and 29.46% to ether. These allocations are based on the relative free float market capitalizations of bitcoin and ether.\n\nBut, is this the only way newly combined ETFs will allocate to bitcoin and ether? And what impact might this have on the market?\n\nRead more: There Are Now 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Here\u2019s the One That\u2019s Best for You\n\nWhy Combined ETFs Matter\n\nThe introduction of combined BTC and ETH ETFs is significant for several reasons. Firstly, these ETFs offer investors diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum. This diversified approach might attract more inflows, especially from more conservative investors, as it mitigates the risk associated with investing in a single asset. By holding both BTC and ETH, investors can benefit from the possible upside of both leading cryptocurrencies, potentially stabilizing returns compared to single-asset ETFs.\n\nThe structure of combined ETFs could also impact the prices of BTC and ETH. As these ETFs gain popularity, increased demand for the underlying assets could drive up their prices. If there are ETFs that allocate more to one asset or another, it could be positive for that specific asset.\n\nNate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, explains that the success of broad commodity ETFs suggests that combined crypto ETFs could find a larger audience \u201cdue to the novel nature of the category.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome investors and advisors will prefer a diversified approach to an emerging asset class like crypto versus attempting to pick winners and losers,\u201d Geraci told Unchained. He believes that once additional crypto assets are available in an ETF wrapper, such as SOL or XRP, we can expect to see various index-based and actively managed strategies.\n\nAllocation Strategies\n\nGeraci believes that, as in the Hashdex ETF, the division should be reflective of their respective market caps. \u201cEther is currently valued at about one-third the market cap of Bitcoin. I think that\u2019s a reasonable proxy for what spot Ether ETF demand will look like compared to spot Bitcoin ETF demand,\u201d Geraci told Unchained. And despite the lack of staking options in the initial spot Ether ETFs, Geraci believes this won\u2019t significantly deter demand.\n\nHowever, Geraci also expects the emergence of multiple flavors of combined BTC and ETH ETFs, including market cap-weighted and actively managed products. \u201cMarket cap-weighted products will hold BTC and ETH in the proportions described above. Actively managed ETF holdings will be dictated by the manager and prevailing market conditions,\u201d he notes, indicating potential variability in allocations based on market dynamics.\n\nScott Johnson, general partner at Van Buren Capital, suggests that combined BTC and ETH ETFs might feature a 50/50 split or follow some type of index-weighted approach. \u201cTo the extent these come online in the near term, you might see a 50/50 or some type of index-weighted allocation,\u201d Johnson told Unchained via email.\n\nLooking at other markets, such as Canada, where crypto ETFs have been available for several years, provides valuable insights. For example, the Evolve Cryptocurrencies ETF is weighted on a market capitalization basis and rebalanced monthly. As of the latest data, this ETF allocates 71.90% to Bitcoin and 28.10% to Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, CI Financial offers the CI Galaxy Multi-Crypto ETF, an actively managed ETF, and uses a rules-based, momentum-signaling strategy, allocating roughly 50/50 to BTC and ETH.\n\nLearn more: Bitcoin ETFs Explained: What Are They & How Do They Work?"

        "title": "Ethereum gets huge win as SEC closes investigation into securities sale allegations - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, determining that sales of ETH are not securities transactions. The decision comes after a letter from Consensys on June 7, seeking clarity following the May approvals of ETH ETFs, which were based on ETH being classified as a commodity. Consensys stated,\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nEthereum rose over 4% overnight following the news, pulling the rest of the crypto market with it as many projects positive over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is the notable exception, down 0.74% according to CryptoSlate data as of press time.\n\nConsensys announced this development as a significant victory for Ethereum developers and the broader industry. The closure of the investigation signifies a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community, providing a reprieve from potential regulatory actions that could have categorized ETH as a security. The SEC\u2019s decision aligns with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) stance, which has consistently classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nDespite this positive outcome, Consensys continues its legal battle against the SEC to secure further regulatory clarity. The company argues that the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions against blockchain developers and technology providers have been overly aggressive and unlawful. Consensys\u2019s lawsuit also seeks a declaration that offering user interface software like MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate securities laws.\n\nAs Consensys emphasized, the legal fight is not just about Ethereum but about safeguarding the future of blockchain innovation in the United States. The SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum had posed a risk to adopting and developing blockchain technologies, with potential negative implications for US leadership in this sector. By challenging the SEC\u2019s authority, Consensys aims to prevent what it describes as an unlawful power grab that could hinder technological advancements and economic opportunities.\n\nThe resolution of the Ethereum investigation marks a critical juncture, but Consensys insists that the broader regulatory environment still requires significant reform. The company\u2019s lawsuit highlights the need for clear guidelines that support innovation while ensuring compliance with existing laws. As the blockchain industry evolves, resolving these regulatory issues will be crucial in determining the pace and direction of technological progress.\n\nAccording to Consensys, fighting for regulatory clarity is essential to ensuring blockchain technology continues growing and contributing to the economy. The company\u2019s actions reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for balanced regulation that fosters innovation without stifling growth.\n\nIndustry participants and regulators alike will closely watch the outcome of Consensys\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. The case highlights the tensions between regulatory oversight and technological innovation, a dynamic that will shape the future of blockchain technology and its applications.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "The dark side of tokenisation - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe writer is a law professor at the American University Washington College of Law\n\nTraditional financial institutions are increasingly showing interest in \u201ctokenising\u201d real-world assets, meaning they are curious about how these assets could be digitally represented by programmable tokens recorded on shared ledgers. There could be real efficiency gains associated with tokenisation, but the drive towards it could also take a dark turn.\n\nThe most dangerous outcomes would arise if tokenisation of real-world assets were pursued simply to feed into what has been described as \u201cthe perpetual motion machine that is crypto trading\u201d. Regulators around the world have expressed concerns about the integration of crypto and traditional financial markets, because of the high levels of volatility, leverage, concentration and operational risk associated with the crypto markets. This integration would be sped up if ownership of tokenised real-world assets were recorded on so-called permissionless public blockchains. The type of ledger favoured by the crypto industry, these blockchains can be accessed by any computer running the necessary software to host them, no identification or vetting required\n\nThe tokenisation of real-world assets can and should proceed without using these problematic blockchains. Their inefficiencies are well documented, and experimentation to resolve problems in scaling their use tends to focus on processing transactions off the blockchain (defeating the stated goal of decentralisation).\n\nIt is perhaps less well appreciated that these kinds of blockchains are also plagued by governance problems. We cannot simply trust in the code of the blockchain. Public permissionless blockchains are \u201cdesigned by people, maintained by people, and governed by people\u201d, as one research paper put it. but we don\u2019t necessarily know who these people are, who pays them, or if they\u2019ll show up in an emergency. This is an untenable position for critical financial infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately, BlackRock has chosen to host its tokenised Buidl fund on the public permissionless Ethereum blockchain. The good news is that some other financial institutions have taken a different path, and are experimenting with other kinds of ledgers to see if tokenisation yields efficiencies in their markets.\n\nEfficiencies can arise from programmability, meaning that software known as \u201csmart contracts\u201d can be built into the tokens to allow for the automation of functions, like interest payments. Smart contracts can also be used to build bespoke financial products out of multiple tokenised assets \u2014 this is known as composability. Ownership of tokenised assets can also be split into smaller pieces in a process known as fractionalisation. When ownership of all tokenised assets used in a single transaction is recorded on the same ledger, the transaction can be settled \u201catomically\u201d, or simultaneously, 24/7.\n\nCross-border payments seem particularly ripe for improvement through tokenisation, but we shouldn\u2019t rush to tokenise everything. Some purported benefits (particularly those relating to financial inclusion) are overhyped. And where efficiencies gains are real, they can invite corresponding fragilities. Even when divorced from crypto, there is a dark side to tokenisation.\n\nTokenisation promises to bring more real-world assets into the financial markets, and to engineer them into new categories of bespoke financial products both big (through composability) and small (through fractionalisation). This may unlock liquidity and efficiencies in good times, but we learned in 2008 that illiquidity, deleveraging and fire sales will be on the menu when things turn south. Discretion and forbearance (for example, with regard to margin calls) are often critical to containing the damage in these circumstances, but obligations automated with smart contracts will inflexibly self-execute regardless of context.\n\nIn addition, smart contract software provides another attack surface for hackers, and the more comprehensive the underlying ledger, the more attractive a target it becomes for cyber attacks. Atomic settlement also deprives markets of the benefits of netting of transactions.\n\nIf we think back to 2020, we learned the hard way that supply chains could become brittle when the unexpected occurred; now there is increasing interest in production strategies that are less efficient, but more resilient. We should explore tokenisation with the same mindset. We need to ask \u201cwhen something is efficient enough, will making it more efficient introduce too many fragilities and be counterproductive in the long run?\u201d In the best-case scenario, tokenisation experimentation will spur the financial industry to start thinking intentionally about this question.\n\n."

        "title": "Ethereum Wins As US SEC Ends Securities Investigation - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The crypto industry received a significant jolt of clarity and optimism as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, announcing that it will not pursue any enforcement actions. This decision marks an important victory for Ethereum and could serve as a critical reference point for the treatment of digital assets under US securities law.\n\nEthereum Is Not A Security\n\nIn 2018, the SEC made a key distinction that Ether was not a security. However, by 2023, amidst evolving functionalities and the transition to Ethereum 2.0, the SEC revisited this stance, hinting at possible regulatory oversight. This shift led to increased scrutiny and uncertainty within the Ethereum community, culminating in a lawsuit filed by Consensys on April 25, 2024. The lawsuit aimed to confirm the classification of ETH as a commodity, arguing that the SEC lacked jurisdiction over its trade and governance.\n\nIn a pivotal response dated June 7, 2024, Consensys urged the SEC to acknowledge the approvals of Ethereum-based ETFs made earlier that May, which were predicated on the assumption that ETH is a commodity. Consensys argued this should conclusively end the SEC\u2019s investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division officially responded on June 18, 2024, as communicated in a letter addressed to Kevin S. Schwartz, attorney for Consensys. The letter stated, \u201cWe write to provide notice that we have concluded the investigation in the above-referenced matter [\u2026] based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the SEC underscored that this closure should not be seen as an exoneration or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation. Nonetheless, Laura Brookover, a lawyer at Consensys, underscored the significance of this development, stating, \u201cThe SEC sent us a closing letter in the Ethereum 2.0 investigation today. Things have changed remarkably fast since we filed our lawsuit against the SEC in late April, culminating in today\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nThis resolution can be perceived as a critical moment for the broader crypto industry, particularly in how digital assets are classified and regulated. Alexander Grieve from Paradigm noted the tone of the SEC\u2019s notification, commenting, \u201cThey\u2019re pretty hedge-y/evasive in their notification\u2014BUT it is relatively unusual for the SEC to specifically highlight to a company that they\u2019ve closed an investigation.\u201d\n\nThe closure of this investigation without enforcement action could set a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are treated by regulatory agencies, potentially easing the regulatory environment for digital assets.\n\nWhile the immediate threat of an enforcement action has been alleviated, Consensys and the wider crypto industry are looking towards further clarifications in regulatory policy. Consensys in their lawsuit also seeks a federal court ruling regarding their operations, asserting that they do not act as brokers nor issue securities through their software offerings like MetaMask Swaps and Staking.\n\nAs stated in their lawsuit, \u201cConsensys is built on creating software products that allow people around the world to use and build on top of the Ethereum network, and it is entitled to run its business without the cost, burden, and uncertainty of an unlawful enforcement action.\u201d\n\nAt press time, the price of Ether (ETH) has responded favorably to the SEC\u2019s decision, showing a notable increase of 3.3%, bringing it to a current trading price of $3,561.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve the long-awaited Spot Ethereum ETF filings by July 2. This move comes amidst several key factors aligning towards regulatory clarity and increased market interest in crypto-based investment products. Moreover, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had previously revealed that they have pushed the potential Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 approval date to July 2.\n\n1. ConsenSys Vs. SEC Investigation Resolution\n\nOne pivotal reason behind the anticipated approval of Spot Ethereum ETF filings is the recent progress in regulatory discussions between ConsenSys and the SEC. ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain technology company, sought clarification on the SEC\u2019s stance regarding Ethereum\u2019s status as a security. This came in the context of their ongoing investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThereafter, the SEC announced the conclusion of this investigation. This development signals a significant shift in their approach towards Ethereum. Moreover, the resolution of this investigation is crucial as it sets a precedent for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, potentially mitigating concerns over its classification as a security. With ConsenSys paving the way for regulatory clarity, the SEC may view this as a favorable signal towards approving Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: Bitwise Files Amended Ethereum ETF S-1 After SEC Feedback\n\n2. Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Amendments by Applicants\n\nAnother key factor influencing the timeline for SEC approval is the proactive approach taken by ETF applicants such as Bitwise. Recently, Bitwise diligently amended their S-1 filings in response to feedback from the SEC. They addressed regulatory concerns and enhancing transparency in their proposed ETF structures.\n\nNate Geraci, the host of ETF Prime, expects other applicants like VanEck, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and others to mirror the move within this week. In case other amendments gush in, the Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 approval could be expedited.\n\nBitwise\u2019s recent amendment, for instance, detailed significant investment commitments. This included a $2.5 million seed investment from Bitwise Investment Manager, LLC. Moreover, expressions of interest from institutions like Pantera Capital Management LP underscore the robust market demand for Ethereum ETFs, despite being non-binding.\n\n3. SEC Chair Gary Gensler Hints At Summer Approval\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2018s public statements have also influenced expectations regarding the approval timeline for Ethereum ETFs. Gensler previously indicated that approvals for such products could be expected \u201cover the course of this summer.\u201d This underscores the SEC\u2019s proactive stance towards embracing innovation while ensuring investor protection.\n\nWhen revising the potential approval date, Balchunas even hinted at an earlier approval. In a post on X, he wrote, \u201cDecent chance they work to declare them effective the next week and get it off their plate before the holiday weekend. Anything is possible but this is our best guess as of now.\u201d\n\nHowever, as of now, the week hasn\u2019t seen such a big leap despite the recent S-1 amendment. Nonetheless, the approval remains imminent as hinted by market analysts.\n\nAlso Read: Hashdex Files 19b-4 For Combined Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Altcoin dominance has declined by 15% in the last month.\n\nThe demand for ETH remained significantly low, putting the altcoin at risk of a further price decline.\n\nAltcoin dominance has cratered by double digits in the last month. At 9.88% at press time, it has fallen by 15% in the past 30 days, according to TradingView.\n\nAltcoin dominance refers to the relative market share of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin [BTC]. Its decline means that the total market capitalization held by altcoins was decreasing compared to BTC.\n\nThis may be because investors are moving their funds from altcoins to BTC, which they perceive as a safer and more stable investment asset.\n\nAltcoin dominance waning?\n\nIn times of market consolidation like this, altcoin dominance may decline while Bitcoin dominance increases, as altcoins lose value or fail to attract investors.\n\nHowever, BTC\u2019s dominance has yet to record any significant growth within the one month considered. As of this writing, its value was 55.36%, declining by 1.03% in the last month and 0.69% in the last seven days.\n\nAMBCrypto reported earlier that this gradual decline in BTC dominance is due to the strong resistance the coin faces at the $70,000 price level.\n\nETH remains at risk of decline\n\nAt press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded at $3,561. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin\u2019s value has surged by 14% in the past 30 days, despite the general decline in altcoin dominance in the crypto market.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that it broke below the support level of $3693 on 10 June and has since flipped it into resistance.\n\nEven though it has managed a mere 1% price hike in the last week, ETH\u2019s price has since oscillated within a range, with new resistance formed at the $3693 price level and support found at $3428.\n\nConfirming the general decline for ETH among market participants, its key momentum indicators were positioned below their respective center lines at the time of writing.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 48.60, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 29.59.\n\nThese indicators measure oversold and overbought market conditions by tracking an asset\u2019s price changes.\n\nAt their values as of this writing, they suggested that selling pressure was significantly higher than buying activity.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIf the decline continues, ETH risks falling to $3496.\n\nHowever, if invalidated, its price might rally toward $3658."

        "content": "The crypto prices today rode a bearish wave as Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to the $65K mark, whereas Ethereum (ETH) showed signs of a pullback. Altcoins Solana (SOL) and others mainly followed, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme coins noting a dip of 9%-13%. However, XRP traded in the green, defying broader market trends.\n\nThe global crypto market cap saw a significant 3.14% decline to $2.35 trillion, although the total crypto market volume from yesterday spiked 104.01% to $94.07 billion. This follows whopping outflows recorded across the crypto sector, triggered by the U.S. Fed\u2019s recent hawkish stance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a collection of some of the top cryptos and their price movements today, June 18.\n\nTop Crypto Prices Today\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe BTC price chart illustrated a faded movement today, nosediving to $65,374.98, down 1.39% over the past day. The token\u2019s 24-hour bottoms and highs are $64,597.25 and $67,252.08, respectively.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance stood at 54.87%, a 0.93% jump over the past day. The token boasted a waned market cap of $1.29 trillion. This drop comes in the background of nearly $146 million outflows recorded in the U.S. spot BTC ETFs, per data by Farside Investors.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nETH price traded primarily in the red in the past 24 hours, falling 4.39% to $3,428.45. The token\u2019s 24-hour lows and highs are $3,371.59 and $3,591.67, respectively.\n\nEthereum boasted a market cap of $419.50 billion.\n\nSolana Price\n\nSOL price corrected 9.25% over the past day to trade at $134.26 at press time. Solana\u2019s 24-hour slumps and peaks are $130.16 and $148.95.\n\nXRP Price\n\nHowever, the Ripple Labs-backed crypto noted slight gains of 0.33% over the past day to reach $0.4893. XRP\u2019s 24-hour lows and highs are $0.4808 and $0.5194, respectively.\n\nDOGE & SHIB Prices\n\nBesides, the meme coins sector mimicked the broader market\u2019s tumbled movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 9.74% from yesterday to $0.122, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) fell 12.12% to $0.00001802.

        "title": "Is ETH in Danger of Falling to $3K or Will the Bulls Wake Up? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has landed on a decisive and substantial support region following a brief consolidation correction stage, with potential for a bullish reversal.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum sellers breach this pivot, a cascade in the market is likely.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA closer look at the daily chart shows that Ethereum has reached a pivotal support region after a brief consolidation correction stage. This region encompasses the price range between the 0.5 ($3421) and 0.618 ($3289) Fibonacci levels, aligning with the substantial support of the 100-day moving average ($3412). T\n\nThe alignment of these support indicators highlights the strength of this critical level and the prevailing demand at this juncture, which could halt further downward pressure.\n\nA battle between buyers and sellers is expected at this pivotal price range, leading to heightened market volatility and potential liquidations. The outcome will likely determine Ethereum\u2019s upcoming trend. If sellers overcome buyers and breach this crucial support region, a cascade toward the 200-day moving average at $2996 will be imminent.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum formed a head and shoulders pattern, resulting in increased selling activity and a break below the pattern\u2019s neckline.\n\nThis development and a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator have heightened bearish momentum, leading to a significant downward movement. Following this, Ethereum has formed a descending flag pattern, a well-known bullish continuation pattern if breached from the upper boundary.\n\nCurrently, the price is hovering around a critical and decisive support region marked by the 0.5 ($3420) to 0.618 ($3289) Fibonacci retracement levels and the flag\u2019s lower boundary. This area is experiencing intensified volatility and fluctuations.\n\nIf sellers break down this crucial support, an impulsive downtrend targeting the $2.9K support is expected. Conversely, if sufficient demand returns and shrinks the existing supply, a reversal towards the flag\u2019s upper boundary at $3.6K will likely occur.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced heightened selling pressure near the $4K mark, leading to a significant decline. This likely stems from participants\u2019 aggressive interest in opening short positions near this pivotal level. Analyzing the potential liquidation levels is crucial for determining the mid-term price targets.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, a significant amount of liquidity resides above the crucial $3.9K mark, potentially representing buy-stop orders from notable short positions around this critical juncture. This liquidity region is likely to be the main target for buyers if demand returns to the market and the price experiences a bullish reversal near the $3K threshold.\n\nReaching this crucial liquidity range would likely lead to increased market volatility and potentially trigger a short-squeeze event, where short positions are forced to cover, driving the price higher. Nevertheless, if the selling pressure continues and Ethereum fails to reclaim higher levels, the price may continue to consolidate or decline."

        "title": "NFT market revival: Ethereum takes the lead as sales surge - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "NFT sales volumes grew by 10.95% over the last week.\n\nEthereum regained the top spot in the NFT sector.\n\nWhile crypto investors weren\u2019t initially flocking to NFTs in 2024, the past few weeks have seen a shift in the market. NFT sales are on the rise, with some collections experiencing significant surges in activity.\n\nThe NFT market recently saw gains for the second consecutive week with sales up by 10.95% during this period.\n\nBlue-chip blues\n\nHowever, the picture wasn\u2019t entirely rosy. Ethereum-based NFT big names like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and CryptoPunks haven\u2019t seen uniform growth.\n\nCryptoPunks\u2019 sales volume dropped a hefty 59%, and the average holding time for these digital avatars has also dipped. This suggests some investors might be offloading their Punks.\n\nMAYC, on the other hand, witnessed the same level of disinterest. The sales, though down 53% compared to earlier highs, show a different story.\n\nThe average holding time for MAYC NFTs skyrocketed by 74%, indicating investors are holding onto their Mutant Apes with confidence.\n\nApeCoin sees no love\n\nDespite the resurgence in MAYC popularity, ApeCoin, the cryptocurrency linked to these Ape collections, hasn\u2019t mirrored the growth.\n\nApeCoin\u2019s price has actually fallen by nearly 16% in the past month. Even if the resurgence in interest in Ethereum NFTs hasn\u2019t helped ApeCoin, the future of the token looks extremely glib.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum NFTs like MAYC and CryptoPunks has propelled Ethereum back to the top spot in the NFT space. For months, Bitcoin dominated NFT transactions, but renewed interest in Ethereum NFTs has revitalized the network\u2019s overall activity.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, the Ethereum network saw $154.8 million worth of NFT sales being made on the network over the past month.\n\nThe surge in activity on the Ethereum network can also help improve the overall sentiment around ETH and help the altcoin in terms of price movement.\n\nBitcoin has been pushed to second place in terms of NFT volume. While collections like NodeMonks and Bitcoin Puppets remain popular, Ethereum\u2019s resurgence has shifted the focus.\n\nIf activity on the Bitcoin network continues to decline and investors lose confidence in Bitcoin NFTs, the price of BTC can be affected negatively.\n\nSolana remained a close third in NFT volume, with Polygon trailing just behind."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has permanently closed its Ethereum investigation, which sparked a rally in ETH and altcoins. While the move by the SEC has gained skepticism, especially in the XRP community, does Ether gaining status as a commodity means all proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon are commodities?\n\nSolana, Cardano, Polygon, Other PoS Crypto Are Commodity?\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ending Ethereum investigation sparked speculation that Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and other proof-of-stake (PoS) could also be commodities. Also, Ether has leaped over Bitcoin and XRP in terms of gaining regulatory clarity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPopular XRP sleuth Mr. Huber asked former SEC securities lawyer Marc Fagel whether the SEC now considering Ethereum as a commodity means anything for proof of stake crypto projects. The latest move by the SEC brings major PoS crypto such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon in the spotlight. The SEC has alleged Solana, Cardano, and Polygon as securities in Binance, Coinbase, and other lawsuits.\n\nI have no visibility into their thinking but, no, I wouldn\u2019t make that leap. I don\u2019t know what evidence (or lack of such) led the SEC to close the investigation, but I assume the prevalence of serious defenses (not present for other crypto) was a big factor. \u2014 Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 19, 2024\n\nAlexander Grieve, government affairs lead at Paradigm, said that it is relatively unusual for the SEC to highlight a company in response to a closure of an investigation. The SEC is \u201cunder no obligation to do so.\u201d Also, Ethereum Foundation was part of the investigation, but it didn\u2019t receive any letter.\n\nMarc Fagel agreed that it\u2019s highly unusual to send a closing letter to one party if something was ongoing as to another party in an investigation.\n\nAlso Read: XRP, Cardano, & 7 Other Communities Must Watch This Key Move By Binance\n\nWill Consensys Drop Lawsuit Against SEC?\n\nConsensys revealed that the SEC Enforcement Division has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, as per a letter send by SEC Assistant Director Kristin M.

The company claimed it\u2019s a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants.\n\nThe move comes in response to a letter sent by Consensys seeking confirmation from the SEC. The May ETH ETF approvals by the SEC were largely a result of ETH\u2019s status as a commodity.\n\nConsensys said it will continue to challenge the SEC in the lawsuit.

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum is down when writing following yesterday\u2019s contraction. Even though the community is optimistic, citing favorable fundamentals, sellers still control price action. For the Q1 2024 uptrend to be valid, Ethereum needs to close above $3,700 and reverse recent losses. If not, the odds of even more losses remain amplified going forward. Presently, the immediate support level is at $3,300.\n\nEthereum is down 3% in the last day and week. At the same time, the average trading volume is decent, at just over $20 billion. Traders expect prices to recover, shaking off the current weakness, in the days to come. When this prints out and there is a decisive high-volume breakout above the local resistance levels, participation will likely expand.\n\nTraders should monitor the following Ethereum news:\n\nEven though Ethereum is tracking lower versus the greenback, analysts are confident of its performance versus Bitcoin . By the end of the year, optimistic traders say ETH could post a 50% spike versus BTC . If this prints out, it would follow the same path as the 2019 to 2021 Bull Run.\n\nWhile the mainnet transaction processing speed remains low, scaling successes in layer-2 and 3 solutions have seen the combined TPS rise to all-time highs. This is primarily because of the explosion in processing speeds in Xai, a layer-3 platform.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH/USD is fragile.\n\nThe coin is trading below $3,700, slipping yesterday.\n\nThough the June 17 bar had a long lower wick, pointing to strong demand at the tail end of the day, earlier losses today validated bears.\n\nAccordingly, aggressive traders can short on every high, targeting $3,300. This preview aligns with the bear formation set in motion by the June 11 bar.\n\nThis outlook will only change when Ethereum soars above $3,700, ideally with expanding trading volume."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nWith a surge of 74.63% in its trading volume and a price correction of 3.56% within the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has plunged below its important level of $3,500. Furthermore, with the rising bearish sentiment, the market sentiments hint at a further fall in its value.\n\nNotably, the altcoin leader, ETH Price, has started this week on a bearish note by losing over 5% in valuation over the past 2 days. Moreover, the price continues its struggle to reclaim the $3,500 mark, indicating a negative influence in the crypto space.\n\nWith the ongoing cross-border market correction, will the Ethereum token make a comeback this week? Or will its price plunge toward its crucial support level of $3,200? Dive in as, in this article, we have covered the market sentiments and short-term price analysis of Ethereum crypto.\n\nETH Coin Price On The Verge Of A Major Break Down:\n\nAfter hovering close to its important support level of $3,700 for a brief period post Ethereum ETF approval by the SEC, the bulls failed to hold the value above its support level. This resulted in the Ethereum price experiencing a breakdown in its price chart.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nSince the breakdown, the ETH token has been constantly trading in a closed range between $3,400 and $3,700, highlighting a weak price action for the altcoin in the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the altcoin leader has formed a symmetric triangle pattern in the 1D time frame and is on the verge of testing its support trendline, the outcome of which is uncertain.\n\nEthereum Market Sentiments:\n\nThe Simple Moving Average (SMA) displays a bearish crossover in the 1D time frame, suggesting a weak bullish sentiment in the crypto space.\n\nThe technical indicator, RSI, fails to gain momentum, resulting in it recording a bearish reversal above the mid-point. Furthermore, it is now headed toward its oversold range, highlighting an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure for the Ethereum token in the market.\n\nWill The ETH Price Go Up?\n\nIf the bulls hold the Ethereum crypto above the support trendline of the symmetric triangle pattern, it will test its resistance level of $3,730. Maintaining the value at that level will set the stage for the ETH coin price to attempt to test its upper resistance level of $4,094.75 this month.\n\nHow Low Will ETH Go?\n\nOn the contrary, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the Ethereum price will continue trading under a negative influence, break down its support trendline, and test its support level of $3,400 this week.\n\nFurthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies and the bears continue to dominate the market, the ETH token will plunge further and prepare to test its crucial support level of $3,000 during the coming time.\n\nAlso Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Price Prediction: Is The Bull Rally Over?"
