        "title": "Three privacy-focused Ethereum L2s arising in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Concept Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Why Do We Need Gas in the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nGas\u2019s primary function is to reduce ETH\u2019s volatility. ETH is publicly tradeable and listed on exchanges. As a result, it is directly subject to market volatility. Petrol is not listed on any exchange, so it is not directly affected by market volatility. An Ethereum smart contract requires more computational power than a straightforward transfer. In order to avoid instability, the fee must be meticulously designed.\n\nHow Is the Gas Price Determined?\n\nGas price is determined by two factors: the gas limit and the price of gas. The sender\u2019s gas limit is the utmost amount of gas they are willing to pay for the transaction. The cost of gas is determined by market supply and demand. The final gas price for the transaction is calculated by multiplying the two prices.\n\nGas Limit * Gas Price = Gas Fee\n\nGas Limit: Gas Limit is the maximum quantity of ETH that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction. Typically, when discussing Gas in Ethereum, one is referring to Gas Limit. Sending ETH requires the shipper to set Gas Limit. If there is insufficient Gas Limit to complete the transfer, the transfer will be cancelled and the shipper will receive a Gas refund. Alternatively, if the sender specifies an excessive Gas Limit, any excess Gas will be returned to the sender.\n\nGas Price: Gas Price indicates the cost of Gas in Gwei. For instance, 1 Gas equals 10 Gwei. It is primarily determined by supply and demand in the market. Gas Price is multiplied by Gas Limit to ascertain the cost of gas.\n\nWhat Are the Factors Affecting Gas Fees?\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of gas fees involves recognizing the factors that influence their fluctuations:\n\nNetwork Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s popularity has led to network congestion during peak usage times. As more transactions compete for limited block space, gas fees tend to increase.\n\nGas Price: Users can set their preferred gas price. A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed promptly, but it also incurs higher costs.\n\nTransaction Complexity: The computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract influence its gas fee. More complex operations demand more gas.\n\nGas Limit: Each Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which represents the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend. If a transaction\u2019s computational requirements exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the user will still be charged.\n\nExternal Events: Market fluctuations, platform upgrades, and major smart contract executions can impact gas fees.\n\nWhat Are the Strategies to Optimize Gas Fees?\n\nNavigating the Ethereum gas fee landscape requires a strategic approach. Consider these tips to optimize your transactions:\n\nGas Estimators: Various online tools and wallets provide gas estimators that recommend a suitable gas price based on network conditions. These estimators help you strike a balance between prompt execution and cost efficiency.\n\nOff-Peak Usage: Initiate transactions during periods of lower network activity. Gas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. These solutions can significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times.\n\nBatch Transactions: Some wallets and platforms allow users to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch. This approach can save on gas costs, as multiple transactions are processed in a single block.\n\nGas Tokens: Gas tokens are tokens that can be minted when gas prices are low and burned (destroyed) when gas prices are high. This mechanism enables users to hedge against future gas price increases.\n\nSmart Contract Efficiency: Developers can optimize smart contracts to minimize gas consumption. This includes techniques like reducing unnecessary storage operations and using more efficient algorithms.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral aspect of the network\u2019s functionality. While they can present challenges, they are also a testament to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and utility. By understanding the factors that influence gas fees and implementing optimization strategies, users can navigate the Ethereum ecosystem more effectively and make the most of its innovative applications."

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "On Dec. 26, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said, \u201cEthereum is going to make a lot of new millionaires in 2024.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that those with a lot of ETH, purchased at much lower prices and staked, will do well in the next bull market. But those getting into the market now, with the asset trading over $2,000, are not going to make it big unless they have a lot to invest.\n\nThe big returns will be made trading Ethereum layer-2 assets, he said.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nEthereum to $15,000\n\nLark highlighted a number of current and upcoming layer-2 listings, such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. \u201cNew listings can make money, especially in the short term,\u201d he said.\n\nNewly launched tokens often exhibit pump-and-dump patterns as airdrop hunters offload them quickly. However, there have been several that have begun up trending soon after when they get listed on larger exchanges.\n\nFor the Ethereum hodlers, things could still be good in 2024. He compared gains for ETH from previous cycles and made a prediction for the next bull cycle in 2024 and 2025.\n\nNow that the asset has broken out from its resistance zone at $2,150, \u201cit\u2019s going to do big things.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum makes similar gains to the last cycle high, or even slightly less, \u201cthat will get us up to around $15,000 per coin.\u201d\n\nThis is on a hypothetical 200% gain from the previous high, which was around $4,880 in November 2021.\n\nFor those buying now, there is a potential 500-600% gain, he said, which is a \u201crelatively low-risk bet for crypto.\u201d\n\nEthereum is very strong fundamentally despite the lack of love recently from the crypto community.\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nCrypto markets are in retreat this Wednesday in Asia. As a result, ETH prices dropped 2% on the day in a fall to $2,223 at the time of writing.\n\nMoreover, the asset has now declined 6.8% from its 2023 high of $2,385 on Dec. 9. There is solid support at the $2,150 area where it could be heading next as markets continue to cool.\n\nThere is little doubt that the asset will perform well in the next bull cycle, but at the moment, the Ethereum engines are spluttering a little."

But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF.

Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021.

I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet thought to belong to former U.S. President Donald Trump recently moved millions in crypto earned from sales of non-fungible tokens, according to reports from Arkham Intelligence on Dec. 27.\n\nArkham noted that Trump\u2019s wallet began to send his ETH holdings to Coinbase three weeks ago and has moved 1,075 ETH, worth $2.4 million, to the exchange. Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

        "content": "A trader who accurately called the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bear market thinks that the uptrend of one Ethereum (ETH) challenger that has massively outperformed the broader crypto markets this year is far from over.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 233,400 followers on the social media platform X that the people who are calling for the end of Solana\u2019s (SOL) big rally this year will most likely miss out on the altcoin\u2019s surge to a fresh all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to Bluntz, Solana has a lot more gas left in the tank as he predicts that SOL could still print gains of more than 257% from current levels.\n\n\u201cSOL is still 113% away from ATH. Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto: 'Solana Is Ethereum,' Says SOL Founder - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Wed 27 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of SOL, highlights a new era of collaboration between Solana and Ethereum. According to him, Solana is Ethereum. This intriguing vision paves the way for crypto interoperability.\n\nSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 26, 2023 Anatoly Yakovenko is convinced: Solana is Ethereum\n\n\u201cSolana is Ethereum\u201d: What Does the Founder of the SOL Blockchain Mean?\n\nCrypto analysts have always considered Solana as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d. But recent statements by Yakovenko are changing the narrative.\n\nIn a recent post on his X account, Yakovenko is expanding the horizon of the crypto blockchain by suggesting that Solana can be more than a mere competitor to Ethereum. Specifically, the co-founder of the SOL crypto platform explores the notion of Solana as a layer 2 for Ethereum.\n\nIn his comments on platform X, Yakovenko explains that this symbiosis is possible through the \u201cnative wormhole layer.\u201d Danksharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability upgrade, then becomes the key to this collaboration. It will improve scalability, thereby paving the way for unexpected cooperation between two crypto blockchain giants.\n\nDanksharding: The Path to Crypto Interoperability\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, Danksharding appears to be the key that unlocks the potential for interoperability between the two crypto platforms. He maintains that the extension of danksharding will facilitate the integration of SOL blocks within a validation relay contract on the Ethereum crypto blockchain. This underscores a collaborative approach to bridging protocol and consensus differences.\n\nThe different consensus mechanisms between Solana and Ethereum raise questions about the stability of this crypto alliance. Some users wonder about the possible reorganization of Solana as a layer 2 if Ethereum adopts a different approach. In this regard, Yakovenko assures that users can withdraw their crypto ETH tokens from the bridge. The agreement from both sides remains essential, however.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that mutual agreement is necessary for seamless integration. He thus highlights the challenges that remain despite the innovative vision of crypto interoperability between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s bold statement marks a turning point in Solana\u2019s perception towards Ethereum. This exploration of crypto interoperability, fueled by Danksharding, promises a collaborative future in the complex universe of blockchain.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Price Exits Correction Trend With 6% Jump, Is $2600 Within Reach? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has managed to sustain above the $2150 level. This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation. With sustained buying the ETH price should surpass the last swing high resistance of $2400 to obtain a better confirmation and entry opportunity.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the post-correction rally can chase a potential target of $2665 aligned with the 0.618 FIB level\n\nKey Level to Watch\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum seems strongly bullish, the coin buyers may face renewed supply pressure at the $2400 mark. In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend. On the contrary, a breakdown below this support would trigger a significant correction in ETH price\n\nBollinger Band: The flattish upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator offers an additional layer of resistance at $2400\n\nVortex Indicator: A bullish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope signals a recovery trend in active.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Manta Pacific's TVL spiked 1,250% in December.\n\nIt is now the seventh biggest layer 2 blockchain network on Ethereum.\n\nOther layer 2s are also ratcheting up airdrops.\n\nCrypto airdrop hunters have deposited $345 million into Manta Pacific, Manta Network\u2019s Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, since December 14.\n\nWhy the sudden interest?\n\nBecause of an airdrop expected in early 2024.\n\nAirdrop hunters have deposited Ether and stablecoins into the blockchain to obtain rewards scheduled for distribution in January.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s TVL has skyrocketed 1,250% in December. This spike has made Manta Pacific the seventh largest Ethereum layer 2 blockchain per total value locked, according to data from Ethereum layer 2 tracking portal L2Beat.\n\nTVL is a metric that tracks how much crypto is locked up in a DeFi protocol\u2019s smart contracts, or in all DeFi protocols running on a given blockchain.\n\nPromising signs\n\nFor Kenny Li, co-founder of blockchain developer p0x Labs and Manta Network contributor, the TVL growth is encouraging.\n\n\u201cThese early promising signs mean that a new contender is emerging from DeFi to challenge the likes of zkSync and Base,\u201d Li told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBase and zkSync are also Ethereum layer 2 blockchains.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe smart contract that holds these deposits is not verified on Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, so it\u2019s difficult for independent security experts to determine its safety.\n\nManta\u2019s team says the contract has been reviewed by security experts.\n\n\u201cThe contracts have been audited by Veridise,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the audit is unverified on Etherscan as the contract is not open-sourced but we plan on having these verified in the future.\u201d\n\nFor risk-tolerant crypto degens, the unverified contract has not proved to be an issue as they\u2019ve run up nine-figure dollar deposits.\n\nInvestors were driven to deposit these funds as part of Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign.\n\nIt promises five layers of rewards for early investors, including an airdrop of 50 million Manta tokens. Manta isn\u2019t trading yet, so those 50 million tokens do not yet have market value.\n\nGetting a STONE token\n\nThis TVL growth is most likely driven by the promised airdrop because the project\u2019s canonical bridge has attracted only $28 million in deposits since its creation three months ago.\n\nManta airdrop hopefuls receive a token called STONE in exchange for their locked Ether deposits in the blockchain.\n\nSTONE is a so-called yield-bearing token, according to Manta\u2019s documentation. Airdrop hunters will be able to redeem STONE for Manta tokens in January.\n\nAs a yield-bearing token, airdrop hunters can use STONE to earn points on protocols within Manta Pacific that support the token. By doing so, investors can farm more STONE tokens and potentially increase their promised Manta token airdrop.\n\nDepositors also earn NFTs, which can be sold on Element, a multichain NFT marketplace.\n\nParticipants are also hunting for NFT combinations that will yield even bigger airdrop rewards, a process that requires them to acquire six different NFTs from the campaign that can be combined to get a premium NFT that offers greater rewards.\n\n$1 billion in investments\n\nManta is only the latest in a growing trend of projects enticing significant early backing with the promise of rewards early next year.\n\nBlast, a planned Ethereum layer 2 blockchain project, managed to attract about $650 million in barely a week after it was announced in November. The project now sits on top of over $1 billion in investments.\n\nLike Blast, Manta Pacific is also invite-only with prospective new entrants requiring invite codes from existing investors.\n\nManta Network did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

Raising awareness about the EthTrust standard becomes imperative for its broader adoption and ensuring a secure environment, especially within the dynamic sphere of Ethereum casino gambling.\n\nConcerns and Future Developments\n\nJohn Wingate\u2019s concerns about the dynamic nature of industry standards. John Wingate, CEO of BankSocial, expresses concerns about the ever-evolving landscape of industry standards. He highlights the perpetual changes in languages, including the depreciation of methods, variables, data types, and object types. The dynamic nature challenges consistency and adherence to the best practices within the blockchain space.\n\nConfirmation that version 3 is already in progress. In response to industry dynamics, Chaals Nevile reveals that EthTrust is actively evolving, with version 3 of the specification already underway. Recognizing the need for regular updates, Nevile aims to ensure EthTrust remains relevant and effective in addressing emerging security challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportance of testing: Emphasizing the need for repeatable, automated testing for decentralized applications. John Wingate emphasizes the significance of repeatable, automated testing as the paramount method to guarantee decentralized applications adhere to best practices.

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko says 'Solana is Ethereum' in layer-2 scalability debate h3>\n\nSolana creator Anatoly Yakovenko recently referred to Solana as an Ethereum layer-2 solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer in a post on X.\n\nIn the exchange, Yakovenko positioned the blockchain as an Ethereum layer-2 while responding to a tweet listing various other L2 solutions, including Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon, among others. He wrote:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, the integration of Solana with Ethereum is facilitated by the Wormhole eigenlayer, which would eventually allow the potential for Solana blocks to be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum after key scalability upgrades.\n\nOn the rise\n\nFollowing a challenging start to 2023, Solana ended the year with a significant upturn. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana impressively more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nThe post Anatoly Yakovenko says \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in layer-2 scalability debate appeared first on CryptoSlate.\n\nCheck More Latest Cryptocurrency News Click Here\u2013 Latest Cryptocurrency News\n\nCheck More Business News Click Here\u2013 Latest Business News"
