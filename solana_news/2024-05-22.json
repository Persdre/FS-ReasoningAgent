        "title": "Ethereum heats up over key ETF decision. Here's what you need to know. - Mashable",
        "content": "Ethereum, the nerdy cryptocurrency that was lately overshadowed by Bitcoin, is in the news again, and the price is pumping. What gives?\n\nWell, only one of the most important developments in Ethereum's history, anon. An Ethereum spot ETF (Exchange Traded-Fund) might get approved in the U.S. today \u2014 that's Thursday, May 23.\n\nUPDATE: May. 24, 2024, 11:51 a.m. CEST The first Ethereum ETFs indeed got the nod from regulators on Thursday, though there's more steps and hoops to jump through (see part on the S-1 form below) before they can actually start trading.\n\nBefore we get into all that, here's a very short primer on Ethereum or ETH. Launched in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin and others, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin, and it has been so for the better part of the past five years or so.\n\nWhat is this Ethereum thing you speak of?\n\nEthereum is a very different beast from Bitcoin. The latter is a digital currency and a public ledger of transactions that uses a network of computers (miners) to securely verify every transaction in the system, as well as create new coins through a computing-intensive process called proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Unlike Bitcoin, it uses proof-of-stake to power and secure the network, meaning there is no environmentally unfriendly mining, with validators using a stake of their ether or ETH (the underlying currency of the platform) to validate transactions. Also, unlike Bitcoin, which is all about the secure sending and receiving of bitcoins and fairly little else, Ethereum is a platform for other decentralized apps (also called smart contracts) to run on.\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes Ethereum more powerful than Bitcoin in a sense, but it also makes it more complicated, both in terms of usage and implications. These days, basically everyone \u2014 the likes of large banks and pensions funds included \u2014 understands Bitcoin to be a largely decentralized digital asset, which can be bought, securely stored and sold, akin to a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a lot more complicated, with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not being entirely clear on whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nAn ETH ETF is now a very real possibility\n\nThis leads us to the part about ETFs. In January 2024, after receiving the SEC's blessing, Bitcoin spot ETF funds started trading in the United States. This had immense implications as to who can buy Bitcoin; suddenly, a U.S. state pension fund or an investment fund was able to easily get exposure to Bitcoin without worrying about breaking some rule. And the \"spot\" part, in contrast to a futures ETF, means that the Bitcoin spot ETFs must buy actual Bitcoins when someone buys their product.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

And unsurprisingly, the price of Bitcoin soared from around $42,000 in early January to roughly $69,500 at writing time.\n\nMany of the same entities \u2014 large investment companies such as BlackRock, VanEck, and Ark \u2014 also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, with deadlines for SEC's approval or denial starting on May 23. And up until a few days ago, analysts largely believed that the ETFs would be denied, given SEC's previous reluctance to provide clear guidance over whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nThis has changed. According to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas, there was \"chatter\" that the SEC has completely reversed its stance on Ethereum, followed by a slew of potential ETF issuers submitting amended 19b-4 forms to the SEC, signaling that there's a very good chance that the ETFs are on their way for approval.\n\nWe know, the sheer mention of something like a 19b-4 form made you fall asleep instantly. But we mention it because there's another set of forms that need to be approved, the S-1 forms, and those are key for actual ETF approval.\n\nIn practice, this means we could get a very good indication that one or more (probably more) Ethereum ETFs are coming, but it might take weeks or months before they actually start trading.\n\nAs a result of these filings, the price of Ethereum rose from around $3,100 to $3,800, where it's trading at writing time.\n\nOf course, nothing is official or set in stone. The Ethereum ETF applications could still get denied, though the consensus among experts is that it's now a question of when, not if, it will happen. A denial would surely be a cold shower for Ethereum's price, at least in the short term.\n\nThis is one of the most important developments for crypto, period\n\nThis is not just about Ethereum's price. This sudden change of sentiment by the SEC could mean that the U.S. government is suddenly far more open to everything crypto related. Indeed, an important crypto bill was just passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, despite the SEC head Gary Gensler having some very stern words about it.\n\nPerhaps the simplest of implications of this approval is other crypto spot ETFs getting the nod in the future. But with BlackRock launching a tokenized version of its money-market fund on Ethereum, it's getting easy to envision a future in which a big chunk of global finance exists on the blockchain. In other words, your nerdy, crypto-mining neighbor who told you that one day all of finance will roll into crypto, may have actually been right.\n\nWhat now?\n\nWell, unless you're a trader looking to capitalize on price moves, you don't really have to do anything. Regardless of whether the Ethereum spot ETF is denied, approved, or delayed today, Ethereum and its ecosystem of apps will keep trudging along.\n\nBut it is important to consider that a potential approval fully legitimizes an entire new class of crypto assets. Institutions, funds, banks, perhaps even pension funds, will be looking to get in on the action, and it could spark a thriving period for Ethereum, as well as the apps and assets that reside on it. After a bit of a lull in the past couple of years, the crypto space could once again become very exciting over the next couple of years."

        "content": "Update, May 23, 2024: This story has been updated with additional information about the approvals.\n\nKey Takeaways The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule change allowing for the listing and trading of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe approval doesn\u2019t allow the ETFs to immediately begin trading, as the SEC will still need to review individual applications from asset managers for each of the eight ETFs that were given initial approval Thursday. That process could take several weeks.\n\nThis is a win for the crypto industry, which has been hoping for the approval of ether ETFs since a similar product for bitcoin was approved at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved applications for the listing of eight spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, though further approvals are necessary before you can start trading them.\n\n\n\nWhen Will Ether ETFs Begin Trading?\n\nAccording to a memo from the regulator, NYSE Arca has been authorized to list the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF; Nasdaq will list the iShares Ethereum Trust; and CBOE BZX will list the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and the Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nVanEck immediately followed the SEC's announcement with an S-1 filing, indicating that their product was ready to launch. The S-1 approval process, in which regulators will look at the specific ETFs themselves, could take weeks but some analysts say that process may be fast-tracked.\n\nSEC Comes Around Despite Concerns\n\nConcerns around whether ether is a security and staking were two major reasons why the SEC was reluctant to give a green light to ether ETFs. While many market participants say today's decision indirectly implies ether is not a security, the issues around staking were resolved when ETF issuers removed it from their applications.\n\nSome analysts said the White House's softened stance on crypto helped move the SEC toward approval. Additionally, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve the ETFs in a letter to the regulators.\n\nSince the January approval of spot bitcoin (BTC), markets have closely watched the approval process for similar funds for the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. That has created a runup in the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is up 60% year-to-date. Ether was up almost 2% on the day as the SEC made its announcement.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct number of spot Ether ETFs that have been approved for listing."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a security or commodity? Why does it matter and will an ETF change this? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The ongoing debate over Ethereum\u2019s classification in the United States is garnering significant attention at the moment due to actions by the SEC and a possible ETF approval. The distinction between commodities and securities holds substantial implications for the regulation and future of crypto. If Ethereum were officially recognized as a commodity, the crypto landscape could witness transformative shifts in regulatory oversight, market participation, and investment vehicles.\n\nCommodity vs security definitions\n\nIn the US, a commodity is generally defined as a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. This category includes items like gold, oil, and agricultural products. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodities, focusing on market stability and fraud prevention. Conversely, a security represents an ownership position in a publicly traded corporation via stock, a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation via bond, or rights to ownership as represented by an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities, emphasizing investor protection and disclosure requirements.\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification has been a contentious issue. In 2018, the CFTC asserted jurisdiction over Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, classifying them as commodities. The SEC, however, has historically been more cautious. In 2018, SEC Director William Hinman suggested that Ethereum, which had initially been funded through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), might not be a security due to its decentralized nature. Despite this, the lack of a definitive classification has left Ethereum in a regulatory gray area.\n\nHow would classifying Ethereum a commodity change things?\n\nThe potential recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would have several implications. Firstly, it would place Ethereum under the purview of the CFTC, which could lead to more consistent regulatory guidelines. This shift could reduce the regulatory uncertainty that currently hampers some institutional investors, thereby encouraging broader participation in the Ethereum market. Moreover, it could pave the way for new financial products, such as Ethereum futures and options, thereby enhancing market liquidity and stability.\n\nA significant development that could influence Ethereum\u2019s classification is the approval of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and typically operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur. In the context of Ethereum, an ETF would provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors alike. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has already set a precedent as it is designated a commodity ETF.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF could bolster arguments for its classification as a commodity. The successful launch of a Bitcoin ETF has demonstrated to regulators that digital assets can be integrated into traditional financial systems in a regulated and secure manner. An Ethereum ETF would likely undergo rigorous scrutiny, ensuring that all compliance and security measures are in place. This process could further validate Ethereum\u2019s status as a commodity by showcasing its stability and maturity as an asset class.\n\nRecognizing Ethereum as a commodity would not only clarify its regulatory status but also enhance its appeal to a broader range of investors. Institutional interest in crypto is growing, driven by the desire for portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation. Clear regulatory guidelines would mitigate the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty, making Ethereum a more attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, this recognition could spur innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. With regulatory clarity, developers and businesses could engage in more ambitious projects without the fear of unexpected legal repercussions. This could accelerate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader digital economy.\n\nUltimately, the official recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would mark a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It would streamline regulatory oversight, enhance market participation, and foster innovation. The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF could play a crucial role in this process, demonstrating Ethereum\u2019s viability as a stable and mature asset. However, it would not be an official settle the debate regarding Ethereum being a commodity unless additional specific classifications were issued by the SEC."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs are the wrong solution to the right problem - Blockworks",
        "content": "Numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a boon for the market. The first day of trading in the US saw over $4.6 billion in volume. Within a month, bitcoin rose above $50,000 for the first time since the bear market and hit $70,000 in March for the first time ever.\n\nBut this bitcoin ETF liquidity boost does not address any of the underlying issues in today\u2019s crypto user experience, nor does it offer investors empowerment through self-custody.\n\nIn the case of ethereum ETFs, the outcome will likely be the same. Rather than rely on regulatory approval of such financial products to welcome traditional investors onboard, our industry needs to reimagine how we approach digital asset management so that users don\u2019t need to choose between convenience and financial freedom.\n\nWhat interest in ETFs really tell us\n\nThe appeal of ETFs is exposure to the crypto market without the hassle of digital asset custody. With over 900,000 ETH forever lost due to user error, it\u2019s understandable that investors would look for easier ways to tap into the value created in this space.\n\nBut using old-world instruments to address crypto\u2019s user experience challenges goes against what this industry set out to do \u2014 transform existing financial infrastructure to empower the little guy.\n\nAfter years of being looked down on by Wall Street, ETFs are tacit acknowledgments by traditional investors that the crypto sector is something worth opening the floodgates of retail and non-crypto money into. Supposing that ethereum ETF approval generates further interest in the crypto space \u2014 be that bullish interest from Larry Fink at BlackRock, opposition from ECB director generals, or just curiosity from the trainer at my local gym \u2014 the opportunity lies in shepherding these new investors toward full ownership of their assets.\n\nThe ETF wrapper is one means of entry into crypto as an asset, but removing the wrapper brings us to the real treat \u2014 true ownership.\n\nNewfound industry attention, now to trust ourselves\n\nWhy should individuals care about self-custody and financial freedom? While the answer may be obvious to those deeply embedded in the crypto community, trusting traditional banks is the norm, and the convenience brought by these institutions outweighs the risks of crypto for many individuals.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin white paper was published 15 years ago, the manifesto envisioned a peer-to-peer network without financial intermediaries. Ethereum then brought new functionality to the digital asset space and created the foundation for DeFi innovation. For the first time, individuals could harness digital ownership and exchange assets globally online while preserving personal privacy and autonomy.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: BlackRock and other bitcoin ETFs rob bitcoin of its room to grow\n\nThe challenge now is to get people of all investment experience and levels involved directly through self-custody of their assets. Products like ETFs, which mirror instruments in the traditional finance space, may have a positive market impact. However, they do not push individuals to reconsider traditional financial hierarchies and take ownership into their own hands. Only by directly engaging in self-custody platforms will we see crypto values influence mainstream audiences.\n\nWe\u2019re only as good as our infrastructure\n\nSelf-custody is important, but how are we going to convince the next billion users to value freedom over convenience? It\u2019s obvious that seed phrases and hardware wallets are not going to unlock digital ownership for mainstream users. In a time where payments can be made with a tap of a phone or a watch, the crypto industry needs usable features to appeal to traditional investors and everyday users.\n\nThat\u2019s why Vitalik and other leaders in the Ethereum space are calling for a transition to smart accounts. By abstracting away the complexities of digital asset management, smart accounts enable features like crypto recovery, self-custodial debit cards and email login. In addition to smart accounts, improvements in scaling tools like zero-knowledge (zk) rollups have increased the capacity and throughput of DeFi applications, overcoming bottlenecks and preparing the industry for mainstream adoption.\n\nBetter features and scalability have paved the way for new use cases in crypto. Self-custody is no longer limited to individual asset management. With multi-signature accounts, for example, organizations and businesses can co-manage assets with ease. Further, developments in zk have reduced transaction fees, making it feasible for projects to facilitate large batches of transactions cost-effectively.\n\nThe crypto industry needs to continue building momentum\n\nBitcoin and ethereum ETFs have captured the zeitgeist, and now the crypto industry needs to capitalize on the mindshare introduced by this regulatory milestone. In the same way that football\u2019s popularity grew in my German hometown in the aftermath of Germany\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup victory, this newfound interest among conventional investors allows us to push self-custody to the forefront and showcase the opportunities unlocked by digital ownership.\n\nETFs encourage adoption; true crypto ownership encourages autonomy. Simplifying crypto user experience should be championed above simple ETF wrappers and commodity baskets. Bolstered with new liquidity, the industry needs to use this pivotal moment as a catalyst to revamp user experience across the board. Improving crypto-native platforms progresses the movement for digital ownership, which will outlast any market trends in the coming years.\n\nJulian Grigo is the Head of Institutions at Safe.

She cited sources who said there is still \u201cwork to do\u201d on those forms.\n\nThis could be seen as a positive development, but it suggests there might have been a previous delay in communication.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: Hearing that conversations concerning the S-1\u2019s have now started happening between @SECGov staff and issuers with the conclusion being that there\u2019s \u201cwork to do\u201d on those. \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 22, 2024\n\nIn a separate post, Terrett indicated the SEC might approve the 19b-4 filings today, followed by collaboration with issuers on S-1 forms in the coming weeks or months.\n\nCommenting on Terrett\u2019s post, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said with significant effort, S-1 applications for spot Ethereum ETFs could be resolved within a few weeks. However, he noted that the SEC may need additional time to complete the S-1 review process.\n\n\u201cI think that if they work extremely hard it can be done within a couple weeks but there are plenty of examples of this process taking 3+ months historically,\u201d Seyffart suggested.\n\nMost ETF issuers, including major players like Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco, submitted their amended 19b-4 filings earlier this week. Nasdaq also refiled BlackRock\u2019s proposed Ethereum ETF yesterday.\n\nThe clock ticks down as the market braces for the SEC\u2019s verdict on spot Ethereum funds.\n\nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggests a timeframe of around 4:00 PM ET for the SEC\u2019s announcement on the fate of these ETFs. The decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs previously arrived slightly earlier on the designated date.\n\nMy best guess is we hear from the SEC around 4pm tomorrow. For spot btc they dropped it at 3:45pm, some others in past were slightly after 4pm. Anything poss tho https://t.co/MzTOcsmTnJ \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 22, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price has surged 25% over the past seven days, trading at nearly $3,800 at press time, according to CoinGecko\u2019s data.\n\nExperts expect that a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval could trigger a sharp price increase. However, whether Ethereum can replicate Bitcoin\u2019s price action after the spot fund approval remains uncertain."

        "content": "Ethereum's price nears all-time high as ETF decision fuels market optimism.\n\nShare this article\n\nTomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement \u201cis happening,\u201d despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.\n\nJames Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s case was different. \u201cIn that instance, though, everything came together \u2013 ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly \u2013 and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,\u201d he shares.\n\nAlthough Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC\u2019s movement after the funds\u2019 approval. \u201cIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.\u201d\n\nRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. \u201cIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins\u2019 growth,\u201d added Lienkha.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was \u201ca sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.\u201d As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute \u2013 implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.\n\nMarko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH \u201cwell beyond its previous all-time high.\u201d Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.\n\nWhat if\u2026?\n\nDespite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn\u2019t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.\n\nNevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange\u2019s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.\n\n\u201cWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,\u201d Jurina added.\n\nMoreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. \u201cEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.\u201d\n\nEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a \u2018layered\u2019 scenario, which could end in a \u201chard rejection\u201d or a \u201csoft rejection.\u201d A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.\n\n\u201cThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,\u201d Bitfinex analysts concluded."

        "content": "Ethereum drops nearly 5% in an hour, suspected MEV manipulation by Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a nearly 5% crash in one hour this Thursday, despite the anticipation around the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. The X user identified as ai_9684xtpa pointed out that this was likely a market manipulation movement by the trading firm Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cThe agency sold 6,968 ETH in one minute at 20:56, worth $27.38 million, with an average selling price of $3,930; one transaction sold 3,497 ETH on the chain at one time, and the bribe cost was as high as 90 ETH,\u201d explained ai_9684xtpa.\n\nSuch transactions are known as MEV, short for \u201cmaximal extractable value,\u201d which consists of using on-chain resources to profit. The payment of 90 ETH suggests a hurry to sell the position at a higher price to make it crash, possibly to buy it again at a lower price.\n\nETH price fluctuation after Symbolic\u2019s transaction. Image: CoinGecko\n\nSince the crash, Ethereum has ranged in and out of the $3,800 price level and is priced at $3,803.37 at the time of writing, nearly 22% away from its previous all-time high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening\u201d\n\nAs shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, an approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is happening this Thursday. Despite the low odds given to this scenario until last Monday, Seyffart and his fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas boosted the chances to 75% after the SEC started contacting the issuers.\n\nSince then, various asset management firms presented amends to their 19b-4 filings, and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF even got listed on DTCC under the ticker $ETHV. The first final deadline is today, as the US regulator must decide on VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nMoreover, according to Balchunas, the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs might come at 4 pm (EST). Although a positive outcome is expected, it doesn\u2019t mean immediate permission for trading."

        "title": "Bernstein Expects Ether Surge 75% post Ethereum ETF Approval - Crypto Times",
        "content": "A lot of excitement and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts are predicting that if this approval happens, Ether could surge as high as $6,600.\n\nThe estimations come from analysts at the research firm, Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. They pointed out that a 75% increase in value occurred in the weeks that followed the SEC\u2019s approval of comparable Bitcoin WTFs in January.\n\nEthereum surged past $6,600 on speculation of SEC approval for ETFs, with a 22% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 4.5% rise. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped to $3,694. Its previous record was $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nIn research released on Tuesday, Chhugani and Sapra stated, \u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH.\u201d Two prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analysts created a stir on Monday when they increased the likelihood that an ETH ETF will be approved from 25% to 75%.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, said they revised their forecast for the ETF in response to rumors that the SEC was talking to exchanges more frequently. As previous, analysts have expressed it appears that the US\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is at a standstill.\n\nPotential SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs could take two steps: first, the ETF would need to be approved in theory, but the products wouldn\u2019t actually be sold in the market until after that. Observers of the market have interpreted this distinction favorably.\n\nConfusion has spread throughout the market as a result of the uncertainties surrounding ETF clearance, especially on prediction sites like Polymarket where users have staked $8 million on the result. Existing bets may become more complex if a two-step approval process is implemented.\n\nDuring these changes, Bitcoin has increased by 4.5% and passed over $70,000 in the last day, while Ethereum has gained 22% to $3,790. With ramifications for other applicants as well, the market is eager to see the SEC\u2019s ruling on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Decision Recalls Spot Bitcoin Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency\n\nRemember the spot bitcoin ETF launch?\n\nAs the spot Ethereum ETF approval drama unfolds, investors and exchange-traded fund industry observers can recall parallels between this case and events leading to the eventual approval and unveiling of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn both cases, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially exhibited caution toward approving spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. However, pressure from various stakeholders, including issuers, investors and the maturing crypto market, spurred a potential shift toward approval.\n\nBoth decisions reflect growing recognition of the maturing cryptocurrency market and rapidly increasing institutional interest in these assets.\n\nThe presence of spot bitcoin ETFs and the potential approval of an ether-based ETF suggest the SEC is considering the growing demand from investors for regulated ways to gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies.\n\nA key difference between the two cases is that the Ethereum ETF approval process may be faster than bitcoin's due to the legal precedent set by the August 2023 Grayscale court case, which effectively reversed the SEC\u2019s initial rejection of the asset manager's spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complex path to approval and greater receptivity toward well-structured spot cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nIs a Dogecoin ETF Next?\n\nIn the first two days of trading this week, the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% as investors began to speculate that the largest meme coin by market cap could be the next for a spot ETF approval.\n\nCrypto trader Andrew Kang tweeted to his 244,000 followers on X Tuesday, \u201cthe odds for a DOGE ETF look brighter than ever.\u201d\n\nWhile speculation over more spot ETFs is not surprising, it would be surprising if a spot DOGE ETF was next in line.\n\nCryptocurrencies with clear and demonstrably valuable use cases beyond speculation might be viewed more favorably. Additionally, a well-developed ecosystem with robust infrastructure for secure storage and transactions could be a plus. Widespread acceptance, measured by larger market capitalization (total value of all outstanding coins) and higher trading volume (liquidity) may also be considerations.\n\nFor example, there are five cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and ether that have larger market caps than Dogecoin, according to data from CoiMnarketCap.com.\n\nBehind Bitcoin and Ethereum, these are the largest cryptocurrencies on the market:\n\nTether USDt (USDT): This stablecoin, with a market cap of roughly $111 billion, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is a popular choice for investors seeking stability within the crypto market.\n\nBNB (BNB): The native coin of the Binance ecosystem, BNB, has a market cap of around $91 billion and is used for various purposes within the Binance exchange and its blockchain applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana, known for its fast transaction processing speeds, currently has a market cap of approximately $80 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the spot Bitcoin ETF launches and increasingly likely spot Ethereum approvals are positive developments, but they don't guarantee a flood of spot ETFs for more cryptocurrencies. The SEC will likely continue cautiously, prioritizing established cryptocurrencies with well-structured ETF proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

        "content": "Europe has many crypto exchange-traded products on the market.\n\nThe UK launched an Ethereum ETP this week.\n\nEuropean investors aren\u2019t that interested in crypto ETPs.\n\nIn the US, the crypto industry is buzzing in anticipation ahead of an expected approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds.\n\nBut nations across the Atlantic are already miles ahead with similar crypto investment products.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange, for one, will begin handling Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products for the first time by the end of May.\n\nNumerous ETPs\n\nAnd in Europe, there are already multiple Ethereum financial products, or ETPs, on the market. They include exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded commodities, which operate in similar ways to ETFs.\n\nBut the products, which have been on the market for years, haven\u2019t caught much steam. That\u2019s because Europeans are less keen on risky investments and prefer stability, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about where\u2019s the alpha going to come from, it\u2019ll be the place with the deeper capital markets and more eager investor base driving the inflows to push these things upward,\u201d Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, told DL News.\n\nDigital asset investment firm 21Shares launched its Ethereum Staking ETP in 2019, and Ethereum ETPs from VanEck and CoinShares made their debutsin 2021.\n\nBut inflows are relatively small.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe 21Shares\u2019 Ethereum ETP has over $307 million assets under management, and VanEck\u2019s has a total net assets of $175 million.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, institutional investors are already prepared to pour $500 million into Ethereum ETFs over the next week if they are approved, according to an analysis by the OKX exchange.\n\nEnthusiasm in the US\n\nThe products follow the price of Ether and allow investors a way into crypto through a bank or investment firm without having to open a crypto wallet or an account with a crypto platform.\n\nFor proponents, crypto ETFs and ETPs provide digital assets with validation and a bridge to broader financial markets.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January. The two biggest funds, launched by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, have vacuumed up more than $30 billion between the two of them as of Thursday.\n\nBut there are stark differences between Europe and the US.\n\nEurope has \u201cmore of an ecosystemic approach\u201d to innovative finance, according to Voloder.\n\nWith legal frameworks for crypto assets starting to come into effect this year and other investment guidelines from regulators, lawmaking sets the foundations.\n\n\u2018Even if Europe has the regulations, our investor base has always lagged behind America.\u2019 \u2014 Erwin Voloder\n\n\u201cEU regulators are more proactive and US regulators are more reactive which is why you see broker dealers launching digital asset structured products in Europe,\u201d Voloder said.\n\n\u201cRegulations enable innovation and experimentation,\u201d he added. This is what allows financial institutions to test tokenised financial instruments.\n\nBut still the size of the capital markets is reflected by that underlying divergence.\n\n\u201cEven if Europe has the regulations to enable innovation, our investor base has always lagged behind America,\u201d Voloder said.\n\nCrypto ETPs beyond Ethereum\n\nCardano Staking ETP by Liqwid began trading on Deutsche B\u00f6rse exchange group on Wednesday. The product is domiciled in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSwitzerland is at the forefront, as staking is regulated here, allowing us to build products incorporating staking\u2014something not yet possible in the US,\u201d Florian Volery, co-founder of Liqwid Finance, told DL News in an email. He is hopeful that the US will eventually catch up.\n\nThe DeFi entrepreneur expects to see actively managed ETFs that include other crypto assets like Bitcoin or Solana in an investment strategy.\n\n\u201cThis development is a game changer for the crypto industry, making it mainstream and a dedicated investment category within the asset and wealth management industry,\u201d Volery said.\n\nInbar Preiss is a Regulation Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity today, marked by notable developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Furrever Token. As Bitcoin holds steady on Bitcoin Day, maintaining its value from yesterday, Ethereum has captured significant attention by surging 23% in just one week. Adding to the excitement, Furrever Token has caught the eye of many investors with its potential for up to 15X returns, making waves in the crypto community. These dynamic shifts highlight the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies and the diverse opportunities they present for traders and investors alike.\n\nEthereum Surges 23% in a Week Amid Record ETF Trading Volumes\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,750, nearly unchanged from yesterday but up 23% over the past week. This surge is driven by growing anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs hit a record daily trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak in March. ProShares' Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the way, accounting for $43.14 million of the volume, followed by VanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) with $2.6 million and Bitwise's Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) with $2.01 million.\n\nDespite this new record, Ethereum futures ETF trading volumes remain far below those of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $2.16 billion in trading on Tuesday, dominated by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT with $1.12 billion. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a significant increase, reaching $684.44 million in daily trading volume, the highest since May 2021.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from 25% to 75%, citing a possible shift in the SEC\u2019s stance on crypto regulation. This optimism has further fueled Ethereum's recent gains.\n\nAs the market awaits potential SEC approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, the increased trading activity and positive sentiment continue to bolster ETH's price, positioning it for further growth.\n\nBitcoin Holds Steady at $69,400 Amid Market Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $69,400, maintaining a stable position from yesterday but up by 5% over the past week. The slight drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price on Wednesday came as traders cashed in on recent gains fueled by optimism over a potential spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nEther, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a pullback after reaching a two-month high earlier in the week. This movement was driven by reports of progress towards the approval of spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is expected to make a key decision later this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the spot Ether ETF, broader market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing concerns about U.S. interest rates. Persistent inflation and warnings from several Federal Reserve officials about the need for more evidence of decreasing inflation before rate cuts can begin have kept traders wary.\n\nAttention is now focused on the minutes from the Fed's late-April meeting, which could provide further insights into the central bank\u2019s plans regarding interest rates. High interest rates generally have a negative impact on crypto markets, as they reduce the attractiveness of high-risk and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe cautious sentiment in the market underscores the delicate balance between optimism over potential regulatory approvals and concerns over macroeconomic factors affecting the crypto landscape. As traders await further cues from the Fed, Bitcoin's price stability reflects the broader uncertainty in the market.\n\nFurrever Token's 15X Return Promise Attracts a Wave of Investors\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has captured the crypto community's attention with its promise of up to 15X returns for presale investors after its official launch. This enticing potential has sparked a significant influx of investors eager to capitalize on the opportunity before the presale concludes.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a roaring success, with over $1.1 million raised in just three months. Currently in stage 8 of its 10-stage presale, Furrever Token aims to raise a total of $1.9 million. The current token price is $0.000648, and investors can purchase FURR exclusively from the official website, furrevertoken.com.\n\nFurrever Token's mission is to create a fun and heart-warming crypto ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery. The project integrates cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals, fostering a warm and friendly community. This unique approach has resonated with many investors, contributing to its organic growth and engaged community of nearly 4,000 members on Telegram.\n\nThe legitimacy of Furrever Token is bolstered by a smart contract audited by Securi Lab, no buy/sell tax, and a team committed to locking their tokens for a year. These measures reassure investors of the project's long-term viability and security.\n\nWith the presale nearing its end, now is the perfect time to invest in Furrever Token.

        "content": "A representation of cryptocurrency Ethereum is placed on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken on June 16, 2023.\n\nThe SEC has approved a rule change Thursday that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether , one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe decision comes less than six months after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved bitcoin ETFs. Those funds have proven to be a big success for the industry, with net inflows already surpassing $12 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nLate May had long been pegged as a potential decision date for the ether funds since it coincided with a deadline for the SEC to decide whether the VanEck Ethereum ETF could proceed.\n\nMany of the companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs \u2014 including BlackRock, Bitwise and Galaxy Digital \u2014 have also started the process of the launching an ether fund.\n\nThe price of ether rose just 2%, although it follows a 20% surge from earlier in the week in anticipation of Thursday's decision. Some investors may also be on pause, as the SEC's rule change approval does not guarantee that all the funds will launch.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC's order approves applications from various exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The order technically does not approve the funds themselves or set a date for the ETFs to begin trading.\n\nEther ETFs are expected to be smaller, at least initially, than their bitcoin counterparts. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently has about $11 billion in assets, much smaller than what the firm's bitcoin fund was before its conversion.\n\nThe approval of the ether ETFs is a sign that the SEC's stance toward crypto may be softening after a series of legal fights. The agency lost a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023 that spurred the approval for the bitcoin products.\n\nThe SEC's push to regulate crypto has also come under scrutiny by politicians. The Senate last week passed a resolution to withdraw an SEC staff bulletin about accounting rules for digital assets.\n\nEther is the second largest crypto asset and has become something of a blue chip coin along with bitcoin, although its value proposition is distinctly different. While bitcoin is seen primarily as a long-term store of value, an investment in ether is considered more akin to an investment in early stage technology. The ether token fuels the Ethereum network, which powers different applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or the tokenization of real world assets like commodities, securities, art, real estate and more.\n\nThe applications approved Thursday do not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network, said Richard Kerr, a partner in the law firm K&L Gates.\n\n\"If and when an ether product is approved, it won't mean that a similar product for other digital assets on the Ethereum platform would be approved,\" Kerr said.\n\nEthereum also provides opportunities for staking, which is a way for investors to earn interest on their ether holdings by locking up tokens on the network for a period of time \u2014 although ether ETFs in the U.S. may not participate. The SEC has alleged in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken that staking-as-a-service offerings are unregistered securities. Ark, Fidelity and Grayscale updated their filings this month to remove staking from their proposals.\n\nThe lack of staking in the ETF products is another reason why ether ETFs may see less demand than their bitcoin counterparts, said Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Private.\n\n\"These numbers are not going to match the bitcoin ETF inflows, and there are some structural differences in the product that just make it less attractive overall,\" Lubka said."

        "title": "What Ethereum ETF Approvals Would Mean for US Crypto Policy - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated earlier this week that it was suddenly open to the prospect of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, after months of stubborn signals to the contrary, the about-face didn\u2019t just catch Crypto Twitter by surprise.\n\nIt also shocked the nation\u2019s top crypto lobbyists, who spend their days tracing minuscule shifts in Washington\u2019s mood on the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable pivot,\u201d Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt. \u201cIt is one that I did not foresee.\u201d\n\nHow did the pivot come to pass? And after years of relentless hostility against the crypto industry, might the development indicate that the SEC, and the U.S. government more broadly, are changing their tune on crypto?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we've absolutely turned a corner,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt marks a complete shift in understanding about the political importance of crypto.\u201d\n\nCrypto industry lobbyists who spoke with Decrypt attribute the SEC\u2019s sudden tack to a recent change of political winds in the nation\u2019s capital. Most agree the series of events that prompted the change kicked off last week, when President Joe Biden issued a forceful threat to veto a pro-crypto bill.\n\nThe bill, which sought to repeal an SEC rule dubbed SAB 121\u2014which discourages American banks from holding crypto\u2014later passed in the Senate with a surprising amount of support from Biden\u2019s own party. Twelve Democrats supported the bill, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader.\n\nThat degree of Democratic support was not anticipated on Capitol Hill. And it undoubtedly sent a message to the White House, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Smith believes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have that many [Democrats] break away from the Biden Administration after it already put out a veto threat on it,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is significant.\u201d\n\nExacerbating matters is the fact that, in recent weeks, Republicans including former president Donald Trump have begun embracing crypto more explicitly than ever before\u2014creating the impression among crypto industry leaders that only one political party is on their side.\n\nCody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, another crypto lobbying group, believes the pressure recently applied by Republicans on crypto, in tandem with the open dissent Biden is now facing on the subject from leaders within his own party, led the president to make a calculated decision to back off crypto\u2014at least for now.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is seeing, in a very tight election that can be swung by a few million votes, that this is not the hill to die on,\u201d Carbone told Decrypt.\n\nThat evolution in Biden\u2019s thinking could already be seen Wednesday, when the president issued a statement regarding another crypto-related bill up for a vote this week\u2014FIT21\u2014which seeks to create a federal framework for regulating crypto. While Biden objected to the bill\u2019s passage, he crucially did not threaten to veto it, as he did last week with the repeal of SAB 121.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, FIT21 easily passed a vote in the House, 279-136, with support from 71 Democrats including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nJi Kim, chief legal and policy officer at lobbying group Crypto Council for Innovation, sees the events of the last week as proof that crypto has now\u2014albeit suddenly\u2014 graduated into a topic of consensus within U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cWhat this all means is that crypto is absolutely a bipartisan issue,\" he said, \"and that members of Congress are further realizing crypto is absolutely here to stay.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the same reasons the White House is now tacking on crypto to save face, the SEC is too, crypto lobbyists say\u2014especially given that the unexpectedly popular, bipartisan repeal of SAB 121 singled out the policies of SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nRubber-stamping spot Ethereum ETFs\u2014which would allow Wall Street firms to buy and store ETH on behalf of their clients\u2014might prove the most visible way for Gensler to take some heat off his back, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Kristin Smith estimates.\n\n\u201cI think this is his sort of peace offering, to show that he is open to this space, and he realizes now that the political winds are against him,\u201d she said.\n\nBut crypto lobbyists disagree on what the move would mean for the SEC\u2019s long-term crypto policy moving forward.\n\nSmith is optimistic the change of heart would mark a major shift in how Gensler and the SEC might police crypto from now on.\n\n\u201cI think he's going to have no choice but to back down,\u201d she said of the SEC Chair. \u201cThat doesn't mean he goes back and undoes all the actions that he's initiated\u2014but he's going to have to think twice before doing something aggressive against the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce\u2019s Cody Carbone, however, has a less cheery outlook. He figures spot Ethereum ETF approvals would represent nothing more than a cold and calculated political maneuver on Gensler\u2019s part. A meaningful change in the SEC\u2019s outlook on crypto? Far from it.\n\n\u201cI don't think you're going to see him dropping any of these cases or stop fighting,\u201d Carbone said of Gensler. \u201cI just don't think you'll see any more headlines. Most of his decisions are driven by PR.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF approval will set stage for Solana ETF, commodity classification - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to a recent Bernstein report, the approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US may establish a precedent for classifying Solana (SOL) as a commodity.\n\nThe classification of cryptocurrencies as either securities or commodities holds significant implications. Commodity classification facilitates ETF applications and approvals, while security classification subjects assets to stricter SEC oversight.\n\n\u2018Big three\u2019\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would mean the SEC views the second-largest crypto as a commodity, setting a critical precedent. This would mark the first time a non-Bitcoin digital asset receives such a classification, raising expectations for Solana to follow suit.\n\nEther\u2019s price increased earlier this week after Bloomberg analysts raised the likelihood of SEC approval for spot Ether ETFs to 75% from 25%, following reports that the regulator requested updates to filings. The SEC\u2019s final decisions on these applications are expected later today, on May 23, following multiple delays.\n\nBernstein\u2019s report noted that Bitcoin\u2019s 75% rally following the approval of spot ETFs suggests similar price action for Ethereum after approval of spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, if the SEC rejects the applications, Ethereum could experience significant volatility and a steep price correction in the coming days, according to CryptoQuant research.\n\nCrypto investor Brian Kelly expressed similar optimistic views about Solana and the potential regulatory approval of Ethereum ETF products during a recent CNBC interview. He speculated that SOL could be the next altcoin to receive ETF approval, highlighting it as a likely candidate for investment managers to push forward.\n\nKelly emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the \u201cbig three\u201d digital assets that might see ETF products approved in this cycle. He noted the success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, valued at around $58 billion, indicating strong demand for regulated crypto investment products.\n\nHowever, Kelly also acknowledged some skepticism within the Solana community. He mentioned that Solana\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) and its classification as a security by the SEC could pose challenges for ETF approval.\n\nDespite this, Kelly remained optimistic that the shifting regulatory and political landscape might increase the chances of Solana ETF approval if Ethereum ETFs receive the green light.\n\nShifting political landscape\n\nThe Bernstein report, released ahead of the SEC\u2019s final decisions on ETH ETF applications, also highlighted a potential shift in the Biden administration\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies based on recent developments.\n\nAdditionally, the report noted that if Trump is reelected, his adminitration is likely to further support the crypto industry through legislative and regulatory measures. According to the report:\n\n\u201cShould Trump get elected, crypto could see significant legislative and agency support, leading to long-lasting structural changes in crypto financial integration.\u201d\n\nThe potential approval of Solana ETFs comes amid a changing regulatory environment and growing bipartisan support for crypto. The recent passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act by the House, with significant Democratic backing, indicates a potential political shift.\n\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky described the bill\u2019s passage as a \u201cvote of no confidence\u201d in the SEC\u2019s current approach to crypto regulation, suggesting political consequences for maintaining an anti-crypto stance.\n\nRegulatory approval of Solana ETFs would mark a significant milestone for the crypto industry, signaling mainstream acceptance and integration. However, with Ether ETFs still awaiting approval, the industry remains cautiously optimistic about the future.\n\nMentioned in this article"
