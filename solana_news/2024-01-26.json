        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) had depressing week after the historic approval and trading of several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunged hard on Monday following a sell-off from digital asset fund manager Grayscale. The virtual coin dropped below $40,000 (to $38,678) on Tuesday, but slowly recovered as the week went on.\n\nIt is now trading for $41,830, CoinGecko data shows, a less than 1% movement over seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading, it had operated like a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. However, following its conversion and subsequent trading, investors started to cash out quickly.\n\nThis led Grayscale to send huge amounts of the cryptocurrency to its custodian, Coinbase, leading to pressure on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off slowed towards the end of the week\u2014likely leading to the rebound in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though: Analysts told Decrypt that Bitcoin \u201ccould see increased appeal\u201d in 2024\u2014if the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut BTC\u2019s plunge in the week hit the wider crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) was a big loser, dropping to $2,186 on Tuesday and never really recovering, logging an 8% loss over the week. It\u2019s now trading for $2,264.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts drop came following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to delay ETH ETF proposals from both BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) took a beating. It was, at the start of the week, one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies. It has since picked up and is trading for $92.60, a more than 1% seven-day rise.\n\nWhile Dogecoin (DOGE)\u2014the original meme coin and 11th biggest cryptocurrency\u2014pumped at the start of the week over speculation that it might be used for payments on Twitter, it slowly drifted back to where it started. It kicked off the week at $0.08, and is back at the same spot as of writing.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Roughly \u201860% chance\u2019 of spot ETH ETF approval in May: Seyffart - Blockworks",
        "content": "Spot ether ETFs have roughly a 60% chance of being approved in May, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nEarlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on the potential BlackRock and Grayscale ether ETFs. Alongside BlackRock and Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and VanEck are also in the running for a spot ether ETF.\n\nThe delays were not surprising, according to experts who expect the SEC to put off a decision on the ETFs until later this year. The SEC, earlier this month, approved a slew of bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead more: Race for a spot ether ETF begins with bid from Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nSeyffart is eyeing May 23 as the next date to watch in the spot ether saga. May 23 marks the 240-day window for the SEC to decide on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck.\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them\u201d around that date, he told Blockworks. \u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf a May approval doesn\u2019t pan out, then Seyffart plans to watch 2025.\n\nGrayscale is taking a similar approach to its bitcoin ETF by trying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a radio interview that the firm is looking at summer 2024 for an SEC decision.\n\n\u201cThat clock will come due sometime this summer,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nIts application for a bitcoin ETF was initially denied which led the firm to file an appeal. Back in August, a panel of judges sided with Grayscale, leaving the SEC to reconsider the application.\n\n\u201cThis ruling opened the floodgates for BTC, so to speak. And also put the SEC in a logical pretzel,\u201d Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said.\n\nFast forward to January, and Grayscale was one of nearly a dozen firms approved to launch. It is also the fund with the highest number of outflows since the ETFs went live earlier this month.\n\nJohnsson further gave his insights on the possible ETH ETF roadmap in a post on X Thursday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cnuance right now,\u201d but he expects that, in the long term, \u201cETH spot is almost guaranteed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the SEC can choose to ask potential issuers to pull their applications or issue denials when the May deadlines come around. If the SEC were to ask Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw then it\u2019s a \u201cgood indication that the SEC is going to approve these,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin,\u201d he added, noting how different the two are.\n\nCaution, Johnsson said, \u201cis warranted in assuming spot ETF approval.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJohnsson believes that the existence of ether futures ETFs is a bright spot for the potential green light, having seen that the SEC approved the bitcoin ETFs partially on that basis.\n\nSeyffart added that the SEC could say that the futures market isn\u2019t \u201clarge enough or liquid enough or impactful enough\u201d when looking at spot ether ETFs.\n\nBut, as May approaches, there should be clues that \u201cinform\u201d the public as to what the SEC is thinking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few different things that we can look to to get a feel for what\u2019s going on that we don\u2019t have yet, and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to have it for some time. Perhaps another month or two,\u201d Seyffart said. These things include filings and responses from both the issuers and the SEC.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly not surprise me if the SEC decided to avoid the [DC Circuit] at all costs and simply issued approval,\u201d Johnsson said in a post on X.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview earlier this week, said that the SEC \u201cshouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nShe added that the SEC will \u201capply precedent\u201d to spot ether decisions.\n\nCurrently, Seyffart told Blockworks, the process for spot ETH approval reminds him of July of last year. Around that time, BlackRock and other issuers were about a month into the spot bitcoin ETF race and the Grayscale decision had yet to be issued.\n\n\u201cI know the timeline isn\u2019t exactly lining up that way, but what we know and what we don\u2019t know are kind of in the same boat,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts : All You Need To Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum stands as a decentralized blockchain platform driven by the Ether token, offering users a versatile range of capabilities. From facilitating transactions to playing games, engaging in cryptocurrency trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) earning interest through staking, and even participating in social media activities, the platform presents a comprehensive ecosystem.\n\nMany envision Ethereum as the natural progression of the internet. While centralized platforms like Apple\u2019s App Store embody the era of Web 2.0, Ethereum represents the dawn of Web 3.0\u2014a decentralized, community-driven network. This new phase in internet evolution supports decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It\u2019s crucial to note that Ether, not Ethereum, is the designated crypto unit.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNow, let\u2019s unravel some lesser-known facts that add intriguing dimensions to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum takes a different stance on token supply. With over 120 million its tokens circulating, a stark contrast emerges\u2014over ten times more tokens than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by its approaching finite supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum follows a different trajectory, emphasizing abundance over scarcity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s imminent scarcity pushes its value higher and poses challclassicenges to mining. The philosophy is straightforward: fewer coins available often translate to higher cryptocurrency value. Once a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply, mining stops, and market dynamics revolve around supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum doesn\u2019t impose a fixed supply cap. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d to manage Ether\u2019s inflation rate, ensuring network security and motivating validators.\n\nThe platform\u2019s issuance rate undergoes adjustments through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and community consensus. Diverging from Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap, it introduces a flexible approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments to maintain balance within the network. Notably, EIP-1559 introduces a deflationary element by burning a portion of ETH as a base fee, contributing to the evolving economic dynamics of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Narrative\n\nThe Ethereum community faced a seismic event in 2015\u2014the DAO hack, resulting in a substantial loss of $150 million worth of tokens. To salvage Ethereum from the brink of collapse, a consequential decision was made: a hard fork. However, a faction within the community, guided by the principle of \u201cCode is law,\u201d opted to adhere to the original code. This pivotal moment birthed two chains\u2014the forked chain retaining the name Ethereum, and the original chain christened Ethereum Classic, which continues to follow the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, preserving the ethos of the original code.\n\nThe Genesis: Birth and Philosophy\n\nEthereum\u2019s beginnings trace back to 2013, involving a collective effort by eight individuals, including the visionary Vitalik Buterin, who crafted the coin (ETH) in Switzerland. With its official launch in 2015, Ethereum\u2019s origin story bears the imprint of Buterin\u2019s dissatisfaction with centralized services\u2014a sentiment molded by his experiences in the world of World of Warcraft. This critical perspective formed the philosophical foundation of Ethereum, steering its path toward decentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid confusion between Ethereum and Ether. Ether, the native token, serves as a virtual coin within the Ethereum network, much like other digital currencies. Beyond being a tradable asset, Ether plays various roles\u2014it is used for transactions, runs applications within the Ethereum network, and serves as a means to monetize activities conducted on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s move towards Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn the early days, both Bitcoin and Ethereum relied on a process called \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW), where individuals could mine new tokens by validating blockchain transactions on their personal computers. However, in September 2022, Ethereum (ETH) underwent a significant transformation, moving away from PoW to embrace Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder PoS, new coins are created when crypto owners \u201cstake\u201d their own coins, essentially locking them up to participate in transaction verification and, consequently, earn rewards. While this method was already employed by Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Ether swiftly ascended to become the leading cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.\n\nThe primary motivation behind this shift lies in energy efficiency. The energy consumption associated with Ethereum transactions was staggering, equating to over 100,000 VISA transactions in December 2021. However, post the Ethereum Merge, the energy footprint notably decreased. Observers believe that this change not only influences public perceptions of cryptocurrencies but also holds implications for the future development of popular decentralized finance (DeFi) categories within Ethereum, such as crypto lending.\n\nExploring Alternatives to \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d\n\nEthereum encountered a pivotal moment known as the \u201cSplit,\u201d sparking a quest for alternatives to the traditional \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW) model. As some enthusiasts applaud the reduction in energy costs, not all its formerminers welcomed the Merge, a transition away from the PoW model.\n\nIn September 2022, a revealing graphic displayed a substantial dump of Ethereum (ETH) by miners holding blockchain addresses linked to their mining activities. Expecting a price surge post-Merge, these miners were disappointed, leading to the selling of their ETH holdings.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed a surge in transaction counts, reaching approximately 1.1 million per day in September 2022. This uptick in activity coincided with the aftermath of the Merge and the subsequent dissatisfaction among miners. The dissatisfaction prompted a significant number of miners to part ways, seeking alternative cryptocurrencies for their mining endeavors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Crowdfunding\n\nEthereum\u2019s inception traces back to a community-driven initiative, spearheaded by its creator, Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, Buterin conceived the idea of decentralized blockchain platform, inspired by a sense of dissatisfaction with the limitations he observed in Bitcoin. His vision extended beyond the constraints of existing blockchain technology, aiming to create a platform capable of supporting intricate and diverse applications.\n\nIn 2014, he initiated a community-backed fundraising effort, selling the initial batch of Ethereum tokens known as Ether (ETH) to the public. This crowdfunding campaign marked a significant milestone, surpassing expectations and raising over $18 million in just 42 days. Notably, this successful endeavour propelled the blockchain into the ranks of the first and largest crowdfunded projects in history.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began not only as a technological innovation but as a testament to the power of community support, illustrating how collaborative efforts can pave the way for ground breaking projects in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nBonus: Ethereum\u2019s Growing Influence in Tech Boardrooms\n\nBeyond the realm of developers and investors, Ethereum has captured the attention of major corporations. Giants like Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Intel, and Amazon are exploring itspotential solutions. Enterprise software companies, including IBM and Deloitte, are testing the platform\u2019s networks, signaling a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in corporate landscapes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain, Ethereum stands as a pioneer, symbolizing innovation, adaptability, and community-driven progress. Beyond its decentralized framework, the popular platform embodies the essence of Web 3.0, ushering in a new era of user empowerment. From token dynamics to the Proof-of-Stake transition and corporate intrigue, Ethereum\u2019s journey reflects a dynamic intersection of technological evolution and philosophical principles. As it charts the course for decentralized possibilities, it serves as a testament to collective spirit in advancing blockchain technology."

        "content": "FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevicha projects Ethereum\u2019s price could further dip towards $2,000, as the altcoin is down by over 8% weekly.\n\nThe crypto market is experiencing a period of subdued volatility, with the total market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion for the third consecutive day. Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.\n\nAs of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.\n\nFurther complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana is leading pack\n\nSolana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.\n\nAt the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.\n\nResistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.\n\nThe relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.\n\nEthereum needs push\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.\n\nResistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.\n\nThe selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary \"fuel,\" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average."

        "content": "Ethereum Scaling Solution AltLayer Launches With $100 Million Airdrop\n\nAltLayer recently became the first of at least three protocols to go live with an impressive $100 million token airdrops scheduled for the upcoming week. The launch marks a milestone in the field of blockchain technology, offering promising solutions for Ethereum's scalability issues.\n\nThe much-anticipated ALT token and the claiming process were officially made available to the public as of Jan. 25, 9 am UTC, as per Cointelegraph. A staggering 300 million tokens were allocated for the initial airdrop, resulting in a total value of approximately $96 million based on the current average daily price of $0.32 per token.\n\nHowever, Celestia stakers eager to participate in the ALT airdrop will have to exercise patience as AltLayer reported technical differences delaying the distribution to Celestia. Despite this delay, AltLayer's airdrop comes at a time when several other projects are also expected to distribute their respective tokens to eligible recipients within the same timeframe.\n\nDymension and Jupiter to Follow Suit\n\nAccording to ADVFN, among these projects is Dymension, a multilayer rollup deployer poised to launch its mainnet in the near future. Dymension plans to airdrop 70 million DYM tokens, primarily benefiting Celestia stakers and Pudgy Penguin NFT holders, as well as participants in the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nFurthermore, the Solana-based decentralized exchange Jupiter has confirmed the launch of its highly anticipated JUP token on Jan. 31. A total of 1 billion tokens will be distributed through the airdrop, making it potentially worth around $410 million based on the current pre-market trading price of approximately $0.41 per token.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Users Could Benefit from Airdrop\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Ordinals users may also have an opportunity to participate in an airdrop. Ordinals developer Leonidas recently announced the launch of \"Runestone,\" a decentralized \"fairdrop\" initiative designed to reward early users of the Ordinals protocol. The airdrop aims to incentivize users' early adoption and engagement.\n\nWhile airdrops offer exciting possibilities, crypto users must exercise caution. The X platform is currently plagued by scam accounts posing as crypto firms' official social media pages announcing airdrops. Users must remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.\n\nPhoto: Traxer/Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "Market picture\n\nVolatility in the cryptocurrency market remains subdued, keeping the capitalisation near $1.56 trillion for the third day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains around $40K, and Ethereum looks pegged to $2200.\n\nThe drop in equity indices over the past 24 hours hasn\u2019t been too much of a concern for cryptocurrency investors so far, as it looks more like a series of individual corporate stories rather than a global shift in sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation as its share of all cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed 50%.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum, the second most-capitalised coin, has returned to the lower end of the consolidation it spent most of December in, losing since the start of the day and threatening to fall a notch lower to the $2100 area, which was the upper end of the consolidation in November. A decline here would be as logical a move as a BTCUSD pullback to $37500, which remains the main scenario. At the same time, however, be prepared for a brief dip towards $2000 due to cryptocurrency volatility.\n\nNews background\n\nThe SEC postponed the decision on BlackRock\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF until 10 March. Optimistic experts expect the Ethereum ETF to be approved in May with a 50-70% probability, while sceptics point to regulatory resistance.\n\nThe emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has opened the door for the cryptocurrency to reach a wider audience. Now, for the first time, cryptocurrency could become mainstream, said the head of institutional at exchange Coinbase. New cryptocurrencies will attract a lot of capital, but it won\u2019t happen overnight. It will take \u201cmonths and even years\u201d.\n\nThe G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board in 2024 plans to focus on global regulations for the digital asset industry and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nReuters confirmed the existence of a thriving underground crypto market in China. Investor interest in digital assets is growing against the backdrop of a troubled economy and a lack of value preservation tools. With Hong Kong\u2019s approval of digital assets in 2023, Hong Kong has become one of the opportunities for Chinese investors to access cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "On chain sleuth ties Ethereum Foundation to 2016 GateCoin Hack as US SEC delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF - Tekedia",
        "content": "A new investigation by an on-chain sleuth has revealed that the Ethereum Foundation may have been involved in the 2016 Gate Coin Hack, which resulted in the theft of more than 185,000 ETH and 250 BTC from the Hong Kong-based exchange.\n\nThe on-chain sleuth, who goes by the pseudonym of Boringsleuth, published a detailed report on X, where he traced the origin and destination of the stolen funds using blockchain analysis tools. He claims that he found evidence that some of the hacked ETH was sent to an address controlled by the Ethereum Foundation, and that the Foundation later sold some of the tainted coins on Kraken.\n\nThe Gatecoin Hack occurred between May 9th and May 12th, 2016, prior to at the onset of The DAO\u2019s token sale & 1 Month Prior to The Dao Hack. Per Gatecoin\u2019s official statement on May 14th, the hack resulted in losses of 185K Ethereum, valued at more than $460M today. At the time, Gatecoin \u201cclaimed\u201d that the hacker was able to alter their own system to bypass their multi-sig cold storage, so that all inbound Deposits into Gatecoin went straight to their exploitable Hot Wallet.\n\nThey list the 4 Hacker Eth address\u2019 below involved in the Exploit, Among the 4 ETH address\u2019, one address, 0x1342a0, was originally funded PRIOR to the exploit. Our focus in this thread is looking into who it was that funded this Hacker\u2019s wallet, in hopes of gaining an idea of who it was that was behind the Hack.\n\nBoringsleuth\u2019s report is based on the assumption that the hacker used a smart contract to split the stolen funds into smaller amounts and send them to different addresses. He says that he identified the hacker\u2019s contract by looking for transactions that had a high gas price and a low value, which indicated that they were used to deploy a contract.\n\nHe then analyzed the contract\u2019s code and found that it had a function called split Funds , which took an array of addresses and amounts as inputs and sent ETH to each address accordingly.\n\nBoringsleuth says that he tracked down all the addresses that received ETH from the hacker\u2019s contract and found that one of them belonged to the Ethereum Foundation. He says that he verified this by comparing the address with the list of addresses that received ETH from the genesis block, which are known to be controlled by the Foundation.\n\nHe also says that he checked the balance history of the address and found that it received 2,000 ETH from the hacker\u2019s contract on March 15, 2016, which was one day after the Gate Coin Hack.\n\nBoringsleuth claims that he further followed the trail of the stolen ETH and found that some of it was sold on Kraken between April and June 2016. He says that he identified the Kraken deposit address of the Foundation by looking for transactions that had a high value and a low gas price, which indicated that they were used to transfer ETH to an exchange.\n\nHe then cross-referenced the address with Kraken\u2019s API and found that it matched with one of the Foundation\u2019s accounts. He also says that he checked the trading history of the account and found that it sold 1,337 ETH for BTC between April 4 and June 13, 2016.\n\nBoringsleuth concludes his report by saying that he has contacted both Gate Coin and the Ethereum Foundation to inform them of his findings but has not received any response from either party. He says that he hopes that his investigation will shed some light on one of the biggest unsolved hacks in crypto history, and that he will continue to monitor the movement of the remaining stolen funds.\n\nUS SEC delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF, a fund that would track the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC said it needed more time to evaluate the proposal, which was filed by BlackRock in October 2023. The new deadline for the SEC\u2019s decision is March 29, 2024.\n\nBlackRock is one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, with over $9 trillion in assets under management. The company has been exploring the crypto space for a while, and already offers exposure to Bitcoin futures through some of its funds. However, the Spot Ethereum ETF would be the first of its kind to directly invest in the underlying asset, rather than derivatives.\n\nThe SEC has been cautious about approving crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation, volatility, custody, and investor protection. So far, the regulator has only approved Bitcoin futures ETFs, which trade on regulated exchanges and are subject to margin requirements and clearinghouse oversight. Spot ETFs, on the other hand, would hold the actual cryptocurrencies in custody, and would require the SEC to grant exemptions from some of its rules.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting the approval of spot ETFs, as they would provide a more convenient and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to the nascent asset class. Spot ETFs would also potentially boost the liquidity and price discovery of the underlying cryptocurrencies, as well as attract more institutional investors to the space.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s delay is not surprising, given its history of postponing or rejecting crypto ETF proposals. The regulator has repeatedly asked for more information and feedback from the public and the industry on various aspects of crypto ETFs, such as valuation, liquidity, arbitrage, market surveillance, and investor education. The SEC has also indicated that it prefers a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets before approving spot ETFs.\n\nBlackRock is not the only company that is seeking to launch a spot Ethereum ETF in the US. Other firms, such as VanEck, WisdomTree, and Bitwise, have also filed similar proposals with the SEC, but have not received any response yet. Meanwhile, Canada has already approved several spot crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ones, which have attracted significant inflows and trading volumes.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC will finally greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF in 2024, or whether it will continue to delay or deny such products. The crypto industry is hopeful that the regulator will eventually recognize the benefits and potential of spot ETFs and will align its stance with other jurisdictions that have already embraced them.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

Trending #8 and #11 on @dexscreener. ?https://t.co/8AO3d7z78ehttps://t.co/WXqV4WTt0Z pic.twitter.com/2ntHQHdHBf \u2014 MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 24, 2024\n\nNew tokens have arrived\n\nThe tokens BIDEN2024 and TRUMP2024 are two of the most popular tokens that have been created in this context. The TRUMP2024 token grew by 751% over the last month and was trading at $0.00000000451 at the time of writing.\n\nThe volume at which it was trading grew by 26.69% in the last 24 hours and was currently at 3.69 million.\n\nComing to the BIDEN2024 token, it grew by 694.25% last week and saw a gigantic surge of 1796.25% in volume. At press time it was trading at $0.00000000431 and its volume was $2.41 million.\n\nAs the presidential election inches near, the probability of these tokens seeing more growth is very high. However, after the event, the prices of the token may collapse.\n\nMemecoins are very susceptible to rug pulls and holders should be careful around these tokens. Holders and traders should hedge their bets if they decide to invest in these tokens.\n\nL1 networks gain\n\nEven though some holders may gain or lose out on money eventually, Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH] might see positive returns regardless.\n\nThe hype around these tokens on both Solana and Ethereum may add to an uptick in activity on both of these networks. The networks saw a massive surge in activity over the last few months as well.\n\nAccording to Artemis\u2019 data, the number of daily active addresses on Solana increased from 214,000 to 624,000 in the last 3 months.\n\nSolana was lagging behind Ethereum in this regard earlier, however, at press time, Solana had outperformed Ethereum by a large margin. At press time, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network amounted to 357,000.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

Ethereum on the other hand had 1.6 million."

        "title": "Ethereum sell-off alert: Here\u2019s what to watch for ETH/BTC pair - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) performance against Bitcoin (BTC) is a leading indicator of market cycles and an altseason. Thus, cryptocurrency traders and investors constantly monitor the ETH/BTC pair for valuable insights.\n\nIn particular, the well-known CrediBULL Crypto has his eyes turned to this pair and warns of a possible Ethereum sell-off. According to him, Ethereum has found a local top against Bitcoin in an expected deviation above previous highs.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto posted this analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on January 25, quoting a previous post where he forecasted the deviation, as happened.\n\nBoom. Beautiful rejection on ETH/BTC as expected. May revisit those local highs but imo a full retrace of ETH/BTC is on the horizon as $BTC recovers from this recent correction and begins it's next impulsive move to the upside, outperforming ETH once again.\n\n\n\nAs I have said before\u2026 https://t.co/HllnRI4Pee pic.twitter.com/uiOqcVvRBO \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nETH/BTC analysis\n\nNotably, the trader points to a breakout from the current support line at 0.04905 BTC per Ethereum. Furthermore, ETH/BTC should continue its downfall through 0.04624 BTC straight to a range below 0.03800 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: CrediBULL Crypto\n\nCrediBULL Crypto explained ETH/BTC will only find a bottom once Bitcoin makes a new all-time high. Therefore, investors must be aware of \u201cany bounces before that,\u201d as they will most likely fade away, in his words.\n\nSince posting, Bitcoin has already outperformed Ethereum by around 2%, validating the above analysis. However, the economic context is a key factor to consider. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything could change swiftly.\n\nOn the other hand, institutional investors are turning to Ethereum and showing support for altcoins and tokenization. Recently, Franklin Templeton backed ETH, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies focused on utility. In the meantime, BlackRock\u2019s CEO shared his vision of tokenization while talking about an expected Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nAll things considered, it is possible that the ETH/BTC pair surprise technical analysts in the near future, depending on further developments involving institutions and the regulatory landscape. Investors must trade cautiously, keeping themselves updated on the adoption and demand for Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
