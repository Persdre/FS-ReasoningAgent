        "title": "Ethereum wins a major battle, but its war with the SEC is far from over - Fortune",
        "content": "Consensys, the maker of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, announced this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission has backed off its unpopular campaign to investigate developers who use Ethereum. The move is in line with the growing legal consensus that Ethereum is a commodity, not a security, which puts it outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The announcement, however, also contained a dark lining that reveals SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crusade against Ethereum is far from over.\n\nYou may recall that things between Consensys and the SEC came to a head when the company took the bold step of suing in April, asking a federal judge to force the agency to back off. The lawsuit came as a preemptive strike after the SEC had telegraphed it was on the verge of filing charges against the company after a year-long campaign of issuing subpoenas to developers who use Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s legal position became tenuous after the agency, under growing political pressure, approved Ethereum ETFs\u2014an acknowledgement the currency is indeed a commodity. In response to an enquiry from Consensys, the SEC then informed the company it was \u201cclosing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\u201d The \u201c2.0\u201d phrase appears to be a reference to the blockchain\u2019s new proof-of-stake system that went into effect in 2022.\n\nAll of this came as good news to the market, and the price of Ethereum jumped around 3%. But one line in Consensys\u2019s announcement hinted that all was not quite as well as it seemed\u2014namely that its lawsuit with the SEC was ongoing. This seemed strange given that, if Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has no jurisdiction and there is nothing to hash out in court.\n\nI asked Consensys\u2019s lawyers what is going on and they told me the SEC is still going after MetaMask because it can be used to swap tokens on the DeFi market, and also because it offers access to staking\u2014a key element of Ethereum that pays users to help secure the network. Here is how the lawyers put it:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s theory is that, because the Swaps offering allows users to trade various tokens using DeFi platforms, it is a securities broker due to at least some of those tokens being securities. They also assert that providing a user interface to two liquid staking protocols is also brokerage activity, and that it also constitutes offering unregistered crypto asset securities. The closing of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation doesn\u2019t resolve those issues.\u201d\n\nThe SEC, in other words, is trying to argue that Consensys\u2014and by extension other firms\u2014is an unlicensed brokerage engaged in the securities trade. This is likely a losing argument too, but it\u2019s on brand for Gensler, who has treated the process of crypto regulation like a personal vendetta, to dig in to the bitter end. The upshot for the crypto industry is it has won another battle, but the war goes on.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating Jump\u2019s crypto trading activities.

        "title": "What You Need to Know about Ethereum ETFs - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "What You Need to Know about Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe buzz around Ethereum ETFs is reaching a fever pitch. Let's break down when you can expect them to hit the market and who's behind the scenes making it happen.\n\nEthereum ETF Launch \u2013 When\u2019s the Big Day?\n\nInvestors and traders are clutching their Ethereum wallets in anticipation of the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF guru, Eric Balchunas, has circled July 2nd on the calendar. This date could be a game-changer, opening up a fresh route for folks to dive into Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s in the Game?\n\nThe road to getting these ETFs approved has been a wild ride. The SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for eight big players, including heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. This stamp of approval is a big deal, letting these companies move forward with their ETF plans.\n\nThe SEC has also tossed some light comments on the S-1 filings back to the issuers. This is a good sign that things are moving in the right direction. SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted during a budget chat on June 13th that we might see these ETFs get the nod by September. Back on May 23rd, the SEC gave a thumbs-up to the 19b-4 filings from eight companies for Ethereum ETFs. This is a solid signal that these ETFs are just around the corner. Investors and traders are watching like hawks, knowing that the launch of Ethereum ETFs could shake up the crypto market in a big way.\n\nMarket Projections\n\nGetting a grip on the market projections for the Ethereum ETF can be a game-changer for crypto traders and investors. Let\u2019s break down VanEck\u2019s price forecast and the expected institutional money flow.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Price Projection\n\nVanEck, a big player in asset management, has thrown out a bold prediction for Ethereum (ETH). They reckon Ethereum could hit $22,000 by 2030. This guess is based on Ethereum pulling in around $66 billion in \u201cfree cashflows.\u201d\n\nInstitutional Capital Inflows\n\nThe launch of spot Ethereum ETFs is set to draw in a hefty amount of institutional cash. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered thinks the inflows could be anywhere from $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year alone.\n\nThese numbers show just how much Ethereum ETFs could shake up the market. If you\u2019re into crypto trading or investing, this is something you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nImpact on ETH Prices\n\nPrice Rally Prediction\n\nEveryone\u2019s buzzing about the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, and it\u2019s got the crypto world in a tizzy. QCP Capital, a trading firm out of Singapore, thinks this could send ETH prices soaring. They\u2019re talking a 60% jump, similar to what happened when spot Bitcoin ETFs got the green light back in January.\n\nMarket Reaction and Price Fluctuations\n\nThe market\u2019s been all over the place since the news dropped on June 13th. ETH took a nosedive from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest point for the month. But it didn\u2019t stay down for long, bouncing back up by 0.69% to $3,517.\n\nEven with these ups and downs, the market isn\u2019t exactly screaming \u201cbullish.\u201d It looks like ETH might still be stuck in a bit of a rut, influenced by some bearish vibes. Check out the recent price movements.\n\nFor traders and investors, keeping tabs on these shifts is key. Knowing how the market\u2019s reacting can help you make smarter moves with your investments.\n\nApproval Process Updates\n\nSEC Chair\u2019s Statements\n\nDuring a budget hearing on June 13th, SEC Chair Gary Gensler mentioned that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs is expected to wrap up by summer, with a likely nod by September. The timeline hinges on how quickly issuers respond to the SEC\u2019s feedback. This has stirred up quite the buzz in the crypto world.\n\nPrice Impact and Market Sentiment\n\nEven with worries about the drawn-out approval process for Ethereum ETFs, Gensler\u2019s recent comments hint at a September green light, giving issuers more prep time. After the June 13th announcement about the potential approval, ETH\u2019s price saw some ups and downs.\n\nETH\u2019s price dipped from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest in June. But as of the latest update, ETH has bounced back a bit, up 0.69% to $3,517. Despite these price swings, the indicators didn\u2019t show a strong bullish vibe, suggesting ETH might still be swayed by bearish trends. This mixed market sentiment highlights the cautious optimism about the potential Ethereum ETF approval."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is finally entering reversal mode, with the price of the first cryptocurrency sliding in above the $65,000 zone. However, it is still moving below key support levels like the 50 EMA and is currently consolidating at the 100 EMA. The most decisive factor for a recovery would be momentum that is not present at this exact moment.\n\nIt is critical that Bitcoin maintains above $65,000 for the near future. Strong support has been seen at this level, which might serve as the basis for a reversal. If Bitcoin is able to overcome the immediate resistance at the 50 EMA or roughly $67,000, traders are hopeful of a possible rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI which is centered on 47, shows that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, pointing to a period of consolidation prior to any notable movement. The macroeconomic environment as a whole is one factor influencing Bitcoin's current performance. Investor sentiment in a variety of markets, including cryptocurrency, has been influenced by worries about inflation and possible interest rate increases by central banks.\n\nBitcoin's long-term prospects are still promising despite these obstacles because of its growing institutional adoption and ability to act as an inflation hedge. Given its continued institutional interest and widespread adoption, Bitcoin's long-term prospects appear bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana's questionable position\n\nWhile Solana clearly gained some respectable strength back in May, the situation for the asset has changed, and it has been going down steadily for the past 20 days. The SOLETH chart, often used for gauging market volatility, is clearly exhausted and might provide us with some growth in the future.\n\nThe Solana vs. Ethereum chart, which contrasts the two most powerful altcoins available, is an important comparison. This comparison makes the relative strength and possible volatility of the altcoin market easier for traders and investors to understand.\n\nA positive outlook for altcoins overall is frequently indicated by Solana's strong performance versus Ethereum and vice versa. Because SOLETH captures the growth and performance dynamics of two significant cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin, it is regarded as a barometer for market volatility. In the domains of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana and Ethereum are renowned for their strong ecosystems and noteworthy use cases.\n\nSignificant movements in these two assets may point to more general trends on the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum frequently serves as a benchmark since it is the bigger and more well known of the two. Conversely, Solana stands for more recent quickly expanding blockchain initiatives. It is possible to infer market sentiment regarding innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency space from the interaction of these two assets on the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nCardano's unexpected bounce\n\nCardano somewhat bounced from a local support level at approximately $0.35, with the potential to fight with the 26 EMA for momentum in the next few days. This bounce is a small but crucial step toward breaking an aggravating downtrend that has plagued the cryptocurrency for months.\n\nHolding above $0.35 is critical for Cardano in the near term. This level has provided a lot of support and might provide the groundwork for a future upswing. Cardano may indicate the start of a recovery phase if it can muster enough momentum to test and possibly break above the 26 EMA.\n\nAn RSI of about 37 indicates that ADA is in oversold territory, which may draw in buyers searching for cheap points of entry. But Cardano has not exactly performed well over the long haul. Even with the community's strong support and the project's lofty objectives, ADA has had difficulty holding onto its value. Cardano has experienced a protracted decline and has not been able to return to its prior highs since hitting its all-time high in early 2022.\n\nNumerous reasons contribute to this subpar performance, including the general mood of competition from rival blockchain platforms and slower-than-anticipated development progress. Although anticipated by many investors, the Cardano ecosystem has not yet produced the ground-breaking applications.\n\nAlthough the deployment of smart contracts on the Cardano network was a big step forward, neither the number of dApps nor user adoption has increased significantly as a result of it. Some investors have become frustrated with ADA's slow development, which has made them doubt the company's long-term prospects."

As we move through 2024, Ethereum, Solana, and Furrever Token rise as the must-watch cryptos, each advertising unmistakable focal points and openings for financial specialists.\n\nEthereum and Solana: Balanced for a Major Upward Move?\n\nLater market examination by Jason Pizzino demonstrates that the cryptocurrency market is right now in a stealth zone, characterized by expanded fear and diminished market intrigued.

This level of strength shows a bullish structure for Ethereum, proposing potential for a slow recuperation over the coming months.\n\nSolana's Bullish Positioning\n\nSolana (SOL) is in a comparable position to Ethereum, remaining over the 50% mark of the whole bear market range.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe second wave of the crypto ETF marketing blitz has officially begun, with crypto index fund manager Bitwise releasing a \u201cnational TV ad\u201d on Thursday talking up the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4pm,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet on Thursday with an accompanying video.\n\nUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 40-second commercial featured an old man role-playing as the traditional stock market that\u2019s only \u201cawake\u201d from 9:30am to 4pm, contrasted with a young man representing Ethereum\u2014a blockchain that never goes offline.\n\n\u201cStablecoins, NFTs, loans... people can access me 24/7,\u201d the young man tells his elder. \u201cYou\u2019ll get after it again on Monday.\u201d\n\nFollowing the post, Bitwise revealed that it had minted the video as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Half of the ad\u2019s proceeds will go directly to the commercial\u2019s two actors.\n\nThe simple, short pitch mirrors that of the array of Bitcoin ETF commercials that hit the airwaves late last year. Promoters like Galaxy Digital said Bitcoin \u201cembodies empowerment in the digital age,\u201d while HashDex pitched it as the next \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d in financial technology after the credit card.\n\nBitwise was also the first of many issuers to run a Bitcoin ETF ad at the time, recruiting help from Johnathan Goldsmith\u2014the most interesting man in the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat influx of ads preceded the Bitcoin spot ETF rollout that occurred roughly a month later, attracting billions of dollars in investments. As of today, expert analysts believe Ethereum ETFs are weeks away from going live, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas forecasting a simultaneous launch on July 2.\n\nGrayscale ran a TV commercial about Ethereum in March in support of its existing $10 billion Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which it intends to convert into an Ethereum ETF. However, Bitwise's ad is the first to go out for a proper Ethereum ETF after regulators officially approved them for public trading in late May.\n\nWhile no other Ethereum ads have emerged yet, future ETF providers have been talking up the asset\u2019s investment thesis. Much like Bitwise, VanEck in early June pitched Ethereum as a new and improved set of global financial rails, forecasting that ETH would hit $22,000 by 2030.\n\nLikewise, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan posted a thread on Thursday arguing why investors may want to diversify into Ethereum alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cAdding ETH to a portfolio over a full crypto market cycle has historically boosted both your absolute and risk-adjusted returns compared to adding BTC only,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Gavin Wood co-founded Ethereum and wrote its first implementation, pioneering smart contracts.\n\nWood founded Polkadot, enhancing blockchain interoperability, and later transitioned to Chief Architect for innovative focus.\n\nGavin Wood\u2019s journey into the world of blockchain began using LEGO bricks rather than a computer. Self-described as a \u201ctechnologist at heart,\u201d Wood\u2019s early interest with creating intricate constructions gradually moved from actual blocks to digital ones. This love of innovation and problem-solving made his later activities in the blockchain sector possible.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that Wood came into contact with. Thanks to the Silk Road online black market, his discovery was, in a sense, accidental.\n\nEnticed by the mathematical approach of human cooperation and interaction found in Bitcoin, Wood recognized the possibility of establishing whole new social systems. In little time at all, this interest became a professional possibility.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nWood had a meeting with Vitalik Buterin and other trailblazers engaged in the ambitious Ethereum project in 2014. Once Wood joined this team, he was instrumental in turning Ethereum from a white paper into a working blockchain.\n\nWith the creation of the initial Ethereum implementation, he introduced the world to smart contracts\u2014a ground-breaking idea that made decentralized, programmable transactions possible.\n\nWood wanted to create a platform that might propel social change as much as a new coin. Ethereum seemed to him like a means of creating a new planet that would propel human development for the remainder of the century.\n\nHis Ethereum work established the foundation for a significant force in the blockchain space that would upend established financial and economic institutions.\n\nMoving Beyond Ethereum: The Creation of Polkadot\n\nWood made major contributions to Ethereum and then focused on addressing some of the shortcomings he observed in the state of blockchain technology. As a result, Polkadot, a technology meant to facilitate smooth interoperability between several blockchains, was developed.\n\nThrough its special architecture, Polkadot addresses the scalability and governance problems that single-chain networks encounter by enabling several blockchains to run concurrently.\n\nood just presented a significant Polkadot update at the Token2049 conference: the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM). By enabling multi-core computing and improving network flexibility, this new protocol seeks to offer a more modular and minimalistic design.\n\nFrom Polkadot\u2019s current Relay Chain, the JAM protocol marks a dramatic change that will solve present constraints and advance the ecosystem toward its lofty objectives.\n\nWood resigned from Parity Technologies, the business that owns Polkadot, in October of 2022. He is still very much a part of Polkadot\u2019s technical and conceptual components as Chief Architect, even if he is no longer CEO. This change enables him to spend more time on the creative improvements and projects that still define his profession.\n\nThe Broader Impact of Gavin Wood\u2019s Work\n\nWood made more than just Ethereum and Polkadot contributions to the blockchain space. His concept to build decentralized platforms with blockchain technology has impacted a great deal of initiatives and businesses.\n\nThrough enabling interoperability between several blockchains, Polkadot has created new opportunities for both developers and companies, encouraging creativity and teamwork throughout the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a LEGO fanatic to a blockchain visionary, Gavin Wood\u2019s path demonstrates his unwavering quest of technical innovation. Beyond what blockchain technology can do, his work has encouraged a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to go outside the box.\n\nThe tale of Wood is proof of the ability of creativity and vision to propel technological advancement. Key elements in his success have been his commitment to finding solutions to difficult challenges and his ability to predict the promise of blockchain technology.\n\nWood\u2019s story emphasizes for would-be entrepreneurs and engineers the value of remaining inquisitive, accepting obstacles, and never stopping to get better.\n\nThe future of distributed technology seems bright as long as Gavin Wood keeps leading and innovating in the blockchain field. His efforts with Polkadot and the JAM protocol are expected to completely change the way blockchains communicate, strengthening and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Comparing Avalanche and Ethereum: Which One Is Better? - Modern Diplomacy",
        "content": "Blockchain technology is developing quickly with several platforms springing up to meet the numerous demands and difficulties in the decentralized ecosystem. Among these, Ethereum and Avalanche stand out as two of the most prominent and innovative blockchain networks.\n\nDedicated platforms like Coindataflow.com offer a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche price predictions. Developers, businesses, and investors can access complete information on prices, market capitalizations, charts, and statistics for both Avalanche and Ethereum. To find out which one is better, you should read the article below where we compare Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe Basics of Ethereum\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a distributed platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It introduced the concept of a programmable blockchain, allowing for the creation of a wide range of applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, following Bitcoin.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts : The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.\n\n: The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

The platform\u2019s first-mover advantage has resulted in widespread adoption and a strong network effect.\n\nIn contrast, Avalanche is relatively new but has quickly gained traction due to its superior performance and flexibility. However, the adoption of Avalanche is growing rapidly, with many projects choosing to build on its platform due to its technical advantages.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is a critical aspect of any blockchain network. Ethereum has a long track record of being a secure platform, although it has faced some high-profile hacks and vulnerabilities in the past. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enhance security further.\n\nAvalanche, with its novel consensus mechanism, also offers robust security features. Its PoS system reduces the risk of 51% attacks and ensures network stability.\n\nDevelopment and Flexibility\n\nBoth blockchain platforms offer flexible development environments. Ethereum\u2019s EVM is widely used and well-supported, making it easier for developers to create and deploy dApps.\n\nAvalanche, on the other hand, offers more flexibility with its subnet feature, allowing developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific use cases. This feature makes Avalanche an attractive option for enterprises and projects requiring specialized blockchain solutions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDetermining which blockchain platform is better between two notable blockchain platforms ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the user. Ethereum boasts a mature ecosystem, extensive developer support, and a solid track record, making it a reliable choice for many projects. However, Avalanche\u2019s superior performance, scalability, and flexibility make it a compelling option, especially for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0, the competition between these two platforms is expected to intensify, bringing further innovations and improvements to the blockchain space. For developers, businesses, and investors, both Avalanche and Ethereum offer unique advantages that can be leveraged to build the next generation of decentralized applications and services.\n\nCarefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. Thus you can make an informed decision on which one best suits your needs in the constantly changing domain of blockchain technology."

        "title": "Choosing Polygon over Ethereum to Build Efficient dApps - Appinventiv",
        "content": "Polygon aims to give people numerous choices when they create dApp on Polygon. Some developers keep security over speed while others compromise on security for lowered fees and speed \u2013 the technology is building multiple Ethereum-centric scaling solutions to address all these different features.\n\nEthereum has remained a pillar in the cryptocurrency space. Right from DeFi to smart contracts and even NFTs, Ethereum has remained one of the key innovations of Web3. However, inspite of the glaring success, the technology has struggled with massive network congestion, high network fees, and lowering transaction throughput \u2013 factors that have created a scope for newer crypto projects coming in to scale it. Polygon is one such project.\n\nOriginated in 2017, India-based software company Polygon Technology scales Ethereum without sacrificing on its decentralization benefits. With the number of dApps on Polygon having reached 53,000, businesses are using the technology\u2019s low fees and fast speed to build Ethereum-powered dApps.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the different facets of Polygon and what makes the technology better than using Ethereum for dApps development.\n\nHow does the Polygon dApp builder work?\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables developers to build dApps on Ethereum without getting stuck with Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nHow it does that is by developing a layer 2 solution using off-chain on-chain concepts and different governance models like Proof of Stake, which helps the network lower its energy footprint by 99.95% \u2013 one which Etherum has also reached after The Merge. In addition to using a PoS architecture where the network participants stake MATIC for validating the transactions, Polygon enables developers to use its open source SDK to launch their Polygon dApp at the back of multiple scaling techniques:\n\nZK-Rollups: The ethereum-based technology acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for USD 400 million. What this protocol does is it enables transaction authenticators to validate the encrypted data without actually accessing the information enabling them to generate the verification proof in under 170 milliseconds.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: It consists of bundling several off-chain transactions into massive batches before submitting them in Ethereum. This way, the fixed costs get spread across multiple transactions that reduce the end-user fees. In essence, this scaling technique assumes off-chain transactions validity without pushing out validity proofs for the on-chain transaction batches by following a fraud-proving methodology to identify transactions having discrepancies.\n\nPlasma Chains: This scaling technique builds a child-parent relationship in Ethereum\u2019s main chain. For example, the plasma chains can deploy their own dApps on Polygon which comes in handy when the other sidechains get hacked or are down. Additionally, the plasma chains tend to deliver off-chain transactions at higher efficiency levels.\n\nAt the back of these scaling methods, while the answer to how much time does it take to build dApp on Polygon is same as that on Ethereum or other blockchain technology, the transaction speed and cost difference is unmatched.\n\nFeatures of Polygon for dApp development\n\nThe technology merges the capabilities of sovereign blockchains and Ethereum into an attractive feature set that helps developers build a decentralized app on Polygon that is highly efficient, scalable, and speedy.\n\nEthereum compatibility\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon you work on a platform with complete Ethereum compatibility to tech stack, languages, standards, and tools.\n\nHigh scalability\n\nThe technology is built on dedicated blockchains, a scalable consensus algorithm, and a customized Wasm execution environment.\n\nCompetitive network Greater security\n\nPolygon dApp development is built on a modular \u201csecurity as a service\u201d facility offered either by Ethereum or a pool or validators.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe technology comes with a native support for the arbitrary messaging passing bridges for external systems and can easily connect with Ethereum main chain using the bridging SDKs polygon offers.\n\nGood user experience\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon it is very similar to one on Web2 purely at the back of a facility like instantaneous transaction finality.\n\nModularity\n\nPolygon comes with high extensibility, customization, upgradability, community collaboration, and a short time-to-market.\n\nThese features of Polygon for dApp development are designed to bring the technology at par with the adoption of Ethereum minus all the limitations of the latter. This makes it profitable for developers and enterprises alike to build a decentralized app on Polygon.\n\nAmidst these feature sets and the obvious benefits of Polygon for dApp development, is it time to let go of Ethereum? And on a technological level, what difference does Ethereum hold from Polygon dApp development?\n\nCreating dApps on Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWhile The Merge moved Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, bringing down its 112 TWh of energy consumption down to 0.01 TWh, the technology is where Polygon already is.\n\nThe Merge however, didn\u2019t change the high variable transaction cost that Ethereum comes with \u2013 a factor that Polygon addresses on a massive extent. In addition to this, the transaction processing speed has also remained unchanged, which in case of Polygon dApps development is only 65,000 transactions per second at the back of the Layer 2 scalability solution.\n\nLet us look into the differences to understand why it makes sense to build dApps on Polygon.\n\nFactors Ethereum Polygon Foundation 2013 2017 Scalability 10 TPS 7000 Market Cap 139.56 Billion 7.698 Billion Average transaction fees 0.4876 US$0.01 Programming language Solidity Solidity, Golang, Vyper Transaction Deterministic Finality Instant 5 minutes Total dApps 2970 53,000\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s popularity is on a fast rise, there are some issues that are still prevalent in the technology. For understanding Polygon to its entirety, it is critical to know the limitations it comes attached with. Let us give a brief look at them:\n\nEthereum Dependency: Ethereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations.\n\nEthereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations. Under Development: Presently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions. Other scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, Sidechains, Validum Chains, and Enterprise Chains, etc. are still in their developmental stages with an unsurety around when they would be live.\n\nPresently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions. Other scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, Sidechains, Validum Chains, and Enterprise Chains, etc. are still in their developmental stages with an unsurety around when they would be live. Matic Plasma Chains: Polygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma.\n\nPolygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma. Competition: There are a number of scaling solutions such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc. which are gaining steady momentum. They are making use of Ethereum and other blockchains to offer better user experience. Amidst this, we might see other solutions coming up and taking Polygon\u2019s market share.\n\nWith everything we have covered up until this point, one thing is clear \u2013 even though the technology has some limitations which need to be addressed, the benefits of Polygon for dApp development are unignorable. However, for an entrepreneur what is necessary is to know the use cases on which they can create dApp on Polygon.\n\nThe use cases to build dApp on Polygon\n\nThe biggest reason why dApp development service providers like Appinventiv choose Polygon is the fact that the end product is the same as what results from Ethereum app development but the customer experience is much greater. So while the businesses get the same Ethereum-powered app, their users get an innovative user experience, higher lowered transaction speed, and minimal transaction fees.\n\nPayments: Polygon platform is engineered to create dApps that speed up the payment process, powering almost real-time payment settlement via specialized API and SDK integration. This enables apps, users, and merchants to instantly perform transactions through multiple cryptocurrencies, usually through the ETH or ERC-20 tokens. This system is being rolled out in three distinct phases: 1. ERC-20 token payments 2. Token transfer in cross-chain 3. Fiat-based payment models.\n\nLending Platform: The next use case to consider when you build dApp on Polygon is creating a module that would enable lenders to analyze users credit ratings and building a smart contract that would automate the loan disbursement journey.\n\nGames: The Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution of Polygon makes blockchain-based gaming platform development efficient and fast. With Ethereum and Polygon working together, the platform will be able to address the lag issues that non-Polygon blockchain games face.\n\nOther Use Cases: There are a range of other use cases to consider when you build a decentralized app on Polygon such as enabling fast settlement times required for decentralized exchanges to provide faster and cheaper trading.\n\n[Also Read: How to monetize with your dApp?]\n\nAmidst these use cases, the Polygon ecosystem is fast expanding. Here\u2019s a look into some of the top applications that are a part of the network\n\nAdditionally, most of the dApps require a method to sign transactions without submitting in the users\u2019 private keys details. On the back of its scalability enhancements, the technology helps in enabling an open identity framework for the dApp, thus solving the privacy issue.\n\nThese use cases are only a surface-level explanation of why businesses should develop dApp on Polygon. There are a range of other applications that can be built on Polygon.\n\nUltimately, even though Polygon dApps are built upon Ethereum, there are some very critical differences between them, specifically in transaction speed and cost. Such costly gas fees and slow transactions can lead to poor user experience that would leave a negative impact on the platform\u2019s adoption. On this note, it makes better business sense to select Polygon, thanks to its ability to back faster transactions and lowered gas fees.\n\nAt Appinventiv, it is our constant endeavor to think about our clients\u2019 customers first and this is the reason why we make dApp on Polygon. Using the technology we have built a range of decentralized apps right from a crypto wallet app to a DeFi exchange all promising a positive customer experience.\n\nLooking to explore the technology for your next dApp project?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is finally regaining some of its lost position. The second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market has already tested the $3,600 threshold. While the 26 EMA break did not happen, the fact that Ethereum tested that threshold may become a foundation for a bullish reversal in the foreseeable future.\n\nEthereum needs to rise above critical support levels in the near future. In particular, the $3,400 and $3,352 support levels are crucial. Ethereum could indicate strength and the possibility of further upward momentum if it can stay above these supports.\n\nTraders are keeping a careful eye on these levels for any indications of persistently bullish activity. The most likely reason behind the reversal is the exhaustion of bulls.\n\nInvestors should monitor the $3,600 resistance level, as a break above it may trigger a fresh upswing in price. Overall Ethereum's long-term potential \u2014 fueled by growing adoption thanks to the ETF and technological advancements \u2014 remains intact even though short-term fluctuations are to be expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's surprising strength\n\nXRP faces a 26 EMA resistance level after the bounce from $0.46, which is a strong signal for the asset. Despite losing the $0.5 support level, the short-term outlook is surprisingly positive for XRP. Key resistance levels to watch include $0.52 and $0.54, where a break above these could indicate further upward movement.\n\nA sustained price above $0.46 is critical for XRP in the near term. With its solid support, this level might serve as the basis for a resurgence. As long as XRP can overcome the immediate resistance at $0.52, traders are hopeful about a possible rebound.\n\nStill, there is cause for concern regarding the asset's long-term performance. The future of XRP is clouded by enduring regulatory challenges, most notably the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. Since bad news can cause prices to drop sharply, market sentiment is also an important consideration.\n\nThe outcome of these legal challenges and public perception of the cryptocurrency market will have a significant impact on XRP's long-term prospects. Even though the short-term outlook is promising and could result in gains if resistance levels are overcome, investors should exercise caution. XRP has a number of long-term issues that could affect how well it performs in the upcoming months.\n\nShiba Inu is plummeting\n\nShiba Inu's drop below $0.00002 was dramatic and clearly should be treated as a signal of a potentially upcoming price drop. However, there is an important factor to consider: the short-term price drop is not set in stone, so bulls may still have enough reserves to buy back.\n\nSpecifically, $0.000019, $0.000022 and $0.000023 are three important price levels to keep an eye on. Each of these levels represents potential resistance or support areas that could determine Shiba Inu's next move.\n\nAt these prices a significant buyback might stop the current downward trend but if it does not hold, losses could continue. Short-term maintenance above $0.000019 is critical. A breakdown below this level could result in additional selling pressure because it has served as a significant level of support. On the other hand, a recovery of $0.000022 and $0.000023 would suggest a return of bullish momentum and might draw additional buyers into the market.\n\nThe popularity of Shiba Inu is fueled by its active social media presence and thriving community frequently causing their prices to fluctuate sharply. Sentiment can shift quickly, which can have a major impact on price, so traders need to be prepared for that.\n\nFurthermore, Shiba Inu's performance may be impacted by changes in the larger cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu's long-term prospects hinge on its capacity to sustain interest and usage among the cryptocurrency community. Long-term growth may be possible for the project if it keeps coming up with new ideas and draws in users."

This announcement has been well received by many in the cryptocurrency community. However, Max Keiser, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and advisor to the president of El Salvador, has advised Milei to be cautious about including other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser has described ETH as a scam, warning that its inclusion could slow Argentina's progress in the digital currency sector. He suggests that while Milei's endorsement of BTC is a positive step, the president should reconsider his stance on supporting multiple cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Keiser, many Bitcoin enthusiasts initially supported various digital currencies before eventually focusing solely on BTC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser, Bitcoin, Argentina\n\nThis is not the first time Keiser has criticized Milei's crypto policy. He previously raised concerns about Milei's decision to mandate the registration of all Bitcoin and crypto platforms in Argentina, arguing that this approach could have negative repercussions due to what he perceives as a lack of deep understanding of Bitcoin's unique characteristics.\n\nDespite these criticisms, President Milei remains committed to his vision of a free market where individuals and businesses can choose their preferred currency. He believes that allowing the use of different units, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will spur innovation and economic growth.\n\nEarlier this year, Argentina took an important step by removing taxes on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, signaling a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets."

        "content": "Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty and pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan still believe the SEC\u2019s decision to end an investigation into Ethereum 2.0 does not absolve ETH of regulatory uncertainty.\n\nBoth legal experts expressed this view shortly after Ethereum developer Consensys Inc. revealed that the SEC does not recommend an enforcement action based on its investigations into certain sales of ETH.\n\nRipple CLO Highlights Regulatory Uncertainty Surrounding Ethereum\n\nReacting, the Ripple CLO congratulated Consensys on the win but raised concerns about the uncertainty regarding ETH\u2019s regulatory status.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe quizzed whether the conclusion of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation indicates the SEC does not think Consensys offered ETH as a security. Additionally, he suggested that the SEC might still view ETH as a security.\n\nFurthermore, Alderoty questioned SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s potential response regarding ETH\u2019s regulatory status. Lastly, the Ripple CLO noted that the regulatory status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services could be in question due to the SEC\u2019s refusal to address the matter in its recent response.\n\nHe expressed frustration with the lack of clear regulatory guidance for the U.S. crypto industry, which could hinder innovation in the country.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked? What is the status of MetaMask and staking? This is\u2026 \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 19, 2024\n\nPro-Ripple Lawyer Reacts\n\nPro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan echoed a similar sentiment, suggesting that the SEC\u2019s decision not to pursue enforcement action following its Ethereum 2.0 investigation fails to clarify the regulatory status of the second-biggest crypto by market cap.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe contrasted the regulatory ambiguity surrounding ETH with the legal clarity XRP received from a federal judge last year, raising a rhetorical question about which situation is preferable.\n\nCome on people. Would you prefer a letter like this sent to one company, or a finding from a judge that a token itself is not a security. Gensler will continue not to answer when asked whether Ethereum is a security. He can\u2019t do that with XRP. pic.twitter.com/kPbeirslFE \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 19, 2024\n\nFurthermore, the lawyer speculated that Gensler would continue to refrain from answering whether ETH is a security but cannot do so with XRP. This is because U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres held that XRP in itself is not a security.\n\nFight Continues\n\nThough the SEC has ended investigations into Ethereum 2.0, Consensys is still embroiled in a lawsuit against the securities regulator. The Ethereum developer filed the suit in April, requesting a Texas court to declare the staking and swap services offered on Metamask as non-securities.\n\nSince the SEC did not comment on the status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services, Consensys stated that its legal fight with the regulator would continue."

Standard Chartered\u2019s new crypto desk will begin trading soon, two people told the outlet, and will be part of the Forex trading unit.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, in line with our strategy to support clients across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,\u201d Standard Chartered told Decrypt, echoing the statement it made to Bloomberg.\n\nBut Standard Chartered declined to respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bank part-owns institutional crypto custodian Zodia Custody and has backed institutional digital asset trading firm Zodia Markets. Now setting up its own spot crypto trading desk shows clear intention to move deeper into the world of digital assets, after dipping its toes through investment.\n\nOther banks have traded crypto before, but due to regulation they have had to trade in derivatives rather than the actual asset itself. For example, Goldman Sachs began trading Bitcoin futures in 2020, then opened its Bitcoin derivative trading desk in 2021.\n\nThe Basel Committee, an organization that sets global standards for banks, recommended in a 2022 report that banks should apply a 1,250% risk weighting when trading crypto assets. This term refers to the amount of capital a bank should have in reserve to counter the risk of the investment. Industry experts have noted that this incredibly high weighting makes it hard for banks to turn a profit on crypto trading.\n\nStandard Chartered has been bullish on crypto recently. In May, it predicted Bitcoin and Ethereum to hit all-time highs after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the U.S.. Soon, the bank predicted that Solana and XRP ETFs would be next to be approved in the States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlbeit this is likely a 2025 story not a 2024 one,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, said.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Amid this popularity, EigenLayer went live on the crypto exchange Coinbase recently.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum Restaking\n\nIn a report published on Wednesday, Andrew O\u2019Neill, S&P Global\u2019s digital assets analytical lead, highlighted the importance of restaking in order to enhance economic growth within the crypto market.\n\nO\u2019Neill also stated that restaking allows Ethereum node operators to validate new services by using established tokens thereby eliminating the need for these services to create their own validator with their own, illiquid, and volatile tokens.\n\nAs of now, there are only a few active restaking services popular as \u201cactively validated services\u201d. The report by S&P Global also notes that the total value of ETH restaked in the EigenLayer has surpassed 5.3 million Ether, valued at a staggering $19 million. Earlier this week, EigenLayer opened the Phase 2 claims for the EIGEN airdrop.\n\nRisks Associated with Restaking\n\nThe risks associated with restaking are primarily operational and specific to each actively validated service (AVS), though financial risks could emerge due to market speculation.\n\n\u201cWe do not currently foresee significant ecosystem-level financial risk as staking and restaking are generally non-custodial and there is no rehypothecation of the collateral,\u201d O\u2019Neill writes. \u201cThe impact of restaking on system-level leverage must be monitored, particularly through borrowing and leverage metrics on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols\u201d.\n\nEver since the EigenLayer launch in April, the protocol has gained strong traction within no time. This could inspire more players in the market to bring restaking services.\n\nHowever, the bigger question is whether the US SEc would allow more restaking protocols in the market. Another doubt is whether the SEC will allow restaking protocols to mature into \u201cinternet bond\u201d market without proper regulations.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Upcoming ETH ETF Trading Teases $5,000-Bound Rally - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The Ether and crypto communities are eagerly looking forward to the start of spot ETF trading in the US. This follows insight from a renowned ETF analyst who projects the D-Day on July 2. In the meantime, ETH price holds firmly to support at $3,500. A breakout from this level could breach the $4,000 resistance which will ignite FOMO as investors back the uptrend toward $5,000.\n\nBitcoin too is starting to shape the next crypto landscape this week after reclaiming ground above $65,500. With the two largest cryptocurrencies modestly in the green, investors are beginning to appreciate the sell-off as a blessing in disguise. This means they can apply key dollar cost-averaging practices, buy the dips, and eventually increase potential gains in the second half of the year.\n\nFactors Likely To Drive The Next Altcoin Season\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index has fallen to 64\u2014still showing greed among investors but significantly below last week\u2019s figure of 74. This indicator by Alternative, monitors market sentiment with zero on the scale referring to extreme fear and 100 to extreme greed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince markets function as living entities, sentiment is driven by people. As euphoria increases, investors become greedy due to the FOMO. This propels prices higher but also introduces the risk of a drastic decline as some investors decide to take profits. It is rarely a good idea to buy when the crypto fear and greed index is near the extreme top.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, a drop in the metrics suggests greed is creeping in. Because sentiment is falling, many people choose to sell\u2014some due to the fear of losing their capital or possibly to protect unrealized gains.\n\nIt is advisable to buy when the market is red and sell when it is green. With that in mind, investors might consider this to be a good time to buy into their favorite altcoins, ignoring the drop in the fear and greed index to 64.\n\nEthereum price has increased 1.3% in 24 hours to $3,585 on Thursday. The value growth, although minor, has reflected a 0.81% surge in the market cap to $438 billion. However, the second-largest digital asset faces a 30% slide in the trading volume to $14 billion\u2014a factor likely to hamper potential growth in the upcoming sessions.\n\nNevertheless, investors seem to have set their sight on the approvable of the spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs in May pending further approval for the operators of the products which will eventually give way to actual trading on stock exchanges.\n\nThe SEC also dropped investigations into Ethereum, further clearing doubts that Ether could be considered a security.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted earlier this week that Ethereum ETFs could start trading on July 2. This followed word that the SEC \u201csent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they\u2019re pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: we are moving up our over/under date for the launch of spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, hearing the Staff sent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they're pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week. Decent chance they work to declare them effective the next\u2026 https://t.co/XJZ8JLwEFF \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 14, 2024\n\nThe start of the actual trading of Ethereum ETFs could spark fresh interest in ETH and altcoins. Traditional investors would find it easier to buy ETH via exchanges, validating the crypto market.\n\nAnalysts at CoinGape expect this to be a moment of reckoning for altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin which are believed to be the next in line for spot ETFs.\n\nThe move could be bullish for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin, and possibly usher in the much-anticipated altcoin season.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Stares At A 30% Breakout\n\nEthereum price is making key strides in its recovery following the correction to $3,400. The token currently sits above two exponential moving averages (EMAs), the 20-day and the 50-day.\n\nA daily close above $3,600 resistance would mean that bulls are getting back in the game for a breakout past $4,000. The presence of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on the daily chart could reinforce the bullish grip when validated.\n\nThis is a bullish pattern validated when the price breaches the neckline resistance around $3,800 in Ethereum price prediction case. Traders would enter above this resistance eyeing a 30% move close to $5,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO - TradingView",
        "content": "In a recent commentary shared on X, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which ranks as the world\u2019s largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds, detailed why investors should consider diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Ethereum (ETH), alongside maintaining a position in Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan offered three compelling reasons for investors to embrace ETH, while also presenting a critical viewpoint for remaining invested solely in BTC.\n\nEthereum Vs. Bitcoin: 3 Reasons Pro-Ethereum\n\nHougan began by emphasizing the importance of diversification within crypto investments. Drawing an analogy to the early days of the internet, he pointed out how difficult it is to predict which technologies or companies will dominate over the long term. \u201cIt is very hard to predict the future with precision,\u201d Hougan remarked, referring to investors who bet on early internet companies like AOL and Pets.com, which failed to maintain their initial promise despite the internet\u2019s overall growth.\n\nApplying this lesson to crypto, Hougan advised a diversified approach to hedge against similar uncertainties. Ethereum\u2019s current market capitalization stands at approximately $420 billion, which is substantial but still only about one-third that of Bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap. Given these figures, Hougan proposed a default starting allocation of 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum for investors seeking broad market exposure.\n\nHougan\u2019s second point delved into the functional differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He described Bitcoin as primarily \u201ca new form of money,\u201d highlighting its design choices aimed at enhancing its utility as a robust monetary system. \u201cEvery design choice the Bitcoin ecosystem makes is designed to make Bitcoin the best form of money that has ever existed,\u201d he stated, underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s targeted development toward optimizing its use as a currency.\n\nConversely, Ethereum is characterized by its role as a foundational technology for building new applications that leverage its capability for programmable money. This includes everything from issuing stablecoins to enabling complex decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s primary function is making money programmable,\u201d Hougan explained. He argued that the ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem provides a broader exposure to the potential applications of blockchain technology, which is still in its nascent stages.\n\nThe third argument for Ethereum centered on historical performance data. Hougan pointed out that historically, portfolios that included Ethereum along with Bitcoin showed better performance metrics, both in absolute terms and when adjusted for risk, across full crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing about that table is that the +ETH portfolio has both higher returns and a lower maximum drawdown,\u201d he highlighted. This historical analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer better downside protection and higher potential returns, though Hougan cautioned that \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future returns\u201d and noted that in shorter, recent periods, a Bitcoin-only strategy would have outperformed.\n\nCounterpoint: Why a Bitcoin-Only Strategy May Be Preferable\n\nAddressing the other side of the coin, Hougan discussed why many investors might prefer a Bitcoin-only strategy. This perspective is especially relevant for those concerned with macroeconomic issues like the degradation of fiat currencies and inflation.\n\nHougan posited that Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position and its community\u2019s focus on becoming a new form of money make it likely to continue leading this space. \u201cIt has a large lead, and size matters in money,\u201d he stated, supporting the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s simplicity and focused use-case as digital gold could be more appealing for certain strategic investments.\n\n\u201cMoney is a massive market. There\u2019s plenty of space for BTC to run if it succeeds. [\u2026] My view, in a word: If you want to make a broad bet on crypto and public blockchains, you should own multiple crypto assets. If you want to make a specific bet on a new form of digital money, buy Bitcoin,\u201d Hougan concluded.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,514.06."

        "title": "XRP holders wonder how SEC will treat Ripple as Ethereum gets free pass - FXStreet",
        "content": "The court decision is a partial summary judgment. The ruling can be appealed once a final judgment is issued or if the judge allows it before then. The case is in a pretrial phase, in which both Ripple and the SEC still have the chance to settle.\n\nThe SEC has stepped up its enforcement actions toward the blockchain and digital assets industry, filing charges against platforms such as Coinbase or Binance for allegedly violating the US Securities law. The SEC claims that the majority of crypto assets are securities and thus subject to strict regulation. While defendants can use parts of Ripple\u2019s ruling in their favor, the SEC can also find reasons in it to keep its current strategy of regulation by enforcement.\n\nThe ruling offers a partial win for both Ripple and the SEC, depending on what one looks at. Ripple gets a big win over the fact that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, and this could bode well for the broader crypto sector as most of the assets eyed by the SEC\u2019s crackdown are handled by decentralized entities that sold their tokens mostly to retail investors via exchange platforms, experts say. Still, the ruling doesn\u2019t help much to answer the key question of what makes a digital asset a security, so it isn\u2019t clear yet if this lawsuit will set precedent for other open cases that affect dozens of digital assets. Topics such as which is the right degree of decentralization to avoid the \u201csecurity\u201d label or where to draw the line between institutional and programmatic sales are likely to persist.\n\nThe United States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Ripple and its executives of raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered asset offering of the XRP token. While the judge ruled that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, sales of XRP tokens to institutional investors are indeed investment contracts. In this last case, Ripple did breach the US securities law and will need to keep litigating over the around $729 million it received under written contracts.\n\nIt depends on the transaction, according to a court ruling released on July 14: For institutional investors or over-the-counter sales, XRP is a security. For retail investors who bought the token via programmatic sales on exchanges, on-demand liquidity services and other platforms, XRP is not a security.\n\nOn the contrary, if Ripple closes under $0.4665, the April 19 low, it could invalidate the bullish thesis. XRP could find the next support at the June 7 low of $0.4508.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossed over the signal line, with green histogram bars flashing above the neutral line, supporting a bullish thesis for XRP. If this upside scenario unfolds, Ripple could rally towards resistance at $0.5326, coinciding with the June 5 high.\n\nXRP gained nearly 1% on Thursday, as seen on the daily chart . The altcoin is trading at $0.4963 on Binance at the time of writing, gaining nearly 1% in the past seven days but losing nearly 8% in the past 30 days.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked? What is the status of MetaMask and staking? This is\u2026\n\nRipple (XRP) holders debate the future of the altcoin on Thursday, which could be closely related to the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) next step following its decision to end the investigation into Ethereum (ETH).\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Breaking: US SEC Ends Investigation into Ethereum 2.0, Says No Further Legal Action Will Be Taken - Crypto News Australia",
        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, dropping allegations that Ether sales are securities.\n\nConsensys argued that recent ETF approvals implied ETH is a commodity, leading to the investigation\u2019s closure.\n\nThe decision may spark discussions on listing other altcoin ETFs, but Consensys emphasises ongoing challenges in the crypto industry.\n\nIn a major breakthrough for the crypto industry, Consensys, a private blockchain software technology company founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, just announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into Ethereum.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nConsensys announced, \u201cthe Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0\u201d.\n\nRelated: Bloomberg Reports Elon Musk Plans To Turn X Into Next Venmo, Will Crypto Play a Role?\n\nThis includes dropping allegations that sales of Ether are securities \u2013 a long-debated question among the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLubin\u2019s company said this comes after they asked the SEC on 7 June to confirm ETH\u2019s status as a commodity following the recent exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision in the US.\n\nIn late May the regulator gave the green light for the listing of Ether ETFs on several US exchanges. The 19b-4 approval signifies that trading on these exchanges now only requires S-1 approval.\n\nA step many saw as a de facto greenlighting of Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nDecision to Spark More Altcoin ETF Talks\n\nThe SEC dropping the investigation could lead to more talk about altcoin ETFs being listed. Recently, both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Tether co-founder William Quigley voiced their expectations of several other altcoins fund listings in the near future.\n\nQuigley believes ADA (Cardano) and SOL (Solana) could be next for an ETF, while Garlinghouse also believes an XRP ETF is in the cards.\n\nHowever, Consensys also said in their statement on X that, while great news, the decision to drop the Ethereum investigation is not a miracle cure for all the issues in the crypto industry.\n\nThe closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime. Consensys Consensys\n\nThe statement added that Consensys would continue the fight, especially regarding the status of crypto wallet MetaMask and swaps and staking within the wallet.\n\nOur fight continues. In our lawsuit, we also seek a declaration that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws. It should not take a lawsuit to provide the much-needed regulatory clarity to allow an industry that serves\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nBackground of SEC Investigation\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, led by Gurbir Grewal, initiated an investigation in March 2023 into Ethereum transactions dating back to 2018.\n\nThe probe came to light when the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub mentioned scrutiny from a \u201cstate authority,\u201d later identified as the SEC.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Ronin with Record $148 Million All-Time Sales in Last 30 Days\n\nIn April, Consensys sued the SEC, seeking confirmation that ETH is not a security. The SEC decided to close the investigation after Consensys argued that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs indicated that ETH is a commodity, not a security."

        "title": "Ethereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently at a critical juncture as its price enters a consolidation phase. This period of price stability, marked by a narrow trading range, has left traders and investors in a state of uncertainty.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price hovering around key support and resistance levels, market participants are closely monitoring technical indicators and market signals to anticipate the next move. The current consolidation reflects a balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution, creating an environment of indecision that could lead to significant volatility once a breakout direction is established.\n\nThis analysis delves into examining Ethereum\u2019s current price state to determine its potential future price action.\n\nMarket Overview: Ethereum Current Trends And Analysis\n\nCurrently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of Ethereum is moving upward toward the upper level of the consolidation zone, but it is still trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nA careful examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that ETH\u2019s price may still move upward as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are trending above the zero line. From this formation, it can be suggested that Ethereum may likely move to test the upper base of the consolidation before dropping again.\n\nOn the 1-day chart, ETH is actively bullish moving toward the upper base of the consolidation zone while still trading above the 100-day SMA. With the way ETH\u2019s price is moving, it may move on to test the upper base of the consolidation.\n\nThe 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator indicator reveals that although ETH is currently bullish, it may go bearish in the long run as both the signal line and the SMA are attempting to cross below the zero line.\n\nPotential Scenarios: What\u2019s Next For ETH?\n\nA look at potential future scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s movement post-consolidation suggests that if the price of ETH breaks above the upper base of the consolidation, it will begin to move upward toward the $4,099 resistance level. If the price breaches this level, it may move on to test its all-time high of $4,863.\n\nIn contrast, should the crypto asset break below the lower base of the consolidation, it will begin to move downward toward the $2,865 support level. If this level is breached, it will continue to move downward to test the $2,147 and probably other lower levels.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $3,607 and was down by 1.82% with a market capitalization of over $440 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $13 billion. Although its market capitalization is down by 1.77%, its trading volume has increased by 28.93% in the past day.\n\nFeatured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Chairman, Jay Clayton revealed in a Monday interview with CNBC that there is now an increased chance of seeing a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) go live for U.S investors soon.\n\nClayton made the revelation while answering questions regarding how far crypto market participants seeking the listing of a Bitcoin ETF have satisfied concerns expressed by the SEC regarding such a product.\n\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s work left to be done,\u201d said Clayton who had in the past mentioned perceived market price manipulation on unregulated exchanges and unreliable custody as the primary reasons why the SEC hasn\u2019t blessed any of the Bitcoin ETF proposals it has received so far.\n\nOnce again, the SEC Chairman highlighted those concerns as tough questions, before saying,\n\n\u201cNow, progress is being made, but people needed to answer those hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate type of product.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the latest comments made by the SEC Chairman raises hopes that there is yet a possibility of seeing the first Bitcoin ETF launch later this year or at least sooner than many had envisaged.\n\nAs Coinfomania reported last month, the SEC must now rule on whether or not to approve proposed rule changes to list Bitcoin ETFs submitted by Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX. These filings were published in the federal register in February kickstarting a 240-day waiting period for a final decision by the SEC.\n\nHowever, the regulator has delayed deciding on three occasions and must now rule on October 13, 2019, whether or not to approve the Bitwise ETF application, and make a similar decision regarding the VanEck/SolidX on October 18, 2019.\n\nIt is also vital to note that there is a possibility that the SEC decides against approving the current proposals [with only roughly a month remaining] since Clayton also mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s work left to be done.\u201d"
