        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Could Skyrocket to $22,000 by 2030 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum continues to be a tech disruptor. But will it really be worth over $2 trillion by 2030?\n\nThrough the first six months of the year, Ethereum (ETH -5.65%) is up 50%. That's right in line with the performance of Bitcoin (BTC -3.04%), which is also up 50%. At its current price of $3,500, Ethereum is within striking distance of its all-time high of $4,891.\n\nBut the best may be yet to come. Investment firm VanEck recently predicted that Ethereum could hit a price of $22,000 by 2030. That might sound overly aggressive, but VanEck has some solid data to back up its prediction. So will it be right or not?\n\nEthereum's disruptive ability\n\nFor the better part of the past decade, we've seen Ethereum disrupt the tech sector. Ethereum was the first smart contract blockchain platform. It pioneered entire sectors of the crypto world -- such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that had never existed before. VanEck is counting on Ethereum's ability to remain a tech disruptor over the next five years to warrant such a hefty valuation.\n\nMost importantly, VanEck sees Ethereum making further inroads into the finance, banking, and payments sectors. And VanEck also sees Ethereum building value in sectors ranging from blockchain gaming to artificial intelligence (AI). The key to disruption will be Ethereum's ability to provide solutions that are cheaper, faster, and better than those currently available from market leaders.\n\nThe $15 trillion opportunity\n\nThat's where things get interesting, because VanEck digs into the numbers to estimate the total potential market opportunity (which it refers to as total addressable market, or TAM). That number could be as high as $15 trillion. The lion's share of this value ($10.9 trillion) will come from finance, banking, and payments. And there is a growing market opportunity ($1.4 trillion) that could result from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe logic here is simple but powerful: Ethereum will continue to roll out disruptive solutions that make it possible to win market share from entrenched incumbents. And the big push will be in DeFi, where a rich, vibrant ecosystem already exists. Just think of how upstart decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are winning market share from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.39%).\n\nWhen you consider key future trends such as asset tokenization (which involves moving real-world financial assets onto the blockchain), it's possible to understand just how big the DeFi opportunity might be. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has suggested that smart contract networks such as Ethereum could be generating fees of $450 billion by 2030.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nAnd, finally, there's the matter of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. These recently won approval from regulators and are expected to start trading soon. Once they do, they could lead to a huge influx of new money into Ethereum. VanEck now predicts that the impact of these new ETFs could be greater than that of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThat's highly debatable, though. As one of the firms that will be launching a spot Ethereum ETF, VanEck may be overestimating the potential impact of these ETFs. In comparison, JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.81%) predicts these new ETFs might only attract $3 billion in new investor money. That's about one-tenth of what the new spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted.\n\nA $2 trillion asset?\n\nVanEck provides three different scenarios for the future value of Ethereum. In the base case scenario, VanEck predicts a price of $22,000. In the bull case scenario, VanEck predicts a price of $154,000. And, in a bear case scenario, VanEck predicts that the price of Ethereum could collapse to just $360. Yikes!\n\nThat's a wide range of outcomes to work with, and that's what makes investing in Ethereum potentially so risky. Yes, Ethereum could soar to a price of $22,000, giving it a massive $2 trillion market cap. But it could also lose nearly 90% of its value and be banished to the dustbin of history.\n\nKeep in mind that Ethereum is not the only blockchain going after that $15 trillion market opportunity. There are plenty of other blockchain competitors, each one promising solutions that are cheaper, faster, and better. So if you're thinking about investing in Ethereum, make sure you do your due diligence and have a good grasp of the assumptions being used to predict a price of $22,000."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nZhu Su , a founder of the infamous Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, recently highlighted the performance of the Grayscale Solana Trust, suggesting it could imply the future value of Solana to $1,000 per SOL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis projection is based on a comparison with the historical performance of Ethereum and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), used as a benchmark.\n\nWhy is no one talking about how Grayscale Solana trust is implying $1k per sol already\n\n\n\nThe numbers are very similar to when eth was $200 but ethe implied $1k, in 2020 Advertisement June 28, 2024\n\nGrayscale's trusts work by allowing investors to gain exposure to digital currencies through a traditional investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing and safekeeping digital assets directly.\n\nEach share of the trust represents a fraction of the cryptocurrency held by the trust, and the value of the shares can trade at a premium or discount to the underlying asset's market value.\n\n\"Every four years...\"\n\nThus, four years ago, when Ethereum was trading at around $200, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust implied a value of $1,000 per ETH. This significant premium indicated strong investor confidence and future price expectations.\n\nEthereum's price eventually caught up with these projections, experiencing substantial growth in subsequent years. This pattern suggests a potential roadmap for Solana.\n\nThe comparison of Solana to Ethereum's early days, when it was also emerging as a significant platform, is noteworthy. If SOL follows a similar trajectory, the implied value suggested by the Grayscale Solana Trust could be realized.\n\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, the historical context offers a compelling narrative of Solana's growth prospects, making the $1,000 target a topic of interest in the community."

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > US court sets \u2018crypto = security\u2019 precedent, spelling trouble for Ethereum\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) is celebrating a fraud conviction that definitively labeled \u2018crypto\u2019 tokens as securities for the first time, leaving Ethereum bigwigs wondering when that axe might fall on them.\n\nOn June 25, the DoJ announced that U.S. District Judge Patricia Seiz had sentenced both Shane Hampton and Michael Kane to nearly three years in prison for \u201cmanipulating the price of a security and scheming to defraud investors in connection with the purchase of Hydrogen Technology\u2019s cryptocurrency, HYDRO.\u201d\n\nThe pair were among five individuals charged in April 2023 with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and securities price manipulation. Kane was the Florida-based Hydrogen Tech\u2019s co-founder/CEO, while Hampton was its chief of financial engineering. Kane pleaded guilty last November, while a federal jury convicted Hampton on February 7. Two other co-conspirators, Andrew Chorlian and Tyler Ostern, pleaded guilty in May 2023.\n\nThe scam involved using trading bots to manipulate HYDRO\u2019s fiat value on an unspecified U.S.-based digital asset exchange. Between October 2018 and April 2019, the scammers ensured their bots made around $7 million in \u2018wash trades\u2019 and placed over $300 million in \u2018spoof trades\u2019 to convince retail investors that HYDRO was a winner. The scam netted its principals over $2 million in profits.\n\nNicole Argentieri, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and head of the DoJ\u2019s Criminal Division noted that \u201cin this case, for the first time, a jury in a federal criminal trial found that a cryptocurrency was a security and that manipulating cryptocurrency prices was securities fraud.\u201d\n\nArgentieri warned other would-be manipulators that the DoJ \u201cwill not hesitate to use all tools at its disposal\u2014including the federal securities laws\u2014to protect the integrity of cryptocurrency markets.\u201d\n\nIn October 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed civil charges against Kane and Hydrogen Tech for violating U.S. securities laws\u2019 anti-fraud provisions through the same manipulative efforts. The SEC won a $2.8 million judgment the following April, forcing a settlement with Ostern, the CEO of South African market-maker Moonwalkers, for participating in the scheme.\n\nThe SEC noted at the time that the HYDRO tokens issued by Kane et al. \u201cwere offered and sold as investment contracts, and therefore were securities whose offer or sale required registration with the SEC unless an exemption from registration was available.\u201d No registration was sought, nor was any exemption granted.\n\nConsensys v SEC\n\nIn a June 25 Bloomberg interview with Annmarie Hordern, SEC chairman Gary Gensler appeared unmoved by cries of inconsistency in his approach to regulating digital assets, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inconsistent about crypto securities and the securities laws.\u201d\n\nNot everyone shares this view. Under Gensler, the SEC has brought numerous civil suits against \u2018crypto\u2019 operators, be they token issuers, digital asset exchanges, or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This hasn\u2019t endeared him to the sector\u2019s leading lights, who tend to view any encroachment on their (allegedly) God-given right to do as they please as tantamount to heresy.\n\nThe sector also doesn\u2019t buy Gensler\u2019s consistency claims, so they were popping champagne corks earlier this month when the Consensys blockchain software firm announced that the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement \u201cnotified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 and will not pursue an enforcement action against Consensys.\u201d\n\nIn late April, Consensys announced that it had filed a pre-emptive suit against the SEC over the regulator\u2019s (alleged) plan \u201cto regulate ETH as a security.\u201d The complaint filed by Consensys sought to compel the SEC to declare that ETH isn\u2019t a security and thus the company\u2019s ETH sales weren\u2019t violating any securities laws.\n\nThe SEC didn\u2019t publicly respond to the Consensys complaint, but a June 18 letter written by SEC Enforcement Assistant Director Kristin Pauley to Consensys\u2019s attorneys did indeed state that her office wouldn\u2019t be recommending an enforcement action against Consensys at this time.\n\nHowever, Pauley added that the SEC didn\u2019t agree with Consensys\u2019s \u201clegal conclusions\u201d (that ETH was a commodity) and that the letter \u201cmust in no way be construed\u201d as a suggestion that Consensys \u201chas been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nETFs don\u2019t make ETH a commodity\n\nThe day after Pauley\u2019s letter, Joe Lubin, Consensys founder and co-founder of Ethereum, told Fox Business journo Eleanor Terrett that his company would continue its litigation against the SEC \u201cbecause we are intent on achieving more legality for all.\u201d\n\nLubin appears convinced that the SEC is still mulling legal action against Consensys based on the belief that its MetaMask Swaps software is an unregistered broker-dealer and its MetaMask Staking product involves the offer and sale of unregistered securities.\n\nRegardless, Ethereum backers were cheering on May 23 when the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets approved rule changes to permit eight ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). Reuters reported this week that formal approval of the eight applicants could come as early as July 4.\n\nEthereum fans took the ETF policy shift as further evidence that the SEC now viewed ETH as a commodity rather than a security. However, approving an ETF doesn\u2019t require a declaration that ETH is a commodity, and the SEC has made no such declaration, regardless of how furious Lubin might try to spin that into reality.\n\nThe SEC was simply following the same path as its January approval of BTC spot-based ETFs\u2014namely, that since both tokens were already traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market, there was sufficient data to ensure oversight of possible fraud or market manipulation.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: ETF or no ETF, \u2018Ethereum 2.0\u2019 is even more of a security than the original product. (And don\u2019t just take it from us: here\u2019s an epic video thread of Ethereum ticking the boxes on the Howey Test.)\n\nAll the tokens, all the time\n\nEthereum 2.0 refers to the network\u2019s September 2022 transition from a consensus mechanism based on proof-of-work to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS). The latter requires individual validators to stake 32 ETH (currently ~US$108,000) to participate in the PoS system and earn additional ETH via block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nThis system was custom-designed for ETH whales, a clear case of the \u2018rich getting richer.\u2019 Given Ethereum\u2019s origin story, it\u2019s not hard to see how the members of the Ethereum Foundation decided this was the way to go.\n\nThe initial ETH pre-sale in 2014 saw as much as 40% of the available tokens go to a handful of insiders, as there was little to no policing of the purported 12.5% cap on tokens sold to any one buyer.\n\nA couple of years ago, former Ethereum developer Lane Rettig estimated that as much as 60% of all ETH was still the product of this pre-mine. Rettig also fingered Lubin as \u201cprobably the largest holder\u201d of ETH at the time of the pre-sale. Rettig eventually quit the project when he began to suspect that his primary role was \u201cpumping Joe Lubin\u2019s bags,\u201d something he concluded was \u201cjust not what I want to do.\u201d\n\nFor years, Lubin and other Foundation whales have relied on a 2018 speech by Gensler\u2019s SEC predecessor, William Hinman, that claimed Ethereum started out centralized and thus qualified as a security but had magically decentralized over time and thus no longer qualified as a security.\n\nHinman was a deeply conflicted individual, having had meetings with Lubin and other Consensys executives prior to that 2018 speech. During his stint running the SEC, Hinman also received millions from a law firm that was a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, prompting concerns from the SEC ombudsman regarding Hinman\u2019s \u201cfull financial conflict\u201d with the firm, which Hinman promptly rejoined after leaving the SEC.\n\nIn other words, Hinman\u2019s speech\u2014which was never formally enshrined as SEC policy\u2014wasn\u2019t worth the paper it was printed on.\n\nConsent of the governed\n\nThe ETH token is by no means the only aspect of Ethereum that\u2019s overly centralized. A recent report by Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy (formerly Galaxy Digital) blockchain/AI-focused investment group sought to determine whether Ethereum\u2019s end users have any say in the evolution of the network or if everything is simply dictated by a shadowy group of insiders.\n\nProtocol changes occur off-chain, \u201cspearheaded by the Ethereum Foundation, and conducted through online forums such as Discord, GitHub, Ethereum Magicians, and Zoom.\u201d Rank-and-file holders of the network\u2019s ETH token don\u2019t get to vote on proposed changes, nor do decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nGalaxy\u2019s VP of Research Christine Kim notes that this off-chain scenario prevents (most) ETH whales from exerting undue influence via the size of their bags, nor can bad actors hijack governance-related smart contracts to skew the results. However, off-chain voting is \u201cdifficult to audit and objectively evaluate because processes are intentionally opaque, subjective, and unstructured.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CoinTelegraph, Kim appeared to suggest that Ethereum was in a bind, as \u201cthe risks of Ethereum being governed by off-chain forums and processes are not unlike the risks that exist even with on-chain forms of governance.\u201d\n\nThis dilemma is compounded by the fact that many of the same whales are among the most important voices in making off-chain decisions. As Kim puts it, \u201cI think some improvements can be made to Ethereum\u2019s off-chain governance model, particularly concerning the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s role in the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation, a \u2018non-profit\u2019 established in Switzerland a year prior to the network\u2019s 2015 launch, cannot unilaterally dictate what changes are made to Ethereum\u2019s protocol. But its founders include Vitalik Buterin, Lubin, and others who are deeply involved in many of the other entities that decide the network\u2019s future direction.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s size and scope remain a mystery, as it hasn\u2019t issued any reports regarding its operations or finances since April 2022. Its only three publicly identified members are Buterin, Aya Miyagushi, and Patrick Storchenegger.\n\nMaking the centralized sausage\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) can be proposed by anyone but the Galaxy report identifies four specific groups of stakeholders involved in the EIP vetting process: the Foundation; validator node operators, who process transactions under Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism; decentralized application (dapp) developers, who provide feedback on their users\u2019 needs; and execution/consensus client software teams.\n\nKim calls the client teams \u201carguably the most important decision-making in the EIP process.\u201d That importance potentially poses a major problem, as the dominant execution layer GETH is funded exclusively by the Foundation.\n\nSeveral other clients have been the recipients of Foundation grants. Still other clients were developed by Lubin\u2019s Consensys. Buterin funded another client, which also received a Foundation grant.\n\nIn other words, while there may be ten client teams, even those that aren\u2019t currently controlled by the Foundation and/or Ethereum\u2019s co-founders owe much of their origin story to those same parties. All of these suggest the \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of Ethereum\u2019s inner circle appears capable of exerting greater influence over the EIP process than is immediately apparent.\n\nKim says that \u201cin theory,\u201d validators \u201chave the final say over what code changes are implemented\u201d because they have the \u201cagency to implement or reject code changes that have been made to Ethereum software by client teams.\u201d\n\nGiven the 32 ETH hurdle for participating in the PoS system and the tiny handful of whales who hoovered up all that ETH via the initial distribution, validators are yet another possible example of the few governing the many.\n\nKim summarizes that \u201cwhile the interests of each focus group, that is client teams, validator node operators, and dapp developers, are distinct, the individuals that comprise these groups often overlap, making the stakeholders involved in the Ethereum governance process difficult to neatly categorize or define.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve tried the rest\n\nEthereum\u2019s overly centralized model is the dictionary definition of an unregistered security while also subjecting the network to the whims of those who just can\u2019t seem to stop tinkering under its hood. Ethereum has undergone so many backward-incompatible \u2018upgrades\u2019 that they actually had a dedicated hard fork coordinator (until he was drummed out by the mob for making a joke about the upcoming transition to PoS).\n\nEthereum\u2019s primary challenge is scaling to handle a sufficient number of transactions to live up to its self-imposed \u2018world computer\u2019 designation. But rather than build a strong and secure main network, those governing its operations incessantly tinker with various bolt-on appendages in a failed bid to reduce its transaction bottleneck and lower its occasionally astronomic fees.\n\nContrast Ethereum\u2019s Rube Goldberg-worthy dead-end detours with the BSV blockchain, which can not only handle a volume of transactions that Visa (NASDAQ: V) would envy, but can do so securely on its original layer, with a fee structure measured in fractions of a cent. And unlike Ethereum, BSV has a locked protocol that ensures all smart contracts will remain valid regardless of when they were established.\n\nBSV was named the digital asset least likely to be labeled a security for these and other reasons. So go ahead and clean house, Gary G. It\u2019s time to take out the trash.\n\nWatch: Teranode is the future of the Bitcoin network"

        "content": "Ethereum price has held relatively well in the past few days as the odds of spot ETF approvals rose. ETH token was trading at $3,455 on Friday, a few points above this week\u2019s low of $3,233. It remains in a correction zone after falling by 13% from its highest point this month.\n\nThe main catalyst for Ethereum is the anticipated spot Ethereum ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As we reported on Thursday, there is a rising possibility that spot Ethereum ETFs will start trading soon.\n\nThe rising anticipation happened after VanEck filed form 8-A, which is an important document in the ETF application process. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg believes that these funds will start trading on July 2nd.\n\nVanEck just filed 8-A form for spot Eth, which is just part of process, but.. should be noted that they filed their 8-A for spot bitcoin exactly 7 days before launch. Good sign for our July 2nd over/under (7 days from now). But again, anything poss. Sure we'll hear more soon.. https://t.co/2BlkDnWhrz \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 25, 2024\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would be a big deal. As we saw with Bitcoin, there is a strong demand for cryptocurrencies from institutional investors.\n\nSimilarly, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has a management fee of 2.50%, has over $10 billion in assets. As such, lower-priced funds will likely see heavy demand from retail and institutional investors.\n\nEthereum ETFs will also start trading at a time when balances in exchanges continue dropping, as shown below.\n\nEthereum reserves in exchanges\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem is still doing well even as the crypto sell-off continued. The network has over $108.95 billion in total value locked (TVL) and almost $80 billion in stablecoins. It has collected fees worth $1.65 billion, higher than Tron\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s combined.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Ethereum price\n\nSome of the top crypto analysts believe that Ethereum is on the cusp of a bullish breakout. In an X thread, Rekt Finance noted that Ethereum\u2019s open interest in the futures market was rising, which is a sign of institutional demand ahead of the ETF approval.\n\nHe also noted that Ether was a deflationary asset that has constantly been reducing its supply over time. Altogether, he expects that ETH will jump after the ETF approval, then move to a consolidation or pullback as many Grayscale Ethereum Fund holders move to cheaper options, and then it will resume its bullish trend.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \"ETH IS GOING TO ZERO\" \u2013 that's what everyone's saying.\n\n\n\nBut I'll prove them wrong.\n\n\n\nI dug into the data and what I found was shocking.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5: When & why $ETH is heading to $10K (+ trigger altseason) \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/nnlUDJlbNz \u2014 Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) June 25, 2024\n\nIn another Tweet, Crypto Rover, who has over 700k followers, noted that Ethereum had formed a descending channel that resembles a falling wedge pattern. In most cases, this is one of the bullish patterns that supports upside potential. He expects that the breakout could happen soon."

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Ethereum While It's Under $4,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the second half of 2024. Here's why.\n\nThrough the first six months of the year, Ethereum (ETH -5.70%) has largely kept pace with Bitcoin (BTC -3.10%). Both are now up about 45% year to date, and the big question on the minds of many investors is which is going to outperform during the rest of 2024.\n\nIn early May, the easy no-brainer answer would have been Bitcoin. But Bitcoin has stumbled of late, and that has opened the door for Ethereum. There are now four compelling reasons Ethereum could soar higher, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nBitcoin, of course, has had spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since January. And the introduction of this new investment product has arguably been one of the most important crypto narratives of 2024. But there's a new twist to that narrative. At the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved new spot ETFs for Ethereum.\n\nIt is still uncertain how much of a boost these new ETFs are going to provide. The current thinking is that they will start trading sometime this summer and that they could lead to $3 billion flooding into the new ETFs. That's a bull case scenario, though. According to JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.81%), the bear case scenario is closer to $1 billion. That's barely a blip on the radar compared to the $30 billion that has flowed into the new Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, they are still likely to move the needle for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum as the market leader\n\nEthereum continues to be the clear market leader in every important blockchain sector. Take decentralized finance (DeFi), for example, where Ethereum still accounts for more than 60% of all total value locked (TVL) in the blockchain world. No other blockchain even comes close. So we can start to downplay any notion that a challenger such as Solana (SOL -5.36%), Cardano (ADA -6.00%), or Avalanche (AVAX -7.38%) has any clear-cut path to toppling Ethereum anytime soon.\n\nThe market seems to agree. Ethereum is significantly outperforming all of its peers. For example, Solana is up 35%, and Sui (SUI -2.02%) is up 9%. Other top competitors are reeling. Aptos (APT -2.47%) is down 28%, Cardano is down 32%, and Avalanche is down 33%.\n\nRegulatory clarity\n\nThere's another big reason to cheer on Ethereum, and that is regulatory clarity. Just about anyone who has ever heard of Ethereum considers it to be a cryptocurrency. However, through the first six months of the year, there were rumbles and murmurs about a pending SEC investigation into Ethereum, due to uncertainty over whether it might actually be a security.\n\nBut those rumors now appear to be quashed, with the SEC saying that it is closing down any investigation into Ethereum. That's important because it could turn on the money spigots for risk-averse institutional investors. Crypto is risky enough without the added risk of an SEC probe.\n\nLong-term disruptive potential\n\nAnd, finally, there's the long-term disruptive potential of Ethereum. For the past decade, Ethereum has been a true innovator, pioneering niches of the blockchain world that had never existed before. And, judging by all the tech upgrades that have been made to the Ethereum blockchain over the past two years, this trajectory should continue.\n\nIn fact, investment firm VanEck expects Ethereum to grow dramatically in several key areas, led by DeFi. It's here that the Ethereum blockchain can offer the greatest disruptive potential. It's simply faster, cheaper, and more transparent to manage financial assets on a blockchain. And that could lead to Ethereum gaining market share at the expense of traditional financial rivals.\n\nIn fact, VanEck has run the numbers and determined that Ethereum could soar to a value of $22,000 per token by 2030. That would give Ethereum an implied market cap north of $2 trillion. Given that the top companies in Silicon Valley are now worth anywhere from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, a market cap of $2 trillion for Ethereum is not as unreasonable as it might sound at first.\n\nWhat to look for over the next six months\n\nFrom my perspective, the biggest threat to Ethereum remains the rise of blockchain challengers such as Solana. The economic moat that once surrounded Ethereum seems to be getting smaller and smaller with each passing year.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments you can make in the second half of 2024. If the new ETFs perform as expected, then it could be off to the races for the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency."

According to the anonymous sources cited by the outlet, the talks between prospective ETF issuers and the regulator have advanced to the \"final stages.\" Now, only \"minor\" issues have to be resolved.\n\nEven though the expected launch of Ethereum ETFs could be a major bullish catalyst for the leading altcoin, it remains to be seen whether inflows will be impressive enough for the market.

        "content": "The Cardano Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the popular proof-of-stake blockchain, has boosted the level of interoperability by integrating the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe integration now makes it easier for developers to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based applications on Cardano sidechain.\n\nThe standardized protocol, which was originally introduced back in 2019 by Cosmos Network, makes it possible to bridge several heterogeneous blockchains by sending information via special channels. Data can be easily transferred by blockchain with different consensus mechanisms. No direct communication between them is required in order to ensure the validity of certain information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Cardano, for instance, enterprises that rely on the ICB protocol can still take advantage of the network's deterministic fees and other advantages while working with other chains. \"With the implementation of IBC on Cardano, businesses benefit from a framework for developing and deploying scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solutions,\" the foundation said.\n\nA governance controversy\n\nIn other news, the foundation recently stirred some controversy with its voting decision earlier this week.\n\nDuring a bootstrapping phase, which will take place between the two stages of the hard fork's implementation, the foundation will become a member of an Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC).\n\nIt has already taken part in the ICC election, placing The Cardano Atlantic Council at the top of its ratings. When voting for candidates, it takes into account such factors as the level of engagement, technical expertise, transparency, and so on.\n\nHowever, the foundation faced some pushback from some members of the community who believe that it had to rule itself out from the entire ICC voting process. \"I think it is wrong that Cardano Foundation should put their thumb on the scales,\" one user commented."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nDespite the depressing performance Ethereum has been showing us lately, the potential behind it is greater than it may seem. The Glassnode analyst believes we have not yet seen everything Ethereum has to offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comparable trend that emerged in the early months of 2021 can be seen if we examine Ethereum's past. The current market structure is consistent with this historical pattern, indicating that Ethereum may have a price target of about $7,500. Based on the current structures and 161.8 Fibonacci extension level, the projection has been made by the analyst.\n\nETH to ~7500 USD as a Final Top?\n\n\n\nIf we look to ETH history, we observe how we in early 2021 had similar pattern for ETH developing. See YELLOW MARKINGS!\n\n\n\nWe believe Market moves in structures. And this structure gives us a target at ~7500 as a Final High for #ETH.\n\nThat is the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FID62C9uyt \u2014 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0 (@Negentropic_) June 27, 2024\n\nA similar Fibonacci extension level signaled a notable rally and large price gains in 2021. According to the analyst, the market moves in predictable patterns, and the current pattern indicates that ETH's high will occur at $7,500. Additionally, the chart shows a bull flag pattern, which traditionally denotes the continuation of a bullish trend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum might be ready for a big increase in the near future if this pattern continues. Additionally, there is a surge in interest and investment on the larger cryptocurrency market. This situation, along with Ethereum's impending updates and growing institutional traction, may create the ideal conditions for a robust rally.\n\nIn order to reach this goal, Ethereum must overcome multiple obstacles. The $4,000 threshold, which corresponds to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the previous cycle, is the first significant obstacle. Achieving this level would confirm the bullish structure and open the door to higher objectives.\n\nAs for potential catalysts and the overall sentiment on the market, we are currently seeing a recovery after the most recent plunge, witnessed a few days ago, when Bitcoin plummeted below the $60,000 level. The best fuel for Ethereum and the market in general would be the approval of the Ethereum ETF and some technological advancements, similar to those we have seen from Solana."

        "title": "How To Create NFTs On Ethereum - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "Every non-fungible token (NFT) is unique and serves as a digital record of ownership. It identifies that you are the creator or owner of a certain digital asset. That could be a song, drawing, or any other media and content.\n\nNFTs can be profitable for individuals and businesses. You can create a digital item and sell it to earn money. Companies can sell event tickets or create NFT collections as extra income streams.\n\nEthereum is among the most popular destinations for creating NFTs. The network offers a reliable place to host your NFT and a simple creation process. If you are ready to create your first non-fungible tokens, find the steps to follow below!\n\nWhy You Should Consider Creating an NFT\n\nAccording to our experts, these are the main reasons why to consider creating an NFT:\n\nEnhance digital ownership and provenance . An NFT proves that you are the item\u2019s owner or creator. Even when you sell the token, there\u2019ll be proof of its origin.\n\n. An NFT proves that you are the item\u2019s owner or creator. Even when you sell the token, there\u2019ll be proof of its origin. Explore diverse applications . NFT can represent music or other digital content. It can also serve as proof that you own a physical item. That includes anything from event tickets to selling artwork and even using NFTs in real estate.\n\n. NFT can represent music or other digital content. It can also serve as proof that you own a physical item. That includes anything from event tickets to selling artwork and even using NFTs in real estate. Improve brand awareness and reputation. Many reputable brands, such as Adidas and other shoe creators, launched their NFT collections. Sports teams also designed non-fungible tokens to boost their bond with the fans. NFTs can be an excellent way to develop a brand and improve its awareness and popularity.\n\nStep-by-Step Process of NFT Creation\n\nThe first, and arguably the hardest, step is considering what you want to create. You might be a music creator who just completed an amazing song. Or you made an animated video or used AI to design a unique picture.\n\nThe important thing is that the NFT is unique \u2014 that\u2019s where its value lies. And it\u2019s worth noting that you need to be certain you are the rightful owner. Otherwise, you could end up having legal issues regarding the asset ownership.\n\nOnce you are ready to create an NFT on Ethereum, here is how to complete the process.\n\n1. Set Up an Ethereum Wallet\n\nEthereum is the favorite destination for NFT creation. Azuki, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Pudgy Penguins are some examples of popular tokens. According to statistics, Ethereum NFTs often reach a six-figure value during sales.\n\nYour first step is to get an NFT wallet. While there\u2019s a huge range of wallets supporting Ethereum, here are your best options:\n\nMetaMask . It offers NFT smart contract support and is compatible with Ethereum and other blockchains. MetaMask is an excellent option for effortlessly storing and managing your NFTs and crypto coins. You can use it via a web browser and on your mobile devices.\n\n.

You can use it on the go with a free mobile app. Alpha Wallet. The developers created the wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFT collection is impressive, and the product offers complete control with the non-custodial feature.\n\nHead to the chosen platform to download and set up a crypto wallet.\n\n2. Purchase Ethereum (ETH)\n\nYou will need some Ethereum in your wallet because the network requires gas fees for transactions. The actual charges depend on the moment your listing is published. It should be easy to acquire some ETH coins since most exchanges support this altcoin. It\u2019s possible to purchase it with fiat currencies or trade cryptos already stored in your wallet for ETH. You can use this ETH calculator to learn more about the asset value and potential.\n\n3. Choose an NFT Marketplace\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nWe suggest picking a popular marketplace with generous existing NFT collections. The reason is that these platforms attract more users, indicating a better chance to sell your token. Some popular options include the following:\n\nOpenSea . The platform has an excellent reputation among traders. You can find art, gaming, photography, music, and other NFTs. They are well-sorted into different categories, and there are helpful sections like current top buys and trending lists.\n\n. The platform has an excellent reputation among traders.

If you are a crypto trader, you might have had previous experience with OKX, which means you\u2019ll be familiar with the interface when creating NFTs. Rarible. Rarible is a user-friendly marketplace where you can create and sell non-fungible tokens. It has a list of the latest drops in a visible position, so you\u2019ll get some attention from potential buyers right away.\n\n4. Create Your Digital Asset\n\nThe actual steps might vary slightly depending on the chosen marketplace. You begin by connecting the wallet to the platform. After opening the registration page, the platform will ask for your wallet details. It will be necessary to verify your wallet before continuing.\n\nMake a final decision regarding your digital content. Get everything ready, whether it\u2019s a single item or an NFT collection.\n\n5. Mint Your NFT\n\nThe next step of the process is to create a smart contract, which actually means generating your NFT collection. Begin by adding the media to the website. Now, pick the token symbol and use the wallet to sign the contract.\n\nWe suggest double-checking everything and adding as many details as possible. For example, some marketplaces allow inserting an external link with more info about the NFT. In the description field, write some catchy lines to capture the potential buyer\u2019s attention.\n\n6. List Your NFT for Sale\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe non-fungible token should now be in your wallet. Click a \u201csell\u201d button next to it, and you\u2019ll have the option to pick the token\u2019s price. The sale can be time-limited, so set the desired duration.\n\nIf everything is ready, you can proceed to publish the listing. Your wallet will be used to sign several transactions. Some chains and marketplaces charge listing fees, but these are usually affordable. You can check Bitcoin NFTs if you\u2019d like to explore non-fungible tokens on this blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe most important part of NFT creation is devising a unique and attractive idea of the digital content that the token will represent. If you have a unique item, creating an NFT shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes. Once you have a wallet ready, pick an Ethereum NFT marketplace and sign up to make your first collection.\n\nAfter listing the NFT for sale, consider advertising it on social networks or promoting it in another way you see fit. That will increase the chance of the token getting sold, as well as the fee you receive."

        "title": "Exploring Blast (BLAST): A Yield-Bearing Ethereum Layer 2 Solution - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Exploring Blast (BLAST): A Yield-Bearing Ethereum Layer 2 Solution Darius Baruo Discover Blast (BLAST), an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol offering yield on ETH and stablecoins. Learn about its features, tokenomics, and how to buy BLAST.\n\nBlast, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is making waves in the crypto community with its unique integration of native yield for ETH and stablecoins. According to blog.bitfinex.com, this protocol distributes yield from decentralized sources like ETH staking and on-chain T-Bill protocols directly to users, offering a 4% yield on ETH and a 5% yield on stablecoins.\n\nKey Features of Blast\n\nBlast operates as an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup, making it easier for users and developers to benefit from higher baseline yields without altering the familiar Ethereum experience. A standout feature is its auto-rebasing mechanism, which adjusts balances in user accounts to reflect accrued yield. This mechanism is applied natively for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and can be optionally enabled for smart contracts, allowing seamless integration with existing Decentralised Applications (DApps).\n\nThe yield generation is facilitated by Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 staking rewards, particularly through protocols like Lido, which automatically transfer yield to Blast users via the rebasing mechanism. Additionally, users who bridge stablecoins to Blast receive USDB, a stablecoin whose yield is derived from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. This ensures users benefit continuously from competitive yield rates, whether they hold ETH or stablecoins.\n\nGas Revenue Sharing Model\n\nAnother notable feature of Blast is its unique gas revenue sharing model. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions that retain gas fee revenue, Blast redistributes this revenue back to DApps programmatically. This allows DApp developers to either keep the revenue or use it to subsidize gas fees for their users, promoting a more cost-effective and attractive environment for DApp usage.\n\nWhat is the BLAST Token?\n\nThe BLAST token serves multiple pivotal roles within the Blast ecosystem. It is essential for governance, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes regarding protocol upgrades and yield strategies. This decentralized governance model ensures the community has a significant say in shaping the platform\u2019s future.\n\nBLAST tokens are also crucial for staking within the ecosystem. Users can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards in return. This staking mechanism incentivizes users to contribute to the network\u2019s security and helps maintain the ecosystem's overall health and stability.\n\nAdditionally, BLAST tokens facilitate various transactional activities within the ecosystem, such as paying for transaction fees on the Blast Layer 2 network. This ensures operations are cost-effective and efficient, given the high gas fees often associated with transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. The transaction fees collected in BLAST tokens are redistributed within the ecosystem, supporting further development and incentivization.\n\nBLAST Tokenomics\n\nThe Blast airdrop initiative rewards early adopters and participants within the ecosystem. Users can earn Blast Points and Blast Gold through activities like maintaining balances in ETH, WETH, and USDB, or participating in DApps on the platform. Points are distributed automatically based on the balance held in users\u2019 wallets or smart contracts, and users can earn multipliers by engaging with highlighted DApps.\n\nDespite the active engagement through the airdrop, detailed information about the tokenomics of BLAST is still pending. Users are encouraged to join the Blast community to stay informed about the latest developments, including updates on the airdrop and detailed tokenomics.\n\nHow to Buy BLAST\n\nTo buy BLAST with cryptocurrency, log in to your Bitfinex account, go to the Deposit page, choose the crypto you plan to buy BLAST with, generate a deposit address on the Exchange wallet, and send the crypto to the generated address. Once the funds arrive, you can trade them for BLAST.\n\nTo buy BLAST with fiat, log in to your Bitfinex account, get full verification, go to the Deposit page under the Bank Wire menu, choose the fiat currency for your deposit, check your email for wire details, send the funds, and once they arrive, you can use them to buy BLAST.\n\nBlast also offers mobile options for on-the-go purchases.\n\nBLAST Community Channels\n\nFor more information and updates, visit the Blast website, follow them on X (Twitter), or join their Discord community."

        "title": "Dogecoin, Solana, And Cardano ETFs Could Follow Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 How The Crypto Market Will React - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Could Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs follow on the heels of Spot Ethereum ETFs? Industry experts believe so. Meanwhile, ETFSwap provides the most secure platform for trading Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNotable figures in the crypto space predict that the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs will launch an avalanche of proposals for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) is garnering increasing attention from traders for its unique offering of diverse ETFs on a user-friendly platform equipped with industry-leading AI trading tools.\n\nWhy Traders Say They Have \u201cThe Best Trading Experience\u201d Trading Spot Ethereum ETFs On ETFSwap (ETFS)\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) is a platform for trading and investing in tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on the blockchain. It enables investors to diversify their portfolios with secure, legitimate tokenized assets backed by real-world securities purchased from traditional financial markets. This is possible because ETFSwap (ETFS) works with MiCa-compliant regulated investment banks to deal in securities and crypto trading.\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) offers traders the potential to earn heightened profits with up to 10x leverage on all trades, 50-60x leverage on perpetual futures and options trading, as well as optimal liquidity. The platform also provides the tools and support to manage leveraged trades effectively so traders can take advantage of opportunities while mitigating risks.\n\nUsing advanced AI-powered tools like the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, ETFSwap (ETFS) investors are empowered to make better-informed trading decisions. With artificial intelligence, these tools analyze large amounts of market data to identify trends and provide insights into the best assets to invest in for maximum profits.\n\nETFSwap\u2019s (ETFS) responsive, easy-to-use interface has drawn praise from traders using the platform. They say they always easily access the features and screens they need, whether they are executing trades, checking their portfolios, staking ETFS, or trading perps.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Approval Could Pave The Way For Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, And Cardano ETFs\n\nFollowing its declaration of Ethereum (ETH) as a commodity, the SEC announced it should fully support the Spot Ethereum ETFs by the Summer of 2024. Industry experts say this could open the doors for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs to enter the crypto market.\n\nCanadian firm 3Qi has filed a proposal with securities regulatory authorities in Canada to approve what could be North America\u2019s first Solana ETFs. If granted, US Solana firms could start filing proposals for Solana ETF approval with the SEC, and Dogecoin ETFs and Cardano ETFs may follow.\n\nCardano ETFs may also enter the crypto market before long. Cardano (ADA) is the 10th largest cryptocurrency on the planet by market capitalization and boasts a more secure and scalable blockchain than most others. With its oft-intense competition with bigger blockchains, Cardano ETFs could receive approval soon after Solana ETFs.\n\nDespite Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) status as a meme coin without much utility, gaining approval for Dogecoin ETFs is not impossible. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently ranked 9th among the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, one place above Cardano (ADA). So, it is well-positioned to lead meme coins to an age of institutional usage with a Dogecoin ETF. When the proposals start pouring in, Dogecoin ETFs could be among the first to receive approval.\n\nHow Dogecoin, Solana, And Cardano ETFs Will Impact The Crypto Market\n\nFollowing the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a price rally of up to 75% as Whales poured 2,212 BTC into US Bitcoin ETFs. A similar trend is expected for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs once they gain approval.\n\nAlthough bearish market conditions have since sunk Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, tokenized assets are receiving favorable attention. According to Rajagopal Menon Vice President, WazirX, about $2 billion was invested into Bitcoin ETFs over the last week. Ethereum (ETH) also saw a 22% price surge following the SEC\u2019s approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nConclusion\n\nDogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs will inevitably follow the SEC\u2019s approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Till then, investors can trade Spot Ethereum ETFs on ETFSwap (ETFS) and earn heightened profits by investing in ETFSwap\u2019s native cryptocurrency ETFS, which analysts believe will make over 200000x.\n\nThe token is currently on presale at $0.01831 and more than twenty-six million tokens have been sold. Investors can accumulate more tokens with the ongoing 20% promo to maximize their returns.\n\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\n\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\n\nJoin The ETFSwap Community"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC struggles around the $62,000 level - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price faces pullback resistance at the lower band of the descending wedge around $62,000.\n\nEthereum price finds support at $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) encounters resistance near the $62,000 mark, while Ripple (XRP) mirrors BTC's challenge around the $0.500 level. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) finds solid support around the critical price point of $3,288.\n\nBTC faces resistance at the lower band of the descending wedge\n\nBitcoin's price broke below the descending wedge on Monday, declining approximately 7.5% to retest its crucial weekly support near $58,375 and rebounded by 5.8% on Tuesday.\n\nSince Tuesday, BTC has faced resistance at the lower boundary of the broken descending wedge. At the time of writing, it trades around $61,704 on Friday.\n\nIf the lower boundary of the descending wedge around $62,000 holds as resistance, BTC could decline roughly 5% to reach its weekly support near $58,375.\n\nOn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are below their respective neutral levels of 50 and zero. This indicates that, according to these momentum indicators, the bearish sentiment prevails, suggesting the potential for further decline in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC closes above the $63,956 level and forms a higher high in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bullish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 5% rise in Bitcoin's price, revisiting its next weekly resistance at $67,147.\n\nEthereum price looks promising\n\nEthereum price retested its support level of $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from a swing low of $2,862 on May 14 to a swing high point of $3,977 on May 27. ETH rebounded by 5% from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and trades at around $3,457, edging up approximately 0.3% on Friday.\n\nIf this support at $3,288 holds, ETH price could rally 8% from its current trading level of $3,457 to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are both below their neutral level of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,288 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price shows resilience\n\nRipple's price currently trades at $0.476, below the daily resistance level of $0.499. Despite Monday's fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price, XRP has shown resilience in its price action.\n\nIf Ripple's price surpasses the barrier at $0.499, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nIn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 mark, indicating neutral to bearish sentiment, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains below zero, suggesting bearish momentum. Both indicators must rise above their critical thresholds of 50 for RSI and zero for AO for a sustained bullish trend. Such a development would bolster the ongoing recovery rally in the market.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if the Ripple price daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, it would invalidate the bullish outlook by establishing a lower daily low. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "title": "PEPE Whale Shifts Focus To Ethereum As ETF Optimism Builds - CoinGape",
        "content": "The latest on-chain insights reveal that a crypto market whale has strategically switched funds from PEPE to ETH amid optimism building up around the launch of an Ethereum ETF. Following the submission of eight S-1 amendment filings, this swap of funds has emerged, portraying optimism for ETH\u2019s future price movements. Meanwhile, it\u2019s worth noting that Pepe coin has also recently emerged as the talk of the crypto town, surging to unprecedented levels.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the whale\u2019s strategic investments and what it could mean for future market performances.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Diverts Funds To ETH\n\nAccording to data revealed by EmberCN on June 28, the whale 0x837 has been recorded switching 1.4 trillion PEPE to 2,646 ETH.\n\nThe trader transferred 1.4 trillion PEPE, worth $18.01 million, to Binance. Subsequently, a withdrawal of $9.04 million worth of ETH took place from the same exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these accumulations happened at an average price of $3,416. Also, market sentiments have tilted towards optimistic for Ethereum, primarily with the whale\u2019s massive accumulation.\n\nThe whale activity also comes in light of recent optimism on the ETH ETF. As mentioned above, eight firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, iShares, and Invesco, have submitted S-1 amendment filings.\n\nNate Geraci, ETFstore President, further took the stage to claim that the ETH ETF launch is imminent, expected to be in 2-3 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH & PEPE prices experienced considerable gains today.\n\nAlso Read: AVAX Price Rally To Surpass Solana Price Surge: Santiment\n\nETH & PEPE Price Performance\n\nWhile writing, PEPE\u2019s price showed a 1.39% upswing to trade at $0.00001244. On the other hand, the ETH price chart showed a 0.86% upswing in value to $3,453.94.\n\nConversely, Coinglass data illustrates a 1.75% drop in Ethereum\u2019s Futures OI to $15.19 billion. The derivatives volume tumbled 6.47% to $19.08 billion. This data flags reduced investor interest in the asset, birthing contrasting market sentiments on future movements.\n\nSimultaneously, PEPE\u2019s OI saw a 3.94% pump to $142.37 million, whereas volume dipped 6.94% to $977.38 million.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ended?

        "content": "With Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recently hinting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be fully approved by September, the FOMO psychology in the crypto market gets even stronger.

        "content": "The recent closure of the investigation initiated by the SEC had a major unexpected drawback on Ethereum (ETH) and several other altcoins including Solana (SOL), Cardano, and Polygon.\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 27 Jun 2024, 09:31 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nMany analysts and traders expecting a bullish outcome based on the data results were shocked as these altcoins trended downwards, with investors leaving to find more stable investments. Despite these negative trends, a top DeFi token, Rollblock (RBLK), has emerged to help investors regain their losses in the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of The SEC Investigation On Ethereum (ETH)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 20, 2024, after the SEC closed its investigations, Ethereum (ETH) saw a brief uptick in price to $3,608.25. However, to the dismay of investors, this wasn\u2019t a lasting growth as the price immediately fell to $3,502 and has since trended downwards, now sitting at $3,403.\n\nThis Ethereum price drop led to greater market instability, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) also trending downward. Investors looking for the best altcoins to invest in are now more cautious about their investment and seek promising investments that don\u2019t display heightened volatility.\n\nThis market reaction to the SEC update underscores the importance of having stable cryptocurrencies with high growth potential in every investor\u2019s portfolio. It also shows how major assets like Ethereum can upset the balance of the entire market. With innovative tokens connected to high-growth industries, investors can experience stable portfolio growth unaffected by changes in major coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRollblock ($RBLK) Stands Out As a Potential Henge Against Crypto Volatility\n\n\n\n\n\nRollblock (RBLK) is a new protocol that aims to disrupt both the GambleFi and casino industry. This project, built on Ethereum, has a live casino and allows $RBLK token holders to receive a percentage of revenues generated by its casino, which will result in a steady increase in investor profits as the platform grows. To guarantee a growing crypto platform, Rollblock has designed several initiatives capitalizing on the $540.3 billion gambling industry.\n\nThe traditional online gaming industry has struggled with transparency and trust when placing bets. With no desire to risk their funds on rigged games, many players now refuse to place bets, negatively impacting the industry's growth. Rollblock provides a solution to this by using blockchain technology to secure all transactions. All users are guaranteed a secure bet, and bets can\u2019t be changed once placed.\n\nWhile playing games, Rollblock will reward users with the $RBLK tokens which they can then use to play more games, win, and grow their funds. The platform has seen a huge influx of users, 100s daily, in just two months due to its easy-to-access system, requiring no KYC from gamers before accessing hundreds of games on the platform. Users only need to open an account with an email or crypto wallet, deposit from a selection of over 20 cryptocurrencies, and start playing different games with instant wins and payouts. This has accounted to Rollblock currently having 3000+ registered users already.\n\nAs the platform grows, Rollblocks price is expected to soar a massive 720%. This is huge for investors, who can not only profit from price increases, but also Rollblocks revenue share model.\n\nUp to 30% of the casino revenue will be used to buy back the RBLK tokens from the open market. 50% of purchased tokens will be allocated for rewards, and 50% will be burned to increase token value.\n\nIn addition to the Rollblock revenue share model, players on the platform can also stake their $RBLK to earn more rewards and bonuses. Any $RBLK earned can be converted into other cryptocurrencies or fiat at low transaction fees and fast processing times.\n\nInvestors struggling to find the best token to invest in and those looking to regain the money they\u2019ve lost from Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins have a huge opportunity with the Rollblock ($RBLK) presale. Currently in stage 3 of the presale with a price of $0.014, analysts have already predicted that Rollblock could see an 800% rise in the next few weeks before the presale is over. Investors who get in early enough could not only enjoy these profits, but could see an additional 100x rally once RBLK is listed on major exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\n\n\n\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The ENS price action showed that bears might force another rejection.\n\nAMBCrypto found one metric that could be key for traders to time a bullish breakout.\n\nEthereum Name Services [ENS] witnessed a strong rally that began on the 12th of June and continued to go strong. At press time, ENS had gained 9.82% and could go higher.\n\nThe good times might not last for the bulls, as ENS fast approached a resistance level that was unbeaten throughout 2024. Will this fourth attempt be lucky, or should bears prepare to enter short positions?\n\nPrice action shows bulls might struggle to make new highs\n\nThe $27.5-$28.5 zone has been a persistent resistance zone throughout this year. The first rally in January saw prices rebuffed to the 61.8% retracement level at $16.34.\n\nHowever, the subsequent breakout attempt in early March also met with failure.\n\nThe retracement thereafter took ENS to $10.67, and the bulls fought through April and May to defend the 78.6% retracement level at $13.29.\n\nThroughout this time, the OBV has trended higher. The steady buying pressure might pay off this time and force a breakout.\n\nNetwork Growth was another positive sign\n\nSince the 15th of June, Network Growth has trended upward to denote hundreds of unique addresses created on the network. The Daily Active Addresses has also trended upward.\n\nTogether, the rising adoption might fuel demand.\n\nThe mean dollar invested age continued to trend upward. This showed the network was becoming less active and older tokens were sticking to the same addresses.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ENS Profit Calculator\n\nA drop in the MDIA metric could rejuvenate the market and spark a breakout.\n\nAs things stand, bulls should be cautious of buying ENS at such a strong resistance zone. However, the $27.5 region is broken and the MDIA metric begins to trend downward, investors might want to bet bullishly.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase above the $3,420 resistance zone. ETH is now struggling to clear the $3,480 and $3,520 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum slowly moved higher above the $3,420 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $3,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair must clear the $3,480 and $3,520 resistance levels to continue higher.\n\nEthereum Price Recovers Slightly\n\nEthereum price started a decent recovery wave above the $3,350 level. ETH even cleared the $3,400 level and outperformed Bitcoin. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $3,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe pair even cleared the $3,450 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,482 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the $3,450 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,328 swing low to the $3,482 high.\n\nThe bulls are now trying to protect more downsides below the $3,420 level. Ethereum is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $3,480 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,520 level. A close above the $3,520 level might send Ether toward the $3,550 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,620. An upside break above the $3,620 resistance might send the price higher. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,740 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Drop In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,480 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,420. The first major support sits near the $3,400 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,328 swing low to the $3,482 high.\n\nA clear move below the $3,400 support might push the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,240 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,400\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,480"
