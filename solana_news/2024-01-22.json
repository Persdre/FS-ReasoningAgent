        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s decentralized mantra in tatters after execution of client bug - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Homepage > News > Tech > Ethereum\u2019s decentralized mantra in tatters after execution of client bug\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s claims of decentralization are ringing ever more hollow due to the network\u2019s lack of client software diversity, an overreliance that could pose an existential threat to ETH stakers.\n\nLast weekend, around 8% of Ethereum proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validators suddenly began producing invalid blocks due to a critical flaw in the Nethermind client software. The issue followed the release of Netherland\u2019s v1.23.0 update, requiring a frantic patch to get these network nodes back in business.\n\nWhile the order was eventually restored, a similar scenario befell the Besu client earlier this month. Besu\u2019s share of the Ethereum execution client market was around 5% at the time and has since fallen to 4%.\n\nEthereum watchers soon warned that the fallout could be catastrophic if/when a similar situation impacted the Geth (Go Ethereum) client. Geth accounted for around 84% of network execution clients at the time of the Nethermind bug, but a concerted effort to sound the \u2018eggs in one basket\u2019 alarm has since pushed this down to a mere 79%.\n\nGeth is client software developed by the Ethereum Foundation that supports network functions like transaction validation and smart contract execution. Geth is generally considered a more robust option than its rivals, which, along with the Foundation\u2019s stamp of approval, is why it accounts for such an outsized market share.\n\nRegardless, such a high concentration level would be problematic in any sector. But in an industry so prone to probing by malicious actors\u2014particularly those adept at software supply chain attacks\u2014it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n\nA Geth failure would bring Ethereum finalization to a screeching halt, but as Labrys developer Lachlan Feeney recently suggested, this vulnerability could also result in the loss of the majority of the roughly 29 million ETH currently staked by validators.\n\nBecause validators are penalized for being offline, an \u2018inactivity leak\u2019 could rob validators of two months\u2019 worth of staking rewards in just two days. Should the downtime extend for five days, a year\u2019s worth of rewards would be lost. A weeklong outage could cost validators 10% of their staked ETH, while 90% of that stake could be lost if the outage extends to six weeks. While such a prolonged outage may be unlikely, it\u2019s also not impossible.\n\nGeth-based validators would likely stampede for the exits rather than watch their stake bleed away to nothing. But they\u2019d get caught in a logjam of similarly minded validators, all of whom would continue bleeding ETH as they wait their turn to disembark this sinking ship. Given the sheer number of Geth-based validators, this bottleneck could mean that only one in 12 could exit with more than 50% of their stake.\n\nFork me\n\nThe potential repercussions of a serious Geth bug don\u2019t stop there. Should a Geth-based validator produce an invalid block, Geth\u2019s domination of the network could result in this invalid block being added to the chain, resulting in a fork that would quickly become the dominant chain. Geth validators would be blocked from the valid chain until the smaller chain is finalized.\n\nAs Feeney put it, \u201cBecause the Geth validators are stuck on the invalid chain, they are considered inactive on the non-Geth chain and will suffer the inactivity leak. No software update or bug patch to Geth will save these validators. They will be bled out until their stake represents <\u2153 of the network, allowing the non-Geth chain to finalize.\u201d\n\nFeeney estimates that this bleeding could result in an 18% reduction in the total supply of ETH. (That\u2019s definitely one method of creating artificial scarcity and thus losing the token\u2019s fiat value.)\n\nFeeney offered this warning: \u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD [the rough value of the 32 ETH required for serving as a validator] into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100% (even if that loss is unlikely)? Probably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today.\u201d\n\nLido shuffle\n\nRetail users lacking the 32 ETH necessary to stake on their own have several options for pooling their resources, but staking via a service won\u2019t necessarily protect them from the potential carnage described above.\n\nLido Finance, the largest staking service with around 9.4 million ETH staked, relies on Geth for most of its operations. On January 23, Lido stated that its preliminary Q4/23 data put Geth usage across Lido protocol validators at 67%, down from 76% in Q3/23 and 93% in Q3/22. Lido said \u201cclient diversity is fundamental\u201d to its \u201cmission to decentralize Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLido added that its Lido DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) node operators \u201care afforded high degrees of autonomy,\u201d but they \u201chave already begun to signal their commitments to reduce majority client usage, or explain how their setups avoid the possibility of being affected by supermajority bugs.\u201d\n\nCoinbase has a plan to make a plan\n\nThe Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) exchange has faced similar queries this week about its reliance on Geth. On January 22, CEO Brian Armstrong personally responded to a Coinbase customer who tweeted that they had \u201cunstaked all of the ETH I had staked with you since you offered it as a service.\u201d The user added that this \u201csingle client staking setup\u201d made it \u201cnot worth the risk\u201d of losing \u201ca large percentage of my deposit.\u201d Armstrong replied: \u201cTaking a look.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the Coinbase Cloud account tweeted that when it launched its ETH staking service, \u201cGeth was the only client that met our technical requirements.\u201d Coinbase claimed that \u201cexecution client diversity \u2026 is a critical concern,\u201d and thus, it was conducting \u201can updated technical assessment with the goal of adding another execution client to our infrastructure.\u201d Coinbase promised to provide an update on its progress \u201cby the end of February.\u201d\n\nNot everyone found this reassuring, with at least one customer suggesting that the situation wasn\u2019t \u201ca review and plan kind of phase. This is take serious and urgent action, with informed customers phase.\u201d Coinbase was urged to set up \u201can insurance fund or allow us to opt in to other clients\u201d because \u201cthe risk of supermajority failure is a *bigger* risk to your customers than minority client failure.\u201d\n\nThis probably wasn\u2019t the best week for Coinbase to run a sponsored post on Decrypt promoting the claim that its staking service \u201caims to be a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for crypto staking.\u201d One stop, one point of failure\u2026 Synergy!\n\nCoinbase rival exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex (among others) also rely solely on Geth to power their staking services. However, they have kept quiet regarding any plans they may have to inject a little diversity into their operations.\n\nAll in one\n\nDecentralization theater has been Ethereum\u2019s stock-in-trade from its inception, starting with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s oversight-bereft crowd sale that delivered the majority of ETH into the hands of a few whales. This concentration of wealth and power continues to this day via the PoS consensus mechanism that further enriches the whales who can afford to run multiple validators.\n\nThis centralization was recently cited by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of the reason it was delaying decisions on applications to offer Ethereum spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity are among those chomping at the bit to offer Ethereum ETFs to the public following the launch of multiple BTC spot-based ETFs earlier this month.\n\nIn approving those BTC ETFs, SEC chairman Gary Gensler stressed that the decision was limited to \u201cone non-security commodity\u201d (BTC) and \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d Gensler, who has previously stated his belief that ETH is an unregistered security, reiterated his \u2018don\u2019t expect ETH ETF approvals anytime soon\u2019 message earlier this week.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC posted a list of ETH-related questions for public comment before making any ETF decision. For instance, the SEC wonders if there are \u201cparticular features related to ETH and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ETH\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d\n\nInterested parties are instructed to submit their comments within three weeks. Just remember Ethereum Foundation members, you have to at least try to make it look like they\u2019re not all coming from the same address.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum,\n\nFTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market."

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has sold more than 1,000 Ether (ETH) in the past several weeks, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence, which has been tracking his ETH holdings for the past several months. It obtained the data through Trump's financial filings and disclosures.\n\nMost of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.\n\nThe NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn early 2024, Trump announced another trading card NFT project that has some unique rewards for owners. Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.\n\nHowever, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nTrump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.\n\nThe sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.\n\nEven though Trump said during his presidency that he was \"not a fan\" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a \"disaster waiting to happen,\" it is hard to pass on several million dollars. Though Trump is largely unaffiliated with the project, he is still earning royalties. While his stance on crypto is still up in the air, the recent sale is an interesting development in Trump's relationship with crypto.\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, it will be important to watch for news relating to presidential candidates' stances on crypto, as this could have large implications for prices, future adoption and use cases going forward.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Most Ethereum Staking Pools Are Using Just One Execution Client, Potentially Increasing Risks to the Network - Unchained",
        "content": "The Ethereum community\u2019s concerns about execution client diversity has intensified, as roughly 84% of all validators are running Go Ethereum.\n\nMost Ethereum staking pools use just one execution client: Go Ethereum (Geth). As a result, some Ethereum enthusiasts have publicly encouraged people to avoid using Geth for their validator duties because of the potential risks of over-relying on one client.\n\nMore than four-fifths of all validators, which are in charge of proposing and validating new blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, use execution client Geth, according to data provided by the crypto analytics website clientdiversity.org, which covers about 60% of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum clients are software implementations people can download to run the Ethereum network. In order to perform its duties, a single validator typically runs two clients simultaneously to address different components of Ethereum \u2014 the consensus side and the execution side.\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client for Ethereum running on about 8% of validators encountered a bug yesterday, Ethereum core developer \u0141ukasz Rozmej said on X. The bug, which has since been resolved, has sparked a conversation about a hypothetical bug impacting Geth.\n\nWhile the consensus side has seen its client diversity improve, execution client diversity on Ethereum is weak. Specifically, the following Ethereum staking pools and service platforms \u2014 per execution-diversity.info \u2014 likely use Geth as their only execution client for their validator duties: Allnodes, Ankr, Blox Staking, Binance, Bitcoin Suisse, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, and Stakefish.\n\nIn addition, Lido, the largest liquid staking platform with more than nine million ETH staked, has connected over three-quarters of its validators to Geth as well.\n\nA \u2018Supermajority Client\u2019\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, designed Ethereum to work on different software clients, not just one, so that a bug affecting a single client would not adversely impact the whole blockchain.\n\nHowever, Geth is considered a \u201csupermajority client.\u201d As such, validators that run Geth have the capability to finalize the Ethereum blockchain without agreement from validators running other software clients, such as Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon. This has the potential for disastrous results such as a network split, loss of funds, and reputational damage to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cShould Go-Ethereum, likely to be the majority execution client after the Merge, produce an invalid block, it could get finalized and thus cause the catastrophic failure described in scenario 3,\u201d wrote Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist in a 2022 blog post. Scenario three entails a hypothetical situation where a client with more than two-thirds of the stake has a bug in its software and includes an invalid block to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nValidators running a minority client would only lose a small amount of rewards for having a bug, while the cost of having a bug for validators running a supermajority client would be massive.\n\n\u201cCounterintuitively: staking with a minority client bears significantly less risk \u2013 those affected by the recent Nethermind bug hardly lost the rewards of one to two days. Being on the wrong side as part of a majority, however, can lead to significant loss of stake,\u201d wrote co-founder of Gnosis Chain Martin K\u00f6ppelmann on X on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Lefteris Karapetsas, the founder of portfolio tracker Rotkiapp, noted on X that \u201cIn case of a supermajority Ethereum client bug that leads to complete loss of the stake of those stakers at the moment this would burn > ~20% of the entire ETH supply.\u201d\n\nLido did not immediately reply to Unchained\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nOn Monday night, Coinbase announced on X its goal of including an additional execution client in its validator infrastructure, after the Ethereum community expressed concerns about Coinbase\u2019s single client staking steup revolving around Geth.\n\nThe largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. said it relied solely on Geth for validation because it was the only execution client that met the company\u2019s technical requirements. But Coinbase said it is open to change.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date,\u201d wrote Coinbase on X. \u201cMany other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is currently assessing alternative execution clients, and said it would share their next steps by the end of February.\n\nUPDATE (January 23, 2:00 pm. ET): Updated with details of Coinbase\u2019s announcement."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Slumped More Than 6% Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is seeing significant declines today as sentiment sours around the world's No. 2 cryptocurrency.\n\nMegacap cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH -0.51%) has continued to sell off in today's session, now having given up most of its gains since the sector-driven mania following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum declined 6.1% over the past 24 hours, dropping below the $2,350 level. This move appears to be tied to a number of market-driven forces, but also some token-specific headwinds that investors are pricing in today.\n\nHere's what's behind today's big downside move in Ethereum.\n\nSignificant Ethereum selling pressure impacting this token\n\nWhen certain investors sell a given cryptocurrency or stock, investors pay attention. Accordingly, news that the Ethereum Foundation (the nonprofit doing much of the behind-the-scenes work to keep Ethereum up and running) sold more than $1.6 million worth of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency has sent shockwaves reverberating through the market.\n\nRecent reports show that this large sale, in which 700 Ether were sold, continues a trend of capital-raising from the Ethereum Foundation. A previous sale of 100 Ether tokens on Jan. 16 from the same wallet suggests that the ongoing development work may be more costly than initially thought, providing some downside selling pressure on this token.\n\nEthereum does have another upgrade on the go, with its so-called Dencun upgrade already underway as of last week. Thus, it's possible that these token sales could dry up as development activity slows, but it's a key factor in the supply/demand equation investors are digesting right now.\n\nAdditionally, concerns around capital flight from the crypto sector, evidenced by more than $2 billion of Bitcoin ETF outflows, has some concerned about the secondary impacts on Ethereum. So far, the excitement around these exchange-traded products hasn't stoked the kind of investment many initially thought would come. For future Ethereum ETFs, that's not great, and this sector-wide selling pressure will likely continue to flow through to the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\n\nWhat to make of today's move\n\nOccasionally, it's important to reflect on the cost impacts various development initiatives have on various blockchain networks and their associated tokens. Given Ethereum's aggressive upgrade schedule and top-tier talent in terms of the developers working diligently on ensuring this protocol's stability, these token sales may not be surprising. But it does appear some in the market have been caught off guard by the corresponding selling pressure and sentiment shift caused by these sales.\n\nThat said, it could also be true that these ongoing upgrades provide outsized value relative to their initial up-front costs. Crypto investors and users want to see an Ethereum network that's as low cost and efficient as possible. That's what this Dencun upgrade aims to achieve.\n\nAdditionally, some recent news around MetaMask launching an Ethereum validator staking feature could result in more locked-up Ethereum tokens, potentially offsetting some of the recent selling pressure we've seen from the Ethereum Foundation and others.\n\nThese effects likely won't offset the institutional capital flight we're seeing from the crypto sector. However, it's the longer-term supply-and-demand dynamics investors will need to consider when it comes to this top-tier crypto.\n\nThus, I think the jury remains out with respect to how Ethereum will perform as it continues its ongoing upgrades in the coming months. For now, sentiment has soured, but long-term investors may want to consider this dip as a potential buying opportunity, as traders look elsewhere to take on bullish positions."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market are down bad this week. But some of the biggest losers near the top of the market were once recently stars of the show, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn recent weeks, all three of those top 20 cryptocurrencies were making big gains as they attracted institutional investor interest. Now, each has slipped by at least 14% over the past seven days, and have posted sizable losses on the day.\n\nEthereum is down sharply this morning, per data from CoinGecko, falling 7% over the past 24 hours to a current price of about $2,200 and pushing its seven-day dip to 14%.\n\nSolana is down almost 16% over the past seven days at a current price of $82.50. It has rebounded slightly from earlier this morning, but remains down about 5% on the day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile AVAX, which is the 11th largest cryptocurrency, has plunged 19% on the week to a current price of just under $29. Like Solana, it has shored up some of its losses since this morning, now down about 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt was just over a week ago that Ethereum came just shy of hitting $2,700, its highest price since April 2022. Excitement over Ethereum grew amid the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as investors considered the next wave of prospective institutional adoption, particularly as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked up the prospect of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSOL had been on a big run starting from the end of October. It was expected to take a hit during the trial of disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, who was heavily invested in the asset via his now collapsed crypto empire, FTX.\n\nBut major companies such as Visa and Shopify sung the project's praises and said they'd use its blockchain. A growing developer base also meant the price of SOL shot up. It rose as high as $123 in December 2023, nearing a two-year high after plunging to a price of about $8 in December 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAVAX also attracted interest when investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nLong-term holders have reason to be optimistic, though\u2014despite the recent dips in price, both coins over a one-year period are doing well: SOL is up 239%, while AVAX has jumped by 64%. Even Ethereum is up by 35% over the last year.\n\nThe broader crypto market has taken a nosedive as it follows the price action of the biggest digital asset by market cap, Bitcoin.\n\nSince crypto fund Grayscale converted its flagship BTC fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and started trading on the stock market, investors have been keen to redeem shares previously locked into the product.\n\nThis has put pressure on the price of the biggest and oldest digital coin in recent days.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

The protocol is designed to ensure that information can be securely transferred between separate operating chains.\n\nRead More: DeFi users \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 what chain apps are on\n\n\u201cIBC already had years put into its design and architecture, so we decided to stick with IBC and not invent a whole new standard,\u201d Du said.\n\nKim added that at the time, IBC was the most decentralized, elegant solution to establish connections and pass messages between chains.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe realized this was something that could be expanded to other chains; basically export the technology to have industry penetration rather than just the Cosmos app chains,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe team wanted to find ways to make the already established interoperability protocol on Cosmos a mainstream standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to integrate IBC natively into all these different chains, which is why we designed the virtual IBC protocol, which essentially allows chains that don\u2019t natively implement IBC to access IBC execution through Polymer and have Polymer execute IBC on its behalf,\u201d Du said.\n\nMany blockchain interoperability protocols today are focused on the state component of interoperability, which involves aligning the status of the data stored within separate systems, but Du believes this is just one part of the interoperability problem.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBeyond the state layer, two other layers need to be considered. This includes the application layer \u2014 that is, the layer responsible for encoding and decoding sent data and the transportation layer (TAO) \u2014 which manages the routing of raw data.\n\n\u201cAll of IBC\u2019s core logic will live on the transportation layer; this becomes decoupled from the application layer, and Polymer will hold the IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d Du said.\n\nThis means that at the end of the day, the application \u2014 which lives on Ethereum \u2014 will be able to interact with the IBC network through Polymer smart contracts.\n\n\u201cPolymer will then take the apps intended actions and execute the associated IBC logic and produce a commitment to the IBC state of that chain on Polymer \u2014 so essentially, Polymer is maintaining this merkle-ized IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: 2023\u2019s top 5 DeFi protocols by revenue\n\nSimilar work to decouple state, application and transport layers is being explored by the interoperability protocol LayerZero.\n\nIBC has been around for a long period of time. Du notes that its specs cover various considerations ranging from authentication, timeouts and acknowledgment, somethings its competitors may not have.\n\nThis means that applications will not have to individually implement these different changes when there are protocol upgrades.\n\n\u201cIf you want to design a protocol that is going to last for generations of builders, you need to be able to handle these different edge cases properly,\u201d Du said. \u201cThis is a foundational level protocol.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Polymer Labs, Yuan Han Li and Joshua Rivera from Blockchain Capital, shared this sentiment.\n\nThey note in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that \u201cwhile numerous arbitrary messaging protocols have emerged to address the cross-chain interoperability, they have all done so by building a new messaging standard, paradoxically causing more fragmentation when a standardized and battle tested way to move data between heterogeneous blockchains already exists.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Polymer team is hoping to ensure that IBC becomes a widely adopted interoperability standard that will shape how blockchain applications of the future will communicate. This latest funding round will bring the team closer to launching mainnet.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low Can ETH Go Following Recent 4% Decline: Ethereum Price Analysis - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In the recent market developments, Ethereum showcased a remarkable upswing, surging to a yearly high of $2717.\n\nHowever, this ascent was met with considerable selling pressure, prompting a slight retracement and setting the stage for a potential short-term consolidation correction.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart uncovers a significant recent surge, with the price reaching a yearly peak of $2.7K. Simultaneously, ETH has emerged within an ascending expanding wedge pattern, identifiable by the orange lines. This pattern holds the potential for a bearish reversal, contingent upon the price breaking below the lower boundary.\n\nDespite this, after Ethereum\u2019s notable upward movement, the price encountered a pivotal resistance zone, notably \u2013 the static $2.7K level aligning with the upper boundary of the ascending wedge pattern.\n\nThis led to a slight retracement. Considering recent market sentiment and price action, there is an anticipation of a continuation in the correction leg, possibly resulting in a pullback to the multi-month ascending wedge pattern (green lines), coinciding with the lower boundary of the recent short-term expanding wedge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, the price faced considerable selling pressure following the impulsive surge, initiating a correction phase. Accordingly, Ethereum seems confined within a crucial range, bounded by substantial support at $2.4K and notable resistance at $2.7K, resulting in a mild downward consolidation.\n\nCurrently, the price has approached the lower boundary of this significant range. Notably, the lower boundary aligns with a significant support region, defined by the price range between the 0.5 ($2408) and the 0.618 ($2335) levels of the Fibonacci retracement. Hence, this offers robust support to the price.\n\nGiven the potential presence of buyers within this critical support zone, an expected scenario is for the price to find support, facilitating a renewed upward movement. However, in the event of a bearish breakout, sellers may target the multi-week ascending trendline as their next objective.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe funding rates are critical in the analysis of Ethereum\u2019s futures market sentiment, as illustrated in the accompanying chart. This metric serves as a pivotal gauge to discern whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders with heightened aggression.\n\nThe chart prominently reveals an upward trajectory in the funding rates metric, mirroring the robust surge in price. This alignment signals a pronounced bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that elevated values in funding rates raise concerns about a potential overheated state in the perpetual markets, signaling the possibility of an impending long-squeeze event.\n\nIn the wake of a recent short-term correction, a noteworthy development is the substantial decline in funding rates. This decline signifies that the overall sentiment remains bullish, concurrently indicating a cooling-off in the perpetual markets from their previously overheated state. Consequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage."

        "title": "Ethereum DeFi Gets \u2018Gasless' Trading With New 0x API - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you're a regular DeFi user on Ethereum, you\u2019ve likely had transactions fail from time to time because you didn\u2019t pony up enough ETH for gas\u20140x aims to solve that.\n\n0x\u2014a prominent developer of web3 infrastructure, including the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) Matcha\u2014today announced the launch of their newest trading API: Tx Relay.\n\nTx Relay facilitates \u201cgasless\u201d swaps, or the ability to swap between cryptocurrencies without spending any ETH on gas fees. Gas fees are the costs a user pays to execute a transaction\u2014whether it\u2019s a swap, a mint, or a token approval, it needs gas.\n\nThe problem is, on average, 8-10% of DEX transactions fail, and this figure spikes up to 20% during times of network congestion (when Ethereum is experiencing an abnormally high volume of transactions). The Tx Relay API abstracts away the usual process of pre-emptively setting how much gas you want to use on your transaction by covering all the gas needed for the transaction and combining it into the transaction itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe cost of the gas is then added to the swap, and paid by the user in the form of the token they\u2019re swapping. The API is available today on Ethereum and Polygon, but the team plans to launch on Arbitrum shortly after in Q1 of 2024.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Product Manager Claudia Haddad believes that network fees have been a top pain point for the last few years. The simplified trading experience gasless swaps create is a \u201chuge UX unlock,\u201d she told Decrypt.\n\nCrypto users are no strangers to gas fees and the headaches that come with them. Coinbase, which is both an investor in 0x and a beta tester for the new API, claims that 69% of Ethereum swaps encounter a \u201cnot enough gas\u201d error when the user starts the trade. Figuring out gas fees, or getting your transactions to execute at all during times of high congestion, are common pain points for the average crypto trader. They\u2019re also common hurdles for new crypto users.\n\nFor example, gas can typically only be paid in the blockchain\u2019s native token. For example, on Ethereum you pay in ETH. A common mistake many new crypto traders make is not leaving enough Ethereum in their wallet to cover transaction costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a similar vein, crypto wallet Giddy last year announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance\u2014paying with the USDC stablecoin instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nWith 0x\u2019s new gasless swap, users don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining a balance of whatever their blockchain\u2019s gas token is, the fee is deducted from their trade in the background.\n\nGasless swaps made using the Tx Relay API also benefit from MEV protection. In simple terms, that means protection against bots and other advanced tools. While sophisticated traders often run their trades through private mempools or custom RPCs, most users are either unaware or just plain too lazy to implement the basic protections available. The Tx Relay API aims to abstract this too away from the user.\n\nExample of how a trade using Tx Relay works. Image: 0x\n\nLast year, crypto wallet Giddy announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance and paying with USDC instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nGasless swaps have been pretty popular with 0x users during their beta. Coinbase reported thousands of users using them in December alone. Matcha has also reported that using the feature reduced failed trades by 85%. When asked how the new API would deal with large spikes in network congestion, 0x co-CEO and co-founder Amir Bandeali said cases of congestion-related failed transactions were rare, but when they occur, the transactions would be automatically resubmitted and executed.\n\nIf everything works as expected, this could create a much better overall user experience for crypto traders, and make the task of conducting on-chain transactions less intimidating to new users.\n\nEditor's note: this article was updated to add mention of the Giddy wallet's gasless approach."

The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.\n\nThis potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.\n\nAdditional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum\u2019s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.\n\nBitcoin in trouble\n\nBitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.\n\nOn the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.\n\nShiba Inu gets hit\n\nThe token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.\n\nThe current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.\n\nIn terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range."

Per Santiment data, Kusama, Polkadot\u2019s canary network, came in third, with a total commit of 329.57, the same figures as Polkadot.\n\nAlternate chain performances\n\nProtocols like Optimism and Status (SNT) recorded upticks in their figures, with total commits coming in at 281.03 and 262.23, respectively. Hedera and Cosmos occupy the fifth and sixth positions, with their GitHub commits coming in at 251.57 and 246.17, respectively.\n\nInternet Computer and Chainlink were also ranked higher than Ethereum as the trio recorded 212.1, 198.87 and 195.93 commits over the past 30 days.\n\nThe GitHub Commit metrics are a testament to how much work is put in to ensure a protocol stays at the top of its game in rolling out applications and upgrades needed to function optimally. While this has not necessarily translated into price growth for Cardano or others, it shows that efforts to keep building for the future remain solid."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst thinks that an altcoin running on the Ethereum (ETH) network is gearing up for a big surge in price.\n\nTrader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 685,500 followers on the social media platform X that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK) looks poised for a 2x rally.\n\nAccording to Van de Poppe, LINK looks bullish against both Bitcoin (LINK/BTC) and the US dollar.\n\n\u201cThis one looks primed for continuation.\n\nThe BTC pair is making higher highs, higher lows and held a higher timeframe support level.\n\nExpecting a breakout to $25-$30 in the coming months to occur.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, LINK is trading for $14.72, suggesting an over 100% upside potential if the ETH-based altcoin hits the analyst\u2019s target.\n\nLooking at layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI), Van de Poppe believes that the altcoin is likely headed to its next support area at around $0.90 before the next leg up.\n\n\u201cThis one is also having a general correction, which is fine. The optimal zone for entries is coming up, before the upwards trend is continuing.\n\nBuy the dips.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SUI is worth $1.04.\n\nNext up is the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Just like SUI, Van de Poppe thinks that ARB will see lower levels before regaining bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cThis region between $1.40-1.85 is an area I\u2019d be looking to get myself positioned before a potential run to $3.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ARB is trading for $1.71.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is the interoperable blockchain Cosmos (ATOM). Van de Poppe believes that ATOM must stay above its immediate support level to have a shot at igniting a strong breakout rally.\n\n\u201cCrucial area to hold, if this area between $7.50-9.00 is going to hold, likely a breakout to $22-$26 seems next.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ATOM is worth $9.20.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Does stETH have a liquidity issue? Lido says no but not everyone\u2019s convinced - DLNews",
        "content": "If Ethereum's validator exit queue becomes congested, Lido may not be able to redeem stETH for Ether during that time.\n\nstETH holders must then rely on existing liquidity to sell their tokens.\n\nA lack of liquidity for Lido's stETH token could cause it to depeg during a period of extreme market volatility.\n\nAt the start of the year, defunct crypto lender Celsius announced it would withdraw $1.6 billion worth of Ether that it had previously staked onchain.\n\nThe move instantly clogged Ethereum\u2019s staking withdrawal queue so no other Ether stakers could execute withdrawals.\n\nFor most stakers, waiting a few days to withdraw their Ether is nothing more than a minor inconvenience.\n\nBut according to some analysts, such a delay could become a major problem for Lido and stETH \u2014 the biggest Ether liquid staking token with over $23 billion worth in circulation.\n\n\u201cThe decline of stETH liquidity is a serious issue,\u201d Riyad Carey, an analyst at crypto research firm Kaiko, told DL News.\n\nThe fear is that with low levels of liquidity and a clogged exit queue, stETH, which acts as a receipt on staked Ether deposits, could break its peg with Ether again, causing mass liquidations among those leveraging the token on lending protocols.\n\nInvestor deposits in Lido\n\nAlthough there was no depeg this time, many fear that if the crypto market experiences another sudden drawdown, the Ether staking queue could quickly become extended as investors rush to unstake their Ether and cash out.\n\nLido maintains that stETH is sufficiently liquid, and that there are mechanisms in place to prevent another depeg.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut with stETH increasingly intertwined with the broader DeFi ecosystem, the threat posed by a potential liquidity crisis is only becoming more pronounced.\n\nNot enough liquidity\n\nAccording to data from Lido\u2019s stETH liquidity Dune dashboard, there\u2019s currently about $274 million worth of liquidity across decentralised exchanges.\n\nLido\u2019s head of protocol relations Marin Tvrdi\u0107 said in a recent X post that liquidity for stETH on centralised crypto exchanges is between seven and eight figures.\n\nCarey argues that the current stETH liquidity is insufficient.\n\nHe says that in situations where Ethereum\u2019s validator exit queue becomes congested, there is not enough liquidity to support the more than $3 billion worth of leveraged bets on stETH on DeFi lending protocol Aave, should these positions suddenly need to unwind.\n\nWith the validator queue clogged, there\u2019s no immediate way for Lido to convert stETH into Ether. This means it falls to trading pools that facilitate swaps between stETH and Ether to pick up the slack.\n\nIf stETH starts to break from its peg amid a demand imbalance, it could set off a cascade of liquidations on Aave. \u201cIf any large stETH holder gets impatient and sells, things could get ugly,\u201d Carey said.\n\nAnd Carey isn\u2019t the only one who is concerned.\n\nAriah Klages-Mundt, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Gyroscope, said there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that stETH will depeg in the future.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too surprised if it happens at some point. You have to plan for things like this to happen at some point in finance,\u201d Klages-Mundt said in a recent X post. Multiple other Ethereum thought leaders have shared similar views, though not all specifically pointed to Lido\u2019s stETH.\n\nTotal market capitalisation of Atheneum's liquid staking derivatives\n\nLeveraging stETH on lending markets like Aave is a popular DeFi strategy to boost returns. Investors deposit stETH to Aave and borrow Ether, which they then deposit to Lido, receiving more stETH.\n\nRepeating this loop compounds the staking yield earning on stETH, but also risks investors getting liquidated if their stETH collateral falls in value against the borrowed Ether.\n\nA strong track record\n\nStill, not everyone agrees Lido\u2019s current levels of liquidity are a concern.\n\nAdcv, a pseudonymous contributor at Lido DAO, told DL News it\u2019s \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say there is insufficient stETH liquidity \u201cin light of the observable on-chain evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cStETH has institutional-grade liquidity, both on and off chain in major trading venues on mainnet, layer 2 AMMs and major CEXs,\u201d Adcv said.\n\nTo back his claims, Adcv pointed to Lido\u2019s strong track record of fulfilling stETH redemptions.\n\nOut of the 3 million Ether withdrawn from Lido since last year\u2019s Shapella upgrade activated withdrawals, fewer than 30,000 took more than 120 hours to process, he said.\n\nAave, on the other hand, defers to the judgement of DAO service providers such as Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to assess the risks of letting its users leverage stETH.\n\nIn November, Chaos Labs proposed that Aave could increase the supply cap on stETH deposits by another 1.1 million tokens \u201cwithout introducing significant risk to the protocol.\u201d\n\nBut the recommendation, which was also supported by Gauntlet, came with a caveat: Chaos Lab\u2019s risk calculation assumed no significant price divergences between Ether and stETH.\n\nPreventative measures\n\nAccording to Carey, Lido\u2019s liquidity issues began when it stopped giving out LDO token incentives to liquidity providers of its stETH-ETH pool on Curve Finance.\n\nLido stopped incentivising liquidity because Ethereum\u2019s April Shapella upgrade allowed stakers to start withdrawing their Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract.\n\nThis meant that instead of having to rely solely on the stETH liquidity on exchanges, Lido could instead redeem stETH for Ether if a supply imbalance were to occur.\n\nLido\u2019s own data shows that since the Shapella upgrade, stETH liquidity on Curve Finance fell from around $800 million to $274 million.\n\nOnchain stETH liquidity has fallen sharply since Ethereum's April Shapella upgrade. (Dune/Lido)\n\nAccording to Carey, Lido could do more to shore up liquidity.\n\n\u201cI wrote back in July that I thought Lido should consider engaging with a market maker to help boost off-chain liquidity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile off-chain liquidity has improved since then, I do think this would still be worth exploring.\u201d\n\nIt appears Lido is looking for ways to further secure stETH liquidity.\n\nIn August, crypto analytics platform Glass Markets posted a proposal on the Lido research forums requesting a grant to assess stETH liquidity and write a research report laying out the best way to address its recommendations.\n\nA December post from a member of Lido DAO\u2019s operations workstream confirmed that Glass Markets had been granted funds to pursue the research report.\n\nDL News reached out to Glass Markets and Lido to ask about the status of the research report but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Spot ETF Speculation Sparks, When Will ETH Hit $4,800? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction indicates a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Currently priced at $2,281, Ethereum has experienced a slight dip of 0.41% in the past day. Despite this minor decrease, the currency has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining a value above $2,200 in recent months. This pattern demonstrates a strong bullish inclination among investors.\n\nEthereum price has witnessed a significant rise of over 46% in the past year, an indicator of increasing investor interest. The last 24 hours have been particularly optimistic for Ethereum, with its trading volume soaring to $9.29 billion. This surge points to a heightened bullish sentiment, suggesting potential for further growth in its value.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Resilient Amidst Market Volatility\n\nOver the previous week, Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,400. Despite this 6% weekly decline, the current market momentum leans towards optimism. Ethereum continues to hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now valued at $285 billion. This stability in the market underscores Ethereum\u2019s growing prominence in the cryptocurrency sphere.\n\nEthereum price dynamics have recently been the focus of Crypto Busy, renowned crypto educators, and market analysts. They shared insights on Twitter, noting Ethereum\u2019s market behavior post-speculation around an Ethereum-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). After the initial surge attributed to the ETF buzz, Ethereum is now experiencing a consolidation phase. This period is characterized by the market stabilizing after the notable increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\n#EthereumNameService $ENS chart update: \ud83d\udc47 Currently consolidating after getting a huge pump from the $ETH ETF speculation. We can see a double resistance as it approach the diagonal and horizontal trendline. Watch out! pic.twitter.com/5TD9IDUvEB \u2014 CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) January 22, 2024\n\nCrypto Busy\u2019s analysis highlights Ethereum\u2019s critical juncture, highlighting a double resistance scenario. This resistance is encountered as Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory intersects with a diagonal and a horizontal trendline. In the wake of the ETF speculation, Ethereum\u2019s value soared, reaching above $2,600. This peak signifies a substantial milestone and signals the potential for additional market gains.\n\nIf Ethereum successfully breaks through the critical $3,000 resistance level, it could be on the verge of a significant price increase. The next major barrier it faces is at around $3,500. Surpassing this could lead to a bullish trend, pushing Ethereum\u2019s value towards the $4,000 mark. Should this upward momentum continue beyond $4,000, Ethereum might see its value rise as high as the $4,800 resistance level.\n\nDaily Technical Indicators: Will ETH Continue to Soar?\n\nConversely, a failure to overcome the $3,000 threshold could result in a downturn for Ethereum. The first level of support in such a scenario is nearly $2,000. A further decline, especially a close below the $1,900 mark, could intensify the drop, leading to a more pronounced decrease in Ethereum\u2019s value. This makes the $3,000 and $1,900 levels crucial for determining Ethereum\u2019s short-term market trajectory.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showcases a bullish trend on the daily chart. This is evident as the MACD line currently hovers above its signal line. Contrasting this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), also on a daily chart basis, signals a bearish market environment. Its readings linger below the 50 mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is also positive at $0.11, indicating a bullish pressure in the near term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Protect Yourself From Identity Theft By Using Zero-Knowledge Proof, Solidity, and Ethereum - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Identity theft is a growing concern in the insurance industry. According to a Javelin Strategy & Research report, identity theft has risen in recent years, with over $17 billion stolen directly from U.S. consumers in 20171.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology, specifically Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), Solidity, and Ethereum can provide a secure and efficient solution to prevent identity theft.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can have devastating consequences for its victims, including damage to their credit, finances, and reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe insurance industry is particularly vulnerable to identity theft, as it deals with sensitive personal and financial information on a daily basis.\n\nHow Zero-Knowledge Proof Can Prevent Identity Theft in the Insurance Industry.\n\nZKP can be used to verify an individual's identity without revealing any personal information. By using ZKP, insurance companies can verify the identity of their customers without storing sensitive personal information in a central database, which is vulnerable to hacks and data breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three fundamental characteristics that define a ZKP include:\n\nCompleteness: If a statement is true, an honest verifier can be convinced by an honest prover that they possess knowledge about the correct input.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundness: If a statement is false, then no dishonest prover can unilaterally convince an honest verifier that they possess knowledge about the correct input.\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-knowledge: If the state is true, then the verifier learns nothing more from the prover other than the statement is true.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nZero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms are cryptographic algorithms that allow one party to prove to another party that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the mere fact of the statement\u2019s truth.\n\n\n\n\n\nA common analogy used to explain ZKP is that of a person trying to prove they have visited a country. The verifier can ask a series of questions that only someone who has visited the country would know the answer to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the person answers the questions correctly, the verifier can be certain that the person has visited the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the person does not have to reveal additional information, such as the names of people they met while visiting the country. This way, sensitive information is protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis innovative approach offers a potent shield against identity thieves. They can't steal what they can't see, making fraudulent claims based on stolen identities significantly harder to pull off.\n\nBuilding Using Solidity and Ethereum\n\nBut how do we put ZK-Proofs to work in the insurance world? That's where Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, a decentralized and secure public ledger.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this scenario:\n\nIdentity data encrypted: Your identity information is encrypted and stored on the Ethereum blockchain using ZK-Proofs.\n\nSmart contracts control access: Insurance companies build smart contracts that interact with your encrypted identity data on the blockchain using ZK-Proofs.\n\nClaims verification streamlined: When you file a claim, the smart contract automatically verifies your identity through ZK-Proofs without revealing your personal information. This allows for faster, more secure claim processing and minimizes the risk of fraudulent claims.\n\nCreate a Solidity Identity Verification Smart Contract.\n\nBuilding a Solidity smart contract with zero knowledge (ZK), proofs involves implementing a system that allows parties to prove the authenticity of certain information without revealing the details of that information.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll create a basic smart contract for identity verification using ZK-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) as an example.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nRemix IDE: Access Remix at Remix. Zokrates Toolbox on Remix: Open Remix IDE and go to the \"Plugins\" section.\n\nSearch for \"Zokrates\" and enable the plugin.\n\nStep 1: Write the Solidity Smart Contract\n\n// IdentityVerification.sol pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract IdentityVerification { struct User { string name; string email; string country; } mapping(address => User) public users; mapping(address => bool) public isVerified; function verifyIdentity( uint256[2] memory a, uint256[2][2] memory b, uint256[2] memory c, uint256[3] memory input ) public { require(!isVerified[msg.sender], \"Already verified\"); // Verify the zk-SNARK proof using the provided parameters require(verifyProof(a, b, c, input), \"Invalid proof\"); // Mark the sender's address as verified isVerified[msg.sender] = true; } // Function to verify the zk-SNARK proof function verifyProof( uint256[2] memory a, uint256[2][2] memory b, uint256[2] memory c, uint256[3] memory input ) internal view returns (bool) { // TODO: Implement zk-SNARK verification logic here // Use Zokrates-generated verifier.sol or implement your own logic. // For simplicity, this example assumes you have a verifyProof function. // Replace the following line with your verification logic return true; } }\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IdentityVerifier contract is an ERC721 token representing identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contract owner can create identities using the createIdentity function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe verifyIdentity function is called by the owner to verify an identity using a ZK-SNARKs proof.\n\nStep 2: Write the ZoKrates Program\n\nCreate a file named root.zok with the following content:\n\ndef main(private field a, private field b){ assert(a * a == b); return; }\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Compile the ZoKrates Program\n\nOpen Zokrates Toolbox on Remix IDE.\n\nIn this example, you will prove knowledge of the square root a of a number b:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \"Compile\" to compile the ZoKrates program.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no errors occurred, you should see a successful compilation message.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click on compute (Computes a witness for the compiled program.), and input the correct values in the fields a and b .\n\nThe keyword field is the basic type we use, an element of a given prime field.\n\nThe keyword private signals that we do not want to reveal this input but still prove that we know its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything is successful, then you will get a response similar to this\n\nComputed successfully!\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on setup (Creates a proving key and a verification key); if the setup is successful, you will see this message. Click the accept button.\n\nIf successful, you will get a similar response with a file created as verification_key.json\n\n{ \"scheme\": \"g16\", \"curve\": \"bn128\", \"alpha\": [ \"0x210423c94fc66d164c8bd2468f84f8c9a7d968fa6387b3b93b0ceeac46fd82e5\", \"0x0ebb3f8d44c365d2d8f2e2291b462dba174119094a6d2b0ec2d4d8eb5c22022f\" ], \"beta\": [ [ \"0x081d89caafe161719b18d52eba13b4d49bbf1773df90ef557fecc15df3e754da\", \"0x175b8d80b480f5a657720e09187ea07e0f652646cb0eef8cac65101266b7d996\" ], [ \"0x0de3c067c14984ff114248511f6ab765fef3ed50cb1976041f3a6050abe4de18\", \"0x206e47582c1032a44cdf5482d42d5f3efee886096f6b463f2ea1b12fdc005625\" ] ], \"gamma\": [ [ \"0x0ddca49b4ddd0e4d72d47577c8ff1e7b38f10236d09076ad34940f5a7dd6c551\", \"0x1257c4524fc1d08ccf3d2b400a6df7096b3023fe76cac8c88702e3b66e5faec6\" ], [ \"0x10636e95862ef1dc713a1cde4a484e83702e4adf518eb7cc3c0f18c696d8647a\", \"0x126e8393f2e8d6d5e283b496f478203bd4778d36ac761970f8e25103b05c698a\" ] ], \"delta\": [ [ \"0x22beccba27f69307089b2204564cac62c6da1c36b8715ef5104c0a7995239a6d\", \"0x02e36e20e8398e7b894123f164e08cd36cce842893929901d00aed2adc939a63\" ], [ \"0x07a981bf40998e83f012638d25a1aa6443144c87d8a559344879cdcd354004fe\", \"0x304d5624ba0c6331808865534aae8426c23b82ea908fc2f0ecf96e33318099e1\" ] ], \"gamma_abc\": [ [ \"0x0b51d2854f317c749ff6b08ae0a141b7910ef4f9f89cfe8792848da778a17292\", \"0x2f0183ef10bb7039a39c1fd99be786cae7243bccaf0efb15856a293d5f70691a\" ] ] }\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Generate button to generate a proof for computation of the compiled program using the proving key and computed witness.\n\nClick the accept button, copy your Verifier inputs, and save it in a safe place; you will need it later.\n\n[[\"0x1899357b6a4dde55cf33faa0e44d0a20bc6493a5431b0cc08f725b9f72a2469a\",\"0x148015243e143145b3156befd13f956b9384774bdfc028ce3de4b3573dbf596c\"],[[\"0x2f255b3eaae2bb31993384cf5d7dd99a1298418a945a4fca963dea30089e7832\",\"0x27419401db75b3494397179a8fb29df56d83661651380b9cd0911b01d73a7996\"],[\"0x040a7240b43396c13acaf09a7623a931357e085e51507804e4d0f69290804951\",\"0x118c58bbb70afc6eeb400c3c41b7a65462cc42fc1523ec0ca31d4aabcfcb983f\"]],[\"0x2e93bc4b403285b54f7010585abd43baf1d9ded3c6ec45a8f5efcba5f66aae10\",\"0x143ebda58260d826feddc28223505dcf95c2a7d5308b004348755e0a12c16323\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify\n\nTo validate the proof, go to the Deploy & Run Transactions plugin, paste the remix-compatible parameters into the verifyTx field, and click the transact button.\n\n\n\n\n\nExport Verifier and click the Export button; this generates a Solidity contract containing the generated verification key and a public function to verify a solution to the compiled program.\n\nIf everything is successful, you will get a generated Solidity code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile your solidity smart contract by clicking on Solidity compiler and this button Compile verifier.sol\n\nOnce you are done, go to Deploy & run transactions plugin , and choose Verifier \u2014 verifier.sol from the dropdown list.

        "content": "The popular smart contract platform Cardano ($ADA) has maintained its top stop in cryptocurrency development activity, outperforming other major digital assets including Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH).\n\nThat\u2019s according to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which noted that the \u201cblockchain of blockchains\u201d Polkadot ($DOT) and its public pre-production environment Kusama ($KSM) came in second and third place respectively. Notably Optimism ($OP) came right after, ahead of other major digital assets.\n\nThe term \u201cdevelopment activity\u201d refers to the amount of work completed by a cryptocurrency project\u2019s developers on the project\u2019s public GitHub repositories within the past 30 days.\n\nUnlike other measures, Santiment\u2019s metric focuses on \u201cevents\u201d rather than the total number of commits. Events encompass various actions taken on GitHub repositories, such as pushing a commit, forking a repository, or creating an issue.\n\nThis approach provides a more accurate representation of the developers\u2019 actual work, as it prevents duplication or inaccuracies that may occur when measuring development activity solely by commits.\n\nFor instance, forking creates a duplicate copy of a repository, including all previous commits. By counting the forking action as a single event, Santiment avoids falsely attributing older commits to new developers.\n\nSantiment\u2019s data comes at a time in which the total value locked on Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has started dropping from a high above the $400 million mark, to now stand close to $330 million.\n\nDespite the drop, some analysts are bullish on ADA. According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano\u2019s current consolidation phase mirrors that of late 2020, when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $0.10 per token.\n\nIn 2021, Cardano witnessed a significant price surge amid a wider cryptocurrency market bull run, surging to the $2 mark before correcting to $1.12 by mid-2021. The cryptocurrency then kept on surging, to hit an all-time high near the $3 mark. Cardano\u2019s price then started dropping amid a wider crypto bear market, and now trades at $0.5 per token.\n\nPer the analyst, if history repeats itself, ADA could resume its upward trend around April to hit $0.8 in the near future, before enduring a brief correction to $0.6. ADA\u2019s price could then skyrocket to the $7 mark.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "title": "How to bridge to Polygon - OKX",
        "content": "Getting familiar with cryptocurrency bridging is essential to your crypto journey. If you\u2019re looking for a detailed guide on how to bridge to Polygon, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Let's explore how to bridge ETH to Polygon using Polygon\u2019s portal and OKX Swap. Additionally, we\u2019ll walk through a centralized bridging process using OKX to bridge USDT from Ethereum to Polygon.\n\nIntroduction to Polygon and blockchain bridging\n\nBlockchains are typically isolated systems with their native tokens and can't interact with other chains. Blockchain bridging enables blockchain interoperability and digital asset transfer between multiple chains. With each chain having its own features and applications, users must be able to move across them conveniently. Cryptocurrency bridging refers to the act of moving your funds from one chain to another.\n\nPolygon blockchain is an Ethereum-compatible chain, but faster and more efficient than Ethereum. At any given time, the transaction fee on Polygon is a fraction of what it is on Ethereum. This makes Polygon ideal for various use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Bridging from Ethereum and other chains to Polygon is essential to get into the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nThe first step before using an ETH to Polygon bridge is to choose the right wallet .\n\nThe OKX Web3 Wallet offered by OKX is known for its strong security measures and ability to support multiple cryptocurrency chains. This wallet can securely hold BTC and any other digital currencies for an indefinite period of time. It also boasts bank-level security and allows users to easily access a variety of decentralized applications (DApps) and the OKX NFT Marketplace .\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking to bridge assets from one chain to another, you must make sure you have the native assets on both bridges. Transferring from Ethereum to Polygon requires ETH to complete the initial transaction. MATIC is the native token of Polygon. While you don\u2019t need MATIC to bridge your assets, you still need it to use your bridged asset on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nNext, you must decide on the digital asset you\u2019re transferring and make sure it\u2019s supported on both chains. One easy way to do this is to check for the supported assets on the bridge of your choice before cryptocurrency bridging.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nThe most common method of cryptocurrency bridging is to use decentralized bridges. Polygon Portal is a popular ETH to Polygon bridge built by the Polygon Foundation and is a safe blockchain bridge to use. Other popular polygon bridging providers include Allbridge and Wormhole . They\u2019re good options if you\u2019re looking for advanced controls.\n\nAnother option is OKX Swap , which allows you to swap and bridge assets across multiple chains. OKX collects prices from numerous decentralized exchanges to provide the most efficient path, reducing both slippage and fees.\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nA straightforward way to bridge assets is using centralized exchanges. You can deposit your assets to OKX using one chain and withdraw them using another. Here\u2019s a simple guide to bridging USDT from Ethereum to Polygon using OKX.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX .\n\nStep 2: Once logged in, head to \u201cAssets\u201d on the top-right and select \u201cDeposit.\u201d If you don\u2019t already have USDT, you can buy some on OKX.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cUSDT\u201d as the crypto and \u201cUSDT-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Deposit USDT into the address shown in your Ethereum Wallet. It takes a few minutes for the USDT to reach your account and be accessible.\n\nStep 5: Return to the \"Assets\" section after your funds become available and select \"Withdraw.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Choose \"USDT\" as the cryptocurrency and opt for the \"On-chain\" withdrawal option.\n\nStep 7: Type in your Polygon address, and select the network as \u201cUSDT-Polygon.\u201d Enter the amount of USDT you want to bridge to Polygon and hit next. You\u2019ll be asked to authenticate your account, and the USDT should arrive in your wallet within a few minutes.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to bridge your assets is by using an exchange, since you won't have to worry about slippage or network fees.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nLet\u2019s now walk through the process of bridging ETH from Ethereum to Polygon. We\u2019ll use Polygon Portal as the ETH to Polygon bridge for this and the OKX Web3 Wallet, which we previously set up. Next, we\u2019ll also explore how we can perform decentralized bridging on OKX Swap.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to Polygon Portal .\n\nStep 2: Click \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d in the top-right corner and select OKX Wallet.\n\nStep 3: Type in the password for your OKX wallet and select \u201cConfirm\u201d to allow Polygon Portal to connect with your wallet.\n\nTransferring assets to Polygon\n\nNow that you\u2019re connected to Polygon Portal, you're ready to bridge your Ethereum.\n\nStep 1: Click on \u201cBridge\u201d on the left.\n\nStep 2: Fill in the bridge details. There are a few fields here that you need to fill in carefully. Let's break them down:\n\nTransfer from: The chain you are transferring from. In this case, Ethereum. Token: Select the token you want to transfer. We\u2019re going to select ETH here. Amount: Type in the amount of ETH you want to transfer from Ethereum to Polygon. Transfer to: Select Polygon POS since this is the chain we\u2019re bridging our ETH to. Refuel gas: Polygon's native currency is MATIC, and refuel acts as an ETH to MATIC bridge. It's optional for the bridge to go through. However, you need it to interact with your bridged ETH. Turn it on and select the amount of MATIC you want if you have none. It can also be considered a MATIC Bridge since you\u2019re converting a part of Ethereum\u2019s native currency to Polygon\u2019s native currency.\n\nStep 3: After filling in and selecting all the fields, select \u201cBridge ETH to Polygon POS.\u201d\n\nStep 4: OKX Wallet is shown with the details of your transaction. Confirm it once again and hit \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nPolygon Portal or any other bridges can also do the reverse and act as Polygon to ETH bridges if required. Note that to do so, you must select Polygon POS as the first chain and Ethereum as the second.\n\nBridge ETH to Polygon on OKX Swap\n\nOKX swap is a decentralized cross-chain swap and bridge aggregator. OKX itself isn't performing the bridging here. Instead, OKX sources the best price across multiple bridges and moves your crypto.\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap and connect your wallet. The process is the same as connecting your wallet to Polygon Portal above.\n\nStep 2: Set the parameters under \u201cSwap and Bridge\u201d:\n\nSet the first chain as \u201cEthereum\u201d and type in the amount of ETH you want to bridge. Set the second chain as \u201cPolygon\u201d and the coin as \u201cWETH.\u201d OKX automatically shows you how much WETH you\u2019d be receiving here.\n\nStep 3 (optional): Click on the small arrow next to the rate to expand the menu. This is an advanced option \u2014 you don\u2019t have to change anything here. If you\u2019re sure about what you\u2019re doing, you can manually adjust the slippage and change the trading route.\n\nStep 4: Click \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet pops up, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap is a user-friendly DeFi solution for transferring your cryptocurrencies across chains and exchanging them during the process.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThere are multiple fees involved in a decentralized bridging process:\n\nEthereum gas fees : To send your ETH and use the Polygon Portal bridge, you're required to pay a transaction fee to the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon Portal fees: Since Polygon Portal is providing the service of bridging your ETH from Ethereum to Polygon, a small fee is involved.\n\nPolygon transaction fees: Similar to the Ethereum gas fee, a polygon transaction fee is taken to facilitate the transaction of ETH from the bridge to your wallet.\n\nConversion fees: Some assets aren't native to the blockchain. This includes ETH on Polygon. The ETH is converted to Wrapped ETH (WETH) and deposited into your wallet. WETH is pegged to the price of ETH and enables the seamless transfer of assets between chains. There's a small fee involved in the conversion of ETH to WETH.\n\nBefore transferring, you can get a breakdown of the conversion and bridge fees on Polygon Portal. However, the Ethereum gas fee is only shown on the OKX wallet pop-up before you confirm the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nJust like the fees, the transaction time also depends on multiple factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: This is your ETH's time to move from your wallet to the bridge. If you use enough gas, this should take a few seconds.\n\nBridge processing time: This is how long the bridge would take to move your asset from one chain to another. It changes from bridge to bridge. In the case of Polygon Portal, you can see it below the confirmation button before you bridge. This is only an estimation and could take longer if lots of people are using the bridge at the same time.\n\nPolygon blockchain confirmation time: The WETH must come to your wallet once the bridging is complete. Since Polygon is very fast, it should reach your wallet in a few seconds.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nKeeping transactions secure\n\nCryptocurrency bridges are powered by smart contracts that have access to the funds in your wallet. Unfortunately, wallet funds can be depleted using rouge smart contracts. We recommend the following for secure crypto transactions on bridges:\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using a reputable bridge service like Polygon Portal, which has been in the market for a long time.\n\nAvoid using your primary wallet to engage with bridges and other DApps. Instead, use a separate cold wallet for this purpose.\n\nAfter bridging, make use of tools such as Revoke to remove access to your wallet.\n\nA potential solution to reduce these risks could be using a centralized exchange. As a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, OKX employs world-class security measures to enable users worldwide to buy and sell crypto safely and seamlessly. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nHere are some of the common pitfalls you can avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Polygon:\n\nMake sure to review all the information you enter before submitting it. Once you confirm the transaction, it can't be reversed.\n\nPlease keep in mind the gas fees , as they can become relatively expensive on Ethereum during periods of high network traffic. Consider waiting for the fees to decrease, or use a centralized exchange to make the transfer.\n\nAnother factor to consider is potential slippage and liquidity concerns. Using a less popular bridge or bridging to a coin with limited liquidity may result in higher slippage. It\u2019s best to bridge assets with good liquidity to prevent this.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nOne common problem encountered by users is transactions that become stuck. The only factor you can influence is the gas fee for Ethereum, which must be set correctly for the transaction to be successful. The transaction will fail if the gas fee is insufficient, and the funds will be returned to your wallet. Transactions can also get stuck when the bridge is congested. Fortunately, cryptocurrency bridges are designed to handle these situations and will eventually be resolved. It may just take longer, so it\u2019s wise to be patient.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: Before bridging, always make sure there\u2019s sufficient liquidity for the asset being bridged and that it can be used on the designated chain.\n\nWhere to seek help\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is incredibly supportive, and if you encounter any problems, you can count on finding assistance."

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: Crossing the Chasm: U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Usher in a New Era of Crypto Adoption - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "The introduction of US Bitcoin spot ETFs marks a pivotal moment in the journey toward cryptocurrency acceptance. In an earlier article, I emphasized the significance of the product adoption curve. With the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it is evident that crypto has successfully navigated the chasm phase of the curve and is now entering the realm of the early majority. On average the gains of new entrants forming the early majority, will likely be less than those of the early adopters, but they will still beat the broader market as adoption of crypto continues to increase.\n\nPhoto: Wikimeida Commons\n\nAnticipations are high that, over the coming months, traditional investors will channel substantial funds into the cryptocurrency market via spot ETFs and derivatives. This influx is expected to lead to a steady increase in cryptocurrency values. Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving in April is poised to further fuel this upward trend by slicing the daily supply of Bitcoin in half.\n\nYet, it\u2019s Ethereum that seems poised to reap the most significant rewards from the Bitcoin ETF approvals. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the premier protocol in terms of total value locked, Ethereum has experienced more substantial gains than Bitcoin since the ETF approvals. Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, Ethereum is expected to benefit from the Bitcoin halving and the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming Ethereum ETF in May. Secondly, Ethereum\u2019s inherent utility as a smart contract platform, its capped supply, and ongoing enhancements aimed at boosting its efficiency and accessibility, position it as the preferred infrastructure for global digital assets.\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum ETF, expected to launch in May, is set to solidify Ethereum\u2019s status as a frontrunner in the digital asset sphere. This ETF will draw in conventional investors seeking diverse exposure in the cryptocurrency market and spotlight Ethereum\u2019s distinct features, such as its smart contract functionality and progressive upgrades aimed at improving scalability and performance.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum will undoubtedly be compelling to observe. Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF is a significant step towards broader crypto acceptance, but Ethereum\u2019s utility and technological progress establish it as an indispensable player in the digital asset infrastructure. The advent of spot ETFs represents a critical milestone, signifying the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into conventional financial systems.\n\nTo sum up, the launch of the US spot Bitcoin ETF is a transformative event for the cryptocurrency industry, heralding a shift towards mainstream adoption. However, Ethereum is likely to be the primary beneficiary in the forthcoming months, propelled by its robust infrastructure, the anticipated ETF, and the growing recognition of the value of utility and technological innovation in the cryptocurrency sector. Moving forward, the interplay between these dominant cryptocurrencies and the wider financial ecosystem will undoubtedly shape the future of digital assets and global finance."

As BTC trades above $40,000, the likelihood of a sideways movement between $41,000 and $42,000 is significant. On the Ethereum front, the current valuation stands at $2,400, but a failure by bulls to reclaim the $2,500 zone could prompt a drop to $2,400 in the upcoming week.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cEven as the US stock market index S&P5000 saw its biggest one-day gain last Friday, Bitcoin failed to impress investors as it is still hovering around the $41k mark. With every slight lower move of BTC however, altcoins have been bleeding as the ETH/BTC pair too failed to hold above the 0.06 bitcoin per ethereum mark. With a lot of hot altcoins like Arbitrum currently trading on trend line support, Monday US hours would be very crucial to see which way the market will take this week.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is holding steady above $41,000 and has seen a slight gain of 0.25% followed by 0.75% decline quickly, right now bitcoin is trading at $41,300 .The speculation comes as X (formerly Twitter) unveils plans for a dedicated Payments account, fueling anticipation of cryptocurrency integration. But the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's shadow looms as Debiex falls victim to a $2.3 million romance scam, highlighting ongoing challenges in the digital asset space. Ethereum is holding steady around $2,400, with traders monitoring signals for a potential rally. Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing pivotal points, with price forecasts indicating cautious optimism while acknowledging neutral market trends. Investors continue to monitor key levels and potential developments in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cThe bearish trend persists for BTC, displaying a downtrend movement as it encounters resistance from the 20EMA on the 4-hour chart. Presently, it is hovering above the $40,500 support level; however, there's no clear confirmation of a reversal or uptrend at this point. ETH, too, is navigating below the 20EMA D after a considerable duration and is currently slightly below the support level at $2,450. It's positioned just above the $2,390 support level. The overall outlook for ETH appears bearish, and a potential pullback might be anticipated from the key level at $2,390.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Celsius Dump Triggers Ethereum Dive: $35 Million Sell-Off Sends ETH Price Crashing - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Celsius Networks, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, has engaged in significant Ethereum transactions that are causing ripples within the digital currency landscape.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, on-chain analysts at LookonChain detected noteworthy transfers, including a 13,000 ETH deposit ($30 million) on Coinbase and an additional 2,200 ETH ($5 million) on FalconX. These transactions suggest a proactive stance by Celsius in addressing its ongoing financial challenges.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP Crash Fears Mount As Whale Dumps 26 Million Tokens \u2013 Details 8 months ago\n\nCelsius Sells $125M ETH, Maintains $1.3B Reserve\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius sold more than $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins between January 8 and January 12. The primary goal of this auction is to pay off creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also revealed a more widespread pattern of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion of staked Ethereum being redeemed during the same period. Since the Shanghai update last year, the amount of redemptions recorded is the highest.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints imposed by the court, Celsius still holds a substantial Ethereum reserve. This reserve amounts to over 557,000 coins in two staking wallets, with a total valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. The size of this reserve adds a layer of complexity to Celsius\u2019 current financial situation and underscores the evolving narrative within the crypto space.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nAs part of its obligations to creditors, Celsius has been actively liquidating its Ethereum holdings. These auctions, aimed at paying off outstanding debts, are integral to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nThe market has responded to these Ethereum transactions, resulting in a 4% decline in the price of ETH. The cryptocurrency slipped below the $2,350 mark, raising concerns among analysts, especially as ETH now wavers below its crucial demand zone ranging from $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts predict that a failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential retreat towards the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,307.2 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nWealthy Investors Trigger Ethereum Profit-Taking\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data reveals that significant transactions by wealthy investors, commonly known as whales, often trigger profit-taking activities among regular ETH holders. This phenomenon intensifies selling pressure and contributes to price declines.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMeanwhile, decreasing funding rates suggest an underlying optimism in the market, hinting at a possible cooldown in previously overheated perpetual markets. This situation leaves room for ETH to rebound once the selling pressure subsides.\n\nAs the bankruptcy drama of Celsius unfolds, the scrutiny on its Ethereum transactions and the resulting market dynamics will persist. Investors and observers are closely monitoring the situation, eagerly awaiting further developments and anticipating the broader implications for both Celsius and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"

        "content": "The Ethereum EIP website has accepted AllianceBlock's draft proposal for a new ERC token standard, and the Nexera protocol will be the first reference implementation of the ERC-7208.\n\nThrough his X (formerly Twitter) account, AllianceBlock's founder and CEO, Rachid Ajaja, verified this, calling it \"a significant milestone in the Company's spectacular journey.\" He also extended an invitation to cryptocurrency members to observe the evolution of the Draft to Final state by providing knowledge and experience that will be vital in improving the ERC interfaces and advancing them to the 'Final' stage, where they will be accepted by all.\n\nToday marks a significant milestone in our journey. Thanks to your incredible support, which has garnered 4,300 views, 70 replies, and 309 likes\u2014landing us at the top spot on the Ethereum Magician forum\u2014we've officially been accepted as a Draft on the Ethereum #EIP website\u2026 \u2014 Rachid Ajaja ?????? (@AjajaRachid) January 19, 2024\n\nWhat is ERC-7208?\n\nAllianceBlock released a draft proposal, known as ERC-7208, for a new Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) token standard. The idea of a new token type called \"Real World Asset\" (RWA) is introduced in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7208. Enhancing on-chain data processing and Real World Asset management across the Ethereum blockchain network is the main goal of this proposal.\n\nTokenizing Real World Assets requires consistent and predictable interactions between tokens; this is addressed in the ERC-7208 standard. In order to improve the functionality and interoperability of ERC tokens, it seeks to provide a set of interfaces known as the On-Chain Data Container (ODC), with a particular emphasis on managing on-chain data pertaining to Real World Assets.\n\nAllianceBlock's dedication to promoting innovation in the blockchain realm, particularly in the areas of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the tokenization of physical assets, is demonstrated by the creation of ERC-7208. The proposal is at the final stage of approval clearly demonstrating its importance within the Ethereum community.\n\nERC-7208 Empowering The world of Real World Assets (RWAs)\n\nSince its introduction in June 2021, ERC-7208 has been sparking lively discussions within the crypto sphere. Enthusiastic members of the Ethereum network have been actively participating in development forums, eagerly anticipating the potential expansion of the network. This is all pending the successful passage of the final draft of EIP7208 by AllianceBlock and its subsequent complete adoption on the Ethereum website. The recent Twitter announcement of this development also mentions the Ethereum Magician forum, a popular hub for developers and stakeholders to come together and suggest enhancements for the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP7208 aims to revolutionize the web3 and blockchain landscape by simplifying data transfer beyond traditional financial transactions. By streamlining the process of creating Real World Assets (RWAs) and also simplifying the rationalization and on-chain trading of these assets, tokenization of these assets will be made easier thanks to EIP7208 . This will be achieved with the introduction of a specialized token standard designed to handle real-world assets (RWAs) on the Ethereum platform, thus solidifying the network's position as a top player in the world of decentralized finance.\n\nJoin the Ethereum Crypto community and have discussions with other crypto enthusiasts on the importance of having ERC-7208 on the Ethereum website."

        "content": "Investors in the DeFi project, CBDAO (BREE), are scratching their heads after it became evident that the people behind the project have vanished. The project\u2019s website, Telegram group, and Twitter handles are no longer online, with the total lost funds exceeding over $1 million in ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, the BREE token which had traded as high as $50 in early September was trading at a $0.43 price, representing a 99.1% decrease from that all-time high.\n\nCBDAO exit scam\n\nAccording to information from its now-deleted website, CBDAO dubbed the \u201cUltimate DAO sandbox\u201d was a DeFi project that promised investors up to 30% APR. BREE tokens can be earned via farming and staking, with the project aiming to deliver a Governance as a Service (GaaS) solution that allows new decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to bootstrap their governance processes.\n\nAs per a detailed Medium post by a supposed investor, \u201cthe team had been developing the project and meeting deadlines,\u201d and even \u201cpushed a new website the night before the attack.\u201d\n\nThe team had announced a token swap for users to swap BREE tokens for Synthetic Bree (SBREE) tokens, and it was a backdoor on the newest token contract that the attacker exploited. They minted 50,000 SBREE, converted to BREE, and dumped onto the open market in fourteen separate transactions for roughly $60,000. That was in ETH addition to the roughly $1 million that the project initially raised, leaving investors bewildered about why the paltry sum was the last act of the exit scam.\n\nWill the identity of CBDAO founders be uncovered?\n\nWith the project existing for as long as two months, investors claim to have uncovered the identity of some of its founders and have already reached out to law enforcement agencies. Other crypto exchanges that reportedly did business with the CBDAO team, including Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex (listed SBREE), Somish Labs, and Etherscan (advertiser), have been contacted.\n\nMeanwhile, angry investors who lost thousands of dollars to the CBDAO exit scam created a Telegram group vowing to uncover the identity of the project\u2019s founders.\n\nSee Also: Degen DeFi User Farming UniCats tokens Ends up Losing $140,000 UNI tokens to Exploit"
