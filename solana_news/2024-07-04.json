        "content": "Lookonchain found that Ethereum earns over $2.7 billion in fees per year \u2014 more than twice the amount of fees generated by Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum earns the highest one-year fee revenue of the top ten blockchains by a large margin, according to a a new analysis from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain.\n\nLookonchain found that Ethereum earns the highest fee revenue of $2.7 billion per year, while Bitcoin comes in second with a yearly fee revenue of $1.3 billion and Tron comes in third with a fee revenue of $459.3 million.\n\nOther layer one blockchains took the next spots on the list, with Solana earning $241.2 million in fees each year, BSC earning $176.5 million and Avalanche earning $68.8 million in fees.\n\nLayer 2 networks zkSync Era and Optimism earned $59.7 million and $40.4 million in fees respectively, while Polygon took the last spot on the list with $23.9 million in yearly fees.\n\nDespite Ethereum dominating in fee revenue, it\u2019s also notorious for having sky high average gas prices. However, the average gas fee on the network is currently at one of its lowest levels in years.\n\nAt the time of writing, data from Etherscan shows that the average transaction on Ethereum costs around 5 gwei or just $0.27. The uptick in use of layer 2 scaling solutions and the impact of the Dencun upgrade may be some of the reasons driving gas prices lower, as activity across decentralized applications (Dapps) has been on the rise.\n\nData from DappRadar shows that volume across Ethereum-based Dapps surged 300% over the last week to $71.8 billion."

Since the beginning of this week, the world's largest digital asset has slumped 9.5%, nearly 21% down from its all-time high clocked earlier this year.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, also crashed to a six-week low, erasing all the gains made since the hype of spot ETF approvals in mid-May.\n\nThe sell-offs were precipitated by the movement of 47,228 Bitcoin, worth $2.7 billion, by defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox from a cold wallet to a new wallet, possibly in preparation for payouts to its creditors.\n\nThe slump forced the largest wave of liquidations since mid-April, as $541.45 million in future contracts was wiped out in the last 24 hours.

The events include the trading start of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US, the Uniswap V4 release, and Cardano\u2019s Chang hard fork.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is expected to launch this quarter, potentially attracting institutional investors. Analysts at IntoTheBlock predict ETH ETF inflows could reach 30% of those seen during the Bitcoin ETF introduction, which saw $5 billion in net inflows over its first five months.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs reported by Crypto Briefing, asset management firm Bitwise\u2019s CIO predicted that Ethereum ETFs could attract $15 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by total value locked, plans to release its V4 version. This is the second development in crypto seen by IntoTheBlock analysts as a potential catalyst for prices in Q3.\n\nNotably, the V4 update introduces \u201chooks\u201d for customization, dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and time-weighted average market maker functionality.\n\nCurrent profitability of UNI holders. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nMoreover, Cardano aims to implement the Chang hard fork by the end of July, introducing decentralized, community-run governance. The Chang upgrade will proceed once 70% of stake pool operators have tested and updated their systems.\n\nThis is also a development in crypto that could boost prices in this quarter, the analysts pointed out.\n\nThese developments follow historical trends of catalysts boosting asset values. During the month leading up to Cardano\u2019s last hard fork in September 2021, ADA\u2019s price increased by 130%, rising from $1.35 to $3.10.\n\nThe On-chain Insights newsletter also mentions the application for a Solana ETF made by Bitcoin ETF issuers VanEck and 21Shares, further expanding institutional crypto access. Although it is unlikely to get approved in 2024, much less in Q3, this movement could boost investors\u2019 sentiment."

        "content": "Solana-based meme coins have significantly outperformed their Ethereum-based counterparts in 2024, yielding an average return of 8,469% as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 962%, per the \u201cCMC 2024 H1\u201d report.\n\nSolana-based meme coins Vs. Ethereum-based meme coins, Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs per the report, the explosive rallies of WIF and BONK on Solana have drawn significant attention and capital from other blockchains, creating a cycle of increased meme coin performance and investment. While meme coins exist across various blockchains, Solana and Ethereum lead in activity and trading volume.\n\nEthereum meme coins are more well-known because they were primarily introduced in 2023 or earlier. In contrast, most Solana meme currencies came onto the scene in late 2023 or early 2024, capitalizing on the surge in attention at the time.\n\nPolitical meme tokens have become a prominent subgenre inside the $57.7 billion meme currency market with a market valuation of $784 million. The MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin has increased in value by more than 5,100% this year due in large part to Trump\u2019s open endorsement of cryptocurrencies and his acceptance of cryptocurrency contributions for his campaign.\n\nThe exceptional performance of Solana-based meme coins underscores a growing shift in speculative investments within the crypto space. This trend is not only reshaping the dynamics between different blockchain ecosystems but also highlights the increasing integration of political narratives within the meme coin market.\n\nAs crypto becomes a significant topic for the upcoming November US elections, political meme coins are expected to continue attracting speculative interest, further driving their market activity and value."

        "content": "Hong Kong could launch Ethereum staking ETFs within the next six months.\n\nOther crypto products, like a Uniswap ETF or Chainlink ETF, may follow.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched in April have been warmly received by Hong Kong\u2019s financial sector.\n\nEthereum staking exchange-traded funds are coming to Hong Kong \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Vivien Wong, partner at HashKey Capital, a crypto asset management firm that played a vital role in getting Hong Kong\u2019s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs off the ground.\n\n\u201cAs soon as spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the US, people ran to us asking, \u2018are you planning to launch an Ether staking product?\u2019\u201d Wong told DL News.\n\nShe said regulators, like Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, were talking with the industry.\n\n\u201cLast month, I sent a message to regulators to say there was a need for Ether staking,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWithout hesitating, they said \u2018okay, please send a detailed proposal.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe timing of her comments is notable.\n\nNine spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch in the US any day now, as soon as the Securities and Exchange Commission finalises applications.\n\nStaking Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum is designed so users can choose to lock in their Ether holdings and earn a 3% yield on the asset \u2014 a process called staking.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhile spot Ethereum ETFs enable investors to easily get exposure to Ether through their brokerage accounts, they don\u2019t allow them to gain that extra yield.\n\nIn fact, in Hong Kong, holders of these ETF shares must pay a management fee that\u2019s anywhere between 0.3% and 0.99%, depending on the fund they choose.\n\n\u201cFor a new Ethereum product to launch, it will probably require another six months or so,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWaiting for the mainland\n\nHong Kong is so keen to offer products that don\u2019t yet exist in the US, because the government wants the city to become a fintech powerhouse, according to Wong.\n\nAnd the process is running \u201cpretty smoothly,\u201d she said.\n\nAlready, the existing crypto ETFs are attracting two types of investors: People who simply want to \u201cbuy and hold,\u201d and crypto natives, Wong said. Crypto natives, in particular, have been enticed by the ETF design.\n\nThe funds\u2019 timely creation and redemption process allows investors to use them for over-the-counter trading purposes, according to Wong.\n\nBut by taking the lead and offering advanced products, the hope is for Hong Kong to draw in investors from other jurisdictions \u2014 and even, eventually, from the mainland.\n\nMainland investors cannot currently invest in these products. But hopefully, if the regulatory situation changes, \u201cthere will be more endorsements from investors in China and we will see more inflows,\u201d Wong said.\n\n\u201dWe are waiting for that to open up this market,\u201d she added.\n\nMassive success\n\nHong Kong\u2019s crypto ETFs have hauled in almost $260 million in assets since they launched in April, per The Block data.\n\nCompared to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US \u2014 which have brought in $14.6 billion since January 11 \u2014 that might feel small.\n\nBut considering that Hong Kong\u2019s ETF market is 168 times smaller than its US counterpart, the products have been a massive success. \u201cThere is definitely excitement,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWhether its financial institutions, wealth managers, distributors, or high net-worth individuals, the entire Hong Kong market is slowly digesting the products and becoming more comfortable with them, she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a guaranteed win.\n\nOpinion about crypto had soured in the region after some of the scandals from the last bear market \u2014 notably the fraud case surrounding Hong Kong crypto exchange JPEX.\n\nUniswap ETF?\n\nWong said that other cryptocurrencies will possibly have their own ETFs someday, but none of the choices are obvious, she said.\n\nFor Hong Kong regulators to approve new crypto ETFs, the underlying token must be publicly tradable through registered virtual asset trading platforms.\n\nAnd it must be very liquid, meaning that it must be easy for deep-pocketed market participants to trade.\n\nHaving a robust use case doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n\u201dERC-20 tokens would be generally preferred,\u201d Wong said, referring to tokens issued on the Ethereum network. \u201cSome names like Chainlink or Uniswap.\u201d\n\nAnd a Solana ETF might be in the cards as well.\n\n\u201cWe are talking with the SFC right now,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe are getting on with launching new products.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The piece was modified to clarify that investors from mainland China will only be able to invest in the ETFs when Chinese regulation allows it.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs expected to begin trading in July after Bitwise files amended S-1 ahead of due date.\n\nEthereum ETFs could flip analysts' expectations if investors buy into ETH's Nvidia-like high-growth tech play narrative.\n\nEthereum derivatives data reveals investors are becoming more risk averse following Mt. Gox headwind on horizon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 3% on Wednesday following Bitwise filing an updated S-1 draft and a wider market downturn with potential Mt. Gox BTC supply flooding the market. Despite the general market lull, investors may gain consolation from Bitwise prediction that Ethereum ETFs could outperform analysts' expectations if positioned as a high-growth tech play similar to Nvidia.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Could Ethereum be the next Nvidia?\n\nAsset manager Bitwise filed its amended S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today ahead of its July 8 due date. The new filing added a fee waiver for up to $500 million in assets under management, similar to Van Eck's waiver last week.\n\nConsidering the comments on these drafts were light, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said spot ETH ETFs should have begun trading and expects them to launch before the end of July.\n\nThe SEC approved spot ETH ETF issuers' 19b-4 filings in May but also needs to greenlight their S-1 registration statements before the products can begin trading.\n\nAccording to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum ETFs could be more successful than earlier predicted if investors buy into the narrative that Ethereum is a high-growth tech play similar to Meta and Nvidia. Hougan had earlier predicted that spot ETH ETFs could attract up to $15 billion in net flows before the end of 2025.\n\n\"It's pretty easy for me to imagine investors selling a small amount of their tech exposure and adding ETH. I'd argue it's easier than imagining investors carving out an entirely separate portfolio sleeve for a new monetary asset,\" Hougan noted.\n\nHowever, people need to buy into the idea that \"Ethereum is a technology investment\" for this to happen. Hougan noted that a clear understanding of how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin and the growth of applications on its network would help strengthen the \u201chigh-growth tech play\u201d narrative.\n\n\"What might that look like? Imagine stablecoins going from $160 billion to $1.6 trillion in assets as more people embrace the speed and transparency of blockchain-enabled payments. Or consider decentralized finance applications opening up new avenues for lending and borrowing with the onset of regulatory clarity. Or imagine more firms following BlackRock's lead and building tokenized funds on the Ethereum platform,\" said Hougan.\n\nMeanwhile, Lookonchain revealed in a recent analysis that Ethereum ranks number one among blockchain networks in terms of yearly revenue. Ethereum's revenue is at $2.728 billion per year, with Bitcoin coming behind at $1.302 billion. Increased revenue often indicates high user activity in a blockchain network, which helps estimate bullish sentiment.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum traders are skeptical with Mt. Gox headwind in sight\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,307, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. ETH breached the $3,367 support level, pouring cold water on hopes of a potential rebound. ETH liquidations reached $44.33 million, equalling that of BTC in the past 24 hours despite having a lower market cap. Long liquidations accounted for 87% of ETH's total liquidations, with shorts at 13%.\n\nEthereum options open interest has declined by 57% since its spike following the SEC's approval of 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. As of May 24, ETH options OI was at $13.44 billion. However, following the expiry of May and June options, most investors have failed to open new positions as indicated in the chart below.\n\nETH options OI\n\nETH options OI is now at $5.69 billion, its lowest level since September. The decreasing options OI accompanied by ETH's price decline suggests option traders are more risk-averse. Two possible reasons for the uncertainty among traders include:\n\nSEC's delay in greenlighting prospective spot ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts.\n\nPrevailing wider market bearish sentiment from Mt. Gox BTC supply.\n\nThe ETH Long/Short ratio also provides insights into traders' sentiment in the past week. The ratio's 7-day average is at 0.946, indicating the futures market is tilted toward the downside.\n\nAs a result, ETH may sustain a horizontal movement in the coming weeks until the SEC approves issuers' S-1 drafts for spot ETH ETFs to begin trading.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nA breach of the $3,203 support could strengthen bearish sentiment and send ETH back to the $2,850 to $3,029 range."

The move increased the prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market as altcoins, led by Ethereum, suffered significant declines.\n\nWhile many expected ETH to be less affected by the wider market sentiment due to the upcoming spot ETH ETF launch, the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) slow move to greenlight issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts likely gave bears the momentum.\n\nThe SEC approved the 19b-4 forms of spot ETH ETF issuers on May 23 but needs to greenlight their S-1s before the products can begin trading. The prospective issuers include VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Invesco.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) switched from trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV) to a premium of about 0.31% on July 3, according to data from YCharts.\n\nA trust trading at a discount or premium to net asset value means one share of the trust trades below or above the market price of the underlying asset it tracks.\n\nETHE Discount or Premium to NAV\n\nETHE has been trading at a discount because investors must sell their shares to exit their positions, as the trust doesn't allow them to redeem it for cash. The discount particularly increased between March and May after rumors of the SEC's Ethereum 2.0 investigation.\n\nHowever, the gap has closed and is now at a premium as investors bought the discounted shares heavily following the SEC's approval of prospective issuers' 19b-4 filings. The $9.5 billion ETHE trust will convert to an ETF when spot ETH ETFs go live.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum may begin consolidation\n\nEthereum is trading around $2,984 on Friday, down nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. The further decline from Thursday's lows sparked historic liquidations for ETH, wiping off $134 million of open positions from the market. Long liquidations climbed to $108.4 million, while shorts were shy of $26 million.\n\nETH's price has reached the lows of May, when most investors expected a spot ETH ETF denial following reports that the SEC was investigating Ethereum 2.0. ETH broke below the $2,852 key support level but quickly posted a weak exhaustion liquidity void, considering this represents a key demand zone for the top altcoin.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nETH has failed to sustain an extended move below this support level since mid-February. Additionally, IntoTheBlock's data reveals investors purchased about 57.02 million ETH around the $2,268 to $2,909 price range.\n\nConsidering these factors, ETH may not sustain an extended decline below the $2,852 support as the weekend approaches. ETH will likely begin a horizontal trend around the $2,852 to $3,367 price range, where it traded for nearly five weeks (April 12 - May 19)."

        "content": "Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has lost almost $800 million in the last three days. BTC is now below $60,000, representing a drop of 4.2%. Ethereum ETH is trading at $2,933, a loss of 6.56% over the last 24 hours. This drop is likely attributed to the massive German sell-off and Mt. Gox saga.\n\nAccording to a report, the German government has sold about $434.9 million worth of BTC since June 19. Unfortunately, this move brought negative sentiment in the market. Can ETH\u2019s price bounce back amid this declining market?\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Action\n\nETH\u2019s price tried multiple times to break above $3,900 but failed as strong bearish momentum pushed it lower. On July 4, ETH hit a strong support level at $2,800, representing a 28.2% drop from the $3,900 level.\n\nCurrently, ETH is recovering slowly, trading above $2,900. However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish. Analysts warn that this recovery might be short-lived, and the bearish trend could continue, pushing ETH lower again.\n\nBased on that, the $2,800 level will be crucial in determining ETH\u2019s next move. If this support breaks, we could see further drops. On the other hand, a strong bounce could signal a trend reversal.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signal Bearish Market\n\nETH\u2019s technical indicators are predominantly bearish. The 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) hover above the current market price. This positioning typically signals a strong downtrend, as the price is trading below the key long-term averages.\n\nAlso, the Price Volume Trend (PVT) indicator sits at 88K, suggesting decreasing buying pressure. This metric contributes to the downward price movement.\n\nFurthermore, ETH\u2019s price is trading below the Bollinger Bands, indicating that the downward trend is strong and may continue.\n\nAlso, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line, while the histogram bars display red candles. This typically signals ongoing selling pressure and reinforces the bearish outlook.\n\nThe SuperTrend indicator is flashing a sell signal, suggesting that the current downtrend may persist in the near term.\n\nLastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 27, indicating oversold conditions. While this might suggest a potential bounce, note that assets can remain oversold for extended periods.\n\nGiven this overwhelmingly bearish technical analysis, investors might consider waiting for clear reversal signals before entering long positions. Also, remember that markets can change rapidly at any time.\n\nPeter Schiff Predicts Ethereum Crash to $1,500\n\nEarlier today, renowned economist Peter Schiff predicted that Ethereum could crash to $1,500 based on market factors and technical analysis. Schiff sees Ethereum breaking crucial support regions, which usually signals a further decline in price as the buying strength is low.\n\n#Ethereum is also breaking key support. It\u2019s trading below $2,900, down 30% from its March high. I think a crash down to $1,500 is coming. It looks like those buying the #Ether ETF rumors couldn\u2019t wait for the fact to sell. pic.twitter.com/XXEyX67BXK \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 5, 2024\n\nMoreover, Schiff believes the anticipated Ethereum ETF launch is overhyped. Schiff claims the ETH ETF hype will ultimately fail soon. According to him, investors are selling off their positions since the price didn\u2019t go as expected.\n\nUnfortunately, Schiff\u2019s $1,500 prediction may create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors as they worry about the market\u2019s future. The crypto market is not doing well right now. Most cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, are losing value.\n\nEven if the U.S. SEC approves ETH ETFs, people might react differently to them because the market is already struggling. So, to be on the safe side, it is best to wait for the market to cool off before investing with proper risk management techniques in place.\n\nSecondly, while the broader crypto market is down, investors can consider a new memecoin on presale, which offers an opportunity to buy low and sell high.\n\nWienerAI: A Promising Alternative to Ethereum in a Bearish Market\n\nThe new project called WienerAI is gaining attention and has raised over $7 million in its presale. WienerAI combines humor with advanced technology. It offers an AI-powered trading bot on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis bot helps users make better trading decisions and protects them from front-running bots. The project has an interesting story involving a mix of AI and a dog.\n\nAdditionally, WienerAI focuses on building a strong community called \u201cThe Sausage Army.\u201d WienerAI offers high staking rewards, and holders of WAI tokens can earn substantial returns.\n\nFurthermore, the project has solid tokenomics with a clear allocation plan. Crypto influencers are already talking about WienerAI\u2019s potential, highlighting its innovative features and engaging branding.\n\nAs a result, more investors are showing interest in the project.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s Advantages in the Current Market\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles, WienerAI\u2019s presale is thriving. It has already raised over $7 million. This shows strong investor confidence in the project.\n\nThe team behind WienerAI has a clear roadmap. They plan to list the token on major exchanges soon, which could increase its visibility and value.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s AI-powered trading tool sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies. It promises to enhance trading efficiency and accuracy. This feature could attract traders looking for an edge in the market.\n\nAnother advantage is the project\u2019s community-centric approach. It fosters engagement and loyalty among its users, which could lead to long-term support and growth.\n\nAnalysts believe WienerAI has the potential for a 100X return on investment, making it an attractive option for investors seeking high rewards.\n\nIf you want to join a new crypto project while it is still affordable, rush to the presale page now and grab as many coins as possible.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Forecast: The intense selling pressure impacting most cryptocurrencies has been caused by various factors including the German Government\u2019s Bitcoin selling spree and a colossal transfer of BTC to exchanges by Mt. Gox, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nInvestors appear worried as a major correction paints price charts in the cryptocurrency market red in July. Collectively, the market has in the last few months tumbled to $2 trillion from $2.8 trillion\u2014a milestone achieved in March.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLike most cryptos, Ethereum could not withstand the increasing pressure on the sell side. The second-largest digital asset extended the correction below the critical $3,000 level.\n\nEther is down 7% to $2,940 on Friday in addition to 16.5% in the last seven days, CoinGecko data shows. Nonetheless, the trading volume has surged by almost 60% to $30 billion, underlining a dramatic increase in selling activity.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Is the Dip a Buying Opportunity or Trap?\n\nDespite the upcoming approval of Ethereum ETFs, bearish sentiment continues to swell. Investors thought the up rally to $3,975 in June marketed the beginning of a long-term bull run but it has in the last few weeks proved to be a trap.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing individual Ether ETF applications ahead of the live trading. However, headwinds in the market are leaving no stone unturned while turning crypto portfolios upside down.\n\nWhile the actual trading of Ethereum ETFs would be a game changer, especially for altcoins eyeing a similar milestone, the ongoing dip has many worried about how far it can go.\n\nBased on the Ethereum price prediction, the token of the smart contracts now holds below all three key Exponential Moving Average (EMAs) including the 20-day, the 50-day, and the 100-day.\n\nChances are that the downtrend will continue into the weekend, considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) persistent drop.\n\nShould sellers intensify their activities, Ethereum might breach a previously tested support at $2,800, highlighted in black on the chart. Such a move could further destabilize ETH price thus accentuating the sell-off to $2,500.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) an indicator that tracks the flow of money in and out of Ethereum markets, shows signs of bottoming out above the oversold region.\n\nIf selling pressure equalizes buying pressure, ETH will start to move sideways, giving recovery a chance in the coming days.\n\nA potential double-bottom pattern from support at $2,800 could also influence the trend reversal. The last time Ethereum price tested this support area, a major upswing erupted to $3,975.\n\nIn the short term, traders can watch out for the reclamation of support at $3,000 where, ETH could consolidate awaiting the next catalyst, possibly the spot ETF approval to ignite a major rebound past $4,000.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is the Ethereum blockchain the same as Bitcoin? Although they are both cryptocurrencies, ETH and BTC do not share the same blockchain technology. Ethereum is a proof-of-stake protocol while BTC is a proof-of-work network. 2. Can Ethereum topple Bitcoin to become the biggest crypto? Possibly, but considering Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the market, this achievement would take a long time. 3. When will Ethereum ETFs start trading? ETH ETFs could start trading 3 days after the final S-1 filings. This is projected to be around mid-July.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "In the first quarter of the year, Solana-based meme coins have emerged as the frontrunners, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s meme coin ecosystem and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, according to a recent report by market data platform CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis shift in popularity signifies a change in dynamics within the cryptocurrency market, with meme coins gaining traction and challenging previously dominant narratives such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana Ecosystem Dominates Growth Chart\n\nThe CoinMarketCap report highlights that the Solana ecosystem has consistently topped the growth chart for the past eight months, with over 20 new tokens introduced in Q2 alone.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem followed closely behind with 14 new tokens, while Derivatives and Stablecoins witnessed relatively lesser growth with 5 and 4 new tokens, respectively. This surge in Solana-based token offerings indicates a growing interest in the network and its potential.\n\nSolana\u2019s meme coin ecosystem, in particular, has gained significant momentum in price performance and popularity since October 2023. Although Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain, Solana\u2019s growing prominence suggests a noteworthy trend in the crypto space.\n\nInterestingly, SOL memes have significantly outperformed ETH memes, delivering an average return of 8,469% compared to 962% for Ethereum, as seen in the chart below.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nAs \u201cspeculative capital\u201d from other chains rushed into Solana, attracted by the explosive rallies of tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), more meme coins experienced price surges, attracting additional attention and capital.\n\nThe top winners in the meme coin space include the cat characters MEW, POPCAT, and Book of Meme (MEME). These tokens have outperformed even the most popular ones like WIF, BONK, Ethereum\u2019s Pepe coin (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNotably, political memes also emerged as a popular subcategory, with the leading MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin gaining over 5100% year-to-date, largely due to vocal support for crypto from former President Donald Trump and the acceptance of crypto for campaign donations.\n\nEthereum Tops Fee Income Rankings\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s significant gains, Ethereum continues to dominate the Layer 1 (L1) smart contracts market, representing 62.11% of the major L1s. The report notes that Ethereum\u2019s recent milestone was propelled by the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Solana have also gained traction, adding $42 billion and $18 billion to their market share among L1 networks. Solana currently leads with over 1.6 million active daily addresses, followed by BNB with 1 million active addresses.\n\nIn Q2, Ethereum experienced record low gas fees, reaching levels not seen since 2020 due to the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions and the market excitement surrounding Solana-based meme coins.\n\nDespite representing 62% of the market cap among major L1s, Ethereum accounted for 70% of the daily revenue, generating approximately $2.7 million. Solana ranked second with around $900,000 in daily revenue.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, Ethereum topped the fee income rankings in the past year with $2.728 billion, followed by Bitcoin with $1.302 billion.\n\nOther notable networks include Tron ($459.39 million), Solana ($241.29 million), Binance Smart Chain ($176.56 million), Avalanche ($68.83 million), zkSync Era ($59.77 million), Optimism ($40.4 million), and Polygon ($23.91 million).\n\nDespite both platforms experiencing success in various financial metrics and growth charts, Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, has significantly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s ETH token.\n\nAs of the current trading price, SOL is valued at $143.25, showcasing a year-to-date growth of 650%. ETH has seen a more modest surge of 68% during the same time frame, currently trading at $3,310.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ethereum developers have proposed an exciting update, EIP-7732, which aims to overhaul the block validation process and accelerate the blockchain. This proposal introduces significant changes designed to bolster security and performance by bifurcating the process into consensus and execution stages.\n\nIn response to the ever-growing demand for efficiency, EIP-7732 aligns with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s advocacy for quicker transaction confirmation times. At the heart of this proposal lies the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS), a groundbreaking method that splits block creation into two distinct roles: the consensus proposer and the execution proposer.\n\nImage Source: Farcaster (Vitalik Buterin exploring methods to enhance the confirmation speed of Ethereum transactions)\n\nUnder this new system, the consensus proposer selects the execution proposer, who then commits to generating a valid block pack or a block hash. Ensuring this block\u2019s timely submission is a dedicated group of validators known as the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC).\n\nBy segregating the consensus and execution layers, EIP-7732 aims to alleviate the computational burden on validators, thereby enhancing network efficiency and speed. Presently, validators juggle both roles in rapid succession, a process filled with potential inefficiencies and delays.\n\nEPBS promises a solution by allowing validators to immediately handle consensus and defer execution validation, all without compromising performance or security.\n\nMoreover, this proposal introduces a trust-free exchange mechanism between builders and proposers. This guarantees payment and the inclusion of valid blocks, eliminating the need for intermediary middleware. As Buterin emphasized in a recent post, \u201cOne of the important properties of a good blockchain user experience is fast transaction confirmation times.\u201d\n\nThanks to the transaction fee overhaul of EIP-1559 and consistent block times post-merge, Ethereum\u2019s transaction confirmation now ranges between five and twenty seconds. While this matches the speed of credit card transactions, certain applications demand even faster processing, far outpacing the current 12-second Gasper consensus mechanism.\n\nWith EIP-7732 under discussion, the promise of swifter transaction speeds seems within reach. However, this advancement may come with the necessity of another hard fork, introducing backward-incompatible changes."

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the second cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved in the US.\n\nLaunched in 2015 with the vision of being a \u201cworld computer\u201d, Ethereum has gained interest from tech enthusiasts and investors alike, growing to a market cap of $350bn.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a type of investment that tracks a particular index, sector, or commodity that can be traded on a stock exchange like a regular stock. ETFs make it easier to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. By investing through an ETF, investors avoid the complexities of holding crypto; like securing private keys or dealing with disreputable cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe approval of a second cryptocurrency ETF in the US signals greater acceptance of the asset class and increasing regulatory clarity. Greater access combined with increasing regulatory clarity is likely to drive an increased demand for Ethereum.\n\nThe chart above shows the subsequent price rise of gold following the listing of the first gold ETF in March 2003. When gold ETFs were introduced, they provided an accessible and cost-effective way to invest in gold compared to buying physical gold.\n\nWhy were Ethereum ETFs approved?\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs by the US SEC on May 23 2024, was unexpected, with many market analysts anticipating a rejection.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

However, the precedent set by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January was likely a key deciding factor in the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nOff to a bad start: Listings of the Ethereum ETFs are delayed\n\nDespite the approval, the listing of Ethereum ETFs has faced delays. This delay is unusual, as ETFs typically start trading immediately after approval, as was the case for the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January. Pending SEC approval of S-1 forms, trading is expected to begin mid-to-late July, although an exact timeline is uncertain.\n\nThese delays have tempered investor excitement and highlighted the ongoing challenges with crypto regulation. When trading does begin, the Ethereum ETFs will be welcomed into a cryptocurrency market experiencing a summer lull. Both Ethereum and the wider cryptocurrency market are down 30% since their highs in the first quarter.\n\nWhat we can expect when Ethereum ETFs are listed\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which exceeded expectations. On the first day of trading, the ETFs saw $4.6bn in trading volume and have since amassed a combined $76bn of assets under management.\n\nHowever, the success of the Ethereum ETFs is not a foregone conclusion. The mood of the cryptocurrency market is very different now from what it was in January, and while Bitcoin and Ethereum share similarities, they are also very different assets. With a fixed limited supply, Bitcoin is viewed as digital gold, whereas Ethereum, with a more technically ambitious goal of \u201cworld computer\u201d, is often likened to digital oil.\n\nMore Crypto ETFs to come\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems.\n\nWhile delays and regulatory challenges persist, the Ethereum ETFs are likely not the last cryptocurrency ETFs the SEC will approve. Indeed 21Shares, issuer of the fourth largest Bitcoin ETF, has already filed an application with the SEC for a Solana ETF."

        "title": "A conversation with Jerome de Tychey, President of Ethereum France, and Bettina Boon Falleur, Head of EthCC - DLNews",
        "content": "What are the long-term goals of Ethereum France, and how do you see the organisation evolving over the next five years given how quickly narratives and themes change in crypto?\n\nJdT: The long-term goal of Ethereum France has always been to educate the public about blockchain technologies, particularly Ethereum. Over the next five years, we aim to expand our presence in French-speaking regions, reaching as many people as possible to help them understand the transformative potential of this technology.\n\nCrypto themes and narratives change quickly, and we aim to be adaptable and responsive to the industry\u2019s evolution. We\u2019re also seeking to maintain momentum and motivation within our nonprofit organisation, so we have been recruiting for the past two years to bolster operations and ensure sustainable long-term growth.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most promising use cases for Ethereum in the next decade? How is Ethereum France positioning itself to capitalise on these emerging opportunities?\n\nJdt: The scaling roadmap of Ethereum has already delivered cheap blockspace for new applications. In my opinion, the main waves of blockchain adoption are going to be gaming and social networks. These themes first emerged at EthCC, and we closely monitor their progress to inform the design of our conference tracks.\n\nA core focus at Ethereum France is to encourage the development of these emerging use cases, and to nurture the growth in interest and talent entering the blockchain space. We host monthly meetups where builders can showcase their latest developments and make information accessible to onboard newcomers into the space.\n\nEthCC has grown significantly since its inception. What are some of the key milestones and successes of EthCC over the years, and how has the conference evolved to meet the changing needs of the Ethereum community?\n\nBBF: EthCC has grown organically since its inception, evolving alongside Ethereum. Starting as a small gathering of enthusiasts, it now covers a broad range of themes and attracts a diverse range of industry professionals. We\u2019re proud of the influential speakers and key announcements made on our stage, reflecting the conference\u2019s importance in the industry.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow in its seventh edition, EthCC expects more than 6000 attendees and 360 speakers, including at the EthVC programme, which serves as a crucial connection between startups and investors. While we\u2019ve grown a lot in recent years, we maintain an open and welcoming atmosphere. We understand that the event is not just for engineers and developers anymore. Catering to all professionals, we have expanded our services to include networking zones and silent workspaces. We\u2019ve also added childcare services this year, acknowledging the growing number of parents in our community who want to fully participate in the conference.\n\nThe agenda of EthCC covers a wide range of topics within the Ethereum ecosystem. How do you curate the content and select speakers to ensure that the conference addresses the most pressing and innovative topics in the Ethereum space?\n\nBBF: Curating content and selecting speakers for EthCC is indeed a challenging task that keeps us on our toes. There\u2019s no magic formula; we spend the year closely monitoring industry trends to best understand what\u2019s happening in the Ethereum space. Given the fast-paced nature of Ethereum, making these decisions eight months in advance is challenging, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to predict everything flawlessly.\n\nWe encourage everyone to apply to EthCC, and each year we discover small projects and lesser-known researchers with valuable insights. We always try to balance well-known speakers and fresh voices. Importantly, we have a strict policy against accepting payments for speaking slots. While this complicates things\u2014especially when companies try to pressure us\u2014it ensures we maintain high-quality speakers. Our reviewers do an extraordinary job, thoroughly reading every application and making selections based on merit. They avoid choosing speakers solely based on fame or rejecting them due to obscurity, ensuring a comprehensive agenda across different tracks."

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum\u2019s price drop has breached critical support levels and fallen below the $3,000 mark as the crypto market collapses. Will the decline go further this weekend?\n\nWith a bullish close last Sunday and a 1.75% rise, the investors did not anticipate a crash this week. However, the release of the Mr. Gox Bitcoin payout has caused the crypto market to plummet to critical levels.\n\nThe massive payouts from the 2014 Mt. Gox security breach have increased supply pressure across the broader market. As a result, the crypto market experienced massive declines.\n\nAs buyers struggle to absorb the selling pressure, Ethereum (ETH), has fallen below the $3,000 mark. With this, Ethereum\u2019s price struggled to find support amidst the market crash. Despite HODLers\u2019 hopes for a quick recovery, ETH has fallen below the critical level. With a 16.42% drop this week, bearish patterns and signals still show on the Ethereum price chart.\n\nThe overpowering bears have initiated a decline with an evening star formation, aiming to restest the $3,460 range breakdown.\n\nOver the past four days, including a 6% intraday drop, ETH has broken below a long-standing support trendline, falling 16% in total. This decline has also affected major altcoins and meme coins like Solana, DOGE, and SHIB, which have each seen a drop of 15% or more this week.\n\nWith the increasing moment, the trendline breakout has pushed Ethereum (ETH) to its next support level at $2,875. Additionally, this decline has triggered a bearish phase in the MACD and signal lines, now below the zero lines.\n\nMeanwhile, a whale recently caused a massive stir in the crypto market by dumping 26,600 ETH valued at $82.5 million to repay debt on Aave, resulting in a 3.4% drop in Ethereum\u2019s price. Following this, the whale created a new walley and borrowed 80.9 million USDT from Aavve to purchase 26,235 ETH priced at $3,084.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2879, reflecting a 9.70% decrease in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Fri 05 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nA shockwave has shaken the world of crypto. In a matter of hours, Bitcoin plummeted by 8%, Ethereum tumbled by over 10%, and millions of dollars in long positions were liquidated. As traders try to understand the reasons behind this sudden downfall, concerns are growing over the significant movements of funds related to Mt. Gox, the defunct exchange platform.\n\nA Steep Dive for Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe crypto market was hit by a wave of $580 million in liquidations, a direct consequence of an 8% drop in Bitcoin and similar declines for Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Long transactions on BTC and Eth saw losses exceeding $380 million, with the largest single liquidation observed on Binance, where an Ethereum transaction worth $18.4 million was forcibly closed.\n\nThese massive liquidations result from highly leveraged positions that traders could not maintain in the face of sudden price drops. Data from Coinalyze shows that this situation led to one of the largest waves of liquidations of the year. Moreover, open interest, which measures the number of unsettled bets on futures contracts, fell by 12%, signaling a capital outflow from the market. This increased volatility reflects a sense of panic among investors, exacerbated by external factors such as the movements of funds related to Mt. Gox and government decisions influencing the market.\n\nMarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors all play critical roles in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Staying informed and agile is key for those involved in the market. Nickolas Hoog, VP of Marketing at BitMart\n\nThe Role of Mt. Gox and Other Trigger Factors\n\nIn anticipation of repayments to creditors, Mt. Gox transferred more than $2.7 billion in bitcoins to a new address. This move has sparked fears of increased selling pressure, amplifying the price drops.\n\nAt the same time, the German government\u2019s decision to liquidate a portion of its bitcoin holdings added a layer of uncertainty to the markets. Traders, already nervous about macroeconomic uncertainties and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, reacted by massively selling their positions. This massive liquidation caused significant losses for overleveraged positions, particularly on platforms like Binance, where an Ethereum/USDT transaction of nearly $19 million was liquidated.\n\nThis increased volatility and price drops have generated a sense of fear among investors, with the fear and greed index plunging to alarming levels. The outlook for the market remains uncertain in the short term, with analysts anticipating a challenging third quarter, marked by increased investor caution and persistent volatility.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "As Ethereum\u2019s price continues to trend lower, investors are wondering whether the bull market is over. Yet, there is still a key support level that can provide the staging grounds for a recovery.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been trending lower inside a large descending channel pattern. In the last few days, the market has failed to reclaim the $3,500 level, and it dropped lower following a bearish rejection.\n\nCurrently, a decline toward the $3,000 support level, which coincides with both the lower boundary of the channel and the 200-day moving average, could be expected.\n\nWhile this confluence of support elements makes $3,000 a strong support zone, if it gets broken down, things can get much worse very quickly.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe shows a clear picture of the price\u2019s rejection from the $3,500 resistance level. The $3,350 short-term support zone is also getting broken to the downside, making $3,000 a probable upcoming target for ETH.\n\net, investors should keep an eye on the RSI, as it has entered the oversold region, which could point to a potential recovery soon.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nTaker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nAnalyzing the futures market metrics for Ethereum can be a great complement to price analysis. This chart demonstrates one of the most useful futures market metrics, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio.\n\nIt measures whether the buyers or sellers are more aggressive in executing their orders on aggregate.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, following the rejection from the $4,000 level, a huge volume of market sell orders has been executed in the futures market, bringing the Taker Buy Sell Ratio to its lowest value in the past few months. This indicates that futures market traders believe the price will be dropping even lower in the short term."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Lost All 'ETF Gains,' Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Its Way to Add Zero, Solana (SOL) Reaches $135, Critical Support Activated - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market has reached \"pre-ETF rumor\" price levels, practically losing all their gains since May. Things are not looking good, and the only relatively positive thing we can see is the descending trading volume amid the price correction.\n\nEthereum's price rose initially as a result of the much-anticipated ETF news. It appears, though, that traders lack the conviction to keep the rally going despite the ETF announcement alone. Ethereum's current price of $3,205 is significantly below its recent highs, indicating that there was insufficient purchasing interest.\n\nThe absence of notable advancements in Ethereum's ecosystem this year is a major contributing factor to the lack of buying support on the market. There have not been any significant additions or innovations to the network that would increase its demand or utility.\n\nThis means that neither new investors nor existing ones are drawn to the Ethereum network and, as a result, usage and demand for it remain low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn uncertain future lies ahead for Ethereum according to the technical analysis, too. There is a bearish trend in the price as it has dropped below the 50 EMA and the 100 EMA critical support levels. The 200 EMA at $3,090 is the next important support level, and if the current trend holds, it may be tested soon.\n\nShiba Inu's disrupted plans\n\nBitcoin plummeting below $60,000 has clearly disrupted a lot of plans on the market. Not many expected the digital gold to drop down so badly in the last 24 hours, which greatly affected the performance of assets like Shiba Inu, which lost a substantial portion of their values.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is down a lot from its recent highs, trading at about $0.00001565. The asset has been steadily losing value, and the recent volatility on the market has made this trend worse. Key moving averages indicate additional bearish momentum, and the chart illustrates SHIB's difficulty finding support.\n\nIt is challenging for SHIB to regain its footing because of the resistance levels set by the 200 and 100 EMAs. The entire cryptocurrency market has been impacted by Bitcoins decline below $60,000. Since Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, its performance frequently influences other digital assets. Plunging panic sales have clearly affected altcoins such as Shiba Inu.\n\nShiba Inu has long displayed technical weakness. A bearish trend is indicated by the asset's recent trading below its major moving averages. An oversold state is indicated by the RSI at 27, but a recovery is difficult because there are not any significant support levels below the current price.\n\nInvestor caution has increased as the general outlook for the market has turned negative, according to various sentiment indicators. As a result of traders' reluctance to invest in a market that is declining, SHIB is under additional pressure.\n\nSolana goes down\n\nSolana went down with the rest of the cryptocurrency market, hitting a $135 price threshold, which is considered a critical support level as it coincides with the 200 EMA. The drop below it would be a long-term bearish signal that hints at the continuation of the bearish trend.\n\nThere is increasing pressure on Solana, which is currently trading at about $134. Traders' attention is focused on the 200 EMA at $131.29, which is a critical support level. A break below this mark would probably indicate the continuation of a bearish trend and might trigger additional drops.\n\nIn line with the bearish outlook, Solana has recently sold off and is now below its major moving averages, which include the 50 EMA at $147 and the 100 EMA at $144.\n\nBecause of Bitcoin's recent decline below $60,000, the sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency market as a whole has turned negative. Altcoins such as Solana are facing more pressure due to the wider market downturn. Bitcoin may push Solana down even more if it keeps having trouble.\n\nSolana is getting close to oversold territory. Although this might point to a possible rebound, technical indicators and the general mood of the market point to the possibility that any bounce would be fleeting unless conditions in the wider market improve. Solana may stabilize and possibly rise again if it can maintain its hold above the 200 EMA at around $130."

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum is selling off when writing, looking at the performance in the daily chart. Even though the uptrend remains, since gains of May 20 weren\u2019t wiped clean, there are cracks developing. These fissures are widening after ETH closed below $3,300 today, confirming yesterday\u2019s losses. If the dump continues, the probability of the coin crashing to as low as $3,000 would be elevated, denting sentiment.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is bearish, breaking below a critical support level. As things stand, Ethereum is down 5% in the last day and week. Since the coin is in red, there have been changes in trend; the coin is sliding on rising participation. Over the last day, the average trading volume rose to over $18 billion. This points to traders flowing in, possibly unloading.\n\nTraders and investors are monitoring the following Ethereum trending news:\n\nGTA 6, the popular video game, reports show that it will support other crypto assets apart from BTC , ETH, and USDT. The expansion of the number of coins accepted is a huge boost as far as adoption is concerned.\n\nCircle and Paxos are now regulated in the European Union, compliant with MiCA laws . Meanwhile, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale, one of the largest banks in France, is launching its stablecoins on Ethereum. More TradFi companies are choosing the first smart contracts platform over modern solutions like Solana.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nETH/USD is under immense selling pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart.\n\nWith the drop of July 3 and early today, every high below $3,300 could offer entries for aggressive sellers targeting $3,000 in the short term.\n\nSince the drop was comprehensive, the probability of ETH sliding below $3,000 to as low as $2,800 remains elevated.\n\nNotice that the gains of May 20 are yet to be completely erased, giving hope to optimistic Ethereum buyers.\n\nIf ETH unexpectedly picks up momentum, winding up recent gains, and breaks $3,500, it would be a huge boost for bulls."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nINTMAX, a new-gen Ethereum ZK rollup with a stateless architecture, is calling on blockchain developers and privacy proponents to submit their ideas for rewarding users who contribute to privacy on its network. The blockchain team is also a partner and sponsor of the most anticipated EVM ecosystem event in Q3, 2024.\n\nINTMAX L2 calls for privacy-centric rewards tool ideas\n\nINTMAX, a key sponsor and supporter of ETHGlobal Brussels 2024, and a cutting-edge Ethereum layer-2 zero-knowledge rollup, shares the details of its new initiative focused on enhancing privacy in the ecosystem. A $5,000 reward will be offered to an entity or individual who proposes a privacy-centric solution for rewarding network contributors.\n\n#Ethereum developers, solve privacy problems and get the prize! We\u2019re looking for ideas and implementations that reward privacy users (mining or airdrop). See you soon in Brussels \u270c\ufe0f https://t.co/PbWl08r6JM \u2014 INTMAX (@intmaxIO) June 25, 2024\n\nThe suggestions might cover both airdrop-based or mining-based reward models on INTMAX. Submitting just an idea is acceptable, but it must be compelling to outperform someone who has also implemented it. As noted in the documentation, rewarding users for privacy without duplication remains a challenging problem for credible and active networks in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy protocols such as INTMAX have a unique dynamic, wherein more participants in the network translates to greater privacy for every user. That is quite unlike most DeFi protocols, where having more users means greater competition for rewards.\n\nThe more participants there are in a privacy protocol contributing their funds and usage, the more privacy is afforded to everyone involved. This is a unique dynamic, where having more \"competitors\" actually benefits each individual user's privacy, unlike typical financial applications, where more users means more competition for rewards.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of more users makes it possible for malicious actors to exploit loopholes and obtain lucrative rewards without actually contributing to the privacy of the network. To ensure the integrity of privacy networks and properly incentivize users, it is necessary to close these loopholes.\n\nEnhancing privacy for future token distributions on EVM\n\nThe INTMAX contest is one of several enticing prizes up for grabs at ETHGlobal Brussels, with a total prize pool of more than $450,000 on offer to developers who can stand out from the crowd at one of Europe\u2019s biggest annual hackathon events.\n\nTechnically, the contest invites developers to propose the safest and most resource-efficient implementation of the Quiz mechanism, or else develop a superior solution that solves the challenges of privacy rewards once and for all.\n\nDevelopers are not required to program the deposit and withdrawal process, or even provide any privacy guarantees but simply focus on designing the actual reward system."

        "content": "A significant Ethereum whale is on the brink of liquidation due to the ongoing decline in ETH prices. This whale has deposited 12,374 ETH to Compound and borrowed $31.4 million in stablecoins. If Ethereum\u2019s price drops to $2,984, the whale\u2019s long positions will be liquidated.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $3,124, down from the $3,500 zone earlier this week. This 10.42% decline since Monday has intensified concerns about the whale\u2019s potential liquidation. The situation worsened today with a 3.03% drop, followed by a marginal rise and another 3.09% decline.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin Prices Drop Sharply\n\nThe crypto market is seeing significant activity among large holders amid this price downturn. Another whale recently acquired 9,425 ETH worth over $30 million from Binance. This fresh wallet also purchased a variety of other cryptocurrencies, totaling $120 million in altcoins.\n\nAs the market declines, the whale who is long $ETH is on the verge of liquidation! He deposited 12,734 $ETH($40M) to #Compound and borrowed $31.4M stablecoins, with a health rate of only 1.06. When the price of $ETH drops to $2,984, he will be liquidated. Address:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lP9877HjCJ \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2024\n\nThis large acquisition includes BNB, MATIC, LINK, AVAX, and top meme coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Floki. The ETH purchase was the largest among these transactions. These moves are drawing attention as they occur during substantial market volatility.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price drop is closely following Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline. Bitcoin has been falling sharply since Monday, driven by sales from major players and miners. Analyst Charles Edwards noted that long-term Bitcoin holders are actively selling their BTC.\n\nGlassnode data shared by Edwards indicates a 374,000 Bitcoin negative flow. This translates to approximately $24 billion worth of Bitcoin being dumped on the market. Additionally, the U.S. and German governments have recently sold significant amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Whale Bags 90M Tokens Amid Market Crash, What\u2019s Next For DOGE?\n\nETH Price Drop Could Trigger Liquidations\n\nThe potential liquidation of a giant Ethereum whale could have broader market implications. If Ethereum\u2019s price falls to the critical $2,984 level, it may trigger further sell-offs. This could exacerbate the current downtrend and lead to more liquidations.\n\nThe ongoing selling pressure from Bitcoin is also affecting the overall market sentiment. As major holders and governments offload their assets, it creates additional downward pressure. Investors are closely watching these developments to gauge the market\u2019s next moves.\n\nMarket analysts are providing varied perspectives on the situation. Some believe the whale\u2019s liquidation risk underscores the fragility of highly leveraged positions. They argue that such scenarios highlight the importance of risk management in volatile markets.\n\nOthers are focusing on the broader market dynamics at play. They point to the influence of Bitcoin\u2019s performance on Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe broader crypto market bloodbath has triggered an unexpected race for survival among Ethereum (ETH) whale investors. According to insights from crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, amid the intensive price slump, many traders are about to face liquidations, as the ETH price falls to a 24-hour low of $2,839.82.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving against potential liquidation\n\nIn the trading world, the market dynamics are always notably different. One common trend is that traders generally borrow money with leverage, and price fluctuations often push these investors into losses or profits.\n\nIn line with these harsh market conditions, Lookonchain said three whales deposited 28,558 ETH worth approximately $82.2 million to Binance earlier today. This massive amount was used to repay the debts they owed.\n\nAs the price of $ETH drops, many whales are about to face the liquidation of $ETH deposited in #Aave and #Compound.\n\n\n\n3 whales deposited 28,558 $ETH($82.2M) to #Binance in the past 2 hours and sold to repay debt.https://t.co/4ynPQwessDhttps://t.co/ABzz0fceAt\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PNYtFvlnV1 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 5, 2024\n\nTraders are often unlucky as the market downturn might happen unexpectedly, giving little or no time for traders to react to save their capital. This trend was seen weeks ago when Curve Finance Founder Michael Egorov suffered one of the worst liquidations on the market this year.\n\nIn another Lookonchain post on X, a trader got caught up in the liquidation as he saw a total of 4,215 ETH worth approximately $12.2 million of his funds liquidated. However, this whale appears to have started repaying the debt.\n\nEthereum price outlook\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is undergoing a very intense sell-off, marked by the slump of the top ETH-based tokens. At the time of writing, the price of ETH itself is changing hands for $2,864.08, down by 9.09% in the past 24 hours.\n\nWith the ecosystem mega coin in a downtrend, major altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Chainlink (LINK) are down by 13.32% and 13.04% to $0.00001325 and $11.39, respectively.\n\nWhile the ecosystem appears strained, experts are optimistic that the coin is likely trading around its price fall, with a sustained rebound set to be recorded soon."

As crypto analysts speculate on Ethereum's ETF release, the price for Ethereum could experience a minor surge any day from now\n\nXRP Could Breakout In 2025 Despite Stagnating Price Action\n\nWhile the price action for XRP rose almost immediately to $0.82 following Ripple\u2019s partial victory in July 2023, the price for XRP has been relatively stable since then, fluctuating around $0.45 on the lower end and $0.55 on the higher end.\n\nXRP\u2019s price slightly recovered to $0.48 in July. XRP holders are still anticipating gains exceeding $1 in 2024. It's possible that XRP could undergo a massive rally next year, though XRP remains the most speculative coin in the top ten aside from Dogecoin.\n\nRollblock Set To Explode Later This Year\n\nRollblock (RBLK) is emerging as the first Play-to-Earn GambleFi token, seamlessly merging centralized and decentralized gaming.

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Sharp Decline As ETH Targets $3,051 Support Level - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a significant downturn, with its price rapidly approaching the crucial support level of $3,051. This sharp decline highlights increased selling pressure and growing bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nAs Ethereum nears this critical threshold, traders are closely monitoring its behavior for signs of either a stabilization or a further drop. The $3,051 support level is now a focal point, determining the short-term direction of Ethereum\u2019s price action and potentially setting the stage for future movements in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis article aims to analyze the sharp decline affecting the digital asset and its impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price as it approaches the $3,051 support level. It also seeks to provide traders and investors with a comprehensive understanding of the current situation, potential scenarios if the support level holds or breaks, and strategies for managing risk in this volatile environment.\n\nETH\u2019s price is currently trading at around $3,181 and down by 5.05% with a market capitalization of over $382 billion and a trading volume of over $18 billion as of the time of writing. In the past 24 hours, there has been a decrease of 5.25% in ETH\u2019s market capitalization and a 74.43% increase in trading volume.\n\nTechnical Indicators Pointing To A Decline For Ethereum\n\nA technical analysis of ETH\u2019s price action on the 4-hour chart reveals that the crypto asset is actively bearish and trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Ethereum has been consistently bearish since after breaching the $3,360 mark and is currently heading toward the $3,051 support level.\n\nAlso, an analytical view of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator shows that the price of ETH may continue its bearishness as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator have dropped below 50% and are attempting a move into the oversold zone.\n\nOn the 1-day chart, the crypto asset has made a sharp drop below the 100-day SMA and is attempting a break below the bullish trend line while dropping toward the $3,051 support level.\n\nFinally, on the 1-day chart, the composite trend oscillator indicates a further bearish move of ETH as the signal and the SMA of the indicator are both trending in the oversold zone.\n\nWhat If $3,051 Support Fails?\n\nAnalyzing potential outcomes if Ethereum breaks through the $3,051 support level reveals that if the digital asset breaks below this level, it may move lower to test the $2,865 support level and probably move on to test the $2,160 support level and other levels below if the price breaches this level.\n\nHowever, if the price of Ethereum faces rejection at the $3,051 support level, it will begin to ascend toward the $3,360 resistance level. Should the asset breach this level, it may continue to climb to test the $3,659 resistance level and possibly move on to test other higher levels if it breaches the $3,659 level.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Traadingview.com"

        "title": "Justin Sun Potential $66 Million Loss Revealed As Ethereum Price Declines - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Following a widespread crypto market crash on Friday, the price of Ethereum took a severe price hit falling by about 10%. While the prominent altcoin has made a minor recovery since then, its price slip has revealed some vital information on the holdings of Tron founder and key crypto figure Justin Sun.\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\nJustin Sun $66 Million Loss, Motive For Massive Bitcoin Buy Offer?\n\nAmidst the market mayhem on Friday, blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain shared an intriguing report on Justin Sun\u2019s investments in Ethereum. In an X post, Spot on Chain stated that Sun has allegedly acquired 361,000 ETH (worth $1.1 billion) over the last five months.\n\nThe Tron founder reportedly made this investment using three different wallet addresses purchasing 169,604 ETH with \u201c0x7a9\u201d in February at an average price of $2,870, 176,118 ETH with \u201c0x435\u201d in April at $3,177, and 15,416 ETH with \u201c0xdbf\u201d in June at $3,474.\n\n\n\nJustin Sun may have lost $66M after the #Ethereum price plummeted 10% today! From Feb to Jun, he allegedly bought 361K $ETH (est. cost: $1.1B) via 3 wallets, including:\n\n\u2013 169,604 $ETH via \u201c0x7a9\u201d in Feb at $2,870 avg\n\n\u2013 176,117 $ETH via \u201c0x435\u201d in Apr at $3,177 avg\n\n\u2013 15,416 $ETH\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bwIezvMRtj \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) July 5, 2024\n\nSpot on Chain noted that the aforementioned addresses always received ETH deposits from Binance following Sun\u2019s stablecoin deposits on the exchange thus leading to suspicions that the Tron founder served as owner of these wallets.\n\n\n\nFollowing the repayment of creditors by defunct exchange Mt. Gox, coupled with a consistent massive Bitcoin sell-off by the US and German governments, the price of Bitcoin has plummeted by 10% over the last two days falling as low as $53,717.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this decline soon extended across the crypto market, with Ethereum crashing by a similar percentage to trade at $2810, marking its lowest price in the last five months. At that point, Justin Sun\u2019s alleged ETH investments reached a $66 million loss.\n\nInterestingly, the Tron founder had reached out to the German government on Thursday to negotiate the sale of their remaining BTC holdings valued at $2.3 billion in a private transaction order. However, it remains unknown if the German government will take up this offer as Sun attempts to reduce the impact of their constant BTC sell-offs on his personal investments and the general crypto market.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum has shown resilience since its earlier slump rising by about 5% to currently trade at $2,975. In tandem, the token\u2019s daily trading volume is up by 47.33% and valued at $30.47 billion.\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnalyst Predicts Ethereum Nosedive, Cautions Investors To Prepare For $2,700 Target 2 months ago\n\nSolana, Others Record Market Gains Amidst Market Crash\n\nWhile the general cryptocurrency remains in a downtrend, with the total market cap down by 1.02%, several assets have managed to stay afloat providing investors with some form of relief. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is one of these assets, with a 4.99% daily gain alongside other prominent tokens such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu with respective gains of 3.99% and 3.70% respectively.\n\nNotably, prominent meme coin dogwifhat leads the resistance with the highest daily gain of 12.28%.\n\n\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from Tradingview"

        "content": "Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below $3,250 zone. ETH dived below the $3,000 support and even tested the $2,850 zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $3,120 and $3,000 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could correct losses, but upsides might be limited above the $3,120 zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dives 8%\n\nEthereum price failed to start a recovery wave above the $3,150 and $3,200 resistance levels. ETH started another decline below the $3,120 support zone like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $3,050 and $3,000 support levels.\n\nThe price declined 8% and even tested the $2,850 support. A low was formed at $2,862 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is showing a lot of bearish signs and trading well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 swing high to the $2,860 low.\n\nEthereum is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $2,960 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,000 level.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major hurdle is near the $3,120 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 swing high to the $2,860 low.\n\nA close above the $3,120 level might send Ether toward the $3,200 resistance. The next key resistance is near $3,250. An upside break above the $3,250 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,350 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $2,850. The first major support sits near the $2,800 zone.\n\nA clear move below the $2,800 support might push the price toward $2,720. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,850\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,000"
