        "title": "Is Ethereum once again the victim of its own success? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Ever since Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, an increasing number of users are getting in on the staking action to reap the rewards that come with it. Institutions are also paying attention, given the decrease in network risk and volatility following \u201cThe Merge.\u201d This has led to concerns about how much ETH is getting locked into staking contracts, potentially interfering with liquidity on the network.\n\nDevelopers are already proposing possible solutions to limit the rate of staking, which benefits overall network health but has now limited the opportunities for users to earn a yield from the network. Coupled with an ongoing DeFi winter, there just aren\u2019t as many lucrative returns opportunities in this space as there once were. Truth is, without profitable and reliable alternatives, ETH holders are going to continue to be drawn to staking as the best means of generating return on their assets.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum staking\n\nIt\u2019s been about a year since Ethereum successfully completed the Merge, in which the blockchain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, like Bitcoin, to a PoS one. This was done to significantly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum network and allowed users to earn a passive income by staking their ETH to secure the network. Ethereum 2.0 was born.\n\nOverall, this has been seen as a positive move for the Ethereum network. A significant number of users have staked their assets already, to the tune of 20% of all circulating Ether. In theory, this sounds great, as the idea is that a diverse array of users are both helping to ensure the security of the blockchain and are being rightly rewarded for doing so. The reality, however, is a bit different.\n\nThe rise of large staking providers have made it easier for virtually anyone to get involved, but this is causing the amount of ETH that is staked to continue to quickly rise. At the current trajectory, the amount of ETH locked up could balloon up to as much as 50% by May 2024 and even approach 100% by December next year, according to projections in an Ethereum Improvement Proposal co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Tim Beiko. While actually seeing the entire supply of Ethereum get locked up won\u2019t happen, this situation could still cause a significant liquidity crunch that limits the functionality of the blockchain ecosystem, decentralized apps, and services built on top of it.\n\nThis fiasco has led to Ethereum developers approving a new proposal that would control the rate at which new validators could stake ETH. Known as EIP-7514, this change will modify the \u201cchurn limit\u201d function to give it a maximum value that will regulate how many validators are able to join or exit the network within a given timeframe. The proposal is already being included in the Cancun-Deneb upgrade that was slated for this October but will likely now be delayed until early next year.\n\nWhile EIP-7514 will help to buy some time, it doesn\u2019t actually address the underlying problem. Namely, the fact that Ethereum staking, as is, incentivizes locking up funds over keeping them liquid. It\u2019s true that users don\u2019t have to stake Ethereum directly but can turn to other yield-bearing services. However, in the wake of FTX and other recent disasters, the entire DeFi market has seen an almost 80% contraction over the last year. This means there are fewer and less useful places for asset holders to earn yield.\n\nWhat alternatives need to offer\n\nUsers need a safe and lucrative alternative that has advantages to staking, even if the returns aren\u2019t quite at the level provided by staking. These could come in the form of yield-generating accounts that allow for returns on the Ethereum stored inside them, but don\u2019t have days or weeks-long limits on when funds are accessible. Because no staking is actually done, users stay in full control of their own assets.\n\nBetter still, accounts such as these could be significantly more user-friendly than the confusing, alienating process of Ethereum staking, holders would simply need to deposit their funds and sit on them. They could remove them at any time, and overall liquidity on the network is not affected. Users also wouldn\u2019t rely on the health of DeFi as a whole, and will generate returns regardless of what the market is doing.\n\nAnother essential aspect of these offerings is that they can also be \u201cring-fenced,\u201d meaning the assets are never intermingled with other user\u2019s funds or company activities and aren\u2019t exposed to broader systemic risk. Assets that are used for growth opportunities are separate from those that are just being held as savings. This is important for keeping users safe, as even if the service itself should collapse, all held funds will be completely intact.\n\nImplementing a service where anyone can grow savings without the need to lock up ETH is the ultimate key to solving the ongoing staking issue that is plaguing Ethereum. Protocol changes are helpful, but what is essential is changing the incentive that users have for earning yield on their assets. By providing growth opportunities that don\u2019t involve actual staking, these accounts can be simpler, safer and healthier for the whole ecosystem than centralized alternatives. The solution is obvious; now it\u2019s time to bring something like this to Ethereum holders worldwide."

        "content": "New research into the Ethereum blockchain looks at ways to use zk-SKNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) to enable private transactions using Solidity, the primary programming language on Ethereum.\n\nThis research is primarily focused on being able to enable privacy-enhancing functionality that is traditionally reserved for layer-2 networks built on top of the Ethereum application layer.\n\nAccording to Mirror Tang, co-founder of Salus Security and author of the research paper, enabling ZK functionality within Solidity may remove the need for layer-2 blockchains, such as zero-knowledge rollups.\n\n\u201cA lot of DeFi activity remains on Ethereum L-1, and less so on L-2s,\u201d Tang told Blockworks. \u201cIf we can use computational optimization to enable ZK technology on Solidity, we would be able to reduce gas fees on Ethereum itself significantly.\u201d\n\nThis may allow transaction activity to be concentrated on Ethereum rather than its disparate L-2 ecosystems, Tang explained.\n\nThere are existing technical barriers to introducing zk-SNARKs to Ethereum, however.\n\nFor example, Solidity is currently single-threaded in nature, meaning that it executes one transaction at a time. It will be important, therefore, to find ways to introduce multithreading to Ethereum.\n\nFurther, to enable zk-SNARKs to operate effectively and securely on the network, it will be necessary to ensure it is auditable.\n\nBy nature, ZK technology relies on provers to send accurate proofs to third-party verifiers without revealing the information of the statement, meaning there would be additional storage requirements at the verification stage.\n\nAbsent these barriers, Tang\u2019s research indicates Zk-SNARKs on Solidity could enhance privacy and improve MEV resistance by enabling private transactions and voting on existing Ethereum projects. Fast-tracking the verification process would enhance the performance of the blockchain as a whole.\n\nThis research, if pursued, would be entirely open-source, enabling further development and contribution by the Solidity community, Tang said.\n\nHe hopes that his research will be noticed by venture capitalists in the crypto community so that his team can continue working towards making its findings a reality.\n\nInterview with Tang was conducted in Mandarin.

        "content": "The number of daily active users on Solana overtook the Ethereum mainnet on Nov. 11 following a sharp uptick in activity.\n\nAccording to data to Artemix, Solana hosted 356,300 unique users on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s nearly 330,000 by 10%. The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.\n\nSolana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike\n\nThe milestone is the latest sign of Solana\u2019s recovery following last year\u2019s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.\n\nThe price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko. Active addresses on the network shrank 85% from 1.28M in May 2022 to around 200,000 this September, according to The Block.\n\nBut Solana refused to stay down, with the network outperforming the broader markets amid the recent cryptocurrency rally as evidenced by the recent surge in active addresses.\n\nThe price of SOL is up 145% in four weeks, beating out many rival digital assets by at least double. The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nThe move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2s\n\nWhile some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.\n\nAccording to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "title": "The Rise of Zero-Knowledge Rollups in Ethereum Scaling - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Zero-knowledge rollups are gaining momentum as the ultimate Ethereum scaling solution.\n\nThis year alone, no less than four major projects based on ZK rollups were launched, and four more are in the works. The technology has proven to be exceptionally fitting for the crypto space, and given the growing enthusiasm from venture capitalists, the ZK trend is here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a comprehensive overview of the current zk rollup landscape and its most prominent projects: zkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, Linea, and Scroll.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first: What are zk rollups, and why is everyone so excited about them?\n\nWhat are ZK rollups?\n\nThe ZK FOMO has a good reason behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method allows executing smart contract computations off the blockchain, rolling them up in batches, and then submitting these batches back to the main chain using zero-knowledge proofs to show that the computations happened within the rules of the EVM. Simply put, zk-rollups allow to outsource computation, all while leveraging the main chain\u2019s decentralization and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike their closest competitor, optimistic rollups, zk rollups offer quicker transaction finality time and better user privacy. Optimistic roll-ups take an \u201coptimistic\u201d stance, assuming that all layer-2 transactions are valid unless proven otherwise by an honest network validator. If the optimistic rollup batch faces no challenges during the dispute period, the transaction data is successfully added to the Ethereum main chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, ZK rollups count on cryptography: after all, math is always more reliable than humans. However, this comes with its own set of complications, such as high computation costs, as well as a more complex cryptographic and engineering network. Fortunately, the former can be solved with special hardware, such as FPGA or ASIC, and the latter \u2013 with quality engineering education, like the one provided by RareSkills.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, there is another hurdle associated with ZK rollups.\n\nEVM-compatibility vs performance\n\nEthereum was not designed to be ZK-friendly, and there are many parts of its protocol that take a large amount of computation to generate validity proofs. This means that building a functional zkEVM \u2013 a replica of the Ethereum Virtual Machine that uses zk-rollups \u2013 implies a major trade-off: EVM compatibility vs performance. There is a balance between these two qualities, and different zk rollup-based projects are trying different ways to find the perfect one.\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin formulated this dichotomy in 2022, drafting a chart with five types of protocols using zk-proofs, from the most compatible to the most performant.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach approach has its pros and cons, and several major projects are exploring them now.\n\nzkSync Era\n\nAccording to Vitalik\u2019s framework, this protocol corresponds to Type 4: high-language-equivalent.\n\nDeveloped by Matter Labs, zkSync Era went live in March 2023. Its current TPS (transaction per second) stands at 4.75, down from this summer\u2019s 9.9. However, according to the protocol\u2019s documentation, it can offer up to 2,000 TPS at peak load.\n\n\n\n\n\nZkSync uses its LLVM compiler to translate code from Solidity, Vyper, and Yul. A compiler adds a step in the coding process and increases the risks of bugs, but in exchange for this inconvenience, zkSync offers other perks. Not only does its custom VM generate zk-proofs fast, but it also implements native account abstraction, which allows programmable authorizations, enabling a greater diversity of wallet and protocol design.\n\n\n\n\n\nZkSync is among the most developed projects, coming with a Hardhat plugin, Web3 API parity, and a well-functioning L2-L1 messaging infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular zk rollup, zkZync Era, processes 22 million monthly transactions (source: L2Beat), ranking second only to Polygon PoS with its 75 million monthly transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarknet\n\nStarknet is a zk-rollup using a slightly different version of the cryptographic proof system. Unlike other popular protocols built on zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), it uses zk-STARKS (zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge). The main difference between the two is that the former uses elliptic curve pairings, while the latter relies on transparent post-quantum algebraic proofs, which generally makes zk-STARKs more efficient but also more computationally demanding. Zk-SNARKS are also being criticized for the trusted setup they require for the initial creation of keys. If the secret used to create the keys is not destroyed, this may introduce a security threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nZK-STARKs were discovered several years after ak-SNARKs, which were already used in the Zcash protocol. Hence, zk-SNARKs are considered more developed as a technology, with extensive developer libraries and numerous projects working on them. Starknet is a notable exception, adopting STARKs as a base for its protocol. The project also puts emphasis on Layer-3 development, providing a set of tools that can help build customizable \u201cApp Chains.\u201d\n\nStarknet Alpha went live in November 2022 and has since developed an important ecosystem, handling 13 million monthly transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Warp, a compiler from Solidity to its language Cairo, Starknet can also be considered as a Type 4 zkEVM.\n\nPolygon zkEVM\n\nThe famous Ethereum sidechain joined the zk race by releasing in March its own version of zkEVM as a separate blockchain (so far in Beta). It will be a part of Polygon 2.0, an ambitious vision of a network of zk-powered layer-2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\nZkProver, Polygon zkEVM\u2019s main component, follows the state machine model, which uses both STARK and SNARK methods. STARK is used to prove the transactions, and then a SNARK circuit is used to verify it, de facto submitting to Ethereum a proof of a proof. To achieve full compatibility, the Polygon team has come up with the concept of micro opcodes, or instructions that EVM will use to manipulate inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Polygon zkEVM is a Type 3 (almost EVM-equivalent), which will turn into Type 2 (fully EVM-equivalent) when all pre-compiled contracts are supported. It processes 1.1 million monthly transactions.\n\nLinea\n\nThis zk-proof solution was developed by none other than Consensys, the Godfather of all things Ethereum. Released in March 2023, Linea (Type 3 aiming for Type 2) strikes its own balance of speed and EVM compatibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinea uses lattice-based cryptography, known to be quantum-resistant, to efficiently generate zero-knowledge proofs, making for a faster prover time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinea aims for a full equivalence with Ethereum. It is able to execute an unaltered, native bytecode in accordance with the EVM specifications, thus reducing the risk of bugs and hacks. Developers can deploy and verify any smart contract with Truffle, Hardhat, or Foundry exactly as if they were building on Layer 1. Linea\u2019s developer-friendliness is enhanced by the native integrations of Consensys tools, such as MetaMask and Infura.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Alpha mainnet launched in August, Linea now handles 3.5 million monthly transactions.\n\nScroll\n\nThe most recent protocol to go live, Scroll, launched its mainnet in October 2023.\n\nThe project aims at fully mapping the Ethereum opcode to the zkEVM, which would allow Ethereum native smart contracts to be fully executed without modifying the bytecode. Currently, Scroll is still a Type 3 but aims to become Type 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched with a centralized sequencer and a centralized central approver, Scroll intends to decentralize over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other projects based on zk-proof are still in the works. This includes Taiko, a rare Type 1 (fully Ethereum-equivalent) rollup, as well as projects based on the Polygon\u2019s codebase, such as Immutable zkEVM, Canto, and Astar zkEVM."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade aims to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency within the Ethereum network, introducing the concept of proto-danksharding.\n\nDanksharding represents the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade that enhances data management and transaction processing.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade is designed to bring faster transaction processing times, reduced transaction costs, and optimized data management. Potential risks include impacts on existing smart contracts and the integration of new data storage techniques.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the introduction of sharding are vital components of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. PoS reduces energy consumption by replacing miners with validators, who are selected to create new blocks based on the amount of ETH they stake.\n\nMeanwhile, sharding increases transaction speed by partitioning the Ethereum network into smaller pieces (shards), with each capable of independently processing transactions and smart contracts. The shift from PoW to PoS enables secure and efficient sharding by randomly assigning validators to specific shards, preventing manipulation and enhancing performance.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade represents an important advancement in the Ethereum blockchain, aimed at fortifying the network's scalability, security, and overall efficiency. This upgrade introduces the concept of proto-danksharding, an important step toward optimizing data management and enhancing transaction affordability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging innovative data storage techniques, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade is poised to revolutionize the way the network processes transactions, paving the way for a more accessible and seamless user experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade (also known as the \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d upgrade) is a concerted effort by Ethereum to bolster its infrastructure and address unresolved issues after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is based on four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs): EIP-4844, EIP-1153, EIP-4788, and EIP-6780. Together, the implementation of these EIPs can provide many benefits, including improved scalability, enhanced data storage and availability, and reduced transaction costs.\n\nWith a primary focus on optimizing the execution layer (Layer 1), the Cancun upgrade prepares the network for the future implementation of full data sharding, a vital component in Ethereum's long-term development strategy.\n\nSharding refers to splitting a blockchain database into smaller portions, called shards, for higher efficiency, and the Cancun upgrade introduces a specific type of sharding known as proto-danksharding (discussed below).\n\nThe goal of the Cancun upgrade is to increase the network\u2019s transactions per second (TPS), aligning with Ethereum's roadmap's \"Surge\" phase, aiming to scale performance to 100,000+ TPS.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade \u2013 along with the subsequent Deneb upgrade \u2013 represents a significant milestone in Ethereum's journey towards establishing itself as a leading decentralized finance platform.\n\nDanksharding and Proto-Danksharding\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding are different iterations of the sharding technology developed for Ethereum. Named after Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist, danksharding is a type of sharding that serves as the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade. It concentrates on optimizing data availability for rollups within the Ethereum network.\n\nTechnically speaking, danksharding is a design that introduces the concept of a merged market fee. While traditional sharding has different blocks and block proposers for each shard, there is only one block proposer in danksharding. In simple terms, danksharding can enhance transaction processing and streamline data storage by simplifying the sharding architecture and prioritizing data management.\n\nIn the context of the upgrade, proto-danksharding (introduced by EIP-4844) serves as a prototype of danksharding. It\u2019s a temporary solution that can significantly reduce gas fees associated with rollups before the complete implementation of the danksharding framework.\n\nBlob-carrying transactions\n\nBlob-carrying transactions were introduced along with proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to help reduce gas fees. Blob-carrying transactions allow the temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data, meaning extra data can be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\nBenefits of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade can provide a range of benefits, including faster transaction processing, reduced transaction costs, optimized data management, and improved cross-chain communication. By introducing the concept of blob-carrying transactions, the upgrade aims to streamline data processing and enhance overall network efficiency.\n\n1. Better scalability: Proto-danksharding introduces temporary data storage capacity, allowing Layer 2 rollups (and the network as a whole) to process more transactions per second.\n\n2. Reduced transaction costs: Blob-carrying transactions allow extra data to be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\n3. Optimized data management: EIP-1153 can optimize block space and reduce on-chain data storage costs.\n\n4. Better cross-chain communication: EIP-4788 aims to improve interoperability between different blockchain networks by exposing the Beacon chain to execution layers.\n\n5. Improved security: EIP-6780 can reduce the risk of smart contract termination by disempowering the SELFDESTRUCT code, enhancing the security of user data and funds.\n\nPotential Risks of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThere might be risks related to the potential impact of the upgrade on existing smart contracts and the intricacies of integrating new data storage techniques. These require extensive testing and careful consideration during the implementation phase to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024 (at epoch 269,568). Node operators and stakers must upgrade their software to releases listed in the official announcement.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade marks a significant leap forward in Ethereum's quest for improved scalability, efficiency, and user experience. By introducing proto-danksharding and laying the groundwork for future advancements, the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will likely enhance the realm of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "content": "Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), once called an \u2018Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) killer' has experienced a remarkable surge in price, surging by 40% in the past week and reaching a new high for the year 2023 at approximately $58.\n\nWhat Happened: Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has conducted a comprehensive analysis suggesting that Solana could be on the verge of an unprecedented market surge. Canfield suggests that Solana could potentially increase its market dominance to the range of 12-15%.\n\nCanfield\u2019s analysis is based on several indicators. He highlights the Solana Dominance (SOL.D) chart, noting that even at its peak market cap, it didn\u2019t surpass 3%. With the current trends and the breakout of SOLBTC from its weekly resistance, Canfield envisions a scenario where Solana could enter a parabolic rally phase.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that @Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle and I'm going to lay out some ideas for you.It's possible that with the Ethereum ETF news that some of these ideas don't play out, but it's worth\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oii8vWs0W9\n\n\u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023\n\nCanfield suggests that if Solana continues to trend against Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), it could easily reach a price of $1,000 per coin and claim the second spot behind Bitcoin. \"Solana could triple or quadruple it's all time high market dominance around 12-15% and if it continues to trend against Bitcoin, could easily see a $1,000 per coin and take the #2 spot behind Bitcoin,\" the analyst said.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

        "title": "Tokenum Unveils Innovative Gasless Platform for the Ethereum Blockchain - A Game-Changer for the World of Cryptocurrency - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Tokenum\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN, Nov. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nTokenum, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, is proud to introduce its groundbreaking \"gasless technology.\" This revolutionary innovation simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and token offerings on the Ethereum blockchain, ushering in a new era of user-friendly accessibility.\n\nThe platform has already embarked on alpha testing, with an accelerated beta version scheduled for release within a week.\n\nRevolutionary Technology\n\nTokenum's gasless technology marks a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape for several compelling reasons.\n\n1) Innovative Gas-free Transactions\n\nIn traditional banking, transaction fees are paid using the same currency that is being transacted. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, fees are often paid in another, blockchain-specific digital currencies. Such fees are referred to as \"gas.\" Tokenum's gasless technology eliminates the need for users to grapple with this complex concept, making cryptocurrency more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n2) Supercharged Token Sales\n\nNew cryptocurrency projects face various challenges, including scheduling, legal compliance, compatible wallets, and sale regulations. Additionally, for users to participate in project sales, users must first acquire specific coins to cover blockchain gas fees. Tokenum's gasless technology simplifies this process, making it easier for crypto projects to attract users and maximize revenue from each sale.\n\n3) NFT Industry Transformation\n\nTokenum's gasless technology presents an opportunity to reshape the NFT industry. NFT creators and owners can now prepay for NFT transfers, removing the burden of gas payments for users. This opens the door to entirely new audiences and streamlines the process, making it as effortless as managing digital art on Instagram or Pinterest.\n\n4) Removal of Entry Barriers for New Ecosystems\n\nTokenum also benefits new blockchains by allowing users to leverage the tokens they already have, eliminating the need to acquire blockchain-specialized coins for different networks and ecosystems. This significantly simplifies the sophisticated process of navigating and using new blockchains, platforms, or even metaverses.\n\nAll Gas No Brakes and Light-Years Ahead\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Tokenum is its current full-fledged operational status. While other industry players, such as Circle Inc., Auros, 0xGasless, Open Zeppelin, and more, are still in the developmental stages, Tokenum is live and fully functional on the Ethereum network. The platform's future plans include expanding its support to encompass additional networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI-Powered CEO Behind Tokenum\n\nTokenum's powerful technology is spearheaded by a distinctive team, represented by Takeshi Tokenai, an AI-powered CEO. Notably, Takeshi was formally appointed as the leader on July 1, 2021, making him the world's first AI CEO. Conversely, Tokenum's technological prowess is underpinned by the collective expertise of its international team, boasting two decades of experience in the realms of cybersecurity, high technology, and blockchain. When asked to share their comments on the matter, Takeshi Tokenai's only statement was: \"Tokenum is here to take the crypto world by storm.\"\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIn summary, Tokenum's gasless technology is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape by simplifying transactions, facilitating token sales, and supporting the growth of new blockchains. Now the project is already integrated with CyberWallet, the one of the most secure wallets at the market, and HyperID, the single identity solution. Together, they creates seamless entrance to any web3 project, space or activity for any user, regardless of their crypto skills. Tokenum is poised to become a major player in the future of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, the company is offering giveaways and opportunities on its X channel (formerly Twitter), as well as on Zealy and QuestN, prominent crypto-community platforms. In the cryptocurrency world, such initiatives often signal preparations for rapid expansion and the potential launch of their own token.\n\nFor further updates and insights, please visit Tokenum's official website: https://tokenum.net\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation on Tokenum's X channel (formerly Twitter) by following @tokenum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, press inquiries, or collaboration opportunities, please contact:\n\nTakeshi Tokenai at info (at) tokenum.net\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "SOL becomes institutional investors' choice over Ethereum as Solana price sustains above $50 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Solana price has been one of the biggest attention grabber over the past couple of days owing to its unexpected 25% rally in a single day right before the weekend. While a specific reason cannot be deduced for the rise, the potential lies in the fact that SOL is now becoming one of the most preferred institutional assets.\n\nSolana sees institutional interest\n\nSolana is already one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in terms of gains, and the institutions seem to be observing this keenly, too. Consequently, cryptocurrency has become the most in-demand asset when it comes to institutional investors, surpassing even Ethereum.\n\nThe CoinShares weekly institutional investors\u2019 report highlights that for the week ending November 10, SOL observed inflows worth $12.4 million, which added to the monthly inflows of $23.1 million, bringing the year-to-date inflows to $121 million.\n\nEthereum and others, on the other hand, are far below SOL when it comes to year-to-date flows, although Ethereum is making slight progress this past month, as noted by the $62 million inflows since November began.\n\nSolana institutional investment\n\nThis will prove to be highly helpful for SOL in noting a boost in its value but also push the price and value of the Grayscale Solana Trust, also known as GSOL. The Grayscale investment product, following the rally in Solana price, has exploded, with the investment vehicle trading at a premium of 378% since the beginning of October.\n\nGSOL 3-day chart\n\nWhile investment product value is not considered to be an accurate measure of demand, it does highlight the rate of improvement.\n\nSolana price reverses after rally\n\nSolana price trading at $52.41 has noted a near 7% decline on the 3-day chart, with SOL noting an 18.02% decline from the intra-day trading highs of the token. The most likely outcome right now for the altcoin is slow declines followed by a reversal in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nSOL could see a gradual decline over the next couple of days, bringing the altcoin to test the support line at $46.42. While the drawdown may not be significant, losing this support would prove to be harmful as it would extend the 24-hour losses towards the $40 level.\n\nAlthough no clear signals of a price reversal are visible, the consistent rally has overheated the market, which would need some cooldown. This might result in further decline.\n\nSOL/USD 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if Solana price bounces off the $46.42 support line and climbs back to breach the $59.03 resistance level, it would invalidate the bearish thesis and send SOL towards tagging the new highs beyond $60.\n\n\n\n"

The spike in interest correlates with Blackrock\u2019s confirmation of an official filing for a Spot Ethereum ETF with Nasdaq, now awaiting SEC approval.\n\nThis revelation has infused a moderate level of euphoria among traders, propelling ETH\u2019s price to the cusp of a 1.5-year high. The crypto community, both traders and influencers, is ablaze with bullish sentiments regarding the potential impact of these ETFs on the crypto sector.\n\nThe industry also speculates that Blackrock\u2019s move may signal positive indications for their earlier Bitcoin ETF filing in June. However, the certainty of these ETFs remains a subject of debate, albeit Ethereum\u2019s significant lead in social volume reinforces its current prominence.\n\nConversely, deeper insights into Ethereum\u2019s network health via Santiment\u2019s metrics reveal a mixed picture.

        "title": "Transaction Fees Soar, Ethereum Follows In Bitcoin Traces - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA - Transaction fees for bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) have seen a significant increase in recent weeks. This shows the high activity of crypto transfers on onchain networks, which also has an impact on other operating costs such as exchange, bridging, and NFT.\n\nReporting from Bloomberg, the average cost for bitcoin transactions peaked at 15 US dollars (Rp234,825) per transfer on November 9, 2023, a sharp increase from US$3.5 (Rp54,795) on October 22, 2023. Similarly, the average cost for Ethereum transactions jumped by 219% in the same time range, up from US$2.08 (Rp32,564) to US$6.64 (Rp103,824) per transaction.\n\nEthereum transaction fees (ETH) on November 12, 2023. The average fee reached a maximum of 10.52 US dollars (Rp164,556) on November 9, 2023. Crypto transaction fees are a reward paid by the sender to the miner or validator who processes and confirms transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThe transaction fee is determined by demand and supply in the market, as well as the complexity and size of the transaction. The more transactions occur on the network, the higher the cost that must be paid by the sender to ensure their transactions are prioritized.\n\nHigh transaction fees show that crypto networks are experiencing congestion or capacity constraints, which can reduce their efficiency and scalability. In addition, high transaction fees can also reduce crypto appeal as a cheap and fast means of payment, especially for low-value transactions.\n\nThe Impact Of High Transaction Fees\n\nThe high transaction fee does not only apply to crypto transfers, but also for other types of operations carried out on blockchain, such as being involved with smart contracts, decentralized exchange platforms (dex), decentralized financial solutions (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nFor example, exchanging ETH-based assets on a dex platform can cost from 27.77 US dollars (Rp 434.118) to 28.50 US dollars (Rp 445,388) per transaction. Meanwhile, the cost of making NFT transactions fluctuates between 46.93 US dollars (Rp 733,636) to 48.16 US dollars (Rp 752,304).\n\nIt also has an impact on increasing costs for transferring assets across different chains via bridging, which is estimated to be around $8.93 (Rp139,485) to $9.17 (Rp143,307) per transaction. Bridging is a process that allows crypto assets to move from one blockchain to another, for example from ethereum to smart chain binance.\n\nFrom October 22, 2023 to November 11, 2023, ethereum has processed an average of around 1,071,448 transactions daily. This number is still lower than the record high of around 1.4 million transactions per day achieved in May 2021, when NFT and DeFi activities were booming.\n\nWhile ethereum is still the second largest blockchain after bitcoin by market cap, high transaction fees show that ethereum faces challenges in competing with other blockchains offering lower transaction fees, such as solana, avalanche, and polygons.\n\nThis blockchain-blockchain uses a different consensus mechanism from ethereum, which currently uses proof-of-work (PoW) which requires a lot of computing power and energy. Ethereum has made a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), which is expected to increase its efficiency and scalability, as well as lower transaction costs.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin, which also uses PoW, still leads ethereum in terms of market cap, daily trading volume, and transaction fees within 24 hours collected by miners.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.
