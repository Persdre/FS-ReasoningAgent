        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is a pivotal entity in the cryptocurrency sector. Founded in 2014, this Swiss-based non-profit organization has been the backbone of the Ethereum blockchain, spearheading its development and ensuring its sustainability. Ethereum, often described as the world\u2019s programmable blockchain, owes much of its success and innovation to the efforts of the Foundation.\n\nEthereum Foundation: Company or Charity?\n\nOne common question is whether the Ethereum Foundation operates as a company or a charity or is the same organization as Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF), also dubbed \u201cStiftung Ethereum,\u2019\u2019 established in 2014 in Zug, Switzerland, is not quite a company and not exactly what you\u2019ll call a charity in the conventional sense, at least. Technically, it\u2019s a non-profit organization that functions similarly to a charity, with a central mission: to shepherd the development and widespread adoption of Ethereum \u2014 the second-largest blockchain platform after Bitcoin \u2014 and the technologies surrounding it. However, its role extends beyond traditional charitable activities.\n\nMission and Goals: A Public Good for All\n\nThe EF\u2019s mission is to secure a prosperous, decentralized, and enduring future for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIf the Ethereum Foundation can be viewed as a public good entity that focused on harbouring & nurturing an early community of missionaries\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2026 then L2s can also be viewed as the new business development & partnership arm of Ethereum that brings in the next generation of Web2\u2026 \u2014 Patrick McCorry (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@stonecoldpat0) June 19, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s not about leading or controlling Ethereum but nurturing its growth and supporting benevolent actors within the ecosystem. The EF\u2019s goals are to maintain Ethereum as a public good \u2014 directed by none and useful for all. This includes funding research and development, supporting infrastructure, and fostering community growth.\n\nSignificance and Key Contributions of the EF to the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nsell 70,000 ETH, totaling, approximately, $100 million for the foundation. The Ethereum Foundation has helped ETH grow. Without the Ethereum\n\nFoundation, ETH would be less successful. It was gifted ETH and it used it in order to fund\n\nventures to help promote itself and ETH. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 6, 2021\n\nThe influence of the EF on the cryptocurrency environment is substantial. It dedicates resources to essential projects, benefiting developers and researchers devoted to enhancing Ethereum\u2019s capabilities. The EF nurtures the ecosystem and champions positive contributors through grants, research endeavors, and programs like the Ethereum Fellowship, which focuses on untapped talent and areas ripe for blockchain innovation. It\u2019s one part of a much larger ecosystem that serves as a catalyst for innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe EF\u2019s support extends to a broad scope of projects, including solutions for scalability, community building, security, privacy, and more. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\nAcademic Grants:\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation endorses scholarly grants aimed at advancing research related to Ethereum. In its 2023 initiative, the foundation supported 43 projects spanning 20 nations, covering fields including cryptography, economics, security, and consensus mechanisms. These grants have helped advance knowledge, foster collaboration, and drive innovation within the Ethereum community.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The first ZK Grants Round is now open!\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, in collaboration with Aztec, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and zkSync, contributed $150K each to the shared prize pool, totaling $900K.\n\n\n\nApply before March 18th! \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/u1lGRfc4CV \u2014 Ethereum Foundation (@ethereum) February 21, 2024\n\nCommunity Engagement:\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation actively engages with the community through platforms like GitHub and Discord.\n\nTheir efforts have increased contributions, with GitHub contributors rising by 57% and Discord community members nearly doubling.\n\nDevcon Conferences:\n\nDevcon, organized by the Ethereum Foundation since 2014, has become a premier event for enthusiasts, developers, and researchers. These conferences foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the birth of new ideas that drive Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nwhat to expect as a Scholar: financial support, pre-Devcon community & programming, an amazing week at Devcon in Bangkok, and a post-Devcon learnings.https://t.co/FAwBYd90PM \u2014 Deva the Devcon Unicorn (@EFDevcon) July 5, 2024\n\nEcosystem Support Program (ESP):\n\nAs an extension of the Ethereum Grant Program, ESP provides financial and non-financial support to projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBy nurturing promising initiatives, ESP has contributed to the growth of decentralized applications, tools, and services in the past and present day.\n\nFellowship Program:\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation Fellowship Program aims to address gaps in representation across cultures, nationalities, and economic classes. It identifies and supports unique and talented individuals, breaking down barriers to entry for underrepresented people and communities in the Web3 space.\n\nEthereum for the Next Billion: Today, @AyaMiyagotchi unveils the new EF Fellowship Program, and discusses the Foundation's role and a vision for #Ethereum's long-term sustainability in a decentralized world.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://t.co/BNnAdH7erH \u2014 Ethereum Foundation (@ethereum) May 7, 2021\n\nImpacts and Achievements\n\nThrough all the key contributions of the Ethereum Foundation highlighted above, the Ethereum ecosystem now boasts of many achievements and giant strides, with tens of crypto projects successfully executed and DeFi startups birthed under their belt. To list a few:\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi):\n\nEthereum birthed DeFi, a movement that transformed traditional financial services. Notable platforms include:\n\nUniswap, launched in November 2018, introduced automated market-making (AMM) and liquidity pools, enabling decentralized token swaps. Aave, founded in January 2020, pioneered flash loans and became a leading lending protocol. MakerDAO, established in December 2017, its DAI stablecoin provided stability in a volatile market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Robust DeFi. Source: The Block\n\nBy July 2024, DeFi protocols collectively held over $100 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nNFT Renaissance:\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts remodeled NFTs for the crypto industry. The Ethereum Foundation established NFT standards (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) that shaped the NFT ecosystem.\n\nScaling Solutions:\n\nOptimistic Rollups , introduced in 2022, enhance scalability by batching transactions off-chain and submitting proofs on-chain.\n\n, introduced in 2022, enhance scalability by batching transactions off-chain and submitting proofs on-chain. Zero-knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), deployed in 2023, further reduce fees and improve user experience.\n\nEth2 Beacon Chain:\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) Transition: The Beacon Chain shipped on December 1, 2020, and formalized PoS as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism with The Merge, aka the \u201cShanghai Upgrade,\u201d on September 15, 2022. During this event, Ethereum successfully switched from \u201cProof of Work\u201d (PoW) to another system known as \u201cProof of Stake\u201d (PoS). This change was a huge accomplishment because it significantly decreased the network\u2019s energy, making the platform much more environmentally friendly. This marked the beginning of a new, more sustainable phase for Ethereum.\n\nThese contributions demonstrate the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s commitment to advancing the ecosystem, which continues to grow in leaps and bounds to date.\n\nThe Names Behind the Ethereum Foundation\n\nAt the heart of the Ethereum Foundation is Vitalik Buterin, a prodigy in the crypto world. Alongside Vitalik, other key figures include Aya Miyaguchi, the Executive Director, and a team of dedicated developers and researchers who work tirelessly behind the scenes.\n\nVitalik Buterin\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has significantly influenced the blockchain space, contributing to high-level roadmaps and technological advancements, including the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702. His work has earned him recognition, such as a spot-on Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 list in 2016.\n\nEthereum's co-founder, VitalikButerin, clarifies his recent ETH transactions.

He shared on X that the SEC is answering issuers today, asking them to return their final S-1 forms on Wednesday, July 17th.\n\n\u201cAnd then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course,\u201d he added.\n\nUpdate: Nate's instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course! https://t.co/D21FD9Qf94 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 15, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum ETF issuers filed their S-1 forms on July 8th but most of them left the fees out of their forms. According to Balchunas, this is likely a strategy from the asset managers to check how competitive the funds\u2019 fees are, especially BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form is an initial registration required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a security can be publicly traded.\n\nAs highlighted by Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart, this could mean that the Ethereum ETFs will start trading the same week as the Bitcoin Conference, set to happen in Nashville.\n\nThe launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs is a key step for crypto adoption by mainstream investors, as it solidifies the altcoin as a sound asset among institutional investors. An estimate by Bitwise CIO predicts that these investment instruments will capture $15 billion in inflows until the end of 2025, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum ETFs open the door for the approval of exchange-traded funds indexed to other crypto. VanEck and 21Shares both filed their form for the approval of the first spot Solana ETFs in the US on the last week of June."

With compromises already being recorded since spot Bitcoin ETF approval days, the market is not expecting any further delays.\n\nHowever, the concerns of many lie in what will become of the industry should the Ethereum ETF start trading. The conversation rests on its immediate impact on the market in terms of price gains.\n\nWhen the SEC approved 19b-4 filings in May, the update fueled a massive spike in the price of the coin, with a ripple effect on Bitcoin and altcoins more broadly. This rally, though short-lived, might get replayed when Ethereum ETF products start trading.\n\nThe bullish sentiment in price is already creeping in. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum and trading volume are up 4.14% and 34.43% to $3,334.51 and $13,196,383,402, respectively.\n\nBesides price impact, the launch of the Ethereum ETF effectively lifted limitations for other altcoins gunning for similar product acceptance on Wall Street. Already, there are active applications for a Solana ETF from VanEck \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060, and 21Shares has already broken the push for the product with a Bitcoin and Ethereum duopoly.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF trading and potential capital injection might confirm what crypto proponents have been projecting for a while now: fact that there is a subtle demand for mainstream, regulated crypto products."

ETH is currently trading at $3.342, with an enormous jump from $2.909 just a week ago.\n\nThe technical analysis of the charts shows a bullish trend, with Ethereum trading above $3.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Inflows Could Hit $10B, Sending Ether to New ATH\n\nPotential Ripple Effects on the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nInstitutional Interest and Investment Inflows\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs, as mentioned previously, have generated quite a bit of excitement for investors and financial advisors.\n\nBitwise Asset Management projects that these ETFs could attract $15 billion in net inflows until the year 2025 ends.\n\nIf this is true, this influx would explore Ethereum\u2019s value and validate its current price revival.\n\nPaving the Way for Other Altcoin ETFs\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs might put its foot in the door for other altcoins that want a similar product acceptance on Wall Street, and here are some of them:\n\nActive applications for a Solana ETF from VanExck\n\n21Shares has expanded beyond the Bitcoin-Ethereum duopoly\n\nAs a result, we could expect a more diverse range of crypto investment products in the future.\n\nAlso Read: VanEck Officially Files S-1 for Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nThe approval and the following trading of Ethereum ETFs could be an excellent marker of the growing demand for more mainstream and regulated crypto products.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the SEC\u2019s decision will boost ETH ETFs to a new level. We\u2019re eagerly awaiting their conclusion."

        "content": "PEPE\u2019s large holders sold off significant portions of their holdings in the last 30 days\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the memecoin was undervalued and could rally after the event\n\nMany investors in the market consider the upcoming Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF launch to be bullish. However, AMBCrypto found that large holders of Pepe [PEPE] seem not to share a similar sentiment.\n\nWe found this information after examining the addresses by holdings data. This indicator groups addresses into different segments and shows if they are accumulating or selling off their assets.\n\nIs the memecoin in chains?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto noticed that PEPE addresses holding tokens worth $100,000 to $10 million fell by double-digits. This decline implies that they have sold off some of their tokens within the last 30 days.\n\nThis is a surprise, primarily because PEPE is the top memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it was expected that the big wigs of the memecoin sector would give the same bullish cues as the rest of the bullish market.\n\nIf this stays the same when the spot Ethereum ETFs go live, PEPE\u2019s price might hike as a result of the development. However, it could be challenging to sustain the hike unless buying pressure increases.\n\nAt press time, the value of PEPE was. $0.0000087. This price meant that it was down 49.27% from the all-time high it hit on 27 May.\n\nGoing by the analysis above, further distribution could drag the price, and the token could be 55% down for the highs. However, post-Ethereum ETF\u2019s launch, the token might perform well on the charts.\n\nHigher highs will come later\n\nThis was the signal the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio gave. This ratio provides insights into profitability in the market.\n\nWhen the ratio rises, it means that the market cap is outpacing the realized cap. In this instance, holders of a cryptocurrency have motive to sell. However, if the ratio falls, it means that the realized cap is much more than the market cap.\n\nMost of the time, this brings about unrealized losses and there is little to no motive to sell. At the time of writing, PEPE\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was -10.90%, indicating that it experienced a poor level of demand dynamics lately.\n\nHowever, the good part is that the negative ratio might force market participants to hold on to the token. Therefore, the memecoin could be termed undervalued relative to its current market conditions.\n\nAs such, if buying pressure intensifies much later, we could see the price attempt to revisit its May highs. Despite the bearish signs pre-ETF launch, some analysts believe that the memecoin would gain from the development.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s PEPE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nOne of them is Donny Dicey, an analyst on X. The quote below is what Dicey thinks of the token\u2019s reaction to the Ethereum ETF launch."

The bullish reversal uplifted the asset from monthly support of $2825 to $3196 registering a weekly gain of 13.2%. This recovery followed a market excitement towards the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs in the coming week and eased from broader market supply. Is the correction trend over?\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Altcoins In Focus As Market Eyes Ether ETF, Fed Chair Comment, & Other Events\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Will Spot ETH ETF Approval Propel ETH to $4000?\n\nThe mid-term trend from the Ethereum price analysis shows a sideways action in the daily chart. The formation of a new lower high at $3974 and recently the same swing low at $2815 projects ETH price entering a consolidation trend to recuperate exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nA recent reversal from the $2815 support has uplifted the asset to $3191 within a week while the market cap jumped to $383.5 Billion. However, the declining volume accompanying the upswing suggests a diminishing interest among market participants to initiate long positions.\n\nThis lack of conviction from buyers suggests an unsustainable recovery and a potential for further correction in ETH. If the coin price reverts from the overhead trendline (downsloping blue line), the sellers could rechallenge the $2815 floor to extend the current correction.\n\nThe potential breakdown could accelerate the supply pressure and push the asset to $2400.\n\nHowever, the potential approval of spot ETH ETF could counter the bearish thesis to change market sentiment.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price To Hit $5,000 As ETH ETF Speculation Ignites Bullish Comeback\n\nNate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, recently tweeted that the SEC\u2019s approach to the spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings closely mirrors their handling of the 19b-4 filings, marked by significant discretion. Geraci remains optimistic about the approval, anticipated next week, emphasizing that there is no justifiable reason for any delay.\n\nIt appears the SEC is playing the spot eth ETF S-1s similar to the 19b-4s\u2026 *Extremely* tight-lipped.

What is the significance of the spot ETH ETF approval? The potential approval of a spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is significant because it could increase institutional and retail investment in Ethereum. 2. What is a relief rally? A \"relief rally\" refers to a temporary increase in the price of an asset after a period of decline. 3. What is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Eyes $3.5K as ETF Launch Anticipation Grows - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently seen an uptick in demand near a crucial support level, leading to a notable rebound above the 200-day moving average at $3,134 and reaching the 100-day MA.\n\nThis price action highlights the potential for a bullish reversal if the price recovers above the 100-day MA of $3,342.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA detailed analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals that after a prolonged bearish trend, the cryptocurrency briefly broke below the 200-day moving average at $3,081, introducing significant fear and uncertainty into the market, as this MA is a vital support level for the price.\n\nHowever, Ethereum found strong support at the substantial and decisive support region of $3K, resulting in a notable bullish rebound. The price has now climbed above the 200-day MA and continued surging toward the 100-day MA, indicating a potential bear trap and false breakout.\n\nCurrently, ETH has reached the 100-day MA of $3,142 and is on the verge of reclaiming it. This MA also aligns with the tactical resistance region of $3.3K, making it a robust barrier to buyers. Yet, if it stabilizes above the 100-day MA, this could confirm a bullish revival in the mid-term, with the next target being the $4K yearly high.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum faced rejection near the multi-month descending trendline at $3.5K, entering a sustained and impulsive bearish trend. Upon reaching the decisive and psychological support region at $2.8K, the bearish momentum faded, resulting in the formation of a notable double-bottom pattern.\n\nFollowing this consolidation, an increase in buying activity led to a bullish rebound, breaking above the neckline and subsequently forming a successful pullback to the broken level.\n\nThereafter, the price experienced an impulsive surge, which clearly hinted at a bullish revival in market sentiment. Ethereum is now at a crucial resistance region, encompassing the significant $3.4K psychological mark and the multi-month downtrend line, where selling pressure may increase.\n\nIf Ethereum reclaims this resistance area, the bullish trend could continue toward the $3.7K mark. Conversely, a rejection at this level would likely result in the continuation of the bearish trend, targeting the critical $2.8K support.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has recently experienced a bullish rebound, surging significantly toward the critical $3.5K resistance zone. Understanding the potential targets for the bullish trend is essential for predicting future price movements.\n\nThe accompanying chart identifies potential liquidation zones within Ethereum\u2019s price action, offering insights for mid-term strategies by informed traders. Following the recent bearish decline below the $3K threshold, the price has tapped into the liquidity pool below $3K, primarily comprising sell-side liquidity from long positions opened near this mark.\n\nLooking ahead, significant liquidity is observed around the $4K resistance region, primarily consisting of buy-stop orders triggered by aggressive short positions during the previous impulsive bearish trend. In the mid-term, a plausible scenario involves the continuation of the bullish trend to capture liquidity near and above the $4K resistance level. This approach aims to exploit these liquidity zones strategically, potentially supporting further upward momentum in Ethereum\u2019s price."

        "content": "Despite outshining BTC and ETH, SOL\u2019s number of NFT sellers and buyers dropped.\n\nSOL was up by 4% in the last 24 hours, but a few metrics looked bearish.\n\nSolana [SOL], which nowadays has been in the limelight for its high network activity, has once again made an achievement in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe blockchain has managed to outshine top players like Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] on a key front. In the meantime, its price action has also turned bullish.\n\nSolana\u2019s promising NFT performance\n\nSolanaFloor, a popular X handle that posts updates related to the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development.\n\nAs per the tweet, Solana outshined all other blockchains in terms of daily NFT blockchain user adoption. SOL\u2019s number increased by almost 34% in the last 24 hours. Apart from SOL, Polygon [MATIC] and Ethereum made it to the top three on the same list.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that Frogana, Retardio Cousins, and SMB Gen2 were the top three NFT collections on Solana over the last 24 hours.\n\nAs per Sanrtiment\u2019s data, SOL\u2019s NFT trade count spiked last week. Its NFT trade volume in USD also increased over the past few days.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CRYPTOSLAM\u2019s data revealed that Solana also witnessed an increase in its NFT sales volume last week. To be precise, the number grew by 8%.\n\nHowever, not everything looked favorable. For instance, SOL\u2019s number of NFT sellers dropped by 59% last week. A similar declining trend was also noted in terms of SOL\u2019s number of NFT buyers, as the figure dropped by more than 66%.\n\nSOL turns bullish\n\nWhile all this happened, Solana bulls buckled up as its daily chart remained green.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, SOL\u2019s price increased by over 4% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $146.67 with a market capitalization of over $68 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto.\n\nHowever, SOL might soon lose its bullish momentum. At the time of writing, SOL\u2019s fear and greed index had a reading of 68%, meaning that the market was in a \u201cfear\u201d phase.\n\nWhenever the metric hits this level, it suggests that the chances of a price correction are high.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto planned to have a look at SOL\u2019s daily chart to better understand what to expect from the token. As per our analysis, the technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish advantage in the market.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and was headed further up from the neutral mark, indicating a continued price increase.\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) went southward, which could restrict SOL\u2019s price from moving up in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This was not a positive sign and reflected reduced on-chain demand and slow growth.\n\nVolume indicators ambivalent despite the breakout\n\nOn Saturday the 13th of July, Ethereum closed a daily trading session at $3,201, breaking out of the resistance zone in the $3.1k area. Despite this achievement, the market structure and momentum were bearish in the daily timeframe.\n\nMoreover, the CMF showed a reading of -0.05 which signaled notable capital flow out of the market. The OBV was unable to start an uptrend as buying volume stuttered over the past ten days. This meant that the volume was too weak to be taken as a clear signal of bullish strength.\n\nThe daily RSI was at 45 to signal bearish momentum but has crept higher over the past week. As things stand, Ethereum might not be ready for a swift upward move unless more volume enters the market.\n\nLiquidation heatmap\u2019s clues on the next resistance\n\nThe $2.7k-$2.8k zone to the south was an attractive pool of liquidity. It was tested in the first week of July but not wholly swept.\n\nThe subsequent price bounce above $3.1k meant the next liquidity cluster at $3.5k-$3.7k would be the target for bulls.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe Open Interest has climbed alongside the prices and the funding rate was positive. The sentiment was strongly bullish, and the spot CVD was recovering too.\n\nIf the trend remained intact, the chances of an ETH move toward $3.6k would become healthier.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."
