        "content": "Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below.\n\nIn this piece we:\n\nWe conclude that Ethereum Layer- 2 landscape is crowded with few winner-take-all characteristics for now.\n\nEvaluate Layer-2 blockchains through a lens of developer experience, user experience, & technical capability.\n\nShow assumptions behind our $1 trillion market cap base case valuation for Ethereum Layer-2s by 2030.\n\nLayer-2 Blockchains Overview\n\nEthereum's dominance in smart contracts faces a critical hurdle: scalability. While the network offers unparalleled security and decentralization, transaction fees and processing times soar when usage intensifies. To overcome this, Layer 2 solutions have emerged, and advancements like the recent fork EIP-4844 promise to unlock even greater scalability for these Ethereum offshoots. Here we analyze an array of Layer 2 solutions from the perspective of transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumption, and ecosystem size.\n\nLayer-2 (L2) blockchains are connected networks that operate on top of a primary blockchain, like Ethereum, to increase its capacity for processing transactions. By handling transactions off the main blockchain and then settling them back on it, L2 solutions help to scale the blockchain's capabilities without compromising its security or decentralization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current capabilities are well-known to be inadequate for hosting all of the globe\u2019s financial transactions. To be more precise, the world\u2019s financial system will need to process more than Ethereum\u2019s long-term limit of around 19.2 USDC or 6.8 Uniswap trades per second. However, this is a limitation by design because Ethereum\u2019s stewards believe that censorship resistance is best achieved by making it inexpensive for anyone to run Ethereum nodes.\n\nThe result is that Ethereum limits its chain\u2019s capabilities to cut down on networking requirements, data storage needs, and computer hardware demands of its nodes. This practically limits how many bytes of data Ethereum can process over a given period of time. As transactions on a blockchain are nothing more than pieces of data that the blockchain agrees are correct, the capabilities of a blockchain can be measured simply by how much useful data it can handle.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/15/2024.\n\nTo address these constraints, Ethereum's developers initially proposed a \u201csharding\u201d solution, which involved splitting the blockchain into 64 smaller, interconnected sub-blockchains called \u201cshards.\u201d Each of these shards would process transactions within each\u2019s own containerized child blockchains and then submit proofs of the activity to be reconciled by Ethereum\u2019s parent blockchain. While this approach appeared promising, and some of its components debuted on Polkadot starting in 2020, Ethereum developers eventually discarded the sharding plan called Ethereum 2.0. This is because they believed it was technically infeasible and incapable of scaling to Ethereum\u2019s vision of becoming a blockchain for billions of users.\n\nInstead, Ethereum's roadmap shifted towards leveraging Layer-2 (L2) blockchains. These L2 networks handle most transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain, only settling the highest-value transactions directly on it. This approach reduces the load on the main blockchain, allowing it to process more transactions efficiently. In this dynamic, Ethereum accrues value because the costs of these settlements must be paid in ETH; this strategy also reinforces the value of ETH as the true \u201coil\u201d powering the entire ecosystem of connected chains.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum's primary challenge is its limited capacity to process, store, and compute data in the form of financial transactions. This bottleneck in data throughput is being addressed by offloading much of the data processing and computation to Layer-2 blockchains. As a result, Ethereum's development is now concentrated on enhancing its ability to integrate compressed transaction data from these L2 blockchains. But how exactly do these connected blockchains function, and what are their business models?\n\nEthereum Ecosystem Transactions vs. Ethereum Mainnet Market Share\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem is growing while Ethereum\u2019s share is shrinking.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s Role in Scaling Ethereum's Network\n\nLayer-2 (L2) blockchains enhance Ethereum's capabilities by aggregating multiple transactions into condensed bundles, known as \"roll-ups.\u201d These \u201cbundles\u201d of transactions are posted by L2s to Ethereum at various intervals that are spaced apart to balance transaction demand, security, and cost. As such, Ethereum is becoming a \u201cblockchain of blockchains.\u201d\n\nEach L2 generally consists of its own series of smart contracts on Ethereum that keep track of L2 transaction history, facilitate data transfer between the L2 and Ethereum, run fault proof or zk verifier contract (more on this below), and function as an asset escrow between Ethereum and the L2. Very powerful computers called \u201csequencers\u201d ingest and order all the transactions that occur on the L2 blockchains. This is more capable and cheaper than Ethereum because L2s run one very powerful server computer that simply intakes transactions and orders them. This dynamic allows L2s to process greater data throughput than Ethereum. By contrast, Ethereum transaction processing involves 100s of thousands of globally distributed validator nodes sending, interpreting, and agreeing upon transaction data. This takes a lot more time due to the Ethereum consensus process and involves duplicating the work of one computer on each of the 100s of thousands of Ethereum nodes. Logically, a single computer like a sequencer processing transaction is much cheaper and faster than a system of globally dispersed, less capable computers that need to collectively use gigabits of internet bandwidth to message and hundreds of thousands of CPUs to process blockchain transactions.\n\nTypes of Layer-2s: Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs)\n\nThere are two main types of L2s connected to Ethereum: optimistic roll-ups (ORUs) and zero-knowledge roll-ups (ZKUs). Both settle their ledger balances, or \"state,\" on Ethereum by sending a compressed version called a \"Merkle Root.\" ORUs also post a condensed batch of transaction data to allow for verification and traceability of ledger changes over time.\n\nSettlement in Layer-2 blockchains (L2s) can be compared to updating a baseball game's scoreboard inning by inning, with the transaction data serving as the detailed play-by-play. For optimistic roll-ups (ORUs), they operate on the principle of optimism, meaning they are presumed to be accurate unless proven otherwise. If an entity, such as a high-frequency trading firm or a mathematically adept researcher, identifies an incorrect or faulty Merkle root, they can submit a fraud attestation, known as a fault-proof, to Ethereum. Entities monitoring ORUs for fraud have a seven-day window, referred to as a \"challenge period,\" to detect any fraudulent activity following a state update. Once this period concludes, the transactions within the ORU are deemed final. If a fault-proof successfully demonstrates fraud, the smart contract overseeing the ORU's state will revert all transactions to the state before the fraud commenced. The challenge period extends for seven days, after which each batch of transactions is irrevocably finalized.\n\nAt the time of writing, of the forty-six L2s we track through l2beat, only four chains have fraud proofs live. Two of those four are under the umbrella of Arbitrum, which boasts the highest total value locked (TVL) of any L2 at $4.31B and only allows fraud proofs from a whitelisted group of entities.\n\nThe most popular ORUs are Arbitrum, Blast, Optimism, Manta, Metis, Mantle, and Base.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) vs. Annualized Revenues Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs)\n\nSource: Defillama, TokenTerminal as of 3/12/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nA zero-knowledge roll-up (ZKU) operates similarly to an ORU, with one key difference. While ORUs submit both transaction data Merkle roots and state Merkle roots to Ethereum, ZKUs only send a zero-knowledge proof of the transaction data. This is because ZKUs do not operate under the assumption that the submitted state roots are correct. Instead, once the proof is submitted to Ethereum, a smart contract verifies the authenticity of the ZKU's transaction bundle.\n\nAs a result, ZKUs do not have fault proofs because proofs are generated with each state update. Unlike ORUs, ZKU transaction data is considered final once the proof is accepted on Ethereum, ensuring immediate finality and eliminating the need for a challenge period.\n\nThe most important ZKUs are currently Starkware, zkSync, zkScroll, Linea and *c zkEVM\n\nThe base economics of ZKUs and ORUs are very similar to those of L1 blockchains. Both types of roll-ups make money when users create activity on their chains and pay fees in ETH to Ethereum. Currently, all L2s price their transactions in ETH because that is the token needed to settle transaction data to Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2s Revenue Models\n\nRegardless of the process, it is important to understand that transaction ordering has value and that blockchains can make money by selling the rights to transaction ordering. This diagram illustrates how three different transaction sequencing models can create different revenue streams.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/25/2024. Explanation: Assume that TX2 is a high value transaction, buying $1M of a token on an L2. In FIFO, everyone pays the sequencer the same amount. In Priority Ordering, TX2 pays the sequencer to be first. In Auctioning Specific Slots, TX3 and TX4 pay extra to be ahead of and behind TX2.\n\nLayer-2s Transaction Sequencing: Priority, FIFO, and Auctioning\n\nL2s charge users a fee for transaction inclusion in each block. This is composed of a base fee and a priority fee. Some L2s charge priority fees, like Optimism. Priority fees give users the ability to be first in line at the top of the block of transactions. In the last 6 months, the top 10 L2s on Ethereum made $232M in revenues from user transactions alone. This ability to \u201ccut the line\u201d by paying priority fees benefits users engaging in time-sensitive activities, such as arbitrage trading.\n\nArbitrum adopts a first-in-first-out (FIFO) sequencing approach to transactions as they arrive. In certain cases, users may prefer their transactions to follow specific others on the block. A common strategy, known as \"back-running,\" involves positioning a transaction right after a significant trade to exploit price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for arbitrage opportunities. More malicious transaction ordering techniques, such as \"sandwich attacks,\" involve strategically placing buy orders immediately before a user's planned trade and sell orders immediately after. This manipulation drives up the price of the desired token just before the user's transaction executes, forcing them to purchase at a disadvantageous, inflated price.\n\nOn Ethereum, ordering is monetized by a software addition added to Ethereum\u2019s validator software. This software, called Flashbots, allows for validators to auction off the right to order transactions (and insert their own) to outside entities. This auction generates \"maximal extractable value\" (MEV), adding to the validators' and stakers' yields. While L2s have the potential to monetize MEV by auctioning off block ordering rights, no L2 has officially done so yet. However, trading firms may already be positioning their servers close to L2 servers, akin to practices in equity and commodities exchanges.\n\nLooking forward, many L2s plan to decentralize their sequencer set, which may involve staking tokens \u2014 possibly ETH from an Eigenlayer DA or from each roll-up\u2019s native token. The sequencer decentralization could unlock new revenue streams from MEV. To contextualize, Ethereum's MEV take rate on DEX volume averages around 4 basis points (bps), while other blockchains like Polygon and Solana have rates of 0.4bps and 3.5bps, respectively. These rates likely understate the full scope of MEV due to the challenges in tracking and the incentives to conceal profits. By estimating MEV take rates against DEX volumes, if Arbitrum's MEV was captured at a rate of 3.0bps, it would amount to $58.9 million \u2014 a significant 57% of Arbitrum's fee-only revenue.\n\nArbitrum Revenues with 3bps of MEV on DEX Volumes\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 3/20/2024.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s On-Chain Cost Structures\n\nLayer-2s (L2) primarily incur costs through Ethereum gas fees as they regularly post transaction data, settlements, and proofs to Ethereum. But zero-knowledge roll-ups (ZKUs) and optimistic roll-ups (ORUs) differ in their cost structures. While both update their states on the L1, ORUs have to pay onerous on-chain data costs while ZKUs must expend money proof generations and verification. Regardless, the consequence of the dependence on Ethereum is that the L2s input cost is subject to the volatility of Ethereum blockspace. For the most part, this cost difference is passed on to the user. However, the margins that L2s earn are quite volatile as a result.\n\nPrior to EIP-4844, L2s posted both settlement data and proofs to Ethereum as single transactions in the \u201cmessage field\u201d of each transaction structure called \u201ccall data.\u201d This was a \u201chack\u201d to utilize one component of Ethereum\u2019s standard transaction format for the purpose of holding compressed L2 data. Though this is novel, it is very expensive. For example, for the month of February, Optimism paid $5.7M, Arbitrum paid $7.2M, and Scroll paid $6.7M for posting call data to Ethereum.\n\nSource: VanEck Research, Celestia as of 3/14/2024.\n\nThe cost components for ZKUs are inherently higher compared to ORUs because ZKUs submit both zero-knowledge proofs and call data to Ethereum. While ORUs may also involve proof costs, these are generally outsourced to third parties who challenge the state if needed, and therefore they do not heavily influence ORUs' base costs. The verification of ZKUs\u2019 zero-knowledge proofs on Ethereum can be extremely costly. Despite Ethereum's optimization efforts, such as native op codes to streamline zk-proof verification, the expenses remain significant\u2014for example, Scroll's ZKU incurred $1.1 million in proofing fees in just the first 13 days of March.\n\nAs a result of these high proving costs, the average profit margin for ORUs over the last six months stands at 26.7%, contrasting with 21% for ZKUs. Logically, a roll-up could send more transactions in fewer batches to decrease variable batch posting expenses. Infrequent batch posting, however, could also come as a result of less transaction throughput happening on the L2s. Regardless, L2 batch post frequency to Ethereum is a profitability lever an L2 can pull, but one that comes at the expense of user experience. In practice, L2s decide batch posting as a calculus of how many transactions they can fit into a block, Ethereum L1 gas prices, and each L2 incoming flow of transactions.\n\nL2 Batches Per Day vs. Ethereum Settlement Costs\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Etherscan as of 3/14/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nTechnically, L2s can post more expansive understandings of what occurs on L2s besides the simple \u201cscoreboard\u201d settlements. Price competition amongst L2s to serve users the cheapest transactions cause L2s to often choose the most economical data to post. Often, this means just posting \u201cstate differences\u201d for ZKUs, and for ORUs, it means posting highly compressed transaction data. Curiously, though ZKUs do not technically have to post full transaction data, some still do so. While Starknet and zkSync only post \u201cstate differences,\u201d Linea, Polygon, and Scroll post full transaction data. This is done because it may be challenging for things like explorers and wallets to track blockchains without the transaction data. Another possibility is that posting full transaction data allows more transparency so that anyone can run a node to track a ZKU. ZKUs may also be open to opening up a prover to anyone in the future, and posting full transaction data to Ethereum allows ZKUs to \u201cdecentralize\u201d their blockchains at the point of the \u201cprovers.\u201d\n\nA cost reduction that many L2s currently make is to improve the efficiency of their compression. For example, on February 13th, Linea deployed a new compression scheme that increased compression on the chain by a factor of 10x, moving from around 500 bytes per transaction to the mid-50s. Other L2s, both ORUs and ZKUs, had an average transaction size on Ethereum of 300 bytes for 2024. While compressing transactions may save on data costs to the L2, it reduces its potential due to the time it takes to compress transactions.\n\nL2 On Chain Margins by Month\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/13/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nEIP-4844\u2019s Answer to L2 Data Costs: Blob Space\n\nOn March 13, 2024, Ethereum passed the Dencun upgrade, which had a handful of important changes, the most significant of which was the creation of what is called \u201cBlob Space.\u201d Prior to this upgrade, the main challenge for Layer-2s was the prohibitive cost associated with posting transaction data to Ethereum. Recognizing this, Ethereum\u2019s solution was the strategic creation of a specialized data layer, colloquially known as Blob Space, designed exclusively for L2 data postings.\n\nThis newly established layer offers a targeted transaction environment tailored to receiving data from L2 networks. Blob Space's innovative aspect is its transient data handling\u2014data blobs posted here are retained for only four weeks before deletion, significantly reducing Ethereum's data overhead. Consequently, L2s have the option to bypass the main Ethereum layer and directly post to Blob Space.\n\nThe Blob Space layer of Ethereum has its own gas prices that abide by the same rule set as Ethereum\u2019s regular execution layer. The result is that transactions from L2s to publish data no longer have to compete with regular Ethereum transactions for blockspace. The dedicated transaction layer is also designed to price the cost of data much cheaper than posting to Ethereum as call data. At the time of writing, the Data Blobs have reduced gas usage charges to L2s by (-96%).\n\nL2 Data Publishing Costs to Ethereum (ETH)\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s Off-Chain Cost Structures\n\nThe first part of the off-chain cost expense for Layer-2s (L2s) are the sequencers they use for ordering transactions. This is basically just a high-end server that sits in a data center. For most L2s, the foundation or business entity behind that L2 pays for the cost of the sequencer. In the grand scheme of things, the costs of running the sequencers themselves are minor at around $1000 to $2000 in equipment and perhaps another $3000 to 5000 in manpower per month. This cost is consistent for both Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs).\n\nA lesser discussed but significant cost element for ZKUs involves the operation of provers. Unlike sequencers that produce the state root, the provers are responsible for creating the zk-proof that undergoes verification on the Ethereum network. This computational process usually takes place on cloud computing platforms like AWS.\n\nAccording to the decentralized zk prover project Gevulot, the costs of the proof will run between \u201c10-20% of the cost of verification on Ethereum.\u201d Additionally, these costs scale with the amount of transactions that are being generated by each L2s. ZKUs are faced with a balancing act between costs and user experience, with the option to reduce the frequency of proofs posted to Ethereum as a potential cost-saving measure. Through a process known as recursion, ZKU provers can consolidate several proofs into a single submission, which, while increasing off-chain computational demands, can optimize the economics by mitigating the costly proof verifications conducted on Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, all ZKUs run their own provers and directly pay for the costs of proof generation. Over time, however, many intend to decentralize proof generation.\n\nEvaluating Layer-2s Across 5 Key Areas\n\nIn our analysis of key Layer-2s, we use five principal variables to measure potential success or failure:\n\nTransaction pricing \u2013 the cost to users of transacting Developer experience \u2013 the ease of building products and applications User experience \u2013 the simplicity of depositing, withdrawing, and transacting Trust Assumptions - liveness and safety assumptions Ecosystem size \u2013 how many interesting things there are to do\n\n1. Layer-2s Transaction Pricing\n\nThe root of transaction pricing differentiation comes from a combination of data compression, data posting efficiency, L2 scale, proving costs (for ZKUs), and, most interestingly, the margin each L2 takes. L2s could also time their postings to Ethereum based upon gas prices, but in practice, we have not found empirical evidence to support this possibility. This is likely due to the general difficulties of predicting future Ethereum gas prices.\n\nThe main difference in pricing economics between ZKUs and ORUs is that ZKUs have higher fixed costs than ORUs. This is because ZKUs must pay for proof generation off Ethereum and proof verification on Ethereum. Proof generation/verification is a large, static cost that does not increase significantly as more transactions are covered by each proof. By contrast, ORUs must post full transaction data to Ethereum. Though ORUs employ different compression mechanisms to cut down on data costs, posting to Ethereum is very expensive. Because more transactions on an ORU means more data is to be committed to Ethereum, the costs of posts to Ethereum are increased. However, with the EIP-4844, the costs of posting data to Ethereum have been reduced significantly and these savings have resulted in cheaper transaction pricing for ORUs. Likewise, ORUs also have the option of placing transaction data on even cheaper data availability blockchains like Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail. Currently, Manta Pacific and Aevo post transaction data to Celestia.\n\nIn 2024, the cheapest chains by average transaction cost were Mantle ($0.17), zkSync ($0.21), and Starknet ($0.25). Each chain was able to edge out its competition on pricing using different techniques. Mantle, an ORU, is able to keep transactions cheap because it accepts lower than the average margin (19.9%), uses its own data availability (Mantle DA) for full transaction batch posting, and updates its state root updates to Ethereum, the second least frequently at every 20.7 minutes. zkSync, a ZKU, was able to price transactions inexpensively due to the high volume of transactions (94.9M), the highest of any L2, that made its proving system highly economical. Meanwhile, the ZKU chain Starknet settled to Ethereum the least often of any of the top 10 L2s, once every 57.8 minutes, while also posting only state differences in place of full transaction data. These two-cost savings resulted in the least amount of data per transaction being settled to Ethereum. Curiously, we estimate that Starknet lost -$0.09 per transaction through March 13, 2024.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation of L2s\n\nData for 2024. Source: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/13/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n2. Layer-2s Developer Experience\n\nDeveloper experience is another important point of competitive differentiation for Layer-2s. The root understanding of making the developer experience easiest was to implement EVM compatibility. This means that smart contract code, tooling, and developer libraries could be ported over directly from Ethereum to be used on the L2. This is believed to give each L2 an advantage because of Ethereum\u2019s large network of developers. Currently, the vast majority of L2s are EVM-compatible. However, ZKUs often have subtle differences that developers must adhere to due to the limitations of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nSome developers have also argued that adherence to EVM compatibility is a disadvantage because EVM places significant limitations on blockchain capabilities while boxing out developers who are more familiar with other computer languages. For example, Starknet smart contracts are written in a language called Cairo, which is more efficient for the zero-knowledge scaling of Starknet. Of course, this comes at the tradeoff where anyone deploying to Starknet must learn the complexities of Cairo. Movement Labs is another L2 developer who is allowing smart contracts to be written using the Move language which appeals to developers who know want to learn Move. And for those who are more familiar with the programming language of Solana called Rust, Eclipse is building a Layer-2 blockchain that runs in a Solana Virtual Machine. This is even expanding to other languages like Web Assembly, as Fluent has created a general-purpose L2 which supports WASM.\n\n3. Layer-2s User Experience\n\nUser experience is another plank by which Layer-2s compete with each other. The most basic component of this is onboarding assets and removing assets from an L2. For the most part, onboarding is not significantly differentiated between L2s, with the exception that some Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) allow for native assets to be moved to each L2. For example, Kraken allows users to withdraw USDC to Arbitrum and Optimism, whereas Coinbase allows USDC to be ported to Optimism and Base.\n\nFinality\u2014the point at which transactions on an L2 become irreversible\u2014marks a significant divergence in the user experience between Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs). For ORUs, finality occurs after the fraud challenge period ends, while for ZKUs, finality occurs once a state root and its proof have been posted to Ethereum. One consequence of finality differences is withdrawals off of an L2. For an ORU, 7 days must pass before a user can move his or her funds back to Ethereum. For a ZKU, this same process can take as little as an hour, and this depends on how frequently the ZKU posts settlements and proofs, as well as each chain\u2019s safety system. While zkSync posts proofs every 6 minutes and state updates every hour, users must have a 24-hour wait period before assets can be bridged to Ethereum due to zkSync\u2019s safety modules.\n\nCurrent Throughput and Latency\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nWhen users interact with L2s, familiar tools and interfaces are paramount. The adoption of familiar wallets and blockchain explorers from Ethereum to L2s greatly enhances user comfort. This seamlessness is pivotal, as most L2s employ analogous experiences to Ethereum, ensuring a minimal learning curve for those moving across platforms. In the realm of quantifiable user experience metrics, latency and throughput stand out. Latency refers to the time it takes for a transaction to be acknowledged by the network after submission, while throughput measures the network's capacity to handle transactions per second.\n\nThe slowest block time, or Round-Trip Time (RTT)\u2014the duration for a user's transaction to reach the sequencer and for the confirmation to be received back\u2014typically defines an L2's latency. Arbitrum, for instance, boasts the potential for extremely low latency at 0.25 seconds, though actual latency may vary based on geographical factors and the user's proximity to the sequencer, which is speculated to be located in a Silicon Valley data center.\n\nzkSync is noted for having the highest theoretical throughput, capable of processing up to 434 swap transactions per second. However, both latency and throughput are adjustable parameters within L2 networks.\n\nThe current bottlenecks for ZKUs are the speed at which their provers can handle incoming transactions, while ORUs are constrained by the efficiency of their transaction data compression and the rate at which Ethereum can absorb this data. At present, L2s voluntarily limit their throughput in alignment with Ethereum's capacity. If an L2 were to use Ethereum\u2019s block space fully\u2014considering Ethereum's current data cap of about 937.5kb per block plus an additional 375kb from three data blobs\u2014this could theoretically expand to approximately 1.3 MB per block, or 110kb per second.\n\nFor a specific L2 like zkSync, which averages 62 bytes per transaction, fully exploiting Ethereum block space could potentially surge to 1764 transactions per second. In contrast, an ORU like Arbitrum, with an average of 255 bytes per transaction, could reach a processing rate of 429 transactions per second under the same conditions.\n\nFurther increases in throughput could be achieved by integrating a Data Availability blockchain such as Celestia. However, this approach raises concerns about compromising user safety, as alternative blockchains may not offer the same level of security assurances as Ethereum. The choice to expand throughput in this manner is a delicate one, requiring a balance between improved performance and the inherent safety that Ethereum's robustness provides.\n\n4. Layer-2s Trust Assumptions\n\nSource: VanEck Research, l2beat as of 3/19/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nThere are substantial differences in the assurance of safety and liveness that L2s offer users. Safety refers to the blockchain\u2019s properties to ensure that only an account owner can access his/her assets, while liveness refers to the safeguards in place to make sure assets can be utilized. As L2s rest upon a single sequencer who both orders a block and \u201cproposes\u201d it to the L1 (Ethereum) for settlement, the sequencer failure is the chief concern for L2 users. This is because each L2 currently operates a single sequencer, and if it fails, that L2 cannot process transactions. While assets cannot be stolen in the event of an outage, they also cannot be accessed by users until that outage is resolved. At the same time, if a malicious entity is able to take over a sequencer, it is possible they could mint fraudulent transactions to take the assets off an L2. The current point of weakness of all L2s is they each operate only one sequencer and that sequencer is usually centrally operated by the foundation behind the L2.\n\nL2 builders realize the issues posed by sequencer failure or takeover, and some implement novel safety valves. These differ depending on the L2 and its safety. To complicate matters, some of these safety measures open up the possibility for other attack areas. Some of the guard rails created to protect users include allowing users, under certain conditions, to remove assets, submit transactions for the L2 blockchain by using the L1 host, or even propose L2 blocks. Mostly, these conditions occur when there is a clear failure somewhere in the L2 system.\n\nSome L2s are developing frameworks where anyone can be a sequencer as well as allowing for multiple sequencers who each take a turn sequencing. This would be accompanied by people running the sequencers to put up an economic bond (most likely each L2 native token) to create penalties for cheaters. Companies like Espresso, Astria, and Fairblock are examples of projects that are building software for decentralized sequencers. Currently, the L2 Metis is furthest along in pioneering decentralized sequencers on its L2. Metis\u2019s community has recently passed a governance vote that creates the framework for decentralizing its sequencer and allowing for multiple sequencers to exist.\n\nThe next point of trust assumption variation, one we discuss above, is referred to as \u201cdata availability.\u201d While ZKUs provide proof that state updates are correct, ORUs provide evidence to allow anyone to prove that a state update is incorrect. In both cases, however, it is important to understand where the data comes from to generate proofs for either ZKUs or ORUs. Ideally, this data would be readily \u201cavailable\u201d on the L1 (Ethereum) so that anyone could verify the underlying data that generates proof. Blockchains such as Immutable X and Metis, keep full transaction data on other locations. Though ZKUs do not need to post full transaction data, chains like Linea and Polygon zkEVM do, while Starknet and zkSync simply post state differences. Additionally, L2s post the data to Ethereum, while others post it to dedicated data availability blockchains like Celestia. Posting data on other chains arguably makes an L2 less safe than Ethereum because it introduces new trust assumptions.\n\nAnother interesting dynamic for ORUs is that, as it stands, almost none of them allow for fraud-proof. This means that anyone using them is subject to censorship (transactions not going through) by the sequencer. The exception to this is Arbitrum, which allows fraud proofs. But even in Arbitrum\u2019s case, only white-listed entities can submit fraud proofs. ZKUs, on the other hand, rely upon the prover (a different entity from the sequencer) posting proof. In the event that the ZKUs prover fails, some chains allow users to submit their own proofs (just do zero-knowledge math!) for transactions to be included on the L2.\n\nRegardless, Layer-2s have many issues with respect to their trust assumptions. However, they currently have hundreds of thousands of daily active users, so it would seem until there is a major issue, no one will care. To simplify our views on the set of safeguards L2s have in place, we rank them from most risky to least risky and find Arbitrum to be the current, although still inadequate, gold standard.\n\n5. Layer-2s Ecosystem Size\n\nBridged TVL of L2s\n\nSource: Dune @21co as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nThe most important competitive factor of L2s is the ecosystem that each L2 has created. Blockchain is a marketplace of services and digital commodities. The more useful things to do on a blockchain, the more value it will accrue through user transactions, demand for its native token, and network effect. Unfortunately, the metrics that measure blockchain activity do not always properly translate into the value of that blockchain\u2019s ecosystem. Applying Goodhart\u2019s law contends that once a metric becomes important in crypto, there is a higher chance that the metrics become manipulated. This rule becomes even more ironclad when we consider airdrop farmers (see our third paragraph from our January Monthly for an explanation) who are generating meaningless activity to receive a free airdrop of token value.\n\nGenerally, what matters are users who are willing to bring value to a blockchain to engage in meaningful activity to generate fees. In that respect, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast have shown they have ecosystems that matter to users as those users have bridged $16.3B, $7.85B, and $2.43B to each respectfully. For the most part, Layer-2s have generated user interest and activity through airdrops of their native tokens. Optimism, for example, has given away nearly 25% of its current floating supply to users in the form of airdrops for activity. Arbitrum has given away over $1.84B in tokens to individuals who have used Arbitrum. Blast has leveraged this concept even further to attract bridged value on the premise that there may be an airdrop of tokens from Blast itself, as well as teams who are building on Blast. Conceptually, Layer-2s compete by giving away, for free, tokens whose value grows as each L2 network grows.\n\nFully Diluted Value (FDV)/Revenue and Market Capitalization (MC)/Revenue\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 3/21/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nBy measure of the trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue to fully diluted valuation (FDV) multiples, each L2\u2019s multiple exceeds Ethereum\u2019s by a fair margin. However, this dynamic changes if we alter the multiple to being based upon floating token supply rather than fully diluted value. This is an odd disconnect that relates to the release schedule of L2 coins \u2013 most L2 projects have only released a fraction of their supply. Realistically, we see L2s trading more on speculation of long-term value accrual rather than current revenue dynamics. We attribute this dynamic to the potential for substantially more future revenues to occur on L2s than on Ethereum.\n\nWe expect L2 revenues to exceed Ethereum\u2019s because Ethereum cannot match the transaction throughput or user experience of L2s. We also increasingly see a state where the general-purpose roll-ups market is consolidated by a few major players. This is due to the network effect of both on chain application composability and shared value. It is also attributed to roll-up frameworks, like the OP Stack or Arbitrum Orbit, becoming dominant and the OP/ARB token accruing value from other L2 or even Layer-3s (blockchains that submit state to the L2s). It is also clear that most roll-ups will eventually move towards the zero-knowledge framework (ZKU) due to its many advantages.\n\nLong-term, we still believe that Ethereum blockspace will be expensive, and one result may be that many L2s consolidate proofs to a unified proving layer that \u201crecursively\u201d combines all proofs of its layer constituents. This may be particularly true in the case of application and sector-specific roll-ups. An example of what a concept may look like is Polygon\u2019s Aggregation. Conceptionally, something like an \u201cAgg Layer\u201d may also vastly improve user experience because it would be more economical to post proofs and state roots often enough to allow for bridging across L2s and Ethereum in seconds rather than hours.\n\nAccordingly, we see cutthroat competition amongst L2s where the network effect is the only moat. As a result, we are generally bearish on the long-term value prospects for the majority of L2 tokens. The top 7 tokens for L2 collectively already have $40B of FDV, and there are many strong projects that intend to launch over the medium term. This means there is potentially $100B more in FDV in L2 tokens coming to market over the next 12-18 months. It seems a bridge too far for the crypto market to absorb even limited amounts of that supply without massive discounts. Additionally, while there are reasons to believe that some L2 tokens will become valuable, the pathways to value accrual are harder to project than they are for other crypto sectors. This is particularly the case since L2 tokens are not even the base money in their own ecosystems.\n\nBeyond the dominance of a few roll-ups among general-purpose L2s, we forecast a future of thousands of use-case-specific roll-ups. These L2 will be segmented by sector, application, or function. Businesses will likely build roll-ups explicitly as their own revenue and/or cost centers like building an asset management Layer-2 chain. Other types of chains may be specifically geared towards hosting a whole sector, such as a roll-up that hosts a social media network, as well as applications that want to build products and services for that social media network.\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Valuation Prediction by 2030\n\nWe find our 2030 valuation for the L2 space by applying an FCF terminal multiple to our expectations of future cash flows. We estimate the revenues that feed these cash flows by:\n\nTransactions Revenues (inclusion of transactions on a blockchain) Estimating the revenue TAM of end markets that could utilize public blockchains Calculating the amount of TAM that will actually use public blockchains Forecasting the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s market share public blockchains Applying take rates on end market revenues that utilize Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem for settlement and transactions Splitting the transaction value between Ethereum and L2s MEV (ordering of transactions on blockchain) Estimating the value of assets including currency, securities, and digital assets that will be secured by Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem Project DEX volume on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem by applying an asset turnover estimate to our forecasts for the hosted asset value of the Ethereum ecosystem Multiplying DEX volumes by an MEV take rate to arrive at total MEV value Splitting the value between Ethereum and its L2s\n\nL2 Valuation - Base Case Ethereum Ecosystem Smart Contract Market Share 60% L2 Economics Estimated Revenue 2030 ($M) $48,659 Global Tax Rate on Crypto 15% Sequencer Cut 1% Value to Tokenholders in 2030 ($M) $40,947 FCF Terminal Multiple 25 L2 FDV 2030 ($M) $1,023,681 L2 Projections Transaction Value on L2 90% Ecosystem TVL Layer 2 90% L2 Token MEV Capture (Split to L2) 100% L2 Transaction Capture (split to L2) 66% MEV Revenue MEV LT Take Rate on DEX Volume 0.02% LT L2DEX Volume/TVL Ratio 12 MEV Value Accrual to Token 95% Crypto Terminal Market Share Base Finance, Banking, Payments 5% Metaverse, Social and Gaming 20% Infrastructure 10% Ethereum Ecosystem Value Capture of End Market Revenue Finance, Banking, Payments 3% Metaverse, Social and Gaming 10% Infrastructure 5%\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/21/2024.

        "content": "Dubai, UAE, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As we navigate through the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, the horizon is bright with predictions of substantial growth for leading tokens. Among these, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the innovative newcomer Option2Trade (O2T) are set to experience remarkable surges in their value. With industry experts forecasting Bitcoin to hit $110,000, Ethereum to reach $6,000, and O2T to skyrocket to $100 before the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation. This article delves into the factors behind these bold predictions and what they mean for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Trailblazer's Trajectory to $110,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) , the original cryptocurrency, has always been a bellwether for the market. Its journey from a novel idea to a global financial phenomenon is nothing short of spectacular. The prediction of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $110,000 is rooted in its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Institutional investment, the halving events that reduce the supply of Bitcoin over time, and increasing global economic uncertainties all contribute to its bullish outlook. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to position itself as digital gold, its trajectory towards $110,000 seems not only plausible but inevitable.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Setting the Stage for $6,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) has carved its niche as the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, contributing significantly to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), promises improved scalability, security, and sustainability. These enhancements, coupled with the ongoing development within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, provide a solid foundation for ETH to climb to $6,000. As more developers and enterprises adopt its technology, Ethereum's influence and value are expected to soar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): The Dark Horse Racing to $100\n\nOption2Trade (O2T) emerges as the dark horse in the crypto race, with predictions placing its value at an astonishing $100 before Q4 2024. This A.I-driven trading platform distinguishes itself by democratizing access to sophisticated trading strategies and market insights, traditionally reserved for the realm of high-frequency trading firms and hedge funds. By leveraging artificial intelligence, O2T can analyze market data in real-time, predict trends, and execute trades with precision, offering an unprecedented advantage to individual investors. The potential of A.I in transforming the trading landscape, combined with O2T's innovative approach, sets the stage for its meteoric rise to $100.\n\nDriving Factors Behind the Predictions\n\nTechnological Advancements: For all three cryptocurrencies, continuous technological innovation is a key driver of their predicted price increases. BTC's enhancements in scalability, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) transition to Ethereum 2.0, and O2T's application of A.I in trading are pivotal developments.\n\nAdoption and Integration: The growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by institutions and their integration into traditional finance, along with O2T's potential to attract a new demographic of traders, contribute significantly to their bullish forecasts.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Sentiment: The cyclical nature of the crypto market, historical trends, and current investor sentiment play crucial roles in shaping these price predictions. The anticipation of increased demand against a backdrop of limited supply, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) , underpins these optimistic valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is poised for significant growth, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Option2Trade (O2T) leading the charge. As we look towards Q4 2024, the predictions of BTC reaching $110,000, Ethereum (ETH) climbing to $6,000, and O2T soaring to $100 reflect not just speculative optimism but a belief in the fundamental value and potential of these digital assets. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming months present an unparalleled opportunity to be part of a financial revolution that continues to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale:\n\n\n\nUse promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonus\n\nVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\n\n\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\n\n\nhttps://t.me/O2TOfficial\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Why the Ethereum Community Is Up in Arms Against a Proposal to Change the Monetary Policy - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum researchers claim that a high staking ratio is bad for the network as well as for ETH as an asset. They\u2019re proposing a solution, but is it worth the cost?\n\nA significant discussion to reevaluate Ethereum\u2019s token issuance model has stirred debate over the future of ETH staking economics.\n\nAs Ethereum sees an upward trend in ETH staking, projections suggest this could lead to a majority of ETH being locked in staking contracts, prompting concerns over the network\u2019s future dynamics. In response, Ethereum Foundation researchers Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling have introduced a proposal to tweak Ethereum\u2019s issuance policy to maintain a balanced staking ratio, aiming to prevent potential negative effects such as inflationary pressures on non-stakers and centralization risks.\n\nHowever, this solution has sparked a contentious debate within the Ethereum community, with some members voicing strong opposition against altering the monetary policy in a way they believe could undermine Ethereum\u2019s foundational principles and its appeal to institutional investors.\n\nAs James Spediacci tweeted, \u201cIt almost seems like a coordinated attack on Ethereum that a few people are suggesting adjusting the ETH issuance curve again and changing the monetary policy when the SEC currently has Ethereum under a microscope.\u201d\n\nThe Amount of Staked ETH Has Been on the Rise\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake 18 months ago, known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the dynamics of ETH staking have shifted dramatically. Currently, about 31 million ETH, roughly 26% of the total supply, are staked. This figure has been on an upward trajectory, from 11% at the time of the Merge and 15% at the time of the Shapella upgrade, which enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain in April 2023.\n\nThere are several drivers behind the progressive increase in staking, including the overall improvement in the network\u2019s security and stability, innovations like liquid staking providers that lower the barrier to entry for staking, and the enticement of additional rewards. Notably, these additional rewards include those from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), as well as opportunities for airdrop farming, which add to the attractiveness of staking beyond the primary consensus layer rewards.\n\nStaking Demand Will Continue to Increase\n\nThe staking ratio is set to increase in the upcoming months and years, as highlighted in a blog post by Mike Neuder from the Ethereum Foundation, due to five reasons:\n\nAppreciating ETH Price: An increasing ETH price makes staking more attractive due to higher USD-denominated yields.\n\nRestaking Demand: Platforms like EigenLayer are driving interest in restaked ETH , with the potential for airdrops adding to the appeal.\n\nInterest Rates: Lower interest rates could shift institutional capital towards staking for better yields.\n\nLiquid Staking Tokens (LST)/Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT): These tokens lower the barrier to staking and are expected to attract significant capital inflows.\n\nStaked ETH ETFs: The possibility of Ethereum-based ETFs, which include staking in their model, could introduce a substantial new audience to staking.\n\nWhy a High Staking Ratio Might Be Bad\n\nHowever, the prospect of a continually increasing staking ratio raises several concerns.\n\n\u201cWe argue that high staking ratio regimes come with negative externalities that affect ETH holders, (solo) stakers, as well as the protocol itself,\u201d they wrote in the proposal.\n\nDietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling\u2019s analysis points out potential issues with nearly all ETH being staked, particularly with a significant portion being locked in LSTs such as Lido\u2019s stETH, Coinbase\u2019s cbETH, or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. According to the authors, a scenario where the staking ratio approaches 100% is troubling for several reasons:\n\nReal staking yield will diminish: As the staking rate approaches 100%, real yields from staking could drop to zero. Although rewards from the protocol continue, the total supply of ETH increases at the same rate, effectively nullifying real gains for stakers.\n\nETH will become \u201cexpensive\u201d money: High staking rates could make holding ETH costly due to increased inflationary pressure on non-stakers. When lots of ETH is staked, people who don\u2019t stake see the amount of their ETH decrease proportionally compared to those who do stake. This could undermine ETH\u2019s role as a cost-effective and trustless asset on the Ethereum network.\n\nThreat to ETH\u2019s status as default currency: The expensive nature of holding ETH might challenge its position as the default currency of Ethereum, leading to friction in transactions and a shift towards alternative tokens or protocols. People might start using other tokens that give them rewards, like Lido\u2019s stETH, for daily use. This means ETH might not be the main currency people use on Ethereum anymore.\n\nRisk of centralization and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d entities: A few dominant staking tokens like Lido, which currently has 30% of all staked ETH, could amass excessive influence over Ethereum\u2019s underlying protocol, posing risks to the network\u2019s decentralization and governance. So, if there\u2019s a smart contract vulnerability in Lido\u2019s cost, and they represent the majority of the network, in theory, they could fork the chain to avoid their losses.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nTo mitigate these risks, on February 21, Ansgar and Caspar proposed a recalibration of Ethereum\u2019s issuance curve, which involves a shift towards Stake Ratio Targeting, a nuanced approach that aims for a balanced staking ratio instead of a fixed quantity of staked ETH.\n\nThe proposed change aims to decrease the incentive for new staking inflows by introducing a revised formula for calculating staking rewards. The current issuance curve, defined by a parameterized inverse square root function, doesn\u2019t cap rewards in a way that prevents an excessive total staking ratio.\n\nThe new formula intends to address this by adjusting rewards to discourage staking beyond a certain threshold, thus aiming to stabilize the staking ratio and ensure network security without inviting negative externalities. While the curve might not need to turn negative abruptly to be effective, a gradual approach towards zero rewards past a certain staking level could suffice to target a suitable staking range. For example, under the current issuance curve, at 80 million ETH staked, the nominal yield would be 2%, whereas under a possible revised curve, the same amount of ETH staked could yield 1%.\n\nNevertheless, the authors don\u2019t explicitly say what the ideal staking ratio should be. \u201cIt is inherently hard to objectively reason about it and needs to be discussed more broadly in the community,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling\u2019s proposal, premised on the assumptions that most ETH will eventually be staked, predominantly through Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), is fundamentally about steering the network towards an inevitable future under controlled terms. They argue that as staking becomes increasingly prevalent, the staking rewards will naturally diminish under the current issuance curve.\n\nBy proposing a change in the issuance curve now, while the staking ratio is still relatively low, they aim to adjust the incentives in a way that preempts the potential negative outcomes of an excessively high staking ratio. This proactive approach seeks to maintain the balance and health of the Ethereum ecosystem by ensuring that the transition towards higher staking ratios does not compromise the network\u2019s security, dilute ETH holders unnecessarily, or disadvantage solo stakers.\n\nNegative Community Reaction\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation researchers intended to initiate a discussion, the community was up in arms, with the majority signaling that this was not a good idea for Ethereum to pursue.\n\nEric.eth, a co-author of one of Ethereum\u2019s most important improvement proposals (EIP-1559), is against changing the curve. \u201cSeeing some growing discussion from researchers and others in the community about tweaking the PoS issuance curve. The general disregard for how hard we\u2019ve worked for a decade establishing ETH being money is concerning. I\u2019ll fight this idea with anything I have,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nHis comments echo some critics who say that frequent changes in monetary policy erode confidence among users and investors, distancing Ethereum from the \u201chard money\u201d characteristic and \u201ccredible neutrality\u201d that underpin its value proposition, in contrast to the perceived stability of Bitcoin.\n\nGnosis co-founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann pointed out that changing the issuance curve \u201cdoes not fundamentally improve Ethereum \u2013 it just shifts incentives from one group to another,\u201d while Jon Charbonneau, founder of DBA, said that \u201cthese tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, altering the issuance curve could dilute Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness as a yield-generating asset for ETFs and institutional investors whose interest in Ethereum is based on its existing \u201cyield\u201d narrative. Similarly, projects built on Ethereum might suffer due to the shift in expectations around monetary policy stability.\n\nRegulatory Risks?\n\nAnother community member pointed out that, in the midst of the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the EF, this move is not smart, as it would imply that the Foundation indeed runs managerial efforts over Ethereum. This is significant because it is one of the prongs of the Howey Test, and the SEC could use it to argue that ETH is a security.\n\nI love and respect EF researchers. We would not be where we are without their precious work and they'll keep on being very valuable. But goddamnit, sometimes, they can't read the room! pic.twitter.com/Lcau6VWpAE \u2014 Jrag.eth (@JimmyRagosa) April 1, 2024\n\nDebate to Continue?\n\nResearcher Emmanuel Awoski criticized those who wouldn\u2019t even engage in a conversation about the issuance curve. He wrote, \u201cToday is a good day to start calling out the trend of anti-intellectualism that\u2019s slowly permeating the discourse around the issuance curve change. Not only are memes like this distasteful, they also represent how low we\u2019ve fallen as a community. Now, EF researchers are getting mocked by people who haven\u2019t spent their days/nights obsessing about solving hard problems. People whose sole contribution to crypto has been \u2018I\u2019ll pour money into some protocol and wait for the numbers to go up\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut negative sentiment has so far seemed to prevail. Ryan Berckmans countered saying that \u201cit\u2019s not anti intellectualism to point out (in meme form or otherwise) that for all its laudable technical rigor, the issuance modification proposal fails to demonstrate an understanding of basic key facets of the change management environment.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Monday, April 3, 04:15 pm ET: An earlier version of this article mistakenly displayed the name of Caspar Schwarz-Schilling as Caspar Schwarz. Unchained regrets the error."

        "title": "Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price falls for a second consecutive day as bears ignite $91.91 million of liquidated positions.\n\nPast gains during the year\u2019s second quarter can be a positive amid uncertainty in SEC's Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin explains key steps for \"The Purge\" on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nDaily digest market movers: liquidations, historical Q2 gains, and The Purge\n\nEthereum's chances of seeing a significant price boost face uncertainty as the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to show any positive sign of approving applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. As a result, much of its price movements in the past months have largely been due to its high correlation with Bitcoin rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin shed almost 6% of its value, triggering similar losses in Ethereum, which has seen more than a 6.7% decline. Losses in the two largest cryptocurrencies saw over $500.6 million liquidated from the entire crypto market in the past 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $7.48 million. The total ETH liquidations sit at $91.91 million, with long positions accounting for $75.1 million.\n\nHowever, historical records show Ethereum may still have a positive second quarter despite the downbeat start. A chart by crypto analyst @ali_charts on X shows Ethereum's Q2 results have always been positive except in 2022, when it recorded a 67.34% loss. According to the charts, ETH's Q2 historical performance has an average of 66.59% and a median of 15.29% in gains.\n\nEthereum returns in Q2 chart\n\nAlthough, he also noted that the \"high probability\" of the SEC delaying approval for a spot Ethereum ETF can cause \"turbulence in the market.\" On the contrary, a green light from the SEC would give Ethereum more institutional backing and exposure to a large number of retail traders, which may cause a rally in its price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided insights that indicate long-term progress for the cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. On Monday, he highlighted in a blog post that a lesser-known Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the EIP-6780, was introduced during the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. He mentioned that EIP-6780 is a huge part of what he terms \"The Purge.\"\n\nThe Purge would help \"slim down Ethereum and clear technical debt,\" said Buterin. In essence, it would shift workload from the main chain, reducing the computational and technical resources of running an Ethereum node while boosting decentralization and security in the process, Buterin said.\n\nIn other news, Vitalik Buterin reposted on Tuesday a former blog post he wrote squashing Layer 3s that serve the same purpose as L2s. He mentioned that L3s only make sense if they serve a different scaling purpose from an L2.\n\nAlso read: Vitalik Buterin announces next step in simplifying Ethereum protocol, ushers in the Purge\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH could fall below $3,000\n\nIn an analysis on Monday, @ali_charts said in an X post that Ethereum could crash to $2,800 if it breached the $3,400 support level. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,362.1. However, another X user noted a strong historical bidding at the $3,200-$3,000 area.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis aligns with earlier predictions by FXStreet analyst Akash Girimath, who stated that Ethereum's price could sweep the range low at $3,054 if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity run."

        "title": "Mastering Crypto Investing: A Guide to Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Furrever Token (FURR)in the Face of Market Turbulence - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a world where cryptocurrencies represent not just a form of currency but a burgeoning ecosystem of innovation and community, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Furrever Token (FURR) stand as beacons of the varied paths digital currencies can take. As ETH and SOL navigate through the choppy waters of market volatility and technical resistances, FURR emerges with a promise of novelty and community-centric appeal, charting a course towards a different kind of success. This juxtaposition of the established giants against an up-and-coming contender like FURR highlights the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the crypto market, illustrating the diversity of strategies and outcomes within this digital frontier.\n\nEthereum's Struggle: Failing to Break $3,650 Resistance Amid Market Volatility\n\nEthereum (ETH) navigates a stormy sea in today\u2019s unpredictable crypto market, feeling the ripple effects of Bitcoin's recent downturn. Efforts to surpass the formidable $3,650 resistance barrier have yet to bear fruit, stirring anxieties within the investment community.\n\nAfter a stern rebuff at the $3,650 milestone, Ethereum's valuation took a steep dive, breaching successive supports at $3,550, then $3,500, and $3,450, before stabilizing around the pivotal $3,320 mark. Despite a flicker of resilience, with values inching above $3,360, the path to recovery is fraught with hurdles, notably staying above $3,500 and the critical 100-hour Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance looms at $3,400, with a more daunting challenge at $3,420, just shy of the trendline. Should Ethereum conquer the $3,450 resistance, a surge towards $3,720 might be on the horizon, pending a decisive breach of $3,650. Yet, ambitions of reaching $3,880 hang in balance, contingent on overcoming these obstacles.\n\nThe immediate future for Ethereum is laced with uncertainty. Failure to breach the $3,420 mark could precipitate a further descent, with initial support pegged at $3,320. Dropping below this threshold could target lower supports at $3,250 and, more critically, at $3,220. With technical indicators like the hourly MACD signaling waning momentum and the RSI stuck below 50, the outlook leans bearish. Nonetheless, surmounting the $3,420 hurdle could ignite a recovery, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the gloom.\n\nSolana's Market Dynamics: A 9% Dip Contrasted with $4.6 Billion TVL Growth and Investor Optimism\n\nSolana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a 9% decrease in its trading value, now hovering around $179. Despite this dip, the ecosystem around Solana remains vibrant, evidenced by a remarkable increase in total value locked (TVL) in its decentralized applications (dApps), exceeding $4.6 billion. This boost, driven largely by the meme coin craze, marks a significant leap in the platform's adoption, hinting at a bright future for SOL's pricing trends.\n\nThe premium on the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) showcases an enduring optimism among institutional investors towards SOL, reflecting a strong conviction in the long-term viability and expansion of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nYet, SOL faces challenges in overcoming the $197 resistance level, with its price oscillating around $184. Although it has seen some upward movement, sustaining gains above $197 remains a challenge, pointing to immediate hurdles in price stability.\n\nSOL\u2019s price movement is influenced by a combination of factors, including significant transactions, technical analyses, and market sentiment. Notable large-scale transfers to Coinbase, amounting to more than 800,000 SOL, suggest potential market pressure that could lead to selling. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicate a slowdown in purchasing momentum, possibly foreshadowing a price drop. Furthermore, a decline in derivatives market interest hints at a temporary softening in SOL\u2019s market strength.\n\nDespite these short-term challenges, the underlying strength of Solana's ecosystem and the continued interest from investors suggest resilience and the possibility of a recovery in SOL\u2019s value. As the market conditions evolve, investors are encouraged to consider these dynamics carefully while navigating Solana's fluctuating landscape.\n\nEnthralling the Digital Economy: Furrever Token's Pre-Launch Success with $614K and a Vibrant Cat-Themed Community\n\nAmidst the ongoing fluctuations that have challenged stalwarts like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the Furrever Token (FURR) makes a remarkable entry into the cryptocurrency arena, bringing with it a wave of novelty and enthusiasm. In a time when the crypto giants are facing instability, FURR carves out its niche with an innovative and delightful approach centered on cat motifs, offering a refreshing oasis in the digital currency landscape.\n\nFurrever Token is not merely a means for transactions; it embodies a vision aimed at infusing the cryptocurrency ecosystem with positive vibes and a sense of unity.

On the verge of its launch, Furrever Token is ready to soar in the crypto domain, captivating hearts and minds with its distinct allure and promising prospects for growth.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe stories of ETH, SOL, and FURR within the cryptocurrency market are tales of persistence, innovation, and community.

        "content": "VanEck believes that Ethereum\u2018s Layer-2 protocols will hit a collective $1 trillion market capitalization by 2030, according to a new research report published on April 3.\n\nThe prediction was revealed in a detailed analysis led by VanEck senior investment analyst Patrick Bush and head of digital research Matthew Sigel.\n\nVanEck\u2019s forecast of a $1 trillion market cap for Ethereum Layer-2s by 2030 reflects a belief in the technology\u2019s potential to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, marking a notable shift in the landscape of digital assets and their underlying technologies.\n\nSolving scalability\n\nThe investment firm\u2019s analysis assessed the burgeoning Layer-2 ecosystem across several critical dimensions: transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumptions, and ecosystem size.\n\nAccording to the report, Layer-2 technologies, specifically Optimistic Roll-Ups and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups, are solving Ethereum\u2019s biggest challenge \u2014 scalability.\n\nThese solutions aim to expand Ethereum\u2019s capacity for transaction processing without compromising its core attributes of security and decentralization. The analysis points to the EIP-4844 upgrade as a key development, introducing \u201cBlob Space\u201d to reduce data posting costs significantly, thereby benefiting Layer-2 operations financially.\n\nAccording to the report, the cost reductions enabled by EIP-4844 are pivotal for improving Layer-2 profit margins.\n\nThe report also explored the revenue models of Layer-2 solutions, emphasizing transaction sequencing as a primary source of income. It examined both on-chain and off-chain cost structures, particularly noting the expensive proof mechanisms that Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups employ.\n\nTVL\n\nIn evaluating the competitive landscape, the study predicts that by 2030, Layer-2s will capture a significant portion of transaction value and Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis growth is partly attributed to the potential of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to augment Layer-2 revenues. VanEck\u2019s analysis suggests a future where Layer-2 platforms may offer competitive advantages over Ethereum in specific market segments.\n\nHowever, the report maintains a neutral tone regarding the speculative nature of the crypto market and the uncertain future of Layer-2 token valuations. It anticipates the emergence of numerous use-case-specific Layer-2 roll-ups, indicating a broader application of blockchain technology beyond finance to sectors like gaming, social media, and infrastructure.\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis presents a compelling vision of the future, one where Ethereum Layer-2s evolve from nascent technologies to central cogs in the global blockchain ecosystem."

        "title": "Unveiling The Dynamics Of ETH Value: Understanding Ethereum's Price Movements - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "Understanding the value of Ethereum (ETH) is essential for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. As one of the leading digital assets, Ethereum\u2019s price movements often attract significant attention from investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike. This article aims to provide insights into the dynamics of ETH value, exploring the factors that influence Ethereum\u2019s price and offering strategies for interpreting and navigating its fluctuations effectively.\n\nDeciphering ETH Value\n\nThe value of Ethereum, like any other asset, is determined by supply and demand dynamics in the market. As a decentralized blockchain platform, Ethereum serves as the foundation for a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Consequently, the demand for Ethereum is influenced by its utility as a platform for building and deploying decentralized solutions.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nSeveral factors can influence the price of Ethereum, including market sentiment, technological developments, regulatory news, and macroeconomic trends. Positive developments such as the successful implementation of Ethereum upgrades (e.g., Ethereum 2.0), increased adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and institutional interest in Ethereum can drive up demand and, consequently, ETH value. Conversely, negative news events, security breaches, or regulatory uncertainty may lead to price declines.\n\nMarket Trends and Analysis\n\nAnalyzing market trends and conducting technical analysis can provide valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s price movements. Technical indicators such as price charts, trading volume, and moving averages can help traders and investors identify patterns and potential price trends. Additionally, monitoring on-chain data, including Ethereum\u2019s network activity and transaction volume, can offer insights into the underlying fundamentals driving ETH value.\n\nStrategies for Interpreting ETH Value\n\nFor investors and traders, understanding Ethereum\u2019s value is essential for making informed decisions. Dollar-cost averaging, which involves regularly purchasing Ethereum over time regardless of price fluctuations, is a common strategy for long-term investors seeking to accumulate ETH. Short-term traders may employ technical analysis and trend-following strategies to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nLong-Term Outlook\n\nDespite short-term price fluctuations, many analysts and investors remain optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects. As the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, Ethereum is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, as well as emerging trends such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market entered April on a bearish note with leading digital asset Bitcoin showcasing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. The supply pressure spread across the market tumbled the top altcoins like Ethereum which recorded a 5.7% drop. This downturn breaks the support of week-long consolidation, indicating coin holders may witness a prolonged correction.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Price Prediction: BTC Sheds 2%, ADA & DOGE Drop 5% Amid Pre-Halving Uncertainty\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Faces Key Support Challenge Amid Emerging Bearish Pattern\n\nAmid the recent market consolidation, the Ethereum price wavered in a narrow range between the horizontal level of $3675 and $3445. The price rejection from both sides indicated a clear dominance from bulls and bears toward the asset.\n\nHowever, a deeper analysis of the 4-hour time frame chart showcased the price developing a bearish reversal pattern called double top. The chart setup is commonly spotted at the market top, bolstering a notable correction in the near future.\n\nThus, with an intraday loss of 5.77%, the ETH price gave a bearish breakdown from the neckline support of $3444. Sustaining this breakdown will intensify supply pressure and plunge the altcoin to $3250 or $3057, coinciding with the 38.2% and 50% retracement levels respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Skywards Proposes To Add Ethena\u2019s sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nEthereum Eyes $4500 Target in April Amid Historical Bullish Trends\n\nLooking at the historical data, Ethereum has shown predominantly positive behavior in April, with high returns in five out of the eight years listed. Notable surges in 2017 (+67.77%), 2018 (+70.29%), and 2020 (+55.04%) highlight this pattern, contributing to an impressive average April return of +23.66%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are exceptions, like in 2016 and 2022, when there were significant declines.\n\nAnyhow, if we consider the average return for Ethereum in April, the buyers may drive the asset to a high of $4500 by the end of the month.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBB Indicator: The converging bands of the Bollinger band indicator reflect increasing volatility in this asset.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) lines reflects an active correction trend in play.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it.\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen over $84 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. As ETH price cools off, several interesting factors are playing out within its ecosystem:\n\nEthereum's price has been consolidating on Wednesday following its recent crash. The recent price movement follows Coinbase analysts raising concerns about \"hidden risks\" in restaking protocols and criticism labeled at the Ethereum Foundation after an article recommending adjustments to the ETH issuance curve.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has taken to the X social media platform to revisit his post about layer-3 scaling solutions amid intensifying debates within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin has noted that these solutions \"don't magically improve throughput,\" but they can still be used for cost saving. That said, there are more efficient ways of cutting costs compared to layer-3s, according to Buterin.\n\nIn his article, which was published a year and a half ago, Buterin singled out three main visions for layer-3s: customized functionality for different use cases, customized scaling in various forms, and weakly-trusted scaling in the form of validiums, which are significantly cheaper compared to rollup but offer better security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin acknowledged that all of these three visions were \"reasonable.\" He was skeptical of a three-layer scaling architecture with the same scaling scheme, but the Ethereum co-founder also added that a third layer could work if it has a different purpose. \"Validiums on top of rollups do make sense, even if they're not certain to be the long-term best way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nThe debate surrounding layer-3s\n\nButerin's recent comment came after some prominent community members started debating the viability of layer-3 solutions.\n\nMert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO at Helius, recently opined that L3s were basically \"centralized servers settling on other centralized servers.\" \"The audacity some of you have to call Solana centralized for YEARS just to use literal web servers settling on other centralized web servers is absolutely wild,\" he added.\n\nUniswap CEO Hayden Adams was quick to criticize him, arguing that the Solana community should refrain from posting \"arrogant takes on scaling.\""

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Halving Lead to $100,000? Ethereum (ETH) on Verge of Reversal, Mysterious Solana Price Performance - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin's next halving event is the main fuel for the discussion about its future price, with most people anticipating $100,000.\n\nThe chart shows Bitcoin is currently experiencing fluctuations. If we follow past patterns, Bitcoin might show strong growth after the halving. But, it is also possible that this growth will not be as great as before, considering the market's capitalization and the presence of institutional funds.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is trading around $65,493. It is important to look at the support level at $63,600. This is like a safety net \u2013 if the price does not fall below this, Bitcoin could start the bullish reversal again. The next support level is down at $47,474, which could come into play if the price drops further.\n\nFor Bitcoin's price to reach $100,000, it would need to break past several resistance levels. The first big challenge is around $68,000. If it can stay above this, Bitcoin may continue to rise and possibly reach new highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean for the future? After the halving, Bitcoin could go up in price, maybe even reaching $100,000. However, it might not happen quickly or as strongly as some people hope. It is important to remember that other factors can influence Bitcoin's price and that previous price performance is not a guarantee of a bullish future.\n\nWill Ethereum reverse?\n\nEthereum is showing signs that it might be about to change its direction after a period of falling prices. The chart indicates that Ethereum is now close to the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. This could be a sign that a reversal, where the price starts to go up again, might happen soon.\n\nWhen we look at the specific numbers on the chart, the 50 EMA is right near the price level of $3,300. If Ethereum's price can stay above this line, it is a good hint that the price could start rising. On the other hand, if the price falls below 50 EMA, it could be the continuation of a descending price trend.\n\nRight now, Ethereum's price is hovering around $3,324.9. The next big resistance level is at $3,500. If the price of Ethereum can go past this point, it could be the start of a climb back up to even higher levels.\n\nIn general, the market is doing okay, so there might not be too much to worry about right now despite the correction we are seeing. However, Ethereum's growth factors for now are mostly layer 2s and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF, which will most likely be the only major capital injection Ether will see during this market cycle.\n\nSolana's weird behavior\n\nSolana's price moves have been quite mysterious lately. After breaking out of a pattern known as a symmetrical triangle, which often leads to a price rally, we saw a few days of gains. But then, surprisingly, the price did not enter a bull trend. Instead, we saw a bearish reversal, where the price started to fall again, which was not the most expected show out there.\n\nOn the chart, Solana's price had risen above the triangle formation, reaching up to about $210. However, instead of continuing upward, it faced resistance and could not maintain the momentum. The price has fallen back to around $180.59, leaving many traders with losses and a lot of questions.\n\nLooking closer, we can identify the key support level at $148.48, which is a price that could potentially stop further drops and help turn things around. If the price falls below this level, the next support is way down at $129.67, showing that there is quite a bit of room for a potential downside.\n\nOn the other hand, if Solana's price can find some strength and start to go up again, the key resistance level to watch is around $213 \u2013 a price from the previous breakthrough."

Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Dogecoin , Cardano, and Toncoin were trading in the red, while Solana, Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Internet Computer, Litecoin, and NEAR Protocol were trading in the green.At 11:30 a.m., Bitcoin was trading 0.6% lower at $66,290 after a dip to the $64,500 region, while Ethereum was down 1.8% at $3,302.Meanwhile, the decline in the crypto market was also influenced by recent U.S. economic data, particularly strong manufacturing and labor market readings, which have raised the possibility that the Fed might postpone rate cuts.\"Bitcoin slipping below $65,000, marking its lowest point since March 24th, comes amidst a Dollar index surge fueled by robust U.S. factory data,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.\"Bitcoin's ability to maintain levels above $65,000 is crucial to mitigate further declines, with a breach possibly leading to a descent towards $63,500. Conversely, surpassing the $68,000 threshold could pave the way for Bitcoin to target the $71,000 resistance zone,\" Edul added.Meanwhile, CoinDCX Research Team, said, \"In the past 24 hours, the crypto market experienced a downturn without a clear catalyst. Factors such as BTC ETF outflows and a large transfer of seized BTC by the US government contributed to the decline.\"The global cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.36% to around $2.5 trillion in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently $12.06 billion, 9.66% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $116.84 billion, which is 93.54% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell to $1.3 trillion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.15%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours fell 10.3% to $46.7 billion.\"Bitcoin's technical indicators reflect current market conditions. The hourly MACD shows a loss of momentum within the bearish zone. BTC/USD's hourly RSI has dipped below the pivotal 50 level, indicating a potential downtrend. Major support levels are identified at $65,200 and $64,500, while notable resistance levels stand at $66,000, $67,200, and $67,950. Traders are closely monitoring these levels for potential market movements,\" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President WazirX."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent report by CoinShares, the digital asset investment landscape has shown signs of recovery, with total inflows reaching $862 million last week. This nearly offsets the previous week's record outflows of $931 million. Despite the encouraging recovery, the report indicates a slowdown in ETF activity, hinting that the initial market hype might be cooling down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) emerged as a major player on the digital asset market, recording inflows of $865 million last week. This renewed interest is attributed to new ETF issuers in the U.S., which contributed $1.8 billion in inflows. However, these gains were partially offset by Grayscale's outflows of $967 million. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $2 million.\n\nThe standout performer on the altcoin market last week was Solana (SOL), which saw an impressive $6.1 million in inflows. This surge reflects growing investor confidence in Solana's blockchain platform and its potential to offer innovative solutions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, this surge in inflows for Solana aligns with a bullish trend in SOL's price performance.\n\nDespite experiencing a 6.52% dip in the last 24 hours, bringing the Solana price down to $182.49, the cryptocurrency has shown impressive resilience and growth. Over the past 30 days, Solana has surged by 40.33%, demonstrating rising confidence and optimism in the platform's capabilities and future prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum struggles amid altcoin surge\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced its fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $19 million. This pattern is often observed following major network upgrades, indicating investor apprehension about the success and stability of these updates.\n\nOutside of Solana, altcoins witnessed a total inflow of $18.3 million last week. Other notable performers included Filecoin (FIL) with inflows of $3.9 million, Polkadot (DOT) with $2.4 million, and Chainlink (LINK) with $1.9 million. The latest data from CoinShares underscores the dynamic and often divergent nature of the digital asset market."

Analysts at the crypto trading firm QCP Broadcast said on Tuesday that the liquidations in the derivatives market signaled the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price decline below $66,000 and Ethereum (ETH) price drop to $3,320.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana-based meme coins yielded gains in the past day despite the market-wide correction.\n\nOptions market predicts correction in BTC, ETH prices\n\nBitcoin price declined to as low as $66,000 early on Tuesday on Binance, one of the largest centralized exchanges. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly dropped to $3,319, and cryptocurrencies suffered $157 million in liquidations.\n\nAnalysts at QCP Broadcast said in a Telegram post that the speed of Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price decline on Tuesday was due to large-volume liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges. Further, the perpetual funding rate on platforms like Binance dropped from as high as 77% to flat, stressing asset prices in the spot market.\n\nBTC/USD 15-minute price chart\n\nQCP Broadcast analysts expect Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to trade sideways after the correction.\n\nMeme coins gain from whiplash in Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe correction in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices was followed by likely capital rotation into meme coins as Solana-based assets noted double-digit gains on Tuesday. Data from CoinGecko shows Tombili the Fat Cat (FATCAT), catwifbag (BAG), BaoBaoSol (BAOS), Cat in a dogs world (MEW) and Book of Meme (BOME) prices rallied between 10% and 52% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana-based meme coins\n\nIn the ongoing market cycle, meme coins have yielded consistent gains for traders during corrections in large assets. However, they have also registered sharp corrections afterwards. Meme coins are typically more speculative than other cryptocurrencies and investors need to be careful of rug pulls, pump and dump schemes and mass sell-offs when trading these tokens."

        "content": "In the last 30 days, Ethereum is down by 4%. Notwithstanding this, ETH holders demonstrate a tendency for liquid restaking protocols to be preferred over the likes of the traditional platform of Lido Finance. The data collected by the Dune Analytics dashboard, developed by researcher Hildobby, points to a substantial change. It shows that Lido Finance has the biggest outflow of Ethereum (ETH) regarding other peers withdrawing more than 284,800 ETH.\n\nLido, however, remains the leader in the Ethereum staking market, with a share of 29.7%. The flow of stakers is in the direction of platforms with liquid restaking options. These, among others, include Ether fi and Renzo Protocol, which received an impressive amount of inflows. Ether fi and Renzo have received over 400,000 and 280,100 Ether, respectively, making them the preferred platforms for stakers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Stakers Prefer Eigenlayer\u2019s Flexible Solutions\n\nEther fi and Renzo are currently the largest liquid restaking platforms identified by DefiLlama. Fi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) is $3.1 billion. At the same time, the investments in Renzo exceeded $2.1 billion. In total, users have locked over $8 billion in these protocols. This tendency shows a certain dominance of platforms that use mutually exclusive capabilities of Eigenlayer, thus providing for wider staking opportunities.\n\nMoving from Lido to Ether fi and Renzo is a characteristic of the increasing popularity of Eigenlayer points among the participants of DeFi. These liquid restaking protocols use the Eigenlayer framework to allow stakers of their ETH to assist other networks and solutions. This approach came into favor when the Ethereum blockchain changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September 2022.\n\nEigenlayer Expands Use of Staked ETH Widely\n\nWith the transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, the staking practice was revolutionized. Stakers are involved in securing the Ethereum chain by depositing the ETH with validators. Eigenlayer has evolved this model by enabling the staked ETH to be employed across a larger range of protocols and chains that are interconnected with Ethereum.\n\nRead Also: ProShares Introduces First Bitcoin ETF To Target 2x Daily BTC Return\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 3: The Miracle Solution for Vitalik Buterin? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 02 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nEthereum remains a major player in the blockchain space, but challenges in scaling persist. Recently, Vitalik Buterin has reignited the debate on \u201cLayer 3\u201d while discussing promising lighter alternatives for cost optimization. Let\u2019s explore these avenues brimming with opportunities for the future of Ethereum.\n\nDecrypting Layer 3 in Ethereum\n\nLayer 3, or additional layers, are built on top of existing Layer 2 scaling solutions. They raise many questions about their true contribution. Indeed, they can reduce certain fixed costs associated with batch settlements and deposits/withdrawals. However, they do not \u201cmagically\u201d improve the overall transaction throughput. Therefore, their real added value in optimizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the long term should be carefully assessed. Moreover, adding this extra layer raises legitimate concerns about its potential complexity.\n\nFurthermore, some question the possible trade-offs between cost reduction and other crucial factors such as decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nThe Emergence of Lighter Alternatives\n\nHowever, in his recent statements, Vitalik Buterin highlighted the existence of lighter alternative approaches capable of offering similar cost savings to those promised by Layer 3. In other words, there may be simpler and more effective solutions. These could solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues without adding a complex new layer. Although few concrete details have been provided so far, this perspective opens the door to promising new thoughts.\n\nIndeed, lighter solutions could potentially offer better compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s existing architecture. This would facilitate their adoption and integration. Moreover, they might prove easier to understand, develop, and maintain for the developer community.\n\nIn the face of scaling challenges, Ethereum must choose its path wisely. Layer 3 promises cost reduction but raises questions about their complexity and compatibility with foundational principles. The lighter alternatives mentioned by Vitalik Buterin, although not detailed, offer promising avenues for potentially simpler and more flexible solutions.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "The US Dollar\u2019s strength is one of the reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) is showing weakness. A spike in buying pressure for the Greeback suggests that the market is risk-off, which could result in a negative impact on risky assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nSolana\u2019s (SOL) price falls sharply on Tuesday, influenced by the steep decline in Bitcoin prices, even though the altcoin registered $6.1 million in inflows from institutional investors last week. While the recent meme coin frenzy may have benefited Solana and attracted capital last week, a recent drop in on-chain activity and a slowdown in inflows could be behind the recent price decline.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Ethereum could see its market structure flipped bearishly upon a descent below $3050.\n\nThe momentum and selling pressure were rising steadily and could force more losses.\n\nThe past 24 hours saw a strong wave of selling pressure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] noted losses of 7%-8% each, and a deeper drop appeared likely. The $3.5k level was a key short-term support for ETH.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that a bear pennant formation was brewing. If it came to fruition, a drop to $2.8k could be on the cards. Will the bears fulfill this prediction?\n\nThe bear pennant or the demand zone- who will win this round?\n\nAMBCrypto highlighted the pennant formation in white. Based on the length of the flagpole, a drop to $2.6k could commence. The $2.8k-$2.9k was a region where ETH consolidated in February before its push beyond $3k.\n\nHence, it could serve as support on the way down and repulse the bears. The $3.1k region was also a lower timeframe bullish order block which saw a significant reaction from the price earlier this month.\n\nThe trading volume has decreased over the past two weeks as Ethereum formed a bearish pattern. The break beneath the rising trendline confirmed the pattern was playing out. A fall below $3056 will flip the market structure bearishly on the 12-hour chart.\n\nEthereum was undervalued, but should you rush to buy it now?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of some of Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics noted positive findings for investors. The 30-day MVRV ratio has been below zero since 18th March, showing an undervalued asset.\n\nYet, the mean coin age, which had trended downward since the 9th of February, began to trend higher.\n\nTogether, it was a strong buy signal. However, this signal is not a short-term one. Risk management needs to be formulated based on technical analysis as well, and at press time, the bears have the advantage.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nComparing the network growth in March to January, it showed that an increasing number of new addresses were created on the network.\n\nThe total Open Interest fell alongside the price to indicate short-term bearish sentiment. However, the evidence at hand showed that a drop to $3.1k or $2.6k would still present a buying opportunity for long-term holders."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has laid out new steps for Ethereum's 'Purge' to improve the blockchain's efficiency.\n\nIn a blog post written by Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder detailed how upcoming initiatives, known as The Purge, will refine the protocol.\n\nThe Purge removes excess and obsolete network history to simplify its process while introducing new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to streamline operations and security.\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nEIP-6780 is central to the Purge and aims to reduce \" the functionality of the 'selfdestruct' opcode, which destroys the contract that calls it and empties its code and storage, so that it only works if the contract was created during the same transaction. \"\n\nEliminating the selfdestruct code will enable each Ethereum block to have more storage slots.\n\nBuilding upon Ethereum's recent update, Dencun, the blockchain will see Ethereum blocks being removed from Ethereum nodes through EIP-4444.\n\n\u201cPotentially, if each node stores small percentages of the history by default, we could even have roughly as many copies of each specific piece of history stored across the network as we do today,\u201d Buterin said, attaching a meme to his blog post:\n\nBy reducing the amount of storage needed to run an Ethereum node will in turn reduce the amount of people required to do it. EIP-4444 simplifies the workflow of node operators and increases Ethereum node decentralization.\n\nA LOG reform is proposed by Buterin to address inefficiencies in decentralized applications.\n\n\u201cOur current mechanism is too slow, pushing dApps towards centralized solutions. By simplifying the LOG opcode and leveraging ZK-SNARKs, we can create a more efficient and decentralized framework for accessing logs,\u201d Buterin says.\n\nHe also announced that Ethereum consensus layer is moving to SimpleSerialize (SSZ).\n\nSSZ offers simplicity, efficiency, and compatibility with various applications. It offers shorter and more efficient Merkle proofs, ensuring better performance and reducing computational load.\n\n\"These efforts are about more than simplification; they\u2019re about ensuring Ethereum\u2019s resilience and adaptability in the face of future challenges,\u201d Buterin concludes.\n\nAs Ethereum improves its technical capabilities, institutions are highly anticipating the SEC's approval of ETH ETFs.\n\nA few days ago, Bitwise filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC but expressed hope for the regulator to delay their decision until the end of the year."

        "title": "Is Solana EVM Compatible and What Does It Actually Mean? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing blockchain platform, has been turning heads in the crypto industry because of its remarkable scalability and transaction speed. However, one aspect that has grabbed particular attention is Solana\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). If you also want to know whether Solana is EVM compatible, then keep reading.\n\nThis exhaustive piece explores what Solana EVM compatibility means, its advantages, and practical applications.\n\nUnderstanding EVM\n\nThe EVM is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized computer featuring a sandboxed environment, meaning that it operates independently of the host computer system.\n\nThe EVM allows for the deployment and execution of arbitrary algorithms in a series of opcodes. Moreover, it provides the backbone for the decentralized apps (dApps) that are the hallmark of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn simpler terms, the EVM serves as a large, global, decentralized computer. Each smart contract is like a \u201cprogram\u201d that runs on this computer. Every Ethereum node runs its own EVM instance. This ensures that all computations are performed consistently. Consequently, the state of the blockchain remains synchronized across all nodes.\n\nWhy would you only learn about blockchains when you could be building one? Get started today.\n\nSolana and EVM: A compatible match\n\nThe Solana EVM serves as a bridge, letting dApps and transactions designed for the Ethereum network run seamlessly on the Solana blockchain as well. This compatibility layer means that Ethereum developers can transition their dApps to Solana without modifying any code.\n\nBuilt on the high-speed Solana blockchain, which can handle as many as 65,000 transactions per second, the Solana EVM offers far greater speed and scalability compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second.\n\nWhy is Solana\u2019s user activity plunging lower? Find out today.\n\nEVM compatibility: A game changer for Solana\n\nEVM compatibility is a significant breakthrough for Solana. This interoperability is a much-needed step towards addressing one of the biggest challenges that the crypto industry faces today.\n\nEVM compatibility brings about time savings, reduces knowledge transfer costs, and cuts back on development requirements. It attracts users, talent, and innovation from the Ethereum ecosystem to other blockchain platforms.\n\nThe boons of Solana EVM\n\nSolana EVM offers various benefits, including:\n\nEfficient scaling: Thanks to the Solana network, Web 3 developers can enjoy low gas fees and high throughput. This is due to its parallel processing (Sealevel) and unique innovations like Proof-of-History. The mechanism enables 400ms block times.\n\nIntegration with Solana ecosystem: Ethereum developers and creators have the opportunity to leverage Solana\u2019s robust ecosystem. This includes its developer community, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. They can either migrate to or expand their applications with the use of Solana EVM.\n\nUsing familiar tools: EVM developers can continue using tools that they are already comfortable with. These include tools like MetaMask, Truffle, and Waffle, ensuring a seamless developer experience.\n\nAdapting smart contracts easily: Existing Ethereum dApps can be ported over to Solana Programs (i.e., Solana smart contracts) without any reconfiguration of the underlying smart contracts.\n\nDemocratizing access: Lastly, by using a Solana EVM, the users, talent, and innovation of the Ethereum ecosystem can easily adapt to projects on both blockchains.\n\nThe force behind Solana EVM\n\nNeon Labs is the company that developed the first EVM on Solana. The Neon EVM is a cross-chain solution that allows dApp developers to leverage the benefits of Solana to expand their services, offering new products like arbitrage or high-frequency trading, growing their user base, and reducing costs where possible, including gas fees.\n\nIts ERC-20/SPL wrapper is an implementation of the ERC-20 interface for SPL tokens that ensures Solana applications interact with Neon EVM contracts.\n\nGetting started with Neon EVM\n\nTo kickstart your journey with Neon EVM, the fastest route is to set up MetaMask and link it to the NeonEVM devnet either via Chainlist or by manual configuration. Developers eager to delve deeper can consult the Neon EVM documentation for further insights, and they can acquire test NEON tokens by utilizing either the NeonFaucet website or its API.\n\nThe future of blockchain with Solana EVM\n\nThe emphasis on EVM compatibility is poised to catalyze a new wave of multi-chain applications, strengthen network collaboration, and elevate the user experience as the focus shifts toward more scalable solutions. As the landscape evolves, the union of Solana and Ethereum ecosystems via EVM compatibility offers an intriguing glimpse into the future of blockchain tech. For developers keen on harnessing Solana\u2019s capabilities, the timing couldn\u2019t be better to delve into this cutting-edge platform and discover its vast potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum it up, Solana being EVM compatible signifies a significant leap in the blockchain ecosystem. It brings together the robustness of Ethereum with the efficiency of Solana.\n\nAs the crypto industry strives to resolve its scalability and interoperability issues, the advent of Solana EVM might just be the solution it needs. The future of blockchain technology looks promising with such innovative approaches. Lastly, it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s next on the horizon."

        "content": "Ethereum-based Layer-2 (L2) protocol COTI has announced the launch of its V2 whitepaper which is focused on boosting confidentiality on the underlying network.\n\nCOTI Network To Live Up To Web3 Expectations\n\nAccording to COTI, this newly launched whitepaper offers a guide to the fastest and lightest confidentiality L2 on Ethereum. The whitepaper showcases the revolutionary breakthrough that has been recorded in the blockchain encryption niche. It also describes the innovative implementation of decentralized sequencers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNoteworthy, this is not the first time COTI is pushing for confidentiality on the Ethereum blockchain. At the beginning of 2024, the Israel-based blockchain development firm made a strategic move with the launch of an Ecosystem Growth Fund targeted at accelerating Ethereum privacy. This equally marked the beginning of the push to accelerate the development and adoption of COTI V2.\n\nCOTI V2 white paper is here!\n\nYour guide to the fastest and lightest confidentiality L2 on @ethereum, this white paper describes the revolutionary breakthrough in blockchain encryption and our innovative implementation of decentralized sequencers \ud83e\uddf5\n\n\ud83d\udc49https://t.co/G3BapUUGCN 1/12 pic.twitter.com/6pQG1qDBzu \u2014 COTI Foundation (@COTInetwork) April 2, 2024\n\nCOTI regards confidentiality as a core human right. It is strongly believed that confidentiality was very crucial for the early adoption of Web2. This was a time when individuals enjoyed the privilege of private conversations, associations as well as transactions.\n\nThe protocol noted that with the coming of Web3.0 which focuses on data sharing and user empowerment, there are some paradoxical challenges linked to users\u2019 privacy that the V2 upgrade hopes to address.\n\nCOTI V2 Engine To Boost Confidentiality\n\nThe Web3.0 ecosystem has been putting structures to effectively navigate the intricacies that exist between individual privacy and the inherent blockchain transparency. Unfortunately for Web3.0, its success lies in the capacity to boost confidentiality.\n\nCOTI V2 brings a new approach to optimizing performance without compromising on confidentiality.\n\nThe protocol achieves this dual function by engaging a unique combination of well-established privacy-preserving technologies, with the main ingredient being a Garbling Protocol. It is interesting to note that the upgraded Garbled circuits offer as much as 1000x faster computation and 250x smaller storage requirements compared to other solutions such as FHE. This is in addition to its 100x lower latency.\n\nAnother feature coming to COTI is gcEVM, an innovative extension of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that is designed by Soda Labs. Its key function is to reinforce blockchain transactions with confidentiality and this translates to secured computations on encrypted data. In the long run, the protocol would be able to boast of data privacy and efficient functionality.\n\nDespite this update, COTI token has kept its joined the broader market slump, dropping 6.2% in 24 hours to $0.1637.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Ethereum saw healthy growth in on-chain activity.\n\nEthereum shrimp and plankton refused to sell their holdings.\n\nEthereum [ETH] rallied by 82% from 1st February to 12th March. Since then, it has retraced as low as $3056 before bouncing higher, trading at $3533 at press time. This resembled the consolidation phase in the second half of January.\n\nAMBCrypto examined some relevant metrics and found a few similarities. These hints highlighted a bullish bias and a healthy network overall.\n\nThe peaks in volume and active addresses\n\nEthereum rallied from $1521 to $2717 from 12th October 2023 to 12th January, a 78% move. It retraced for close to three weeks before breaking above the lower timeframe resistance at $2380.\n\nJust before the ETH price slump, the trading volume peaked to levels not seen in over six months. The daily active addresses also shot upward, nearly reaching September 2023\u2019s highs.\n\nThe surge in activity was understandable as bullish sentiment was intense. This spurred increased demand for ETH and drew in more participation. During the retracement, the daily active addresses remained high.\n\nThe trading volume, on the other hand, slumped drastically. This was quite similar to what happened over the past three weeks. In March, the daily active addresses made new highs even after prices plunged to the $3100 mark.\n\nMeanwhile, the on-chain transaction volume formed a local peak during the January and March highs. The retracement period saw a brief decline in the transaction volume, followed by a quick recovery.\n\nThe transaction volume of the past week was low, but otherwise, the metrics closely mirrored what happened in the latter half of January.\n\nThis comes alongside ETH bulls forcing a quick recovery after falling to $3056. We might see a bullish continuation in April as we did in February.\n\nThe supply distribution showed whales were buying\n\nWhen smaller holders sell their assets to whales, it is typically a bullish sign. The Ethereum supply distribution chart showed this but with a caveat. Wallets with 1k to 10k ETH and 100k to 1 million ETH slowly trended higher after 12th March.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nShrimp holders also grew, such as those with fewer than 0.1 or 1 Ethereum. The 1 to 1k bracket shrunk steadily. This showed that medium-sized holders were selling their holdings while whales and shrimp alike continued to accumulate the assets.\n\nThe 10k-100k ETH bracket also trended downward, which went against the bullish inference. It showed that accumulation and distribution were not black and white, but small ETH holders were increasingly HODLing."

        "content": "Year-to-date inflows went into digital asset funds reached $13.13 billion.\n\nBitcoin, Solana were high on demand, while Ethereum saw outflows.\n\nDigital asset funds were back to winning ways last week, spearheaded by strong investments into the newly-launched Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETFs in the U.S.\n\nStrong recovery\n\nAs per data shared by James Butterfill, Head of Research at crypto asset management firm CoinShares, about $862 million in net inflows was recorded across institutional crypto products\n\nThis was a sharp rebound from the $942 million in outflows seen a week earlier.\n\nThe latest capital infusion propelled year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $13.13 billion. For context, this was nearly 25% higher than the total inflows recorded in 2021 \u2014 the year of the crypto market\u2019s last bull run.\n\nDuring the week, the total assets under management (AuM) swelled to $98 billion, marking an increase of 11% from the week before.\n\nAUM is an important performance gradient of a fund. The higher the value of AuM, the more investments it tends to attract. AUM depends on the inflows and the market value of the underlying asset.\n\nLast month, the AUM hit $100 billion for the first time in history, as Bitcoin smashed to its all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. However, subsequent price correction caused the AUM to drop to current levels.\n\nBitcoin remains institutions\u2019 favorite\n\nOn expected lines, Bitcoin-linked funds led the charge, pocketing $865 million in inflows last week. With this, total inflows since the beginning of the year rose to an impressive $12.8 billion.\n\nThe surge could be attributed to strong demand for U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted $860 million in inflows last week.\n\nRobust inflows into new ETFs led by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT helped offset outflows from incumbent issuer Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, which has been bleeding since transitioning to an ETF.\n\nEthereum loses, Solana gains\n\nOn the other hand, funds tied to second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum [ETH] saw outflows worth $19 million last week. The bearish sentiment likely flowed from lower chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nSolana-based investment products witnessed inflows of $6 million last week, spurred by impressive price performance of the native asset SOL."

        "content": "A new meme coin, CHUCK CHUCK/USD, built on Ethereum ETH/USD, surged 25,800% in value only hours after its launch on Tuesday, eclipsing the performance of top meme cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Data from Dexscreener shows CHUCK with a market capitalization of $4.16 million, with liquidity reported at $488,100. The circulating supply of CHUCK tokens stands at 42 billion, with a total holder count of 361 individuals.\n\nAt the time of writing, DOGE and SHIB were up 2-4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trading volume for CHUCK in the last 24 hours has reached over $6.62 million.\n\nThe official website for CHUCK describes the meme coin as \u201cthe strongest of all memes. Dogs, frogs, cats, and shady players\u2014your time is over! CHUCK is here to save the meme-fest and claim his top spot in the meme hierarchy.\"\n\nMoreover, the website clarifies that the meme coin has no formal association with the martial artist and actor Carlos Ray \u201cChuck\u201d Norris Jr. or his representatives. The site notes that \u2018CHUCK\u2019 is: \"Inspired by the legendary internet saga surrounding Chuck Norris, created by fans to celebrate the spirit of his character.\"\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nWhy It Matters: CHUCK differentiates itself by launching on the Ethereum network, unlike many other meme coins that have found a home on the Solana blockchain, carrying the slogan: \"Make Ethereum Great Again.\"\n\nThe Solana blockchain is well-known for its promise to deliver faster and more cost-efficient transactions than its competitors, such as Ethereum.\n\nIt has become a platform for hosting meme coins like dogwifhat WIF/USD, Bonk BONK/USD, and Book of meme BOME/USD. These tokens primarily derive their value from their viral appeal on the internet. However, the meme coin trend has boosted Solana with increased activity and liquidity, it has also exposed some of the network\u2019s technical issues, leaving investors and several traders disappointed.\n\nCHUCK's launch on ETH is due to its extensive and vibrant community of users and developers, which lays a perfect foundation for the growth of meme coins and leads to strong collective support for these assets.\n\nMoreover, as a time-tested blockchain, Ethereum ensures a trustworthy and robust framework for conducting meme coin transactions\u2014a vital aspect for attracting investments and maintaining the continuity of these initiatives.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of the top meme coins, Such as FLOKI, SHIB, and PEPE, are Ethereum-based.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, CHUCK was trading at $0.0001006.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

This long-awaited approval has led to a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, driven by increased interest from traditional investors eyeing these products.\n\nWith the Bitcoin ETFs paving the way, major players in the cryptocurrency world like Blackrock and Fidelity are actively seeking approval for their ETF applications with the SEC. However, hopes for Spot Ethereum ETF approvals have dwindled, contrary to earlier projections expecting SEC approval by May 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Status in Question\n\nRecent reports from Fortune suggest that the SEC is contemplating an investigation to potentially classify Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, as a security. This investigation has led organizations associated with the Ethereum Foundation to receive subpoenas requesting detailed documentation and financial records.\n\nAs a result, applicants such as Hashdex and ARK 21 Shares find themselves in limbo, awaiting the SEC\u2019s final decision expected in May.

Despite a recent dip in Ethereum\u2019s price to $3,484, reflecting a modest decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours, Credible remains steadfast in his long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\nI made a mistake here. I was looking at fully diluted valuation for XRP.\n\n\n\nReality is at current circulating supply a 10k ETH is equivalent to a $20+ $XRP.\n\n\n\nSo if you think $10 is impossible for XRP but 10k ETH is realistic for ETH you need to check your bias real quick.\n\n\n\nBoth\u2026 https://t.co/IPsElR7xBx \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 31, 2024\n\nA Surge Incoming?\n\nShifting focus to XRP, Credible anticipates a potential breakthrough, suggesting XRP could surpass the $10 mark. He points to XRP\u2019s past achievement of surpassing Ethereum\u2019s market cap in a previous market cycle, indicating the possibility of significant gains for the altcoin.\n\nWith XRP currently trading at $0.614, Credible\u2019s forecast underscores the resilience of XRP, despite occasional setbacks, and hints at imminent new highs.\n\n$BTC probs going to continue ranging for a few more days at least. Bids now capping price on the downside (or attempting to) the same way asks were capping upside earlier. OI is building up though so we should get some nice volatility once we break out of this range. pic.twitter.com/zIF3DjlfES \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 29, 2024\n\nBitcoin is Building Momentum!\n\nAll eyes are on Bitcoin\u2019s next move, especially with the looming halving event. While initial projections speculated a surge beyond $80,000 before the halving and even higher figures afterward, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory has been less predictable. However, Credible remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term prospects, despite potential short-term fluctuations.\n\nIn the near term, Credible suggests Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways for a brief period. He notes a consolidation of bids, indicating potential support levels, coupled with a buildup of open interest, hinting at imminent volatility once the market breaks out of its current range.\n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading at $68,508, investors eagerly await clarity on the market\u2019s direction.\n\nThis Might Interest You: Top 10 Altcoins for Biggest Returns in 2024\n\nMarket Pullback Soon?\n\nExploring the recent market pullback, Kristian Haralampiev, Nexo\u2019s Structured Products Lead, attributes the downturn to profit-taking by investors capitalizing on peak market conditions. Haralampiev highlights increased cryptocurrency volumes flowing into exchanges, particularly from short-term traders enjoying profits, as per data from Glassnode.\n\nDespite the unexpected pullback amidst expectations of Bitcoin scaling new heights, both Credible and Haralampiev view it as an opportune moment for latecomers to enter the market ahead of the next Bitcoin halving event."

        "content": "Investors in the DeFi project, CBDAO (BREE), are scratching their heads after it became evident that the people behind the project have vanished. The project\u2019s website, Telegram group, and Twitter handles are no longer online, with the total lost funds exceeding over $1 million in ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, the BREE token which had traded as high as $50 in early September was trading at a $0.43 price, representing a 99.1% decrease from that all-time high.\n\nCBDAO exit scam\n\nAccording to information from its now-deleted website, CBDAO dubbed the \u201cUltimate DAO sandbox\u201d was a DeFi project that promised investors up to 30% APR. BREE tokens can be earned via farming and staking, with the project aiming to deliver a Governance as a Service (GaaS) solution that allows new decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to bootstrap their governance processes.\n\nAs per a detailed Medium post by a supposed investor, \u201cthe team had been developing the project and meeting deadlines,\u201d and even \u201cpushed a new website the night before the attack.\u201d\n\nThe team had announced a token swap for users to swap BREE tokens for Synthetic Bree (SBREE) tokens, and it was a backdoor on the newest token contract that the attacker exploited. They minted 50,000 SBREE, converted to BREE, and dumped onto the open market in fourteen separate transactions for roughly $60,000. That was in ETH addition to the roughly $1 million that the project initially raised, leaving investors bewildered about why the paltry sum was the last act of the exit scam.\n\nWill the identity of CBDAO founders be uncovered?\n\nWith the project existing for as long as two months, investors claim to have uncovered the identity of some of its founders and have already reached out to law enforcement agencies. Other crypto exchanges that reportedly did business with the CBDAO team, including Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex (listed SBREE), Somish Labs, and Etherscan (advertiser), have been contacted.\n\nMeanwhile, angry investors who lost thousands of dollars to the CBDAO exit scam created a Telegram group vowing to uncover the identity of the project\u2019s founders.\n\nSee Also: Degen DeFi User Farming UniCats tokens Ends up Losing $140,000 UNI tokens to Exploit"
