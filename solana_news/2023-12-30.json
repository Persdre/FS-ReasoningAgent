        "title": "It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

But when it comes to looking out for the future of your career, even the busiest of developers should understand how important it is to stay current with the newest developer trends. Blockchains have, quite simply, revolutionized many spaces thanks to the implementation of dApps. But can blockchains stay at the forefront of revolutionizing technology if it becomes stagnant? Blockchain primitives will have a huge impact on the ever-changing development of distributed ledger technology, and it will all boil down to one thing: protocols.\n\nPublic blockchains involve active participants (miners, validators, node operators etc.) to contribute towards the common goal of strengthening the network and confirming transactions through some sort of distributed consensus algorithm.\n\nWith the rising popularity of cryptocurrency, the rise of a new generation of crypto-lovers has also fueled the growth of a new beast: non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe way the world interacts with visual art is changing.

When I started developing Solidity smart contracts and Ethereum dapps in 2017, Truffle and Web3.js were the industry standard. These are great tools and I have tons of respect for the people that built them. However, anyone who has used them has dealt with bugs and sometimes poor developer experience.

The roughly 5-year-old project has emerged as one of the most exciting and proven projects in the cryptocurrency space while somehow still encompassing the most risk and arguably, upside of any crypto-project. This dichotomy has allowed Ethereum to act as a sort of magic mirror for those in the industry. Fanboys and detractors alike can look into the project and see what they want to see: the 2nd-most successful crypto-project with product-market fit and an army of developers behind it or a nascent, experimental Frankenstein so complicated it would make Rube Goldberg blush.\n\nImage Credit: UnsplashThe endless possibilities of cryptocurrencies have seen a lot of businesses show interest in the token economy and the overall blockchain space.\n\nMost of the applications on Ethereum are micro-financial ones where the price per ticket ranges from $100 \u2014 $1000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply is becoming scarce while demand is rising. Here's what you need to know.\n\nHow the Internet Computer promises to serve as a decentralized, scalable layer for Web3 and blockchain-based gaming.\n\nThe future is now, it's 2020 and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are experiencing a Cambrian explosion.\n\nTypically in an enterprise, you have top-down hierarchies as the mechanism of control. Let's look at a quick example of how a DAO works differently in action.\n\nImagine you\u2019re building a startup, except at this startup, there is a clear sense of organization without humans organizing other humans. It all runs organically, and it's generative in nature, meaning it evolves, innovates and experiences high growth from within.\n\nLeaderless leadership!\n\nHow is such a way of working together achieved?\n\nThrough active participation from interested parties who share common values, missions and objectives. People-driven autonomous organizations happen mostly through voting on decisions that are proposed by other community members.\n\nYou can propose, vote and discuss decisions as a team without having to have a singular authority to report to. Resulting in new ideas being seeded and proposed from within the organization to solve mission-critical challenges that the DAO is facing.\n\nIt's really a synthesis of innovation and ambition, it's great!\n\nWith that said there are certainly some balanced benefits and drawbacks about this model that we should explore.\n\nFor the moment DAOs function in a fairly binary nature, you vote on proposals that you or others have submitted, typically these votes take place on blockchains by signing a transaction with your crypto wallet. That means the current state of DAOs is experiencing the highest growth in the blockchain industry. So whilst DAOs are now, they might be somewhat gravitating around the future of money.\n\nHowever crypto-centric it is right now, it is definitely laying out an exceptional framework that any organization type could be built upon. We are seeing many other non-crypto DAOs emerge too, using platforms like Aragon to create a DAO in minutes on the blockchain. This is achieved by creating a Governance Token on the Ethereum blockchain. When users hold these Governance Tokens they can vote on proposals put forward to the community.\n\nThese communities can even have treasuries where the DAO can organize their finances. For example, members that hold these Governance Tokens can suggest making a payment, creating a vote inside the community so it can be approved or denied collectively.\n\nThere are many lessons to learn about how to coordinate large groups of self-interested people.\n\nI recently wrote an article, \"Failure shows us the way\", where I outlined my thesis on how I think we can even coordinate groups who don't explicitly share the same values, they instead just share the same mission. It's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds with the DAOs that are experimenting right now.\n\nWhy are DAOs exploding right now?\n\nBasically there is an entire unstoppable movement happening because of projects offering up a Governance Token as a bonus to those who are using some Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nI've heard many stories from folks achieving incredible results in less than 5 days. For example, \"With YFI I earned like $3.5k on $24k\", one community member shared with me.\n\nThat example is a 14.58% increase in capital in just five days, no wonder it's getting attention.\n\nWait, how are people making money from these Governance Tokens?\n\nIn the DeFi world, there is a new meme known as Yield Farming \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf3e its technical name is Liquidity Mining.\n\nThis is where a user deposits crypto stablecoins like USDC, DAI & USDT to earn a reasonably safe and secure return, which lately seems to be roughly 8% APY. As well as this, these DeFi applications which have newly formed their own DAOs to oversee their protocols, are rewarding users with Governance Tokens when they have funds deposited into their various DeFi products.\n\nThis has added rocket fuel to the DeFi community, with an explosive $3 Billion USD flowing into projects in just the last couple of weeks. This doesn't stop here either, there are many more DAO innovations that will be made known during this wave of Governance Tokens. One example is Referral Yield Farming, where you can earn Governance Tokens for referring people to DeFi platforms without having to deposit any funds of your own.\n\nArt101 announced a Vitalik Buterin NFT collection 'Based Vitalik'\n\nThere is no doubt that the crypto space is growing at a very rapid pace, but no one can ignore the scams that are prevalent in this ecosystem. If we just go back a few years, more than 80 percent of the ICOs were identified as outright scams in a study conducted by the ICO advisory firm Statis Group.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin is the most well-known name in the Ethereum space, the birth of Ethereum was a collaborative effort, as were later developments like ERC-20. Fabian Vogelsteller is one-such early Ethereum developer and thought leader on blockchain technology. He has built many Ethereum user and developer-facing projects including the Ethereum Mist browser, the Ethereum Wallet and web3.js - the Ethereum\u2019s space most used JavaScript library.\n\nTogether with Vitalik Buterin, he proposed the ERC20 token standard, which initiated the world ICO wave and redefined investment and crowd ownership as we know it. Today Fabian is leading the concept, design, and development of the LUKSO Blockchain.\n\nPolkadot is a radically different approach to blockchain scaling.

Here's everything you need to know about the ethereum gas limit debate.\n\nThe other day I got myself in a situation where I needed to communicate with the Ethereum network using python in an environment where getting web3.py to work seemed pretty much impossible. Since I still needed to talk to the network, I resorted to using the JSON-RPC API provided by Ethereum, which all web3 libraries are built on top of. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty interesting! So, let\u2019s get started!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for a while, then you\u2019ve surely heard the phrase \u201cwe just need a killer app\u201d to get crypto into the mainstream. Now, as you\u2019ve most likely also noticed, many of the current decentralized applications that are out there have great ideas backing them \u2014 perhaps even revolutionary ones \u2014 so why aren\u2019t any of these dApps achieving widespread use? Why aren\u2019t they, or one of them, the \u201ckiller app\u201d that we need? I certainly don\u2019t think the gambling dApps topping the daily usage tracking charts would constitute such an app.\n\nCompanies can determine whether they should invest in blockchain by focusing on specific use cases and their market position.\n\n\u201cI need a no-code platform to build my own web3 product!\u201d Is that you?

Despite being a gateway into the world of decentralized finance, centralized exchanges are very\u2026well\u2026centralized in nature and hide many of its intrinsic mechanics from the scrutiny of public blockchains. Not surprisingly, ten years after the creation of Bitcoin, the internal architecture of centralized exchanges remains a mystery to even the top experts in the crypto market.\n\nPhoto by Cl\u00e1udio Luiz Castro on Unsplash\n\nCentralized exchanges are, arguably, one of the most challenging components to analyze in the crypto-asset markets. While the behavior of many actors in the crypto space is transparently recorded in distributed ledgers, centralized exchanges still operate largely off-chain only publishing subset of the activity to the corresponding blockchains. Without a doubt, centralized exchanges introduce a level of opacity that challenges even the most sophisticated analytic techniques. And yet, the analysis of the behavior of centralized exchanges can yield many interesting benefits for crypto investors and traders. Imagine that you are able to effectively track large crypto transfers between exchanges that can anticipate a large position on a specific crypto asset. All that, however, requires understanding the underlying patterns in centralized exchanges.\n\nThe global healthcare crisis caused by COVID-19 has severely impacted the financial markets.

Even better, you can use an augmented bonding curve to fund your DAO, thanks to the amazing work by the Commons Stack folks, and there you have it! A fully-functioning DAO with just a few days of work!\n\nAfter the global economic crisis of 2008, the question of trust in the modern international financial system arose globally. The answer to this request was the emergence of the first decentralized Internet system \u2014 Bitcoin, which from \u201cdecentralized\u201d money turned into a valuable financial asset by 2020.\n\nI guess the first question is, Why? Why should an internet community become a DAO?\n\nAll but the simplest of Ethereum applications are composed of several smart contracts. This is because of a hard limit of 24KB in any deployed contract, and because your sanity will slip away as the complexity of a smart contract grows.\n\nCentralized crypto exchanges are the most important black box of the crypto ecosystem. We all use them, we have a love-hate relationship with them, and we understand very little about their internal behavior. At IntoTheBlock, we have been heads down working on a series of machine learning models that help us better understand the internal of crypto exchanges. Recently, we presented some of our initial findings at a highly oversubscribed webinar and I thought it would be elaborate further in some of the ideas discussed there.\n\nThe following are not my beliefs, but a compilation of notes from conversations I had with a self-described Bitcoin \u201cmutant\u201d, named Edan Yago, contributor to Sovryn. Letting him ramble on about Bitcoin resulted in mesmerizing, mythical, and fascinating ruminations about Bitcoin\u2019s destiny. So for one, I myself believe in Bitcoin as a digital store of value. It is a huge chunk of my portfolio, and I believe it will outlast 99% of the cryptocurrencies we have today. There is no better symbol of scarcity and hard money in crypto to date. However, I feel just about the same level of admiration for Ethereum, as it is opening up so many use cases through DeFi and DAOs. I am putting my biases aside to explain a very rare (and what I find fascinating) point of view. I present you Part 1 of The Hero\u2019s Journey of Bitcoin:\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s called Vyper, not Viper.\n\nThe go-to blockchain for decentralized finance is still Ethereum (ETH).

Ethereum was designed with a broader vision, as adecentralized or world computer that attempts to marry the power of the blockchain, as a trust machine, with a Turing-complete contract engine. Although Ethereum borrows many ideas that were initially introduced by bitcoin, there are many divergences between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine and smart contracts are key elements of Ethereum, and constitute its main attraction. In Ethereum, smart contracts represent a piece of code written in a high-level language(Solidity, LLL, Viper) and stored as bytecode in the blockchain, in order to run reliably in a stack-based virtual machine (Ethereum Virtual Machine), in each node, once invoked. The interactions with smart contract functions happen through transactions on the blockchain network, with their payloads being executed in the Ethereum virtual machine, and the shared blockchain state being updated accordingly.\n\nblockchains offer the simplest means of keeping self-audited immutable records without having to use any third party service.\n\nMany of us have come to know about decentralized finance (DeFi) and have faced this sector with many doubts, understanding its potential, especially given the interests and the APR and APY it provides to those who interact with the various protocols.\n\nThe #creatoreconomy is changing quickly with the influence of #NFT #Crypto and #blockchain.\n\nThe two latest thrilling things in the Ethereum ecosystem are NFT and DeFi.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale has recently made a huge purchase of 25,674 ETH; however, this action could backfire if the price of ETH falls below a specific threshold, triggering a liquidation event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom all indications, it appears that the whale obtained the said ETH from MakerDAO. This decentralized lending platform allows users to mint stablecoins (DAI) by locking up their crypto assets as collateral.\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,257, the smart money will be in danger of liquidation.\n\n\n\nThe healthy ratio on #Maker is as low as 1.03.\n\n\n\nThe smart money once again spent 61M $DAI to buy 25,674 $ETH, and then sold 5,851 $ETH for 14M $DAI, making ~$99K.https://t.co/yGkFI6qpnj pic.twitter.com/VRmstUCngE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 29, 2023\n\nLookonchain reports that the whale had spent 61 million DAI to buy 25,674 ETH; however, the whale shortly after sold 5,851 ETH out of this stash for a value of 14 million DAI, of which they made a profit of $99,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the whale had made some profits from this strategy, they also faced the risk of liquidation. If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "title": "The Year Of Ethereum: ETH Long-Term Holder Percentage Surpasses BTC - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The percentage of long-term ETH holders has skyrocketed this year to surpass Bitcoin for the second time ever. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has done pretty well in its percentage of long-term holders this year, with over 70% of investors currently holding on to their assets for more than a year, a new milestone for the blockchain.\n\nETH Long-Term Holders Now Top BTC\n\nEthereum\u2019s price activity has largely underperformed this year when compared to Bitcoin. But this isn\u2019t surprising, as Bitcoin has led the entire industry in bullish metrics and investor confidence this year. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggest more Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH for the long haul, hopefully with the belief that it will continue to rise substantially in value over time.\n\nLong-term holders are investors who refuse to sell their crypto even during times of market volatility and price depreciation. They are particularly important in maintaining the overall health of any blockchain, as they help to provide stability and reduce price volatility.\n\nHistory has shown Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin as regards this metric only once before. It\u2019s important to note that the last time this happened, ETH would go on to lead in this metric over the subsequent months.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, In/Out of the Money metric by IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin leading Ethereum in terms of profitability. At the time of writing, 82.25% of all BTC addresses are making money at the current price, compared to 76.10% of ETH addresses.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high profitability can be linked to a huge number of early Bitcoins assumed to be lost forever. As a result, the percentage of holders who bought at the current price metric puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $1.6 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAround 63% of ETH addresses who bought around the current price of $1,948 and $2,641 are still in profit compared to BTC\u2019s 52% of addresses that bought between $35,729 and $48,402.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $2,285 and is up by 91% this year. However, the asset\u2019s price has largely underperformed in comparison to major altcoins like Solana and Cardano, who are currently up by 925% and 145% respectively this year.\n\nInterestingly, this hasn\u2019t stopped bullish predictions from coming in regarding Ethereum. One of these is a prediction from BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, who estimated an astounding $5,000 price for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Raoul Pau also looked at price history to predict ETH outperforming BTC becoming a key macro trend of 2024. The first step in achieving this would be to break above the $2,380 price level.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026 I think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nFeatured image from Pexels"

        "content": "Google Trends Highlight Solana's Surging Interest\n\nIn an intriguing turn of events within the cryptocurrency sector, Solana has garnered significant attention, surpassing Ethereum in Google search interest for the first time in 2023. This surge in curiosity reflects the dynamic movements within Solana's ecosystem and hints at changing trends in the crypto community.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum: A Shift in Search Dynamics\n\nThroughout most of 2023, Ethereum maintained a considerable lead over Solana in terms of search interest. However, the period from December 17 to December 23 marked a pivotal change, with Solana achieving a search interest score of 56 compared to Ethereum's 50. Google Trends forecasts that Solana's search interest will reach a peak score of 100 between December 24 and December 30, indicating \"peak popularity for the term.\"\n\nInterestingly, the surge in Solana's search interest is more pronounced in countries like Spain and the Philippines, while Ethereum continues to dominate in regions such as Indonesia, Taiwan, and Morocco.\n\nAssociated Search Trends and Market Movements\n\nUsers searching for Solana have also shown interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk, a dog-themed memecoin, overtook Pepecoin in market capitalization on December 8 after witnessing a 370% monthly gain. Tensor, a Solana-based nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, has created the Tensorians NFT collection, which also experienced significant gains in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana's increased search interest may be partly attributed to the recent rise in the price of its token. On December 20, Solana's market capitalization surpassed Ripple's XRP, with the token price increasing by 13.8%, reaching over $82 for the first time since May 2022. This surge briefly positioned Solana as the fourth-largest crypto token by market cap, surpassing BNB on December 22. However, by December 29, BNB regained its position as Solana's token prices returned to levels seen before Christmas."

That is not the top, that is not their peak,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nNotably, the current market value of Solana stands around $108.75 while XRP which is still below the $1 peg is trading at $0.63, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This would mean an around 1,000% increase for Solana and a 1,100% increase for XRP.\n\nArmstrong outlined a roadmap for his predictions, involving factors such as Ripple\u2019s Initial Public Offering (IPO) and the Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) becoming catalysts for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price surge.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the difference between XRP and Solana\u2019s bull run. Solana has had its run up into the bull. It will continue to do well but it already has massively overinflated numbers. XRP is going to slowly wind up and at the end when the Ripple IPO launches that\u2019s when XRP will go through the freaking roof. Because not only will it have the IPO, it will also have the Ethereum ETF going,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nXRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nXRP To Outperform Solana\n\nIn his YouTube video, Armstrong predicted the future trajectory of XRP up to 2025. His projections revolve around the aftermath of the Ethereum Spot ETF potential launch and the possible introduction of an XRP ETF.\n\nThe crypto influencer expressed confidence in XRP outperforming Solana in the future. This prediction could be attributed to the recent positive developments occurring within the XRP ecosystem including the improved regulatory clarity and the widespread acceptance of XRP in major crypto exchanges and countries globally.\n\n\u201cWhen the ETF gets launched, Ethereum is going to go sky high but what\u2019s gonna happen is people are gonna start thinking about the next coin. What\u2019s the next one that\u2019s gonna get the ETF? This will be in 2025 when this happens. That\u2019s when the XRP gets to long tail at the end of the blow-off top. I think XRP ends the bull run, and Solana starts it,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nFeatured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum Roadmap For 2024 - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA - Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared plans for the Ethereum roadmap for 2024. He acknowledged that there were only minor changes compared to last year.\n\nIn a series of posts on platform X (formerly Twitter), Buterin explained that the focus continues for Ethereum in 2024 centered on six main components.\n\nFurthermore, in a detailed graph with annotations and diagrams, Buterin outlines these six elements the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nHe pointed out that, as Ethereum's technical direction became clearer, there were only a few minor adjustments compared to the 2023 road plan. \"As Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are relatively few changes,\" he said.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KUG\n\nThe Merger is highlighted as a key part of the road plan, aiming to maintain a simple and long-lasting proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge took place, integrating the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake blockchain, Banyak Chain.\n\nFollowing the merger, the most significant observation on Ethereum is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that consumes high energy to PoS, resulting in a huge drop in network total energy consumption.\n\nHe also noted developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF). The finality aims to ensure that changes to blockchain block cannot be reversed without burning at least 33% of the total Ether at stake.\n\n\"The role of the single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvements is getting stronger. It is clear that SSF is the easiest path to solve most of the current Ethereum PoS design weaknesses,\" he said.\n\nThis comes after Cointelegraph recently reported that Buterin wanted to restore the original idea of a \"cypherpunk\" revolution to blockchain.\n\nCypherpunk refers to someone who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing computer networks, especially from government authorities.\n\nIn a post blog, Buterin explains that Ethereum was originally idealized as a \"public decentralized shared drive\" that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage.\n\nHowever, the vision began to fade in 2017 by turning towards financialization on Ethereum.\n\nButerin highlighted that rollups, proof of zero knowledge, account abstraction, and second generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream. He noted that this could support certain values related to the principle of cypherpunk.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.
