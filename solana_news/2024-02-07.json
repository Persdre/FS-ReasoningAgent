        "title": "SEC may be forced to declare Ethereum a security after controversial new launch - Fortune",
        "content": "Prometheum plans to announce on Wednesday the launch of custodial services for Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $280 billion market cap is second only to Bitcoin\u2019s. The move may be part of a larger strategy by the crypto firm to get regulators to identify Ether as a security\u2014a position widely unpopular among industry peers.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has avoided taking a position on Ethereum\u2019s legal status even while declaring more than a dozen other popular cryptocurrencies to be securities. The latest gambit by New York\u2013based Prometheum, which claims it has discovered a compliant path for crypto within existing laws, could force the agency\u2019s hand.\n\nLegal experts have told Fortune that Prometheum\u2019s plan to launch its custodial service may compel the SEC to resolve the long-running Ethereum question. If the agency does indeed proclaim Ether to be a security, Prometheum could be in a pole position when it launches its planned trading platform next quarter\u2014even as the rest of the industry insists crypto can\u2019t be viable without new laws.\n\nA controversial new player\n\nLongtime crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken offer trading platforms in the U.S., allowing users to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. While many of the firms have been around for more than a decade, they still operate outside the regulatory framework of the existing financial system, which has led lawmakers to propose new rules for the industry.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has stepped up enforcement after the disastrous collapse of FTX, has said existing rules are sufficient and filed lawsuits against exchanges for failing to register with the agency. In response, companies like Coinbase have argued that the existing rules are outdated.\n\nWhile much of the U.S. crypto industry has sided with Coinbase, Prometheum has taken a different\u2014and contentious\u2014approach.\n\nFounded by two brothers, Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum received regulatory approval in 2021 to operate an alternative trading platform\u2014similar to a stock exchange\u2014where users can buy and sell different securities. The company went on to gain widespread attention in mid-2023 when it announced a first-of-its-kind approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014an industry oversight body that\u2019s independent of the SEC\u2014to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. The SEC first created the designation in 2021, but no other firm has succeeded in obtaining a license, though others, including Robinhood, have tried.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claim to have found a compliant path for crypto trading immediately drew condemnation from legal figures in the crypto industry, who argued that even if the SEC and FINRA approved Prometheum\u2019s structure, it would not have any assets available for trading. That is because, skeptics argue, the SEC has jurisdiction over securities, while cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ether are more like oil or gold\u2014assets that don\u2019t fit the legal definition of a security and so can\u2019t be registered.\n\nThe Kaplan brothers, in contrast, agree with the SEC\u2019s assessment that most cryptocurrencies are securities. They argue that Prometheum will be able to list different crypto assets as securities under an exemption called Rule 144, which is used to trade restricted stocks, and that they can use blockchain data to determine whether the assets have been in circulation for more than a year\u2014a key factor for the exemption. As an alternative trading system (or ATS), Prometheum will not have to work directly with the issuers but instead can choose which assets to list.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claims have not only riled the crypto industry but Republican lawmakers, who have argued that Gensler had propped up the little-known firm to further his own regulatory agenda. In a June appearance on CNBC, for instance, Gensler touted Prometheum\u2019s registration as a special purpose broker-dealer as an example of a compliant path for the industry. And last June, the company received a prized invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto despite having virtually no presence in the industry.\n\nThe debate over Prometheum\u2019s proposal has until now been theoretical, but Wednesday\u2019s announcement of Ether custodial services, which are slated to launch by late March for institutional clients, means the company is on the cusp of becoming the first crypto exchange to compliantly offer assets like Ether for trading.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with the crypto industry,\u201d Benjamin Kaplan said in an interview with Fortune. \u201cOur goal is not to destroy, it\u2019s not to harm, it\u2019s not to undermine\u2014it\u2019s to help build.\u201d\n\n\u2018Move the ball forward\u2019\n\nIn the traditional world of stock markets, the various steps that make up a trade are divided among different firms. For instance, a retail trader visits a broker like Fidelity to buy a share of Apple stock, leading Fidelity to turn to a broker-dealer like Citadel Securities to fill the order. Next, a firm called the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, figures out who owes what in all the trades the broker has made that day\u2014a process known as clearing.\n\nAt this point, another DTCC subsidiary called the Depository Trust Company steps in to oversee the funds and securities moving from one party to another\u2014a process called settlement. Finally, an institution\u2014either the original broker or a firm like State Street or BNY Mellon\u2014serves as the custodian, meaning it holds the actual securities on behalf of the investors.\n\nOne of the reasons for separating these various functions is to prevent conflicts of interest. If Citadel, for example, was serving as both an exchange and a broker-dealer, it could digest customer trade information and front-run orders. Separating brokers into distinct entities also prevents markets from having a single point of failure, as happened with FTX.\n\nJames Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown focused on financial regulation, told Fortune that much of the separation is also historical\u2014a convention that the crypto industry is seeking to disrupt with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nFirms like Coinbase offer clearing, settling, custody, and trading services under one roof, an arrangement that provided partial fodder for the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against the exchange. The agency\u2019s primary complaint, though, was that Coinbase and others had not registered with the SEC to offer any of these services\u2014even as it sold what the agency deemed to be securities.\n\nPrometheum, meanwhile, believes it has found a way to sell crypto without triggering any of these objections from the SEC, in part by dividing itself into two entities.\n\nOne, the alternative trading system, is a member of FINRA and registered with the SEC, and will provide a front-end platform for investors to buy and sell crypto assets. The other entity, Prometheum Capital, is the company that received the special purpose broker-dealer license and a final go-ahead from FINRA in January to offer the clearing, settling, and custody services necessary to complete the trades.\n\nThe upshot is that, while firms like Coinbase have been battling with the SEC, Prometheum has been getting approvals from FINRA, which is nominally independent of the agency but also works closely with the SEC and is ultimately subject to its oversight. It is also notable that, while other firms have applied to receive the special purpose broker-dealer license\u2014the one created by the SEC in 2021 and issued by FINRA\u2014Prometheum is the only one to receive it.\n\nNow, Prometheum\u2019s custodial services for Ether announcement suggests the company is on track to offer the popular cryptocurrency for trading to institutional investors later this spring. More consequentially, by offering custodial services for Ether, Prometheum is claiming that Ether is a security\u2014a critical question that the SEC has yet to decide on\u2014and doing so as a FINRA- and SEC-regulated business.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to custody before you trade,\u201d Aaron Kaplan told Fortune. \u201cThis is hopefully going to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a gamble\u2019\n\nFortune spoke with four lawyers and academics with expertise in digital asset regulation who agreed that Prometheum\u2019s custody launch could lead the SEC to finally rule on Ethereum\u2019s legal status, especially because Prometheum prominently displays its registered status with the two organizations on its website\u2014a decision that Boston University lecturer Mark Williams described as \u201cmarketing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d Williams told Fortune. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s part of their business strategy to force the hand of the SEC.\u201d\n\nWilliam Brannan, vice chair of the crypto practice at Lowenstein Sandler, said that Prometheum would be creating \u201cunnecessary controversy\u201d by announcing Ether as the first asset it would custody, given the SEC\u2019s reluctance to take a stance on it.\n\nEven though Prometheum\u2019s primary regulator is FINRA, which operates separately from the SEC, Brannan said FINRA likely would be working with the SEC on the question of Prometheum\u2019s launch of Ether custodial services, owing to the decision\u2019s magnitude.\n\n\u201cMy hunch would be that, particularly for these types of issues, FINRA is in very close contact and consultation with the SEC, and would likely be liaising with them and seeking to get some clarification on their position,\u201d Brannan told Fortune.\n\nAccording to a company spokesperson, since Prometheum received the special purpose broker-dealer license from FINRA, it doesn\u2019t require further approval to make assets available for custody, but it has informed FINRA of its plans to offer services for ETH.\n\nSpokespersons from FINRA and the SEC both declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nIf the SEC took action to stop the offering, it would likely come after Prometheum launched its custodial services for Ether. Still, Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg and a former SEC enforcement attorney, said that he does not expect the SEC to block Prometheum\u2019s approach given Gensler\u2019s stated desire to find a company that can operate under the SEC\u2019s preferred guardrails. \u201cThe SEC, given their position on crypto being a security, wants successful registrants in the marketplace that are complying with federal securities laws and supporting their position,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThe question remains whether Prometheum can draw investor interest\u2014and whether its approach will survive subsequent SEC administrations. The Kaplan brothers argue that creating a compliant approach will drive institutional participation in the crypto industry, although they haven\u2019t specified if the trading platform has potential clients lined up. Williams expressed skepticism that Prometheum would pull off its bold move. \u201cThey\u2019re not market-tested, so I would just have some caution in regard to their ability,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nBut even if Prometheum can\u2019t drum up demand, or running the operation proves too expensive, a successful launch could upend the industry\u2019s argument that crypto is incompatible with existing securities laws. And that clarity, Brannan said, wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of value,\u201d he told Fortune, \u201cin just knowing exactly what the rules of the road are.\u201d"

This will guarantee data availability and will also be much more affordable than calldata.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs consider \u2018existential\u2019 upgrade to the EVM\n\nData availability in blockchain refers to the process of storing data for a set period of time to ensure that all network participants will be able to access and retrieve it so that they can challenge whether or not the data is accurate.\n\nRollups only need this data to be available once and for a set period to give honest participants enough time to construct the rollup state and verify its accuracy.\n\n\u201cWhile Ethereum has rightfully suffered from criticism over fees and processing times, the\n\nDencun concepts of proto-danksharding and \u201cdata blobs\u201d have the mission to address and overcome those,\u201d Angelov said.\n\nHe notes that should the upgrade on mainnet be successful, Ethereum will be able to manage data throughput and network costs much more efficiently, giving it a competitive advantage over other layer-1 solutions.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it is the ability to onboard new protocols into a much freer-flowing environment and move capital at lower costs that will ultimately enhance cryptocurrency adoption by delivering a more economically feasible, highly-scalable on-chain solution,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA quarter of all Ethereum (ETH) in supply is now being staked, data shows. According to figures from blockchain data firm Nansen, over 30 million ETH\u2014or about $74 billion worth of the cryptocurrency\u2014has been locked up.\n\nStaking is the process of \u201clocking up\u201d digital coins or tokens to help keep a blockchain network running. Proof-of-stake assets like ETH require users to pledge their coins to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address. Those who stake earn token rewards in the process.\n\nLast year, the Ethereum network was upgraded, allowing users to easily withdraw staked ETH. Since then, liquid staking protocols have boomed\u2014allowing users to seamlessly lock up and withdraw their crypto.\n\nAs ETH enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that brings the second-largest digital asset to Wall Street, applicants are talking about staking in their proposals. Yesterday, investment firm Ark 21Shares amended their spot ETH ETF S-1 to mention the practice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the trust\u2019s assets through one or more trusted staking providers,\u201d the filing read.\n\nStaking is controversial with regulators, though: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has fined major crypto companies\u2014such as digital asset exchanges Kraken and Coinbase\u2014for allegedly selling unregistered securities via staking services.\n\nThe Ethereum network is in the process of an upgrade, too.

        "title": "What is Ethereum fragmentation? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution is marked by the adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s), designed to alleviate the network\u2019s congestion and high transaction fees.\n\nL2s operate on top of Ethereum (Layer 1 or L1), processing transactions more efficiently before finalizing them on the main chain. However, this has led to a new challenge: each L2 functions in its isolated environment, creating silos that hinder interoperability\u2014a state we refer to as fragmentation.\n\nWhat is Universal Synchronous Composability (USC)?\n\nThe core issue with fragmentation is the loss of \u201cuniversal synchronous composability\u201d (USC), a feature allowing different applications to interact with each other seamlessly in real time. Imagine Ethereum as a bustling city where roads (L2s) connect buildings (applications).\n\nFragmentation is akin to having roads that don\u2019t interconnect, forcing you to take a long detour to move from one building to another.\n\nThe proposed solution, \u201cshared sequencing,\u201d is like establishing a city-wide transit system that links all roads, enabling direct travel routes between any two points without detours.\n\nTo further simplify, consider shared sequencing as the internet of Ethereum. Just as the internet allows different computers to communicate directly regardless of their physical location, shared sequencing enables different L2s to interact seamlessly. This system removes barriers, allowing for immediate transactions across the network, akin to sending an email from one side of the world to the other in seconds.\n\nTechnical Explanation of Shared Sequencing\n\nShared sequencing coordinates the order of transactions across all L2 solutions on Ethereum. It uses a centralized mechanism to sequence transactions identically across different L2s without requiring major infrastructure changes.\n\nShared sequencing leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing data availability capabilities. It proposes adding functionality for L2 solutions to sequence transactions in a unified manner. By sequencing transactions in the same order everywhere, shared sequencing enables instant interactions between L2s across Ethereum.\n\nPotential Use Cases for Shared Sequencing\n\nAdopting shared sequencing could revolutionize Ethereum. It would enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs by enabling seamless communication between L2 solutions. This would eliminate the need for complex bridging between L2s.\n\nShared sequencing could enable more robust decentralized applications (dApps) and services that integrate across L2s. This would improve user experience and accessibility. By restoring composability across L2 solutions, shared sequencing would strengthen Ethereum\u2019s network effects and dominance as a platform for blockchain applications.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey through fragmentation may resemble a challenging phase of growth, the horizon holds promise for a unified and efficient ecosystem. Shared sequencing represents a leap towards realizing this vision, offering a roadmap to re-establish Ethereum\u2019s composability and network effects.\n\nAs we look to the future, continued innovation and collaboration within the Ethereum community will be pivotal in overcoming current limitations and unlocking the platform\u2019s full potential. Through these efforts, Ethereum can evolve into a more interconnected and powerful platform, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications."

        "title": "Ethereum Restaking App Approaches $4 Billion In Deposits: Biggest Airdrop In History Incoming? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "EigenLayer is a new liquid restaking platform for Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake the same amount of Ether (ETH) across multiple projects simultaneously to earn additional rewards. Proponents of the technology say that it will increase capital efficiency and spur innovation. Those against the technology believe that it could cause overleveraging and is susceptible to slashing.\n\nThough the new technology is causing a debate among ETH enthusiasts, it is impossible to deny the project\u2019s popularity. Initially, EigenLayer put a 200,000 ETH cap on each protocol so that it could test the concept without extreme amounts of volume. The limit was removed on Feb. 5. Within 24 hours, over 700,000 ETH, or over $1.6 billion was deposited into EigenLayer. According to data from DefiLlama, this brought EigenLayer's total volume locked (TVL) to nearly $4 billion, which is over 1% of all Ethereum in circulation. For comparison, EigenLayer had less than $300 million in TVL for most of December 2023.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWhile the limit on deposits has been temporarily removed, a new limit will be put in place on February 9th. While the exact limit is unknown, it will likely be close to the TVL on February 9th. However, the project has also stated that it hopes to eventually remove any deposit limits, though this will likely happen some time in the future, if it happens at all.\n\nOn February 5th, ETH appreciated more than 3.5%, causing its market cap to approach $300 billion. Despite the strong day, ETH was still down more than 1% over the previous 7 days.\n\nTo make the project even more enticing, EigenLayer has begun showing EigenLayer Points, which are a calculation consisting of the time spent restaking, volume restaked, etc. to formulate a numerical value. While there is no guarantee that this could lead to an airdrop, other staking platforms have used a similar system in the past to mete out tokens in the event of an airdrop. One example from recent memory was the Jito (JITO) airdrop on the Solana chain. This project also used a point system, which allowed users to be placed into tiers that gave different amounts of JITO on the day of the airdrop.

        "title": "Top 9 smart contract platforms to consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts let users write executable code that encodes business logic and runs on a blockchain or other type of decentralized ledger. Depending on your goals, there are many ways to use smart contract platforms to push these powerful apps into production.\n\n\"Smart contract platforms are decentralized systems that enable self-executing contracts on a blockchain,\" said Sanjiv Maewall, CTO of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte Consulting. These platforms support secure, transparent and tamper-proof execution of predefined conditions, according to Maewall, which makes them ideal for trustless applications such as finance, supply chain management and voting systems.\n\nThere are four main kinds of smart contract platforms: large blockchain platforms; smaller ones optimized for improving smart contract execution speed or cost; private smart contract frameworks; and specialized tools for crafting and managing smart contracts across trusted partners.\n\nThese tools were selected based on their prominence across the various smart contract platforms; conversations with industry experts; and, in the case of the public smart contract platforms, their market cap and trading volume.\n\nWhat are smart contract platforms, and how do they work? Before diving deeper into the different types of smart contract platforms, it's helpful to define what a smart contract is and what it does. Lata Varghese, digital assets and blockchain practice leader at Protiviti, said she likes to think of a smart contract as \"a digital form of a traditional contract where contractual agreements between counterparties are inscribed as a piece of code.\" A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required by an agreement when predetermined terms and conditions are met. It ensures trust between the involved parties without needing a central authority. A smart contract platform is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that lets users create and execute smart contracts. A blockchain is not in and of itself a smart contract platform. Developers must extend it with tools to store smart contract code in a secure and tamper-proof form. They also add tools that enable decentralized and autonomous execution of smart contract code correctly, securely, transparently and deterministically. It's also important for the state transition from smart contract code execution to be verified by consensus of the nodes in the blockchain network before recording the state change in the blockchain ledger. The blockchain-based cryptocurrency Bitcoin supported the first digital, permissionless and tamper-proof smart contract, but it was of limited scope. Varghese said the major breakthrough came when the developers of the Ethereum blockchain added support for programmable smart contracts. They also introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as the computation engine that manages the state of the blockchain and enables smart contract functionality. \"Ethereum continues to be the most popular platform for smart contracts due to its highly decentralized security as well as a large community support,\" Varghese said. One caution for enterprise users is that smart contracts are not legally binding. Within the Web3 community, the term is used differently than enterprises looking to automate contract processes in a traditional sense. In parallel, lawyers and governments are developing frameworks for what are called smart legal contracts, which might or might not use decentralized ledger technology. Automated procurement platforms, such as SAP Ariba and B2B marketplace platforms, can sometimes be used to automate contractual processes through ERP integrations. Contract lifecycle management platforms (CLMs), such as the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, are also exploring ways to integrate smart legal contracts into enterprise workflows.\n\nLayers and levels of smart contract platforms Several blockchain technology platforms have been used for executing smart contracts. They're usually characterized as Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) platforms. L1 platforms are blockchains on which smart contracts are executed directly on the main core platform. Prominent examples are Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and BNB Smart Chain. L2 platforms execute the smart contracts on a parallel space so they can run more efficiently and quickly; they then roll up changes to the core platform. Examples of L2 platforms include Ethereum ZK-Rollups, Ethereum Optimistic Rollups and Polygon. Many of the newer offerings support both L1 and L2 capabilities. \"There is continuous innovation occurring in these technology platforms to address blockchain scalability challenges and become the platform of choice to build Web 3.0 applications,\" Varghese said, referring to the future blockchain-based generation of the web, often called Web3. The newer blockchain platforms almost uniformly have support for smart contracts, she said, and many are EVM compatible. That means a decentralized application (DApp) that runs on Ethereum can also run on them. Other prominent platforms Varghese has explored include Avalanche, Tezos, Algorand, Polygon, Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron, Near and Cardano. In addition, some blockchain platforms, such as Avalanche, Cosmos and Polkadot, are being adapted for private, permissioned smart contract implementations. Several smart contract platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and Hyperledger Besu have supported enterprise blockchain implementations for at least five years. Purchasers should investigate a platform's protections against these smart contract security risks.\n\nKey factors to consider in a smart contract platform When choosing a smart contract platform, Maewall suggested examining a platform's security features, track record, scalability potential, performance, cost and strength of the associated developer community. \"Each platform has its unique offerings and tradeoffs, so choose one that best aligns with your project's requirements,\" he said. These platform elements also come with compromises. For example, Ethereum has the strongest developer community, but it also has the highest cost per transaction -- called gas in the blockchain community -- Maewall said. Similarly, some platforms are Turing complete. They can simulate every function of a Turing machine, a mathematical model of computation, which means users can write more expressive applications. But this flexibility comes at the expense of security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.\n\nUnderstanding the different approaches In some ways, smart contract infrastructure is comparable to that of cloud computing, which has many nested and sometimes overlapping platforms. On one level are the large infrastructure platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The application software layer includes Salesforce, ServiceNow and other platforms. In addition, private clouds enable enterprises to deploy workloads running on Docker containers that can move across public and private cloud infrastructure. Similarly, in the smart contract arena, Ethereum is like AWS before Microsoft and Google came along. Several newer competitors, including Cardano, Solana and Tron, provide alternatives to Ethereum. Another tier of platforms that includes Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Tezos mimics private cloud infrastructure. Development management platforms, such as Kaleido and Casper Labs, are designed to make it easier for partners to create and manage their own smart contract infrastructure. Additionally, CLM platform vendors are extending their tooling to support smart legal contract development management capabilities that span decentralized ledger and CLM capabilities, such as DocuSign Smart Agreements. There are nuances in how the various platforms approach the problem of smart contract development and deployment. For example, apps might run on EVMs, low-level VMs, Docker containers or other infrastructure. It's also important to consider your reasons for building decentralized apps before choosing a smart contract platform. Differences in platform features and capabilities can determine what an app can do and what users can accomplish by using it. For example, platforms such as Ethereum and Solana make it easier to incentivize infrastructure creation with cryptocurrency tokens. However, private trading partners might be happy to build or rent their own infrastructure. They are more motivated to streamline transactions and improve transparency. Much like in the cloud industry, there are dozens of smart contract platforms, and the field is evolving rapidly. Rather than surveying all of them, it's more helpful to focus on the top categories and the biggest or most interesting players. With this in mind, let's look at some of the top smart contract platforms across key categories.\n\nTop tier Ethereum Ethereum pioneered flexible smart contracts when it was launched in 2013. It supports Solidity, a variant of the JavaScript programming language that was immediately accessible to front-end developers and quickly grew a massive base of developers and financial supporters. Ethereum also pioneered the EVM, which has become a standard for other smart contract platforms. Ethereum's stock market capitalization is far and wide above competitors. In early 2024, it was $277 billion -- several times more than all the other smart contract platforms combined. The main benefit of a large market cap is that successful smart contract apps have the potential to grow faster in a much larger virtual economy. Ethereum is the top choice for developers who want to game the largest smart contract ecosystem with a bright new idea. Some observers say Ethereum's performance is not as fast as some of the upstarts. Smart contract mistakes can be expensive and difficult to unwind; in some cases, this can require a fork, a usually temporary split in the Ethereum network to allow major technical upgrades or changes. The blockchain has also been undergoing a constant pace of forks, merges and upgrades. The Shanghai upgrade in mid-2023, called Shapella, supported a more efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and faster transaction processing.\n\nSecond generation The success of Ethereum smart contracts revealed some fundamental disadvantages of the platform. For one thing, it's not particularly fast compared to modern transaction processing infrastructure -- a few dozen transactions per second compared to 24,000 for the Visa payment network. Hackers also discovered new security bugs in Ethereum smart contracts that were difficult to resolve. For example, a hack of the first Ethereum distributed autonomous organization, a type of management structure built on a smart contract, resulted in the DAO losing a third of its value. Eventually, Ethereum was hard forked -- permanently split in two -- to undo some of the damage. A second generation of open blockchain networks has sprung up to address such shortcomings. BNB Smart Chain The BNB Smart Chain is built on the BNB coin. It was previously the Binance Coin by Binance and was migrated to a separate Smart Chain in 2019 to create a native coin. In early 2024, the BNB coin had a market cap of about $47 billion. The platform supports a proof-of-stake authority consensus mechanism architected to optimize speed and keep transaction costs low. The network currently supports a million daily users and more than 2,000 active DApps. It is also popular among the gaming community, with over 287,000 weekly active gamers. The platform supports several popular development languages, including Solidity, Go, Java and Swift. One potential concern for developers is that Binance, the company behind the chain, has suffered legal problems that could impact the rollout of smart contract apps in the U.S. In November 2023, Binance pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and agreed to pay over $4 billion in fines. Solana The Solana blockchain ecosystem has recently grown to be the third largest public smart contract platform with a market cap of about $44 billion as of early 2024. Some experts consider it more efficient than Ethereum and many other public blockchains. Factors contributing to the speed include support for a low-level virtual machine for deploying smart contracts as well as the use of C and Rust programming languages for writing them. That makes it a good bet for developers looking to combine high transaction rates with the economic opportunities available on a public blockchain. Cardano Cardano was introduced as a more energy-efficient alternative to Ethereum in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, who also helped start Ethereum. In 2021, it introduced its Plutus feature for building smart contracts. The community has also created several programming languages for creating smart contracts on Cardano, including Marlowe, Aiken, OpShin and plu-ts. Cardano is a newer platform with less functionality and fewer developers than others on this list. However, it has the fourth-largest market cap at about $19 billion, making it an interesting option for developers who want to take advantage of a large token economy outside of Ethereum.\n\nPrivate blockchains Private blockchains are similar to open source cloud development platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift and Cloudify but for smart contracts. The code itself is open source; a variety of expert service firms provision it on private hardware in data centers or on top of cloud services. Private blockchains are a good fit for businesses and government organizations that want to streamline transactions between trusted partners. They're a good choice for improving the efficiency of things enterprises already do, with mechanisms to update contracts or roll back transactions when problems are discovered. The most common use of private blockchains is scaling trust across enterprise boundaries. Hyperledger Fabric IBM developed Hyperledger Fabric and then handed it off to the Linux Foundation to create an enterprise-grade blockchain platform with modular architecture and various consensus mechanisms. It enables fine-grained control of data visibility and confidentiality so only authorized people can access data. It also supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Go and Java, and is designed to handle high transaction volumes. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain network. That means only authorized individuals or devices can participate in transactions, which is important from a trust, compliance and regulatory perspective. Corda Corda was created to model and automate real-world transactions in a legally enforceable way. Private channels let participants transact directly to improve the confidentiality of transactions. Numerous integrations have been built for the finance, healthcare and supply chain industries."

This means that ERC-404 tokens can be both fungible and non-fungible, depending on the specific implementation.\n\nIn a nutshell, ERC-404 is a new way of defining digital assets like tokens or collectibles on the internet.\n\nERC-404 key features breakdown:\n\nHybrid functionality: ERC-404 tokens can represent both fungible and non-fungible assets, offering flexibility for various use cases.\n\nNative liquidity: Unlike traditional NFTs, ERC-404 tokens have built-in liquidity mechanisms, allowing for easier trading and fractional ownership.\n\nProgrammable scarcity: The supply of ERC-404 tokens can be dynamically adjusted through code, enabling innovative tokenomics models.\n\nHow does ERC-404 work?\n\nOne NFT of the underlying project is awarded to the wallet that has a full ERC-404 token. When the token is sold, the NFT is automatically burned. Both the tokens and NFTs can be traded independently.\n\nIs ERC-404 safe?\n\nERC-404 is not vetted, hence an experimental standard. Its development has not followed the traditional route \u2013 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIPs). Additionally, it has not undergone a full external audit, but it has been tested extensively.\n\nThe only similarity ERC-404 and other ERC standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721 share is the name \u201cERC,\u201d which stands for Ethereum Request for Comments.\n\nProjects using ERC-404 token standard\n\nPandora and DeFrogs are the only two projects that have implemented the ERC-404 token standard. The latter project\u2019s token, DEFROGS price, is up 21% in the last hour, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nCtrl, the team behind the launch of the experimental token standard, has also launched Pandora. PANDORA token started trading on February 2 at $212 and is currently trading at $21,000.\n\nPANDORA/WETH 4-hour chart\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Crypto markets to turn volatile as AI steals the spotlight\n\nWill ERC-404 push Ethereum price higher?\n\nIt is unlikely that the launch of projects based on ERC-404 standards will push Ethereum price higher. Since Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it is highly correlated with Bitcoin price and is unlikely to be influenced by the new narrative.\n\nBut with the tides turning bullish for Bitcoin price, the outlook could get optimistic for not just Ethereum but ETH-related altcoins as well.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets primed, await directional bias from BTC"

        "content": "ERC404 tokens have exploded on Ethereum, led by Pandora's $230 million volume.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects contributed 12% to Uniswap\u2019s 24 hour volume on Ethereum.\n\nThe frenzy has raised concerns about rug pulls and high gas fees.\n\nLess than a week since the creation of ERC404, trading volumes on Ethereum are now dominated by these hybrid tokens.\n\nThe top ERC404 collection, Pandora, has experienced over $230 million in total volume since launching on February 2.\n\nThe PANDORA/WETH liquidity pool on decentralised exchange Uniswap is now the number three pool by volume, only behind stalwarts USDC/ETH and USDC/USDT.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects \u2014 Pandora, MNRCH and DeFrogs \u2014 have registered a combined $113 million worth of trades over the past 24 hours, accounting for 12% of Uniswap\u2019s Ethereum trading volume.\n\nERC404 is a token standard on Ethereum that combines characteristics of both cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It greatly improves the liquidity \u2014 availability of funds \u2014 for NFTs, which are typically highly-illiquid assets.\n\nWhen a user holds at least one token of an ERC404 project an NFT is automatically minted. The user can then either sell the token, thereby burning the NFT, or they can list the NFT on a marketplace like Opensea.\n\nBut the frenzied trading around ERC404 tokens comes with consequences.\n\nThere have already been a number of rug pulls \u2014 situations where the address that created a token pulls liquidity leaving investors with nothing \u2014 and rising gas costs on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe ERC404 frenzy\n\nAs traders flock to the ERC404 token standard, some have started to take advantage of the frenzy. On Wednesday, a token trading under the name Punks, rose from $350 to over $20,000 in just two hours. Now, it\u2019s almost worthless.\n\nThat\u2019s because the wallet that created the token used a malicious contract that allowed the creation of an infinite number of Punks tokens. Shortly after Punks hit $20,000, the wallet\u2019s controller executed the contract, minting thousands of tokens which were then sold into the PUNKS/WETH Uniswap pool.\n\nUsers who invested in this token lost everything while the creator\u2019s wallet walked away with a gain of 42 Ether \u2014 or about $100,000.\n\nSimilar incidents occurred with four other ERC404 collections using variations of the Punks name in the last two days.\n\nERC404\u2032s are also contributing to rising gas costs on Ethereum. Given the standard is so new, it has not yet been optimised for gas costs.\n\nEthereum gas fees spent trading the Pandora ERC404 token. (Chocolate Chungus)\n\nGas fees on Ethereum are payments made by users in order to send transactions. Ethereum is designed to increase the cost of transactions during busy periods to protect the network from spam attacks.\n\nThe founder of the Pandora collection recently stated in the project\u2019s Telegram chat that the next ERC404 improvement should reduce gas costs by 300 to 400%.\n\nThis will likely be welcomed by Ethereum mainnet users. Gas fees on the network have averaged 53 gwei over the past 24 hours, while the average for the previous seven days was 29 gwei.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "title": "Latest Ethereum price predictions: $5,000 by the end of 2024. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we see the latest forecasts on the future price of Ethereum offered by the fintech company Finder, which conducted a survey with 40 experts in the cryptocurrency industry in January 2024.\n\nThe emerged results speak clearly: the majority of experts are super bullish on the price of ETH, with predictions for the next 6 years talking about figures higher than four zeros.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum could experience a real rally as soon as it breaks the long-term downtrend, which has been ongoing since August 2022, in the chart against Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nFinder\u2019s predictions on the future price of Ethereum\n\nAccording to a panel conducted in January 2024 by the analysis company Finder, in which 40 fintech market specialists were interviewed, the price of Ethereum could soon skyrocket if it were to meet the announced forecasts.\n\nAccording to the average of the responses obtained from the participants, by the end of the year ETH could reach $5,000 per token, approaching $4,887, thus increasing its current value by over 100%.\n\nThere are even those who have gone so far as to imagine a fiery scenario for Ethereum, hypothesizing a price of $17,000 by the end of 2024. At the same time, there are also those who, going against the tide, support the crypto market bears and predict a price of $1,333.\n\nApproximately 23% of the interviewed speakers believe that the price of ETH will rise in the range of $4,000 to $4,999 at its maximum before the end of 2024, while another approximately 23% believe that we will see the price of ETH within the range of $3,000 to $3,999 in the same time frame.\n\nExpanding our horizons, we see that forecasts indicate a potential growth of the cryptocurrency that could reach $7,492 in 2025, while by 2030 we could reach $19,190.\n\nThese numbers, obtained as a simple average of the responses provided by industry experts, are significantly higher compared to those recorded in a similar survey conducted by Finder in October 2023.\n\nThe analysts interviewed by Finder also contributed to explaining the reasons for their bullish or bearish biases, providing technical support to the market forecasts provided.\n\nIn particular, we see how Damian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor of Finance Magnates, believes that the fate of Ethereum largely depends on the performance that Bitcoin will record:\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum will reflect what happens with Bitcoin. If I believe in a historical high by the end of 2024 around $70,000 for BTC, I also believe that ETH will reach its historical high, testing the $5,000 level.\u201d\n\nEven Jonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of ARIA Algorithmic Ratings & Investment Analysis, agrees with Chmiel\u2019s thesis. He notes a very strong correlation factor between the two assets, but emphasizes that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could have the upper hand this year:\n\n\u201cGiven the strong correlation between bitcoin and ether, it is likely that ether will benefit from bitcoin catalysts such as spot ETFs [bitcoin] and [the halving]. However, I believe that ether has greater potential due to its current market price. There is a general perception that ether offers a better opportunity for higher multiple profits compared to bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to a slightly less optimistic forecast by Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler SA, the price of ETH is expected to increase in 2024 without breaking any previous highs.\n\nAccording to his vision, Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure will capture a lot of value in the coming years due to its advantageous technology, but at the same time, competitors will grow alongside it:\n\n\u201cIn the long term, the price of assets will increase because Ethereum is the main ecosystem for blockchain projects. However, competition with other blockchain ecosystems will intensify.\u201d\n\nTechnical analysis of ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts\n\nAt this point, to complete the overall picture of the future price predictions of Ethereum, let\u2019s take a look at the ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts to identify potential starting points for the next predicted increases in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nCurrently, the cryptocurrency is priced at $2417, well above the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, with the macro trend reversing after the declines of 2022 and becoming clearly bullish since January 2023.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum has had some difficulty in surpassing the $2500 mark, never managing to close candles above the fateful level.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Ether has attempted to break out against the dollar, but without managing to surpass the $2800 high.\n\nTo give more space to the optimism of the bulls, it will be necessary to break the $2500 mark as soon as possible, trying to break into the area around $3000 as well. The volumes have not yet returned to 2020 levels but are gradually growing.\n\nThe RSI indicator is at a medium-high level in the channel but leaves fertile ground for other potential bullish climbs.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USDT)\n\nAs for the ETH-BTC chart, we notice that the situation is quite different.\n\nPrices are currently below the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, indicating a more bearish outlook.\n\nSince August 2022, the currency of the world\u2019s most famous smart contract platform has recorded a downward trend against the market king Bitcoin, losing about 40% from the highs to the lows of the last 2 years of trading.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Ethereum has consolidated within the range of 0.05-0.055, increasing the chances of a trend reversal and fueling positive predictions on the price of the crypto.\n\nIf the bottom has really been reached in recent months, then we can expect a year of strong rebounds both for ether and for many altcoins, which will benefit from the loss of power of BTC.\n\nCurrently, the most optimistic scenario involves a recovery of 0.07 by mid-2024, with the remaining 6 months of the year in which we could witness an attempt to remove one zero from the chart and bring ETH back to one-tenth of the value of BTC.\n\nThe most important resistance is located at 0.085 zone, which has acted as a peak in the chart for the past 5 years, preventing any return to the crazy levels reached during the bull run of 2017.\n\nWe are waiting to find out ETH\u2019s next move towards BTC, in order to update price forecasts and identify the most likely targets."

        "content": "The Ethereum crypto has witnessed a notable rally, with its price soaring towards $2400, buoyed by the excitement surrounding the imminent deployment of the Dencun upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s core developers recently implemented the Dencun upgrade on the Holesky testnet, marking the final phase before its expected mainnet rollout in early to mid-March.\n\nThe integration of EIP-4844, a key feature of Dencun, is anticipated to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s scalability and cost-effectiveness, particularly for Layer 2 rollup chains. Notably, the Ethereum price rally today also sparked curiosity, despite the SEC delaying the spot Ethereum ETF approval from Invesco and Galaxy Digital.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Live On Holesky Testnet\n\nDespite market consolidation, Ethereum has experienced a surge in price, fueled by optimism surrounding the upcoming Dencun upgrade. The successful implementation of Dencun on the Holesky testnet, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh, signifies a crucial milestone before its anticipated mainnet deployment.\n\nThis upgrade, featuring EIP-4844, notably promises significant enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction cost reduction, positioning the network for further growth and adoption in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade underscores Ethereum\u2019s dedication to ongoing advancement and innovation. With a focus on scalability through proto-danksharding, improved security measures, and enhanced network efficiency, Dencun is poised to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s standing as a premier blockchain platform substantially.\n\nEthereum Price To $3,500?\n\nIn a recent analysis, prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe highlighted the imminent uptrend for Ethereum (ETH), particularly as a focus on the Dencun upgrade. Van de Poppe predicts that the Ethereum price surge is imminent, with a target set at $3,500.\n\nExpressing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential, van de Poppe emphasized that the market is currently undervaluing the significance of ETH. He further disclosed his strong preference for the Ethereum ecosystem, foreseeing it as a major driving force in the months ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart stated that he continues to expect more delays in spot Ethereum ETF approval in the coming months. According to Seyffart, the focal point for Ethereum spot ETFs currently revolves around May 23rd, which marks the final deadline set by VanEck, another ETF issuer seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nAccording to a study by Coingecko, Europe leads the global Ethereum (ETH) ETF market, holding an 81.4% share. The region boasts 13 ETH-backed ETFs, covering both spot products and futures funds, with assets under management (AUM) totaling $4.6 billion.\n\nCanada also plays a significant role in the ETH ETF market, holding a 16.6% share with $949 million in AUM. ETFs have emerged as a popular entry point into the crypto space for many Canadian investors.\n\nAs of February 2nd, the total global AUM for ETH ETFs reached $5.7 billion, spread across 27 ETFs offering both spot and futures funds\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a stunning display of trading acumen, an Ethereum (ETH) trader managed to secure a profit of approximately $166,000 within just two days, starting with an investment of merely 0.26 ETH (equivalent to $613). This remarkable feat was achieved through strategic transactions involving DeFrogs (DEFROGS), a new cryptocurrency that has recently captured the attention of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to details shared by Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, the trader embarked on this lucrative journey by initially investing 0.08 ETH ($190) to purchase 100 DEFROGS tokens. This transaction was executed despite the high gas fees at the time, which amounted to 0.178 ETH ($423). The decision to bear such significant transaction costs early on underscores the trader's confidence in the potential of their investment.\n\nIn just 2 days, this trader made $166K with only 0.26 $ETH($613)!\n\n\n\nThis trader spent only 0.08 $ETH($190) to buy 100 #DEFROGS using a high gas of 0.178 $ETH($423), then sold 60 #DEFROGS for 27.8 $ETH ($67K).\n\n\n\nHe currently has 40 #DEFROGS($100K) left, the total profit is ~166K! pic.twitter.com/g0VtlKoKGM \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 8, 2024\n\nThe strategy began to bear fruit when the Ethereum trader sold 60 of their DEFROGS tokens for a staggering 27.8 ETH, translating to approximately $67,000. This sale not only recouped the initial investment and associated costs but also yielded a substantial profit. As of the latest update, the trader still holds 40 DEFROGS tokens, valued at around $100,000, bringing their total profit to the vicinity of $166,000.\n\nMeme coin craze\n\nThis trading success story coincides with a significant surge in the value of DeFrogs (DEFROGS). The cryptocurrency has experienced a remarkable 111.91% increase in its value over the last 24 hours, with its price currently standing at $3,335 per token. This surge has propelled the trading volume of DEFROGS to $28.8 million and boosted its market capitalization to $34.27 million, highlighting the growing interest and confidence in this new digital asset.\n\nDeFrogs is part of the burgeoning meme coin sector , drawing inspiration from the Pepe (PEPE) crypto project. Launched on Feb. 7, DEFROGS is touted as a token based on the novel ERC-404 standard. This standard is designed to blend the features of cryptocurrencies with those of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering a unique value proposition in the digital asset space.\n\nThe story of this Ethereum trader's success serves as a testament to the potential rewards of strategic and informed trading within the volatile cryptocurrency market. It also underscores the importance of staying abreast of emerging trends and technologies in the digital asset space, where innovative projects like DeFrogs can offer significant opportunities for growth and profit."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu token has recently slipped below a critical support level at $0.000009. This drop signifies a potential pivot point for the asset, with the next critical support level now in the spotlight, highlighted by the stark blue line on the trading chart.\n\nThe loss of the $0.000009 support level is implying a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. Traders often view such breaches as a signal for a potential downward trend, leading to increased selling pressure. The market seems to be in a precarious position, where the demand at the subsequent support level must hold to prevent further declines.\n\nFor SHIB, the next critical support level is now set around $0.0000087, highlighted by the blue line. This level represents a psychological and technical threshold, which, if breached, could intensify bearish momentum. The resistance level to watch is currently at $0.0000095, a boundary that SHIB needs to surpass to negate the current bearish outlook and potentially signal a reversal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if SHIB can consolidate above the current support and break through the resistance at $0.0000095, it could lead to a relief rally, attracting buyers back into the market. This could be driven by positive news, market sentiment or broader crypto market recovery. In this case, a move toward the next resistance at $0.000010 could be in the cards, potentially rekindling investor interest and speculative trading.\n\nEthereum gains confidence\n\nEthereum has seen a resurgence of momentum, possibly catalyzed by the recent outage on the Solana network. Investors are increasingly favoring stability, and Ethereum's uninterrupted service during Solana's downtime may have reinforced its position as the go-to platform for developers and investors seeking reliability.\n\nThe Ethereum network has maintained its operations without significant issues, which stands in stark contrast to the outage experienced by Solana, often touted as an Ethereum competitor. This reliability has not gone unnoticed. Amid fears of potential future outages, Solana's instability has inadvertently highlighted Ethereum's robustness, possibly triggering a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum.\n\nA look at the Ethereum price chart suggests a bullish trend, with the asset recently rebounding off the 50-day EMA, currently at around $2,331. The next resistance level to watch is around the $2,367 mark, which, if surpassed, could pave the way for further gains.\n\nThere has been speculation in the past that individuals with significant market influence, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, have contributed to network instabilities to benefit their trading platforms. While these rumors have been persistent, the recent Solana incident appears to be the result of a genuine surge in activity, rather than any malevolent interference.\n\nAs Ethereum continues its climb, support levels have solidified, particularly around the $2,206 line, aligning with the 100-day EMA. This level is crucial for Ethereum to maintain its current momentum and avoid a retracement toward lower supports.\n\nXRP's issues with volatility\n\nXRP is now facing a period of stagnant volatility and waning interest. With the ongoing SEC case showing no signs of progress and market participants shifting their focus elsewhere, XRP's trading volume and network activity have significantly dwindled.\n\nA glance at the XRP price chart reveals a constrained trading range, with the cryptocurrency struggling to make decisive moves. Currently languishing around the $0.50 mark, XRP finds itself trapped between the immediate support level at $0.49 and a faint resistance near $0.56. This tight range indicates a lack of enthusiasm from traders, with minimal volume to suggest any forthcoming change in this dynamic.\n\nThe decreasing volatility is symptomatic of broader market sentiment toward XRP. Without substantial developments in its legal challenges or breakthrough use cases that rekindle interest, XRP remains in a state of limbo. The once vibrant and highly speculative asset now sees days of minimal price change."
