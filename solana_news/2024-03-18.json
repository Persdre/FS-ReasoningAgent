        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit a New All-Time-High of $5,000 by the End of 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum has two solid catalysts in place for 2024, but will they both deliver as planned?\n\nNow that Bitcoin (BTC -0.63%) has hit a new all-time-high, could Ethereum (ETH -1.03%) be next?\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at just under $4,000, within striking distance of its all-time-high of $4,891.70. Given that Ethereum is already up about 70% for the year, it wouldn't seem to require much for Ethereum to rise another 25% before the end of 2024.\n\nAnd indeed, there are two potentially major catalysts in place this year. If Ethereum is going to soar to an all-time-high of $5,000, it's likely that both of these are going to be needed. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNew tech upgrade\n\nThe first major catalyst is a brand-new tech upgrade (Dencun). It is the biggest change to the Ethereum blockchain since The Merge, which took place nearly 18 months ago. So understandably, analysts are getting excited about what this new upgrade might mean for Ethereum's growth prospects.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has two major goals: to improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain (which can still suffer from congestion and slow throughput times), and to lower the costs of transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. If Dencun can deliver on both, it would help to cement Ethereum's role as the preeminent smart contract platform in the world. Even better, Dencun is setting the stage for Ethereum's next upgrades, all of which have been carefully laid out by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in the blockchain's latest annual roadmap.\n\nSo far so good, right? You have a tech upgrade promising major performance enhancements, and you also have a roadmap for future growth. But not so fast. A number of blockchain analysts are taking issue with the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAs they see it, Dencun is not a long-term fix because it relies too much on third parties (known as Layer 2 scaling solutions) to make all the performance enhancements work. In a worst-case scenario, reliance on these Layer 2 scaling solutions could lead to all kinds of interoperability issues, fragmentation within the Ethereum ecosystem, and a loss of cohesion among Ethereum developers.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe second big catalyst is the potential launch of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as early as May. Given all the enthusiasm and excitement around the spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's easy to see why a new spot ETF investment product could send Ethereum soaring.\n\nAs in the case of Bitcoin, it would become remarkably easy for any investor to buy Ethereum. If these investors decide to allocate even 1% of their portfolios to Ethereum, that could send the crypto soaring.\n\nThe only problem, from my perspective, is that analysts seem to be vastly overstating how easy this process is going to be. As they see it, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already bought into the idea of spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies, and thus, new approvals are going to be coming on a regular basis from here on out.\n\nBut what they fail to take into account is that the spot Bitcoin ETF process took years to achieve, and only after very specific milestones had been met. Even up until final approval in January, there were serious doubts about the SEC finally approving them.\n\nAnd we're starting to see the same thing with the spot Ethereum ETFs now. The probability of an SEC approval taking place in May has recently been lowered from 70% to 30%, according to a top Bloomberg analyst.\n\nThat's because the SEC has maintained what can only be described as radio silence ever since the spot Ethereum ETF applications were filed. There has been no outreach to the investment firms trying to bring them to market, and no indication that regulators are now ready to sign off on other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.\n\nIs the glass half-full or half-empty?\n\nIf you're an optimist and see the glass as half-full, the new Ethereum tech upgrade in 2024 is worthy of the same type of acclaim as The Merge was back in 2022. You probably also think that a fresh batch of spot Ethereum ETFs are on their way before the start of summer.\n\nHowever, if you're a skeptic and see the glass as half-empty, the new Dencun upgrade is at best a temporary fix for problems that have been plaguing Ethereum for years: high transaction fees and slower transaction processing speeds compared to many other blockchains. Moreover, you're probably also thinking the SEC will take its time with the spot Ethereum ETF approvals, much as it did with the Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nMy concern right now is that the optimistic scenario has already been baked into the price of Ethereum. How else to explain the fact that Ethereum is up just as much as Bitcoin this year?\n\nThus, if either of these two catalysts fail to deliver as expected, we could see a pullback in the price of Ethereum. For that reason, I'm taking a wait-and-see approach with Ethereum right now."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s CREATE2: A Double-Edged Sword in Blockchain Security - Check Point Research",
        "content": "By Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, Roman Zaikin\n\nEthereum\u2019s CREATE2 function is being exploited by attackers to compromise the security of digital wallets, bypassing traditional security measures and facilitating unauthorized access to funds.\n\nThe attack method involves tricking users into approving transactions for smart contracts that haven\u2019t been deployed yet, allowing cybercriminals to later deploy malicious contracts and steal cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the need for enhanced security measures in wallet security products to adapt to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets in the face of innovative exploits.\n\nIn the digital realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, Ethereum stands out as a platform of innovation and versatility. Its capacity for adaptation and development makes it a critical player in the tech space. However, the very features that make Ethereum remarkable also expose it to potential vulnerabilities. One such feature is the CREATE2 function, which, while showcasing Ethereum\u2019s advanced technological capabilities, has unfortunately also opened the door to new security threats against digital wallets.\n\nThe Intricacies of CREATE2\n\nIntroduced in Ethereum\u2019s Constantinople upgrade, the CREATE2 function has been hailed for its ability to deploy smart contracts with deterministic addresses even before the creation of the contract\u2019s bytecode. This function significantly enhances the predictability and efficiency of smart contract interactions, offering a boon for the complex ecosystems of decentralized applications (dApps). It allows for the pre-orchestration of interactions between multiple contracts, a feature critical for the seamless operation of dApps.\n\nThe Security Concern\n\nHowever, the innovative CREATE2 function also presents a significant security loophole. Cybercriminals have quickly leveraged this function to bypass conventional wallet security measures, creating a new method for exploiting unsuspecting victims. The core of the vulnerability lies in CREATE2\u2019s ability to deploy a smart contract at a known address in the future, enabling attackers to deceive users into approving transactions with a contract that doesn\u2019t yet exist. Once the user grants approval, the attacker can deploy a malicious contract to that address, hijacking the transaction and draining the victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nA Closer Look at the Attack Mechanism\n\n1. The attacker begins by convincing the victim to approve or increase the allowance for a yet-to-be-deployed contract.\n\n2. Since the contract hasn\u2019t been deployed at the time of approval, it evades detection by security solutions, which cannot identify potential threats in non-existent contracts.\n\n3. After securing the victim\u2019s authorization, the attacker deploys the malicious contract, exploiting the victim\u2019s funds.\n\nThis method not only underlines the creative misuse of Ethereum\u2019s features by malicious entities but also highlights a critical challenge for security products. Most security solutions are calibrated to analyze and validate transactions based on existing contracts and known behaviors. CREATE2, by facilitating interactions with future contracts, effectively bypasses these security frameworks, leaving digital assets at risk.\n\nThe Technical Side of CREATE2\n\nDelving into the technical aspects, CREATE and CREATE2 are both opcodes in Ethereum blockchain development that support the deployment of smart contracts. They differ primarily in how the address of the new contract is determined. While CREATE bases the contract\u2019s address on the creator\u2019s address and a nonce, CREATE2 allows for a more flexible approach by incorporating a user-specified salt, the creator\u2019s address, and the contract\u2019s initialization code into the address computation.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum blockchain development, both CREATE and CREATE2 are opcodes that facilitate the deployment of smart contracts, but they differ in how the address of the new contract is determined.\n\nThe CREATE opcode generates the address of the new contract based on the address of the creator (the sender of the transaction) and the nonce. On the other hand, CREATE2 offers a more flexible approach by allowing the contract\u2019s address to be determined based on a user-specified salt, the creator\u2019s address, and the contract\u2019s initialization code.\n\nThe address of the contract in CREATE2 is computed by using 4 parameters:\n\nkeccak256(0xff + sender_address + salt + keccak256(initialization_code))\n\nConstant prefix \u2013 A fixed prefix that is part of the hashing process, which is 0xff. This is used to differentiate CREATE2 addresses from those created with the CREATE opcode. Sender\u2019s Address \u2013 The address of the account creating the contract, typically a smart contract itself when using CREATE2. Salt \u2013 A 32-byte (256-bit) value chosen by the creator. The salt allows the creator to deploy multiple contracts with the same initialization code to different addresses. Initialization Code \u2013 The bytecode of the contract being created. This includes the bytecode that results from compiling the smart contract source code, along with any constructor arguments encoded into it.\n\nTo demonstrate how CREATE2 can deploy another contract with a deterministically computed address, we will use the below simple example that includes two Solidity contracts: Factory and Child. The Factory contract uses the CREATE2 function to deploy the Child contract to a specific precomputed address.\n\nBy deploying the Factory contract to the testnet and using 123456 as a salt, we will be able to precompute the child contract address:\n\nFactory Contract Address is (https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb74025567acdc922507821516014dc5fe659483f):\n\nNow by using computeChildAddress function, we will be able to precompute the child address which is\n\n0xe41Ba18D5e667b0B391b33b848520FA6F041C092:\n\nThis address does not exist yet because we didn\u2019t deploy the contract:\n\nNext, the attacker will try to trick the victim into approving this contract as a spender for a specific token he wants to steal, and because the contract has not been created yet, this transaction evades all forms of wallet security measures the victim possesses, which rely on the historical record of the contract address.\n\nAfter the attacker tricks the user to sign the approval request, he will be able to deploy the contract by using the same salt 123456 in the function deployChild:\n\nAn Example from the Wild\n\nA stark illustration of this vulnerability in action involved a user losing $3.5 million due to such an exploit. The victim approved a transaction for a contract that hadn\u2019t been created yet. The contract was deployed shortly after the approval, and the attacker executed a function to transfer the victim\u2019s funds to their own address.\n\nAt the time of the transaction, the contract a01dee645e4dbaaa8aa2089cc4b1cc34d36fa71c which is approved for the allowance had not been created yet:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xb5f03259859c10243a85f7a9ca27d8b45e67ce6463800193634d27718ba162a0\n\nThis transaction executes an unverified function that performs various checks and then creates the approved contract address by using CREATE2 as we demonstrated before:\n\nTarget \u2013 Which is, in this case, SUPER token\n\ncallData \u2013 This is the bytedata of the function the attacker wants to perform.\n\nin this situation, the attacker performs the transferFrom function and uses the allowance from before to transfer the balance from the victim to the following address 0x8f9278aab84290fe6e78515b7938b3136b89a1e2:\n\nSecuring the Digital Frontier\n\nThe exploitation of the CREATE2 function underscores the ongoing battle between innovation and security in the blockchain space. As Ethereum continues to evolve, so too must the security mechanisms designed to protect users from such sophisticated attacks. Awareness and education are the first steps in safeguarding digital assets against emerging threats. Blockchain developers and users alike must remain vigilant, continuously updating their knowledge and security practices to navigate this ever-changing landscape securely.\n\nThe Threat Intel Blockchain system, developed by Check Point, continues to accumulate valuable information on emerging threats, and this intelligence will be shared in the future. In this collaborative effort, we aim to empower investors with the knowledge needed to navigate the crypto space securely and protect themselves from potential pitfalls.

ETH price is down 7% on the day and almost 20% on the week, wiping out recent gains. On-chain data insights reveal that large-wallet investors, popularly known as whales, are shedding their Ethereum holdings and taking profits, increasing the selling pressure on ETH.\n\nAlso read: Grayscale amends Spot Ethereum ETF filing, ETH trades sideways below $3,700\n\nEthereum price crumbles under rising selling pressure\n\nData from crypto intelligence tracker Spotonchain shows that three large-wallet investors have taken profits on their Ethereum holdings in the past four days. The three Ethereum whales sold 26,946 Ether, worth $95.7 million, and took $39 million in profits. The transactions took place on Binance between March 15 and 19.\n\nAs whales shed their Ether, the altcoin\u2019s supply on exchanges has increased. Between March 15 and 19, ETH reserves on exchanges are up from 13.92 million to 14.43 million. An increase in supply on exchanges implies there is a higher volume of Ether available to sell.\n\nAs seen in the Santiment chart below, Ethereum price declined alongside this supply increase, supporting the thesis that profit-taking has partly driven the drop in Ether\u2019s price.\n\nSupply on Exchanges. Sources: Santiment\n\nEthereum price could sweep $2,900\n\nEthereum price is strongly correlated to Bitcoin. Therefore, the price decline seen in BTC likely helped Ethereum\u2019s price to drop as well alongside factors like profit taking and whale activity.\n\nETH price is on the verge of dipping into the range between $2,717 and $3,200, represented by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) on its monthly chart. Once the altcoin collects liquidity in this zone, its price could rebound towards resistance at $3,500 (represented by R1 in the chart below).\n\nThe ETH/USDT 1-day chart shows that bears are taking over as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator flashes red bars. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.05, close to the neutral zone, meaning ETH is not currently oversold. Should the RSI for ETH drop into the oversold zone, it would give a buy signal for sidelined buyers to step in.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA daily candlestick close below $3,200 (the upper boundary of FVG) would result in a steeper correction that could send ETH price towards support at $2,166."

        "content": "The price activity of Ethereum is reducing the supply of the crypto to the lowest levels recorded since August 2022. Furthermore, the decline in ether supply has marked its fastest decrease since May 2023.\n\nAt the same time, several on-chain metrics are approaching or even reaching new twelve-month highs. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe rapid decline in Ethereum supply and price trends\n\nAs we know, the latest Dencun update of Ethereum was implemented on March 13th.\n\nHowever, it was the previous major update that significantly impacted the total availability of ether.\n\nMid last week, the total amount of ether dropped to the lowest level recorded since August 2022, as indicated by data provided by CryptoQuant and reported by CNBC.\n\nIt is precisely during that period that Ethereum introduced its most significant upgrade to date, moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, known as The Merge.\n\nFurthermore, the rate of decrease in the supply of ether is currently the fastest since the beginning of May 2023.\n\nIn the recent 30 days, the supply of ether has decreased at an annual rate of 0.872%, according to data from ultrasound.money. For comparison, since the Merge itself, the rate of decrease has been 0.246%.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted that the high activity on the Ethereum network has led to high transaction costs and, consequently, to a greater amount of ether being burned.\n\nIn concrete terms, over 1.56 million ether have been burned by the Merge, while less than 1.12 million ether have been issued.\n\nThis has caused a sharp decrease of over 446,000 ether, equivalent to almost 1.62 billion dollars at current prices.\n\nActivity record and on-chain transparency\n\nAlthough the focus is mainly on activity on the Solana network, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to show distinctive signs of vitality.\n\nA seven-day moving average of transactions on Ethereum is approaching its annual peak recorded in January, with 1.26 million transactions recorded just yesterday, according to recent data.\n\nJulio Moreno highlighted that \u201ctotal daily transactions are at record levels, not seen since May 2023\u201d, pointing out an increase in network fees, an increase in burned fees, and a reduction in the total supply of ether.\n\nAt the same time, the number of active addresses on Ethereum is at its highest since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with approximately 540,000 active addresses registered just yesterday.\n\nFurthermore, the number of new addresses on the Ethereum network is also at its highest since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with more than 120,000 new Ethereum addresses.\n\nFinally, the on-chain volume of Ethereum has reached new highs since the beginning of the year and for the past 12 months, with over $7 billion in volume recorded just yesterday, according to data from The Block.\n\nBearish correction for Ethereum: potential recovery towards $4,000?\n\nThe price of Ethereum has started a correction lower below $3,650, but is currently attempting a decent recovery wave in the short term.\n\nThe correction of Ethereum has crossed the levels of $3,800 and $3,700, following Bitcoin, and then dropped below the key support at $3,650, entering a temporary bearish phase.\n\nThe price has even exceeded the critical threshold of $3,500, touching a minimum of 3,414 dollars, but now shows signs of recovery. Ether has recovered above 3,500 dollars and the Fibonacci retracement of 23.6% from its high to low.\n\nCurrently, the price of Ethereum is below $3,700 and the 100-hour simple moving average, with immediate resistance around $3,650 and a clear downtrend line at $3,660.\n\nFuture prospects indicate a possible recovery towards $3,750 or a 50% Fibonacci retracement at $3,830, beyond which it could gain momentum towards $3,925 and, eventually, $4,000."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has undergone notable changes in recent times. On September 15, 2022, the network transitioned from a proof-of-work mining model to a proof-of-stake model. This transition has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption, with reports indicating a 99.95% decrease.\n\nA few days ago, the network implemented the Dencun upgrade, which was designed to improve its functionality and performance. However, following this upgrade, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, falling below the $4,000 mark.\n\nETH had recently shown growth, surpassing $4,000. However, the coin has since experienced a decrease in value along with the broader cryptocurrency market. As of press time, ETH is trading at $3,391, which represents a 6.1% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite this recent decline, ETH remains up by 89% year-to-date and is still the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: Top 3 Coins That Could Hit ATH In The Coming Week\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for the week\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for the week. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,637 and a maximum price of $3,726. The average price is expected to be $3,680.\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the growing expectations of ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. However, the current market sentiment, coupled with Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to push further highs, has dampened the likelihood of ETH surpassing the $4,000 mark this week.\n\nAlso read: Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hit $0.00005 This Week?\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space. Its robust ecosystem, which hosts a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continues to drive innovation and adoption.\n\nHowever, Ethereum also faces challenges, such as high gas fees and scalability issues, which have led to the rise of competing blockchain networks.\n\nWhile the recent drop in Ethereum\u2019s price following the Dencun upgrade may be disappointing for some investors, it is essential to view the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility in the context of its long-term potential.\n\nAlso read: Solana Breaches $200, But Analyst Warns Investors To Stay Out of SOL\n\nEthereum\u2019s fundamental strengths, including its large developer community, robust ecosystem, and commitment to sustainability, position it well for future growth and adoption."

        "title": "Bitcoin Rebounds But Concerns Mount as Ethereum\u2019s Perpetual Funding Turns Negative - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Over the past weekend, the crypto market experienced a tumultuous blend of emotions, characterized by fear and greed, as Bitcoin plunged to lows of 64,500. However, it swiftly rebounded, with the leading asset surging back above the 67,000 mark.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has exhibited significant resilience, the same cannot be said for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rocky Road Amidst Bitcoin\u2019s Resilience\n\nThe heavy selling of BTC put options indicated a dissipation of fear among investors, who seemed eager to capitalize on the dip.\n\nInterestingly, amidst this sentiment shift, there\u2019s a notable inclination towards greed, evidenced by the increasing interest in long-dated Sep and Dec BTC calls targeting lofty price levels of $100-150k. According to the latest analysis by QCP Capital, this optimism reflects a bullish outlook despite recent volatility.\n\nThe Singapore-based digital assets trading firm said Ethereum presents a contrasting narrative as concerns loom as perpetual funding rates turn negative and risk reversals portray a \u201cdownside skew,\u201d signaling apprehension within the market about a potential downturn in the crypto asset\u2019s price despite the continuing rally in alts.\n\nDespite Ethereum reaching a peak of over $4,000, its highest value in two 3years, QCP previously observed a change in market sentiment, evident in the negative risk reversals. These reversals indicate the contrast in implied volatility between call and put options, a shift likely attributed to the decreased chances of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US in the near future.\n\nFollowing the long-awaited Dencun upgrade, which QCP had anticipated, the crypto asset saw a decline to under $3,500 over the weekend amid a market-wide slump.\n\nIs Ether Overvalued?\n\nA different analysis by CryptoQuant revealed that ETH\u2019s total supply is diminishing as a result of heightened network activity and the utilization of transaction fees for burning. The subsequent uptick in staking participation was also observed, with over 31 million ETH staked, indicating growing confidence in the asset\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nIts network also witnessed a notable surge in activity, characterized by increased daily transaction volumes and ETH transfers. However, the current elevated MVRV Ratio implied that ETH might be overvalued.\n\n\u201cThe current high MVRV Ratio suggests that ETH might be overvalued, which calls for a cautiously optimistic approach. Despite these challenges, the Dencun upgrade reinforces Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals. Yet, the market\u2019s recent preference for SOL over ETH signals that we might see some adjustments ahead.\u201d"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is in a problematic state, with key players Ethereum and Ripple facing significant downtrends, while Solana emerges as a beacon of bullish momentum. This divergence in performance offers insights into the current market sentiment and potential future movements.\n\nEthereum has recently slipped below critical support levels, challenging the resilience of the bullish structure established over the preceding months. After reaching all-time highs, ETH has encountered substantial selling pressure, leading to a stark retraction in price.\n\nCurrently grappling with the $3,500 level, Ethereum's next significant support lies around the $3,300 mark, closely aligned with the 200-day moving average. If Ethereum fails to reclaim its position above this threshold, the asset could see further losses, potentially testing the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nResistance for Ethereum is now forming at $3,800, where the asset must break through to reverse the prevailing bearish sentiment. The volume profile shows thinning out at higher prices, which could facilitate a more rapid recovery if buying pressure increases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's precarious position\n\nXRP's situation appears even more tenuous as it teeters on the edge of what some analysts are calling a catastrophe. After enduring a series of legal battles that have left investors wary, XRP is struggling to maintain support at the $0.58 level. A breach below this could trigger a sell-off, driving prices toward the next support at $0.50. On the resistance front, XRP faces a hurdle at $0.65, where previous attempts to rally were quashed by bears.\n\nThe moving averages on XRP's chart are converging, which could either signify consolidation before an upward move or prelude further declines if the price action remains negative. Traders are closely monitoring the $0.60 level, as a sustained closing below this could signal a bearish trend in the making.\n\nSolana's bullish outlier\n\nContrasting sharply with its counterparts, Solana stands out as the market's bullish outlier. Amid the market correction, SOL has been charting an impressive upward trajectory. With local support established at $150, Solana's price action suggests a strong buy-in from investors at these levels. The immediate resistance lies at $190, and a breakout above this could set SOL on a path to retest its recent highs.\n\nSolana's ascent is underpinned by robust on-chain metrics, indicating growing adoption and a healthy ecosystem. The price has been consistently finding higher lows, a bullish indicator in technical analysis. Furthermore, the RSI for SOL is now approaching overbought territory, signaling strong buying momentum that could sustain further price increases.\n\nCurrent sentiment in nutshell\n\nThe divergence in performance among these three assets is a reflection of broader market sentiment. While Ethereum and XRP suffer from bearish pressures, Solana's strength is indicative of the market's appetite for risk and volatility. This sentiment is compounded by the move toward NFTs, DeFi and other blockchain applications, areas where Solana has established a competitive edge.\n\nAs Ethereum and XRP navigate turbulent waters, Solana's relative stability could be a sign of the market's shifting priorities. However, the interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market means that a reversal in the fortunes of larger assets like ETH could have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem, including SOL.\n\nHistorically, when Ethereum has led a market rally, many alternative coins have followed suit. However, the decoupling of Solana's performance from Ethereum's suggests that the market is starting to differentiate between blockchain projects based on the amount of risk those can offer instead of fundamental value.\n\nWhile Ethereum and XRP are showing signs of struggle, they also present opportunities for high-risk, high-reward strategies, should the market conditions shift favorably. Solana's resilience and bullish momentum position it as a hedge against the volatility of its larger counterparts."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMarkets are seeing red early Tuesday morning as Bitcoin drops 7% and Ethereum lags 10%.\n\nThe global crypto market cap has contracted by 8% since yesterday, having dropped below $2.5 trillion after last week getting within 5% of matching its all-time high market capitalization crypto markets last saw in early November 2021.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $63,142.39 after having briefly dropped below the $63,000 mark, according to CoinGecko data. It's been a rapid change of scenery for Bitcoin traders. BTC set a new all-time high by inching above $73,000 last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum has fared even worse than Bitcoin.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the Ethereum price was $3,230.05. That's a 10% drop since yesterday and 20% lower than it was this time last week, when the Ethereum community was ramping up for the Dencun upgrade to go live on mainnet.\n\nThe stark Bitcoin and Ethereum price drops mean that a lot of long positions opened by optimistic traders have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass. In the past day, more than $500 million worth of long and $100 million worth of short positions have been liquidated across digital asset contracts.\n\nWhen a trader opens a long position, it's essentially bet that an asset will increase in price by a certain date. Ideally for investors, they only sell the asset once they've realized some gains and want to take profit. But in extreme cases, an exchange or brokerage can force a trader to liquidate because the asset has seen a big drop in price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, many of the meme coins that were stealing the show a few weeks back have seen even larger losses. That's usually the case for meme coins. When the market's largest assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum see price movement, memes can especially volatile and see outsized gains and losses.\n\nSolana meme coins Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) have dropped 22% and 19% respectively in the past day. And Floki Inu (FLOKI), one of their Ethereum-based Shiba Inu-themed meme coin competitors, has shed 20% since yesterday.\n\nEven Jupiter, the Solana DEX that yesterday pledged to help out the Slerf presale buyers who just lost $10 million, has seen its JUP token drop 16% since this time on Monday."

        "title": "Crypto wallet providers urged to rethink security as criminals drain them of millions - The Register",
        "content": "Infosec researchers are noting rising cryptocurrency attacks and have encouraged wallet security providers to up their collective game.\n\nCheck Point specifically cites the growth of attacks that abuse Ethereum's CREATE2 opcode, dubbing it a \"critical issue in the blockchain community\" that's seeing millions of dollars worth of assets being drained from victims' wallets.\n\nIntroduced in 2019, CREATE2 is seen as a significant advancement for Ethereum, allowing for more efficient deployments of smart contracts \u2013 the technology that validates transactions on the blockchain.\n\nCREATE2 is also the function that's being exploited by attackers to drain tokens from victims' wallets.\n\nOne of its key capabilities is being able to deploy smart contracts to pre-determined addresses, making the entire process more predictable for the blockchain when dealing with multiple contract interactions across the ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nBy pre-determined, it means that an attacker can create temporary, single-use addresses to receive a victim's assets. New addresses can be used for each attack, and this is crucial because wallet security providers rely on previously held data to flag potentially malicious transactions. If the address has no dodgy history, it's likely the transaction will evade these detections.\n\nThe fact that attackers can set up a contract before deploying it (before it even exists), using a wallet address that doesn't have a history of malicious activity, means that if they can get the victim to approve a contract they can drain their funds.\n\nOf course, this requires some social engineering hijinkery to pull off, but we've all heard about the real-life scam stories that sound too wild to be true, but are. This attack works, and has facilitated huge single-transaction scams in recent times.\n\nThe researchers highlighted one fraud in January that saw attackers make off with $3.6 million worth of SuperVerse tokens in one fell swoop as an example of how serious these incidents can be for victims.\n\nRemember: with blockchains, there is no legal recourse and no customer helpline to recover funds. Once they're sent and signed, that's it \u2013 tokens are gone for good.\n\nHow they work and why they work\n\nThe attack flow is as follows. First, an attacker needs to get a victim to approve a contract that hasn't yet been deployed \u2013 the bit that requires social engineering. They then use CREATE2's ability to generate new contract addresses to receive the funds and deploy the malicious contract, complete with the victim's authorization, in turn draining the victim's wallet.\n\nThe key part here is the generation of a new wallet address, one that has no history of being reported for criminal intentions. CREATE2 generates this using a calculation that includes four parameters: the attacker's wallet address, a constant prefix, a salt, and an initialization code.\n\nThis address will be created only when the victim approves the contract, meaning it's never been used before for any illicit dealings, and won't be used again, thereby bypassing the security protections that usually monitor such transactions.\n\n\"The exploitation of the CREATE2 function underscores the continuous battle between innovation and security in the blockchain sphere,\" said Check Point researchers Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, and Roman Zaikin.\n\n\"As Ethereum continues to evolve, so too must the security mechanisms designed to protect users from such sophisticated attacks. Awareness and education are the first steps in safeguarding digital assets against emerging threats. Blockchain developers and users alike must remain vigilant, continuously updating their knowledge and security practices to navigate this ever-changing landscape securely.\n\n\"This vulnerability highlights the need for enhanced security measures in wallet security products to adapt to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets in the face of innovative exploits.\"\n\nThe big business of crypto attacks\n\nTowards the back end of 2023, we saw a string of high-profile wallet-draining attacks netting cybercriminals hefty sums, and the attacks weren't localized to just the Ethereum blockchain either.\n\nJustin Sun, founder of the Tron Foundation and owner of Poloniex, a crypto exchange that was drained of circa $120 million in November, offered a reward for the attackers at the time to return the funds they stole.\n\nThe Monero Project was also mysteriously drained of nearly half a million dollars just days before, and 5,000 Atomic Wallet users were drained earlier in the year \u2013 just a few of the high-profile incidents that took place in 2023.\n\nWhile not all of these have been directly attributed to CREATE2 exploits, researchers told The Register that it seems like North Korea's state-sponsored Lazarus gang may have been behind a sizable proportion of them.\n\nThe web3 anti-scam solution provider ScamSniffer analyzed a series of CREATE2 incidents between May and November 2023, concluding that almost $60 million had been stolen from around 99,000 victims. \u00ae"

        "content": "Owners of Shiba Inu Behind Dogwifhat Meme Auctions NFT on Ethereum\n\nA South Korean Instagram user announced that the Shiba Inu featured in the \"Dogwifhat\" meme, named Achi, was their pet. To celebrate, they planned to auction an NFT of the original photo of Achi wearing a woven beanie on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe user's Instagram profile has consistently posted photos of Achi in various woven clothing for the past five years. They also posted the famous \"Dogwifhat\" photo itself in December 2018, almost a year before it went viral online. Partners of the Achi NFT auction have confirmed that the user has been verified as Achi's true parent. At writing, Dogwifhat (WIF)'s market capitalization is almost $3 billion, while the current bid for the Achi NFT is 55 ETH, around $197,800.\n\nSeveral members of the WIF community and other Solana users expressed disappointment that the Achi NFT auction was not partnered with the WIF team. The new Achi NFT is minted as an Ethereum NFT and is currently up for auction on the Ethereum NFT platform Foundation.\n\nAchi's parents previously attempted to work with the Solana community, partnering to launch a memecoin called ACHI, but the experience ended in a rug pull. As a result, they opted to partner with Feisty DAO for the NFT auction.\n\nDespite the community's frustration, it appears that the WIF community has done little to reach out to Achi's family. WIF launched in December, and as of a few weeks ago, Achi's parents had reportedly never heard from anyone in the community. Path, the Feisty DAO member behind the NFT auction, said he is open to re-minting the NFT on Solana if there is interest. However, he has not yet received any inquiries from WIF community members."

        "content": "A close above $3,700 could help the price back to $4,000.\n\nThe Pi Cycle Top indicator revealed that the ETH might rally.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seemed to have become a shadow of its former self after the price collapsed from $3,633 to $3,22o in the last 24 hours.\n\nDespite the decline, AMBCrypto agrees that the value of the altcoin might retest $4,000. However, this prediction might not come cheap or easy.\n\nThis is because of the number of addresses that accumulated ETH around $3,700. This has made it a key resistance zone.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, ETH\u2019s previous rise above $4,000 placed 89% of its holders in profit.\n\nWho decided what\u2019s next?\n\nHowever, the recent decline meant that there was a sell wall at $3,700 where 991,000 ETH addresses purchased 4.35 million coins.\n\nWith ETH trading below the region, the holders have an opportunity to break even if the price climbs.\n\nIf the participants decide to book profits, the altcoin might find it challenging to revisit the psychological $4,000 mark.\n\nOn the other hand, if buying pressure outweighs the on-chain sell volume, then ETH might cruise above $3,700.\n\nBut whether the cryptocurrency would continue to languish in the red does not depend on the on-chain outlook alone.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto gauged the price action from a technical perspective. According to the 4-hour ETH/USD chart, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) depicted a short-term bearish trend for the altcoin.\n\nAt press time, the 20 EMA (blue) crossed below the 50 EMA (yellow). With this trend, the price of the cryptocurrency might drop by another 7.30%. Should this happen, the value could hit $3,112.\n\nA look at the Aroon Indicator also reinforced the bearish bias. As of this writing, the Aroon Down (blue) was 100% while the Aroon Up (orange) was 35.71%. This indicates that sellers were in control of the price action.\n\nETH is oversold\n\nFurthermore, an assessment of the Supertrend indicated that ETH has not yet flashed a buy signal. But there was an earlier sell signal at $3,780.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in the oversold region. If the reading continues to decrease, then the chances of a harder bounce might also increase.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, ETH might climb to $4,500 when the market turbulence fizzles.\n\nWhile the short-term outlook looked gloomy for ETH, the Pi Cycle Top indicated otherwise for the mid to long-term.\n\nHistorically, the indicator tells when a cryptocurrency is close to the bottom or has hit the market top.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nIf the 111-day moving average (MA), in green hits the same region as the 350-day MA (purple), then Ethereum would have hit the top of this cycle.\n\nBut that was not the case, as the 111-day MA was lower than its opposite number. Thus, the price of ETH might have a lot of upside potential over the forthcoming months."

        "content": "Today the Hyperledger Foundation, the enterprise grade blockchain ecosystem, announced two new members, Citi and Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). Additionally, it unveiled a new Hyperledger Besu Financial Services Working Group. Besu is the popular Ethereum blockchain client that targets enterprise users and works with public and private Ethereum blockchains.\n\nNew members\n\nLast year, Citi unveiled its tokenized deposit offering, Citi Token Services, and later revealed that it used a private Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. However, it has also been experimenting with other technologies, such as Avalanche.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just looking to the future; we\u2019re shaping it, aiming for the next generation of financial solutions to be built on a foundation of trust, safety, soundness, and technological innovation powered by the global community,\u201d said Biser Dimitrov, Global Head, Distributed Ledger Technology Center of Excellence at Citi. \u201cWe look forward to being a part of this cutting-edge community.\u201d\n\nWith the addition of BNDES, numerous regional blockchain development networks now use Besu, including LACChain (IDB), Europe\u2019s EBSI and Spain\u2019s Alastria network.\n\nAnother Brazilian institution, Banco Central do Brasil, uses Besu as the foundation of its wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, DREX.\n\nHyperledger Besu Financial Services Working Group\n\nThe central bank is one of the members of the new finance working group led by the DTCC. Others include Accenture, Consensys, Citi, Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC), Kaleido, LACNET, Mastercard, Santander, Visa, and Web3 Labs. Recent Blockdaemon research found that 44% of 92 institutions it explored used Besu.\n\n\u201cThe number of enterprise users of Hyperledger Besu in the digital assets space is rapidly increasing, underscoring the need for establishing a collaboration space for the financial services industry to align on development priorities,\u201d said Carlos Vivas of the DTCC, and Chair of the working group.\n\nHyperledger already has a special interest group (SIG) for the financial services sector. However, the SIG\u2019s focus is on general financial services use cases and is not linked to one of Hyperledger\u2019s 13 projects. In contrast, the new Besu Financial Services working group is a technical working group that will influence the Besu roadmap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s creating an open forum for anyone to participate. You don\u2019t have to be a member of the Foundation,\u201d said Daniela Barbosa, Executive Director of Hyperledger Foundation. \u201cBut many of our founding members, including our newest one, Citi, are taking leadership roles in that working group. And it is a place for the end users and the engineers at those financial services companies to work on requirements to help the maintainers of Besu understand the critical features that need to be implemented and moved forward in the Besu project.\u201d\n\nEyes on public blockchain\n\nA key driver in Besu\u2019s popularity is the potential for institutions to use public blockchain now or migrate some functionality in the future. Besu is the third most popular Ethereum software client, used by about 9% of public mainnet and especially by institutions. In January the second most popular client, Nethermind, had a bug that caused an outage, highlighting the importance of diversifying clients.\n\nThat could be a pro and con for Besu. On the one hand, it could help drive further adoption on public blockchain. But there\u2019s also an argument that Besu could become overly dominant for permissioned Ethereum instances. Hence, a bug could influence several institutional infrastructures. One counter argument is that permissioned chains have greater control, so the risks are not as significant."

It reached $200 for the first time since October 2021.\n\nAt press time, SOL was 22x higher than the lows of the 2022 crypto winter.\n\nNetwork activity imparts value\n\nThe increasing on-chain activity was likely boosting the coin\u2019s value.\n\nSolana logged the highest decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes for the second straight day, surpassing Ethereum [ETH] and all its associated layer-2 (L2) networks, AMBCrypto noted using DeFiLlama\u2019s data.\n\nAs evident below, Solana\u2019s weekly DEX volumes have been growing steadily over the past month, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $17.5 billion last week.\n\nHigher engagement with DEXes meant a higher number of transactions, and therefore higher fees. Solana recorded its highest on-chain fees on the 17th of March, totaling $3.82 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain fees have declined in recent days, while Solana\u2019s have increased. If the trend holds, Solana could flip Ethereum as the chain with the highest fees.\n\nSince the network burns a percentage of the fees earned in SOL, such high levels of network utilization indirectly aided the coin\u2019s upward climb.\n\nIncreased profit-taking a worry?\n\nEven whales found it tough to resist the temptation, seeing SOL\u2019s rally. According to Lookonchain data, large investors started offloading their SOL holdings to make profits.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nOne particular whale moved a whopping 200k SOL coins, worth $40 million at press time, to cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the past two days.\n\nWhile this may reflect profitability now, a sustained period of whale sell-offs could apply brakes on the ongoing rally."

It could trade to $5K-$10K in this cycle. So buying it at $140 is a great asymmetric risk profile.\n\nAdditionally, he highlighted Solana\u2019s UX/UI as the best in the ecosystem and easy to use.

Discover SCENE\n\nAn Ethereum NFT photo of the original Dogwifhat meme\u2014which inspired one of the hottest Solana meme coins of the moment, WIF\u2014was sold for a whopping $4.3 million worth of ETH early Monday, narrowly surpassing the previous record held for most expensive meme NFT ever sold.\n\nThe on-chain image of a Shiba Inu puppy in a knit beanie sold for 1,210.759 ETH early Monday, a sum worth $4,311,234 at the time of the transaction. The NFT sold to GCR, a prominent pseudonymous crypto trader, via an auction on the digital art platform Foundation.\n\nJust two hours before the auction concluded this morning, the Dogwifhat NFT had only secured a top bid of 55 ETH, worth about $195,000 at writing. Then, a furious bidding war ensued between GCR and Memeland, an NFT venture collective from the team behind social media platform 9GAG. Memeland bid as high as 1,100.69 ETH before GCR secured the piece with a final offer north of $4.3 million.\n\nThat figure officially\u2014if ever so slightly\u2014makes today\u2019s Dogwifhat NFT acquisition the most expensive meme NFT sale of all time. The record was previously held by the original Doge NFT, which sold to the collective PleasrDAO on June 11, 2021, for 1,696.9 ETH\u2014a sum then worth $4.234 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongrats, Achi! On Nov. 17, 2018, Achi's owners captured him in an endearing hat on camera. On Mar. 18, 2024, that photo, Achi, dog wif hat, became our second highest auction, collected by @GiganticRebirth for 1,210.759 ETH ($4.3m USD). pic.twitter.com/KrAeQ5WMVm \u2014 Foundation \ud83c\udf10 (@foundation) March 18, 2024\n\n\u201cIt went for far more than expected,\u201d Path, the pseudonymous facilitator of the Dogwifhat NFT sale, told Decrypt. \u201cI think it\u2019s great for the entire category [of memes] and the concept of provenance. WIF is definitely more crypto-native than Doge.\u201d\n\nThe NFT was put on sale by two South Korean pet owners who took the original photograph from the viral Dogwifhat meme back in 2018\u2014one featuring their Shiba Inu, Achi.

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: Which Smart Contracts Blockchain Should You Pick? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Solana and Ethereum are among the most important blockchain projects on the market today, and are the go-to platforms for anyone who\u2019s looking to build or use decentralized applications.\n\nWe\u2019ll be comparing Solana vs. Ethereum in several categories to help you understand the most important differences between these two leading blockchains, as well as the areas where they are similar.\n\nKey highlights: Ethereum and Solana are currently the leading blockchains with smart contract capabilities.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is substantially larger than the Solana ecosystem, although Solana has been seeing a resurgence since late 2023.\n\nSolana currently offers much lower fees and faster transactions than Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is primarily looking to improve its scalability through layer 2 platforms, while Solana developers are focused on layer 1 improvements.\n\nETH is currently deflationary due to EIP-1559 token burns, while SOL is designed to have a long-term 1.5% yearly inflation rate.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum \u2013 Comparing the two leading smart contract platforms\n\nNow, let\u2019s get right into our analysis of the differences and similarities between Solana and Ethereum. We\u2019ll be taking a quick look at the projects\u2019 histories, approach to scalability, consensus mechanisms, smart contract capabilities, and more.\n\nHistory\n\nEthereum was first conceived in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, who also authored the Ethereum whitepaper published in 2014. The project successfully raised $16 million in an ICO in August of 2014. Besides Buterin, the Ethereum project was also co-founded by Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin, Charles Hoskinson and Anthony Di Iorio.\n\nThe initial development of Ethereum was led by a Swiss non-profit called the Ethereum Foundation, which continues to play an important role in the Ethereum ecosystem today. The Ethereum mainnet launched in July of 2015.\n\nSolana was initially proposed in 2017, but the network itself made its debut in 2020. Solana was created by Solana Labs, an organization founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal.\n\nPrior to the launch of the Solana blockchain, the project raised funds for development through private token sales and a public sale on the CoinList platform. In 2021, Solana Labs raised a $314 million funding round, which eclipsed all the project\u2019s previous capital raises. This funding round included investments from leading crypto venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Multicoin Capital.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nAlthough Ethereum and Solana have significant differences in how they operate under the hood, they are both decentralized blockchain platforms with general-purpose smart contract capabilities.\n\nTherefore, they can both be leveraged for use cases such as custom tokens, NFTs, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, prediction markets and on-chain governance systems.\n\nEthereum smart contracts are written in a custom programming language called Solidity, which is influenced by popular programming languages such as C++, Python and JavaScript. Due to the popularity of Ethereum, Solidity has become a well established language for smart contract development and there is a robust ecosystem of development tools specifically designed for it.\n\nMeanwhile, smart contracts in Solana are written in the Rust, C and C++ programming languages, which are mature programming languages that many developers are already closely familiar with.\n\nConsensus mechanisms\n\nBetween its launch in July of 2015 and September of 2022, Ethereum used a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Ethereum mining was commonly performed with GPUs (graphics processing units), although there were also ASIC miners available for the Ethereum\u2019s Ethash algorithm.\n\nIn September of 2022, Ethereum successfully underwent a transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This has significantly reduced the environmental impact of the Ethereum network, and has also opened the doors for certain scalability improvements, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible under Proof-of-Work.\n\nSolana developers the Proof-of-History protocol to provide reliable and fast synchronization between nodes and validate transactions reliably. However, it\u2019s important to understand that Proof of History is not a stand-alone consensus mechanism \u2013 it\u2019s a protocol that supports Solana\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nETH vs SOL\n\nThe native asset of the Ethereum blockchain is called Ether, and it\u2019s commonly referred to with the ticker ETH. All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain require a fee paid in ETH \u2013 this is required to dissuade spam transactions and provide an incentive for validators to continue securing the network.\n\nThe supply of ETH doesn\u2019t have an upper limit. In practice, the supply of ETH has actually been slowly decreasing since September 2022, when the Ethereum network moved over to Proof-of-Stake consensus.\n\nThis is because the number of ETH that\u2019s being burned through the EIP-1559 mechanism is greater than the number of new ETH that\u2019s being created to reward validators. This could change in the future \u2013 if demand for transaction on the Ethereum network drops substantially in the future, it\u2019s possible that the Ethereum supply could begin inflating again.\n\nThe base unit of ETH is called wei. One ETH consists of 10^18 wei (1,000,000,000,000,000,000). Since wei is such a small unit, it\u2019s not used very commonly to refer to prices. Ethereum gas prices are typically expressed in gwei, which equals 10^9 wei (1,000,000,000).\n\nSolana\u2019s native asset is SOL, and performs a similar role as ETH does on Ethereum. A fee paid in SOL is required for any transaction on the Solana blockchain, and Solana validators are rewarded with SOL for securing the network.\n\nThere is no maximum limit to the SOL supply, and the supply of SOL is actually designed to gradually increase over time. The initial SOL inflation rate was 8% per year, although it is designed to gradually increase until it reaches the long-term target of 1.5% per year.\n\nThe base unit of SOL is called a lamport. One SOL consists of 100 million lamports.\n\nScalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability on the base layer is quite limited, and the Ethereum ecosystem has been focusing on improving scalability through layer 2 solutions that rely on the Ethereum mainnet for security while offering cheaper and faster transactions to users. This is achieved through various means \u2013 for example, layer 2s that use \u201crollups\u201d bundle multiple transactions into one transaction, which is then posted to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn terms of improving layer 1 scalability, Ethereum developers are working on sharding. Through the implementation of sharding, the Ethereum mainnet will be split into smaller, interlinked networks known as \"shards.\" These shards will independently process transactions and execute smart contracts in parallel with one another, which is expected to provide a big boost to the amount of transactions the Ethereum network will be able to process and significantly reduce transaction fees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Solana ecosystem is focused on scaling directly on the base layer instead of relying on layer 2 solutions. Solana is already one of the cheapest cryptos to transfer, but could deliver even better scalability in the future. Here, we should mention Firedancer, a Solana client that\u2019s being developed by a team from the high-frequency trading firm Jump Trading.\n\nBuilt from the ground up, Firedancer aims to optimize networking, consensus rules and runtime processing in order to overcome current software bottlenecks.\n\nAccording to revealed benchmarks, Firedancer can already handle over 1 million TPS per core in testing environments. Once validators running Firedancer come online, the Solana mainnet could see dramatic leaps in throughput and efficiency. The client diversity also improves decentralization and resilience.\n\nDecentralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is viewed as being much more decentralized than the Solana network, although Solana has perhaps been treated a bit unfairly in regards to decentralization.\n\nPer data from Ethernodes, there are 7,292 nodes active on the Ethereum network at the time of writing this article. These nodes are spread out across more than 50 countries, although there is a relatively concentration of nodes in Europe and North America.\n\nWhen it comes to client diversity, there are 4 main Ethereum clients in use today: Geth, Nethermind, Besu and Erigon. Reth, which is an Ethereum client written in the Rust programming language, is also seeing some adoption.\n\nAccording to data from Solana Compass, there are 2,919 active nodes on the Solana network at the time of writing this article. These nodes are spread out across 211 different cities in 31 countries.\n\nIn terms of clients, Solana node operators currently have two options: a client developed by Solana Labs and a client developed by Jito Labs. Firedancer, which is being developed by Jump Crypto, will provide another alternative once it sees its mainnet launch sometime in 2024.\n\nSolana has seen considerable criticism due to several incidents where the network experienced downtime. The most recent Solana network outage came on February 6, 2024, when the network was down for roughly 4 and a half hours. Other major Solana outages happened in October 2022 and February 2023. You can view a comprehensive history of Solana\u2019s uptime and outages on the Solana status page.\n\nValidators\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana are permissionless networks, which means that there is no whitelisting requirement for anyone to join the network as a validator. However, operating a validator is not particularly accessible in practice when it comes to both Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIf you want to operate your own validator on the Ethereum network, a stake of 32 ETH is required. Based on the ETH price at the time of writing this article, this translates to just over $118,000, which is an amount of capital that most ETH holders simply don\u2019t have or can\u2019t afford to invest into a volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nETH holders who don\u2019t have 32 ETH but still want to participate in staking can do so through cryptocurrency exchanges or liquid staking protocols. You can learn more about this in our article exploring Ethereum staking.\n\nWhen it comes to Solana, the main bottleneck for participating in the network as a validator is not the required amount of SOL, but rather the hardware requirements for running a Solana validator successfully.\n\nPer the hardware recommendations provided by Solana Labs, you\u2019ll need a CPU with a base clock speed of 2.8GHz or higher with at least 12 cores / 24 threads, 256GB of RAM, and ample storage to run a Solana validator. On top of that, you\u2019ll need a fast internet connection. The cost of putting together such a setup is substantial, but is actually more accessible than obtaining 32 ETH to run an Ethereum validator.\n\nSOL holders who don\u2019t want to run their own validator can delegate their tokens to an existing validator, and receive a portion of the earned staking rewards. This can be done easily with any Solana wallet that supports staking \u2013 the Phantom and Solflare wallets are great examples.\n\nAdoption and ecosystem\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has a stronger ecosystem than Solana overall. Ethereum has a more active development community, larger DeFi protocols, tokens with larger market capitalizations and more valuable NFT collections.\n\nAccording to data from DeFi Llama, the decentralized finance ecosystem on Ethereum has a total value locked of $51.89 billion, which is over 5x larger than the second-placed Tron. Solana is currently in fourth place, with a TVL of roughly $4.32 billion.\n\nThe top 10 blockchains by TVL (total value locked) in decentralized finance apps. Image source: DeFi Llama.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains dominant in the smart contract platform sector, Solana has been making large strides in terms of adoption since late 2023. After seeing a precipitous drop in 2022 and stagnating for the majority of 2023, Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has started seeing impressive growth once again.\n\nThe TVL (total value locked) on Solana-based decentralized finance apps since March 2021. Image source: DeFi Llama.\n\nWe should also mention that Solana is currently a hotspot for meme tokens, with Solana-based meme projects like Dogwifhat and Bonk displaying large gains and igniting a speculative mania for meme tokens.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum \u2013 The bottom line\n\nEthereum and Solana are both top-tier blockchain platforms with support for smart contract. They can both be used to build an almost infinite variety of decentralized applications, and both projects will likely stay relevant over the long term.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Solana and Ethereum is that the Solana ecosystem is looking to scale the platform further through improvements on layer 1, while the Ethereum ecosystem is mostly focused on scaling through layer 2 solutions that rely on the Ethereum layer 1 for security.\n\nEthereum currently has a more robust ecosystem and a larger number of developers, although Solana has certainly been making strong progress in the last year to become a truly worthwhile competitor to Ethereum.\n\nIf you\u2019re interesting in more comparisons between top blockchain platforms, make sure to check out our article tackling the topic of Cardano vs. Solana."

        "title": "Cardano Vs Solana: Which Is the Potential \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Cardano and Solana are among the smart contract platforms growing in popularity the most. The term \"Ethereum Killer\" is often used to describe blockchains that are trying to provide a better alternative to Ethereum. In most cases, this means providing similar smart contract functionality while offering better transaction throughput and lower costs.\n\nIn this article, we will compare the Cardano and Solana blockchains in terms of TPS, consensus mechanisms, market caps, technologies they have, and more. We will attempt to determine which of these two \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d is more worthwhile to invest in.\n\nKey highlights: Cardano, founded by Charles Hoskinson, uses a novel consensus mechanism called Ouroborus, which is up to 1.6 million times more efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nSolana, developed by Anatoly Yakovenko, is known for its Proof-of-History model combined with Proof-of-Stake, offering high transaction speeds and low costs.\n\nCardano's ADA and Solana's native coins have both seen significant price increases, with Cardano prioritizing decentralization and Solana focusing on high transaction speed.\n\nWhile Cardano excels in decentralization and real-world applications, Solana leads in NFT and DeFi sectors with its fast and cost-effective network.\n\nThe choice between Cardano and Solana depends on individual needs and interests, with both offering unique advantages in the blockchain space.\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is a blockchain project founded by Charles Hoskinson, who also played a role in the early days of the Ethereum project. The native coin of the Cardano blockchain is called ADA. The consensus mechanism that Cardano uses is Proof-of-Stake, which consumes less energy than Proof-of-Work.\n\nThe Cardano mainnet was launched in September 2017. The project\u2019s goals include providing financial services to people who have difficulty accessing the banking system, decentralizing financial services, and expanding the benefits of blockchain use. The Cardano project has been especially active in the African market. For example, it has collaborated with the government of Ethiopia.\n\nThe Cardano mainnet gained smart contract capability with the Alonzo upgrade in 2021. This enabled DeFi protocols to be built on the Cardano network and enabled the network to host new building blocks of the Web3 ecosystem, such as new dApps and P2E (play-to-earn) games. One of Cardano's goals is to be the most sustainable and eco-friendly blockchain platform. When Ouroboros is improved with an upgrade called Hydra, the scalability of the network is expected to increase significantly.\n\nOuroboros consensus mechanism\n\nThe Ouroboros consensus mechanism, created by Cardano developers as a result of peer-reviewed and academic research, is a more efficient Cardano-specific implementation of Proof-of-Stake. According to Charles Hoskinson, this model is 1.6 million times more energy efficient than Bitcoin. Using a combination of combinatorics, mathematical game theory, and cryptography, Ouroboros supports a sustainable, provably secure, and integrated community node network.\n\nCardano pros: Cardano has a fairly large network of validators, leading to relatively strong decentralization\n\nThe network is energy efficient and has been running reliably so far\n\nHas a strong ecosystem backing it with entities like the Cardano Foundation and Emurgo Cardano cons: Cardano\u2019s smart contracts are based on Haskell, a niche programming language that not many developers are familiar with\n\nThe project is known for its \u201cslow and steady\u201d approach, which can be a negative in the fast-moving blockchain space\n\nStill requires some upgrades before it can meaningfully compete with platforms like Ethereum\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a blockchain project founded by former Qualcomm software engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. The feature that puts Solana in an advantageous position against Cardano and other competitors is the blockchain based on the Proof-of-History model.\n\nThe Proof-of-History combined with Proof-of-Stake has brought the ability to process transactions at much higher speeds and lower transaction costs compared to the consensus mechanisms of other blockchains. In fact, Solana has achieved a network that is fast enough to compare with the speeds of huge payment firms such as MasterCard.\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana hosts thousands of dApps in many different categories, primarily DeFi, on the blockchain. The project, which managed to increase its market cap very quickly in 2021, is notably supported by FTX, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, and by many venture companies.\n\nProof of History (PoH)\n\nSolana developers have developed an innovative timestamp format to provide reliable and fast synchronization between nodes and validate transactions. Proof-of-History provides a reliable method for nodes to validate transactions on the network.\n\nProof of History is not a stand-alone consensus mechanism; it is a protocol that supports a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nSolana pros: Solana offers the lowest transaction fees compared to its competitors\n\nSolana is the second most used blockchain after Ethereum when it comes to NFT marketplaces, NFT trading, and new NFT collections\n\nSolana is also environmentally friendly, and the Solana Foundation aims to make this network carbon neutral Solana cons: The Solana network has had numerous outages, leading to reliability concerns\n\nRunning a Solana validator requires expensive computer hardware\n\nSolana vs Cardano: Which is better?\n\nIn the Solana vs. Cardano comparison, we should know that both blockchains offer many useful alternatives to real-world problems and Ethereum's problems. Both blockchains contain very advanced technologies, and their native coins saw major price increases in 2021.\n\nIn terms of decentralization, Cardano currently appears to have the upper hand, as becoming a validator on the Solana blockchain is much more difficult.\n\nCardano Solana Mainnet Launch September 2017 March 2020 Price $0.665 $205 Market Cap $22.5 billion $91 billion Number of Active Wallets 67,250 1.4 million Total Value Locked (TVL) $535 million $6.75 billion\n\nData collected on March 18, 2024\n\nAnother thing to consider in the SOL vs ADA comparison is that the Solana network has experienced outages more than 7 times since launch. Solana users had to wait for hours to complete their transactions multiple times.\n\nAlthough Cardano is developing projects for the adoption of the use of blockchain in the world, the concrete steps taken in this regard are quite limited. Although the goals of both blockchains are very good, the speed at which they\u2019re reaching their goals leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nCardano vs. Solana is a comparison that should be evaluated under two different categories. If you are interested in DeFi, NFT, and P2E dApps, the Solana ecosystem is the right choice for you.\n\nIf you are more interested in use cases like storing credentials, supply chain management and the use of blockchain in administration processes, then Cardano is probably more interesting to look at.\n\nTransactions per second (TPS)\n\nCardano Solana Current TPS Limit 477 65,000 Theoretical TPS Limit 1 million 700,000 Transfer Time <1min 5 seconds Average Fee $0.22 $0.005\n\nData collected on March 18, 2024\n\nAccording to developers, the Solana blockchain could theoretically reach the capability of processing 700,000 transactions per second. Cardano, on the other hand, could process up to 1 million transactions per second after the Hydra upgrade.\n\nWhile the theoretical limits can be interesting to discuss, Solana is currently much faster than Cardano. The Solana TPS (transactions per second) is currently around 65,000, while the Cardano TPS tops out at around 477.\n\nOn Solana, the average transaction fee is $0.005, and the transaction latency is around 5 seconds, while on Cardano, the average transaction fee is roughly $0.11, and the transaction latency is less than a minute (but can take up to 20 minutes in some cases).\n\nIs Cardano a good investment?\n\nCardano's work to increase blockchain adoption has made it one of the most used blockchains for solving real-world problems. IOHK's appetite for developing this blockchain and the perseverance of the community could make Cardano a good investment.\n\nBefore making a Cardano price prediction, it\u2019s important to consider the factors that are affecting the broader cryptocurrency market. A few conditions need to be met for the crypto market to start a new bull rally. Improvement in macroeconomic conditions will be achieved by decreasing inflation and gradually lowering the interest rate. With the Bitcoin halving approaching, the Cardano price could see a significant increase after the next crypto bull run takes off.\n\nIt's worth noting that ADA has been a rather poor performer in the past couple of months. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and especially Solana showed 100%+ rallies over the past year, ADA has been on a more modest uptrend. Meanwhile, the ADA currency gained about 80% in the past 12 months, which is less than virtually every other major crypto. This has caused ADA to slip in rankings, currently sitting as the 9th largest crypto asset by market cap (down from 5th in 2021).\n\nIs Solana a good investment?\n\nThe Solana ecosystem, which is one of the biggest actors in the market, especially in the NFT and DeFi sectors, continues to increase its market share in both sectors. The fact that Solana has always been in the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies since August 2021, when it started to show its potential, has made it a good investment.\n\nThe Solana price prediction will also be impacted by the same conditions that apply to Cardano and the rest of the crypto market. A new alt season could push the Solana price back to its 2021 ATH. In fact, we've recently seen Solana break the important psychological barrier at $200, which was last reached during the 2021 bull run.\n\nIt's difficult to say how much higher Solana could go in the future, given that it already sits as the 4th largest market cap crypto. However, with the growing popularity of Solana coins, increasing DeFi volume, and impressive on-chain stats, Solana could still have room to grow in the future.\n\nSolana vs. Cardano: Here's the bottom line\n\nBoth Cardano and Solana have an advantage over each other in terms of certain features. Solana is a notable smart contract platform for its unique PoH protocol and its place in the NFT industry, while Cardano stands out for its strong decentralization, long history, and real-world uses.\n\nCardano leverages peer-reviewed academic research and pioneers\u2019 decentralization. Solana is both faster and cheaper, but its effective level of decentralization could certainly be improved upon. When choosing one of the two cryptocurrencies, you can decide according to your experience, needs and belief in the projects.\n\nIf you want to see more blockchain comparisons, feel free to take a look at our Solana vs. Avalanche comparison."

        "title": "Solana Surpasses Ethereum In Major Metric Amid Surge Above $200 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Solana has recently become one of the trendiest cryptocurrencies in the space, capturing the interest of both crypto investors and enthusiasts in the space. The popular cryptocurrency has witnessed a significant surge in network activity, surpassing even that of Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nSolana Outpaces Ethereum Network Activity\n\nOn March 16, Solana experienced a major increase in its overall network activity, pushing its capacity to its limits amidst the growing demands. The network had surged past Ethereum\u2019s total trading volume and exceeded its daily trading volume by more than $1.1 billion, according to data by DefilLama.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Analyst Predicts Further Upside For Shiba Inu, Here\u2019s The Target 6 months ago\n\nSpecifically, Solana\u2019s 24-hour trading volume had recorded almost $3 billion, surging past Ethereum\u2019s daily volume of $2.04 billion. During the surge, the network witnessed an unprecedented amount of trading activities, which resulted in failed transactions and a surge in ping times.\n\nAs highlighted by Solana Validator, the cryptocurrency network\u2019s ping time on March 18, had jumped to a staggering 46 seconds, causing about a 30% to 40% failed transactions. The validator\u2019s report also revealed a steady and rapid increase in Solanan\u2019s transaction count, recording over 276 million transactions at the time of writing, with about 2,107 transactions per second.\n\nThis rise in Solana\u2019s network activity has been attributed to the surge in interest in Solana-based meme coins. On Thursday, March 14, degens eagerly sought after a new meme coin called Book of Meme (BOME), which had experienced an unprecedented bullish spike that triggered its market capitalization to rise from almost zero to a staggering $1.45 billion.\n\nDuring these periods, the price of Solana also rallied alongside, witnessing an unexpected price surge that propelled it by more than 30% in the past week. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady momentum since the beginning of the year, displaying slight price corrections before continuing on its upward trajectory.\n\nSOL Price Rides The Bullish Wave\n\nAmidst Solana\u2019s burgeoning popularity and rising transaction volumes, the cryptocurrency saw a price increase to more than $200, reflecting a daily surge of approximately 8.9%, at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency\u2019s market capitalization is also up by 11.10%, recording over $89 billion and steadily closing towards the $100 billion mark.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDue to its overwhelming network activities and growing popularity, Solana has successfully gained the position of the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, overtaking BNB Chain (BNB) by more than four billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency has reached peak levels globally in terms of Google search interest, hitting a new all-time high. This surge has been attributed to the increasing interest and demand for the popular digital asset.\n\nSOL price crosses $200 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from LinkedIn, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "5 Best Ways How to Stake Ethereum With Ease in 2024 - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "Crypto has come a long way since 2009, when Bitcoin was launched. So many things have changed, and thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been developed. Users now have endless options regarding crypto, blockchain, Web3, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), mining, staking, yield farming, and many more. Even mentioning those crypto-related terms can show how much crypto has grown.\n\nWhile so many crypto projects are on the market, some remain in the spotlight thanks to their features, the years they have been traded for, and the security and safety they provide. Among them is Ethereum, one of the cryptocurrencies that progressed the most and revolutionized many concepts in the crypto industry.\n\nSo, if you have been around for the littlest of time, you might have considered purchasing Ethereum. Are we right?\n\nAnd you may have also asked yourself what it takes to earn more by staking those ETH coins. Well, you are in the right place. This article will discuss Ethereum staking, its main requirements, and the best ways to stake your ETH.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nOfficially launched on July 30, 2015, by a team of 5 founders, Ethereum is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. Unlike some may think, Ethereum was not conceived with fast transactions in mind.\n\nHowever, the network\u2019s initial developers, Vitalik Buterin, Jeffrey Wilck, and Gavin Wood, aimed to develop an ecosystem that can store decentralized applications (dApps) and help the DeFi industry evolve as much as possible.\n\nThe whitepaper of Ethereum, published in 2013, explained what dApps are, how they work, and how they can rely on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, Ethereum is home to numerous decentralized applications and many other types of crypto projects, being the most developed blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge Update\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has passed through plenty of updates and new launches, but the most significant remains The Merge. While Ethereum first worked based on a PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus mechanism, on September 15, 2022, the network switched to PoS (Proof-of-Stake), thus moving from mining to staking.\n\nThe Merge was a major change for Ethereum and came with various significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption. After switching from PoW to PoS, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by approximately 99.95%, a tremendous decrease in carbon emissions.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Dencun upgrade took place on March 13 and is the latest update that starts the surge, Ethereum\u2019s phase, in which it addresses certain scalability limitations. As Vitalik Buterin said, they aim to hit 100,000 transactions per second and beyond.\n\nAs a result, the new update consists of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844 or proto-dank sharding, which aims to introduce temporary storage called data blobs for Eteherum L2 networks to use.\n\nThese blobs will increase the capacity of the availability of data, whereby L2 rollups can use the extra space to submit the data to the mainnet, thus reducing L2 gas fees.\n\nI don\u2019t think there will be an immediate reduction (on March 13), I don\u2019t know how far along the L2s are with rolling out their blob support, but I would suspect that it takes them a few days/weeks to fully support EIP-4844 and not post their data as CALLDATA but switch to blobs \u2013 said Marius van der Wijden, software developer at Geth, and Ethereum.\n\nBut what does this update mean for Ethereum staking?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a direct impact on the Ethereum staking core process; the locking up of 32 ETH remains unchanged. However, the effect is more on the broader picture: the more transactions the network supports per second, the busier the network will become. Thus, it could make Ethereum staking even more appealing, increasing activity on the network.\n\nEthereum Staking\n\nOnce The Merge was completed, the Ethereum network moved to Ethereum 2.0, or the 2nd version of the blockchain. This way, users can stake their ETH to earn staking rewards based on the amount of ETH they lock up and the lock-up period.\n\nStaking ETH implies using your coins to verify, secure, and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Once a transaction is verified, you can receive a reward. That reward is the network fee required by the blockchain to complete that transaction.\n\nHowever, with the new Dencun upgrade, the network will cater to more secure interactions between various blockchains through EIP-4788, improving cross-chain bridges and stake pools.\n\nWhere and How to Stake Ethereum\n\nSince Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, crypto enthusiasts can now stake their ETH coins. It is widely known that the staking process is a little less complex than mining. Furthermore, you need less powerful (and expensive) hardware for staking than mining.\n\nSo, many crypto investors were eager to start staking Ethereum once this was possible.\n\nCurrently, there are multiple ways to stake ETH, and you have to choose the most profitable and accessible to complete, depending on your needs, holdings, and knowledge.\n\nThe most popular Ethereum staking options include solo staking, staking pools, staking through a centralized crypto exchange, or even SaaS (Staking as a Service).\n\nWe will take them one by one and highlight their features and advantages.\n\n1. Staking Ethereum on Crypto Exchanges\n\nHundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges are on the market, each with new or improved features and products. Most of them also support Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies, and some also allow users to stake their ETH tokens to improve the Ethereum network and earn extra coins.\n\nStaking on a crypto exchange is easier than you think. First, you must sign up on a platform if you still need an account. Then, you should purchase ETH or move it from another platform. Afterward, you must select the amount of ETH you want to lock up and start staking it.\n\nBinance\n\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, with over 168 million registered users. The platform is user-friendly but most suitable for crypto investors with at least a little trading knowledge.\n\nBinance supports over 350 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, the platform allows users to stake their ETH coins. The minimum required amount is 0.1 ETH, and the reference APR varies but is approximately 3.5%. At the moment of writing, the reference APR was 3.22%.\n\nStaking ETH on Binance is as straightforward as possible. You do not need extensive crypto knowledge to do this, and Binance is here to help its users stake their Ethereum coins by explaining the process on its official website.\n\nStep 1: Sign up on Binance\n\nFirst, if you do not have a Binance account, you should sign up. To do this, you will have to provide an email address, your phone number, and other similar information. However, Binance will never ask you to provide too much information, as it only requires what it needs to create your account.\n\nStep 2: Click on \u201cEarn\u201d\n\nOnce you are registered and signed in, you can go to the staking page. To do this, you will have to click on \u201cEarn\u201d from the top of the screen.\n\nStep 3: Click on Ethereum\n\nThen, you should see multiple cryptocurrencies available, each having a dropdown. Click on \u201cEthereum.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Click on \u201cETH Staking\u201d\n\nThen, you will see the staking option.\n\nStep 5: Start Staking Ethereum\n\nAfter you click on \u201cETH Staking,\u201d you will be able to stake your Ethereum coins as desired. You will also notice the reference APR, the conversion ratio, and the total value staked on Binance.\n\nOf course, it is essential to note that you must hold ETH to stake it on Binance or any other platform. So, if you do not hold it yet, you can purchase it directly on Binance.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is the 2nd largest crypto exchange on the market, available almost worldwide and offering numerous trading services. Coinbase allows users to buy, sell, and trade over 250 cryptocurrencies through 2 leading platforms: Coinbase Simple Trade and Coinbase Advanced Trade .\n\nStaking on Coinbase is pretty straightforward. The platform is user-friendly, and the staking feature is not significantly more complicated than other processes supported by the Coinbase exchange.\n\nOnce you have some ETH coins in your account, you can start staking it and earn ETH staking rewards. The estimated reward rate for Ethereum staking is 3.49%. Thus, depending on your holdings and the amount you lock up, you can earn approximately 3.49% of the amount of staked ETH.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken is one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and exchange over 220 cryptocurrencies, including the most popular, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the staking feature is a little affected at the moment by a lawsuit filed by the SEC against Kraken at the beginning of the year, the crypto exchange still offers staking for various cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Cosmos (ATOM), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), or Tron (TRX). However, it is essential to note that the feature is still not available for US citizens.\n\nStill, if you want to earn rewards by staking ETH, you can use Kraken, as the platform is extremely intuitive, so the process should not take too much. The yearly rewards for Ethereum staking range between 3% and 6%, depending on the amount of staked ETH and the period you decide to lock up your coins.\n\n2. Stake Ethereum on Crypto Wallets\n\nStaking Ethereum through crypto wallets is as easy as with crypto exchanges. Things are similar, and the main requirement is to hold some ETH coins in your account. Numerous wallets allow users to stake ETH, some of the most popular being MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask may be one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets on the market. It is available as a web browser extension (available on Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Opera) and a mobile app (available on Android and iOS devices), and users usually praise the wallet for its user-friendliness. MetaMask allows you to stake crypto on both its extension and app.\n\nIn the app, for instance, you have to go to the \u201cExplore\u201d section and search for \u201cMetaMask Portfolio.\u201d Afterward, all you have to do is access the MetaMask dashboard and tap on \u201cStake.\u201d Then, you can select Ethereum and choose a platform.\n\nYou can choose from Lido and Rocket Pool. The rewards differ, too. Lido offers rewards of up to 3.83%, while Rocket Pool has a reward rate of approximately 3.65%.\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nMyEtherWallet is one of the best Ethereum wallets on the market, supporting all ERC-20 and ERC-271 tokens. On MyEtherWallet, users can buy, sell, swap, and exchange crypto seamlessly, thanks to the company\u2019s user-friendly platform. The wallet is free to use, and investors must support network fees.\n\nMyEtherWallet also allows users to stake ETH on the platform, offering 2 types of staking. Users can run a validator node or stake smaller amounts of ETH through pooled or liquid staking.\n\nUsers can check their rewards on the MyEtherWallet platform, available on web and mobile devices. The rewards vary depending on the amount of staked ETH and the lock-up period.\n\n3. Solo Staking\n\nAlso called \u201cnative staking,\u201d solo staking brings you the most significant rewards, but there is a catch: to be a solo staker, you have to get your own validator node, and this requires 32 ETH. Such crypto may be too much for some users, considering that ETH exceeded $2,000.\n\nHowever, solo staking is quite profitable, and the hardware required for this type of staking is not that expensive, especially compared to the hardware you need to mine crypto.\n\nIf you decide to stake ETH alone, you must do all the work. Solo Ethereum validators will have to wait a bit more to earn rewards, as they also have to go through an activation process enforced by the protocol. The process might take a few days, but in some cases, it can also take a couple of weeks.\n\nOverall, solo staking is considered the least risky option, assuming you have complete control over your staked ETH and validator rewards.\n\nStaking as a Service (SaaS)\n\nIf you hold at least 32 ETH and want to earn native block rewards but do not want to get directly involved with the staking process, you can choose SaaS (Staking as a Service). Specific staking platforms can manage the validator on your behalf.\n\nOf course, if you choose to do this through such staking services, you must pay a little commission to the company managing your validator. All in all, staking-as-a-service is an excellent option for those who aim to earn crypto through staking but need more time or the proper hardware to do it themselves.\n\nOf course, once you give your ETH to a SaaS platform, the entire staking process becomes a little less safe. However, just like with any other crypto-related process, we strongly advise you to research the platforms available and choose the safest option.\n\nWith so many crypto platforms, you will find a trustworthy platform to manage the staking process.\n\n4. Pooled Staking\n\nIf you do not have 32 ETH, you can join a staking pool, where users\u2019 ETH coins are combined to get the total required for running a staking node. Pooled staking platforms offer many users the opportunity to join the Ethereum ecosystem without the burden of having to purchase 32 ETH (approximately $70,630).\n\nWhile the Ethereum network does not directly support pooled staking, various platforms allow you to join staking pools in no time. That platform will activate and deactivate validators according to deposits and withdrawals. Furthermore, they must manage and ensure that it supports the pool.\n\n5. Liquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking is similar to pooled staking, but some differences are worth considering. This staking method implies staking your coins into a pool, but the reward part is entirely different.\n\nIn liquid staking, users receive rewards based on their percentage ownership. However, you will not receive tokens; you will receive transferable receipt tokens (also called liquid staking tokens). These tokens will prove ownership and allow you to withdraw your funds.\n\nRemember that many consider liquid staking one of the riskiest methods, as it implies counterparty risks with the transferable receipt. However, once you get the ETH staked to a safe place, everything should be under control.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking brings pros and cons to the table, so in the following chapters, we\u2019ll find out which are which and how to harness this process in your favor.\n\nETH Staking Pros\n\n1. Staking Rewards\n\nBy now, it\u2019s clear that when you stake Ethereum, you are rewarded with the ETH for your contribution and securing the network. The amount depends on how much you staked and for how long.\n\n2. Assist the Network\n\nThe staking process heavily contributes to the Ethereum network security and decentralized principles, as all stakes, with no exception, are responsible for validating the transactions.\n\n3. Maintaining the ETH Ecosystem\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the Ethereum update for PoS, staking is more eco-friendly as it doesn\u2019t require high computational power, as seen in PoW or mining Bitcoin.\n\n4. Being Part of The ETH Governance\n\nAll validators have an essential role within the governance network, and since they are doing the hard work to keep the network secure, they have the power of the decision-making process.\n\nETH Staking Cons\n\nRegarding the downsides of staking Ethereum, the first and foremost is the technical risk, which means a network attack and losing your ETH.\n\nOverall, ETH staking is an excellent way of getting rewarded, yet it is essential to take into consideration all factors, good and bad.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nStaking Ethereum is a great opportunity to earn passive income by locking up the coins you hold for as long as you want. With so many staking options, it may seem hard to choose the best option for your funds.\n\nSolo staking requires more advanced hardware and a minimum of 32 ETH to become a validator. However, with pooled or liquid staking, things get a whole lot easier.\n\nFurthermore, if you hold 32 ETH, you can choose staking-as-a-service, and a staking provider will manage your funds and complete the staking process.\n\nBesides, you can always consider staking through a crypto exchange or wallet, as many such platforms also provide staking services. On exchanges and wallets, things get a lot easier, but there is a possibility that the rewards will decrease once you choose such a staking method.\n\nShare this Post Twitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n* The information in this article and the links provided are for general information purposes only and should not constitute any financial or investment advice.

        "content": "The Solana blockchain has continued to witness impressive numbers in recent months. According to The Block, the high-speed Layer-1 blockchain has set a new record for new and active monthly addresses during December.\n\nA New High\n\nPer the report, the number of active addresses on the network surged to 15.6 million in December. This metric represents a 50% increase compared to November, surpassing January\u2019s 15.2 million active users.\n\nFurthermore, the network has set a new record for the number of new addresses for the month. In December, the number of new addresses created topped 6.8 million, surpassing May\u2019s 6.6 million.\n\nThese metrics suggest a continuous influx of fresh participants entering the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, it signifies the growing popularity of the network among market participants. Solana\u2019s speed and lower transaction cost have made it more attractive to users when compared to its competitors, including Ethereum.\n\nHowever, one vital metric, non-voting transactions, hasn\u2019t yet shattered previous records. These transactions are unique to Solana, as they contribute to network validation and perform typical functions like sending money or executing smart contracts.\n\nTheir lower numbers than November raise questions about whether the current boom is driven by real user activity or other factors.\n\nTop Performer\n\nNevertheless, the Solana ecosystem remains one of the top performers amid the recent market rally. Recently, the high-speed network achieved a significant milestone by flipping Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana surged to $10.1 billion over the past week compared to Ethereum\u2019s $8.8 billion.\n\nSolana\u2019s impressive performance coincides with the surge in its native token, SOL. The token has risen by 61% in the past week and more than 90% since the beginning of this month. At press time, SOL was trading at $113.\n\nRecently, Coinfomania reported that SOL flipped BNB to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. SOL\u2019s market cap currently stands at $48.1 billion compared to BNB\u2019s $40.8 billion."
