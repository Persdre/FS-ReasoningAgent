        "title": "Optimism execs are optimistic for Ethereum\u2019s future amid its ongoing scaling battle - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As the layer-1 blockchain Ethereum continues to grow and evolve, layer-2 blockchains like Optimism are working to alleviate issues of scaling, speed and costs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the same thing since 2017,\u201d Jing Wang, Optimism\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been trying to solve the same problem for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe mission to scale Ethereum is ongoing, said Ryan Wyatt, chief growth officer at Optimism. Before joining Optimism, Wyatt was the president of Polygon Labs, the entity building the layer-2 blockchain Polygon.\n\nAs it stands, using and transacting with Ethereum is still relatively clunky, slow and more expensive. That\u2019s why layer-2 (L2) blockchains like Optimism exist: to focus on scaling and speed, while also lowering costs for users. It helps users interact with Ethereum\u2019s chain for about 10x cheaper through its own network and also provides developers the ability to build decentralized applications (dApps) in a faster, scalable way.\n\n\u201cJust as Amazon is a serverless back end for web2 applications, Optimism is a decentralized serverless back end for web3 applications,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe wanted to scale Ethereum because I think Ethereum stays the most close to the original decentralization values and we wanted to give it a go staying close to those same values.\u201d\n\nBut with scaling also comes the importance of growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of facets to it, and I think one missing piece is how we continue to work with developers across the ecosystem,\u201d even if they\u2019re not a part of the Optimism family, Wyatt said.\n\nUsually when you think of scaling, you think of hiring big teams. But although Optimism wants to grow bigger, the ecosystem has to self-govern, and the best way to do that is to have developers across the space contribute.\n\nOptimism wants developers to build dApps using its technology, therefore pushing users to the network. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of similarities to blockchain infrastructure in the developer ecosystem,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cFor me, it seems incredibly similar.\u201d\n\nFor some, blockchains are like religious ecosystems, where there\u2019s only one way or the highway. \u201cIt\u2019s one chain versus the second chain,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOptimism\u2019s Superchain vision is trying to get us closer to a world where the chains are closer to containers for compute \u2026 and all these chains interoperate together in what we call the Superchain.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to help users forget which chain developers are building on, because it ultimately won\u2019t matter. \u201cIdeally in the future, there\u2019s applications that are so massive that they\u2019re probably running 100 concurrent chains. But for now, the amount of demand within the industry doesn\u2019t necessitate that, so we have something that looks closer to one application per chain.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to success stories, it \u201cshould really be about the developers that are building on top of this infrastructure,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cSo the day that we get away from talking about L2s, I think is going to be a big day because now the story will be about the great apps and experiences that are being built on top of the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Safeguarding Your Bitcoin & Ethereum: Exploring Multi-Sig Wallets for Enhanced Security - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Storing crypto on an exchange or a hardware wallet is risky. Instead, you should use a multi-sig setup.\n\n\n\nI used to store mycrypto in hardware wallets like Ledger, but for large amounts, it is still risky. If somebody steals your ledger or its seed phrase, you are doomed. If a fire or earthquake destroys them, you are doomed. I used to keep two copies of seed phrases in different locations for this latter risk. But that poses another risk - what if somebody steals from my second location when I am not present, and I do not know until it\u2019s too late?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is to use a multi-signature wallet, which is a setup in which a threshold of devices must be confirmed to execute a transaction. I put this off for way too long but finally got around to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Multisig\n\nFor Bitcoin, there are two main providers I\u2019d suggest - Casa or Unchained Capital . Both are self-custody, meaning you are the holders of the keys. No FTX-like risk here. Both have also raised much in venture capital and have great customer experiences. I actually spoke to Unchained Capital four years ago when they were just getting started and raising their first round of seed capital. Now, they have raised $100M+.\n\nCasa vs Unchained\n\nCasa costs $250 a year (they also offer more expensive services, which I won\u2019t go into here), while Unchained Capital offers a free tier of service. However, the latter requires KYC while the former does not.\n\nHow It Works\n\nFor Casa, there is an app. You control two of the keys; Casa controls the third. You need 2 of 3 keys to send funds out. Your mobile serves as one key, and a hardware device like a ledger as the other. For the key that Casa controls, you answer security questions that you\u2019d re-enter if you want Casa to sign for you in the future. You would use this if one of your two keys was compromised. Casa would sign after a seven-day buffer. It is highly recommended you write down your answer to the security questions and put it somewhere safe.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also have the option to use two hardware devices instead of the mobile.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnchained Capital is mostly similar, but they only offer the two hardware wallet solutions, no mobile. Also, while they are free, they charge a $20 co-signature fee if you need to rely on their third key. Since they KYC, they don\u2019t require security questions; hence you don\u2019t need to worry about writing it down and storing it safely somewhere; instead, they can verify via a method like video call when you need them to sign. They have a 72-hour buffer period before signing.\n\nWhile KYC has this convenience, a downside is that if Unchained\u2019s data gets compromised, your identity and crypto holdings will be revealed. To be clear, your crypto would still be safe in such a scenario because you control two of the keys. Alternatively, the downside of Casa with no KYC is that you are responsible for storing the answers to your security questions safely.\n\nFinally, for a higher fee, you can do more complex options like 5 keys and white glove service with either Casa or Unchained.\n\nOne mobile & one hardware wallet or two hardware wallets?\n\nOne Mobile & One Hardware Wallet:\n\nWith mobile, it\u2019s almost always on you, so if somebody steals your hardware wallet, you\u2019ll still have your phone with you, which some may argue adds a degree of safety.\n\nIf you choose to keep one of the hardware wallets in your residence, you can conveniently transact anytime using it and your mobile device. Alternatively, if you choose to keep your hardware wallet separate from your primary residence, you\u2019d need to go there to transact, which is less convenient but arguably even safer.\n\nFinally, if a natural disaster destroys your hardware wallet and phone, you can get back your mobile key from a cloud backup (more later), and use this with Casa\u2019s key to recover your balance.\n\n\n\nTwo Hardware Wallets:\n\nWhile mobile can be convenient, the two-hardware wallet solution is a great option, too, and even more secure for those who don\u2019t expect to transact much if kept in different locations.\n\nIf kept in different locations, you\u2019ll need to bring your first hardware wallet to your second location whenever you need to transact.\n\nSee here by Unchained for different setup ideas for two hardware wallets. The maximum security setup would involve four locations that each have one of your two hardware wallets and two seed phrases. Very secure, but at the cost of inconvenience. A middle ground solution is keeping each pair of hardware wallet + seed phrase in two locations.\n\nIs mobile safe?\n\nYes. The mobile private key is literally on your device in a secure enclave that can\u2019t be accessed by anyone, not even your mobile device manufacturer. This means that even if somebody stole your Casa login credentials and logged in on their phone, they still can\u2019t sign because they need your exact mobile device.\n\nWhat if I change or lose phones?\n\nIt is backed up to iCloud for iPhone and Google Drive for Android and can be re-established on a new phone.\n\nRisk Scenarios:\n\nSomebody steals your two keys: If a thief somehow manages to steal two of your keys (whether it\u2019s two hardware or one mobile and one hardware) and get through the security needed to use those devices, they\u2019d still need to know your login to your multisig provider (Casa or Unchained). This is because signing a transaction requires two private keys, but also the three public keys (note: public key is different from your address; your address is derived from your public key through hashing). The three public keys are accessed automatically through your multisig provider when you log in to transact. Multisig provider goes down: You can send funds out using open-source software like Electrum or Spectrum. This process is called Sovereign Recovery. For Casa, you\u2019d basically export your mobile private key and seed phrase and re-establish your wallet on Electrum or Spectrum using your hardware device, mobile, and the Casa public key. For Unchained, you\u2019d do the same using your two hardware wallets. Both Casa and Unchained provide detailed instructions on their website if this is ever needed.\n\nEthereum Multisig\n\nFor Ethereum, Casa offers an ETH vault that basically uses Safe (rebranded from Gnosis Safe) under the hood and comes for free if you use their BTC vault. However, it does not allow altcoins beyond USDC and Tether yet. Unchained is Bitcoin only by philosophy (something that Bitcoin maxis appreciate) so it does not offer ETH multisig.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use Safe directly, as it\u2019s free to use, and you can hold any altcoin. It is the dominant DIY open-source multisig solution on Ethereum used by all decentralized orgs. They recently raised $100M on a $1B valuation. I got to be familiar with using it, as my most recent startup nestwallet.xyz was built on the Safe protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference to note between using Casa and Safe directly is that with Safe, you are responsible for safeguarding all your signer devices and their seed phrases, whereas with Casa, you can rely on them to hold one key (Casa key), while the mobile key will be held on your phone and accessed through their app without requiring you to write down a seed phrase (this mobile private key and seed phrase can be exported out, but you\u2019d only do so for Sovereign Recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Safe, you can set it up however you want, like 2/3 signers, 3/5, 2/2, etc. Safe also has a mobile app that can serve as a key, but as I mentioned above, you\u2019ll have to write down the seed phrase for it in a secure location if you choose to use it. The other signers can be hardware wallets, hot wallets (like Metamask), or a combination. The most important thing is to keep the seed phrases in separate geographic locations.\n\nLet me know what you think\n\nHopefully, this was helpful as you think about safeguarding your own crypto. It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve thought a lot about, and it is important to have a solution that is immune to all the major risks - theft of a single device, natural disaster, or an exchange going down (a la FTX or the multitude of others).\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this as a starting point, but I recommend doing your own research and choosing the setup that best fits your needs. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions, and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.\n\nAlso published here."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is best known for creating the world\u2019s second-most-valuable blockchain, Ethereum, when he was just 19 years old. In the past few years, though, Buterin\u2019s influence has expanded well beyond the world of crypto and into the broader realm of ideas where the young polymath\u2014who taught himself Mandarin while traveling the world\u2014offers important treatises on technology and the future.\n\nThe latest example is a 10,000-word essay Buterin published this week titled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d It\u2019s a response to the much-discussed \u201cmanifesto\u201d with a similar title by the influential venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Buterin\u2019s piece endorses many elements of the manifesto, including an affirmation that technology has delivered marvelous benefits to humanity, and that fear and overzealous regulation have limited progress in fields like biotech. But while he endorses a foot-on-the-gas approach, especially to solve the climate change crisis, Buterin also calls for a more cautious approach when it comes to AI.\n\nWhile the Ethereum creator has long been a leading thinker in computer science, he has also become one in the governance of technology and society. Here is Buterin on the crack-up at OpenAI and the problem of putting guardrails on technology by means of small councils of elite decision-makers:\n\n\u201c[It was] a well-intentioned effort to balance the need to make a profit to satisfy investors who provide the initial capital with the desire to have a check-and-balance to push against moves that risk OpenAI blowing up the world. In practice, however, their recent attempt to fire Sam Altman makes the structure seem like an abject failure: It centralized power in an undemocratic and unaccountable board of five people, who made key decisions based on secret information and refused to give any details on their reasoning until employees threatened to quit en masse.\u201d\n\nDrawing on his experience in trying to build decentralized communities in the Ethereum realm, Buterin provides new and important insights into how to think about AI\u2014including how to avoid the very real possibility that humans end up as pets to machine overlords. He is, of course, hardly the only one with big ideas about the future of technology. But what makes Buterin stand apart is his deep capacity for empathy and lack of ego.\n\nUnlike Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan\u2014another tech genius whose ideas carry a lot of weight in the debate over technology\u2014Buterin doesn\u2019t have contempt for those who disagree with him, and he doesn\u2019t frame the debate in the shrill us-versus-them tone of the venture capital elite.\n\n\u201cI believe that these [technologies] are deeply good, and that expanding humanity\u2019s reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d he writes. In a troubled moment where too many people are consumed with fear and negativity, it is welcome to read a tech genius who relies on empathetic persuasion. If you want a shorter and more approachable window into Buterin\u2019s worldview, you can also check out this new Fortune Q&A, which includes the moral case for supporting Ukraine and the fascinating sci-fi realm of the popular book and film The Three Body Problem.

        "title": "Blast from the past: 3 years on from the launch of ETH staking - Blockworks",
        "content": "Yeeting ETH into the void is nothing new for Ethereans.\n\nBy the time the Beacon Chain officially launched on Dec. 1, 2020, the staking contract \u2014 referred to as \u201cETH 2.0\u201d back then \u2014 had already seen around 880,000 ETH in deposits.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that multisig-with-a-plan project Blast now sports $650 million in staked ether and stablecoins under its control.\n\nBlast\u2019s explicit promise is that deposited tokens will earn an on-chain yield, plus rewards of unknown value. Ether staking yield comes via Lido\u2019s stETH tokens, while stablecoins are converted to dai deposited in Maker, or savings dai (sDAI).\n\nOn Thursday it emerged that the Blast deposit interface set its slippage tolerance to an inordinately high 10%, resulting in one user losing about $100,000 in value. The Blast team says they\u2019ve fixed it.\n\nBut, sandwich attack surprises aside, most depositors at least know that all assets will be locked until the proposed optimistic rollup launches in February.\n\nDepositors to the Beacon Chain, too, knew that their ether would be locked up for at least a couple of years \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t clear when exactly The Merge and subsequent enabling of staking withdrawals would happen when many aped in.\n\nUltimately it took until April 2023, by which time about 18 million ETH (about $33 billion at the time) were deposited.\n\nIn the interim, there was a rapid growth in liquid staking, with Lido becoming the dominant player in early 2022, and already nearing a third of all staked ether by May 2022. It has remained between 29% and 33% ever since, keeping the project at the center of a debate about centralizing market forces on Ethereum.\n\nThe total percentage staked through Lido currently stands at 32.28%, and Blast \u2014 which uses Lido exclusively \u2014 isn\u2019t helping.\n\nHow much of a problem that is, depends on who you ask.\n\nSome will analogize the concentration of ether stake to the preponderance of the Go Ethereum (Geth) execution client for Ethereum node operators. A great deal of social coordination was needed to bring down the market share of Prysm on the consensus layer, which reduces risks to the network as a whole. Geth is currently at 84%.\n\nClient diversity is widely seen as one of Ethereum\u2019s strengths, a hallmark of its resilience through decentralization, which is unmatched in crypto. Indeed, decentralization and resilience are often seen as synonymous.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThat\u2019s why some are concerned about the Blast-fueled tick up in Lido\u2019s stake share.\n\nBut for others, it\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Blur and Blast investor Izebel.eth stated the \u201c3 line pitch\u201d for Blast is that \u201c[Ethereum] would be better if everyone used stETH\u2026so we use the bridge as a forcing function.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nOf course, the \u201cbridge\u201d is not really a bridge, while it can only be crossed one way. And forcing people into a harmful position isn\u2019t doing them any favors.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIt\u2019s generally good advice to be wary of promises from backers that something can \u201creshape the fabric of society.\u201d That\u2019s not just \u201cambitious\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hubris.\n\nNone of the more academic discussions ultimately matter, though, when you have gamification as your selling point. And, maybe there are bigger fish to fry.\n\nIn any case, Lido has more TVL \u2014 approaching $20 billion \u2014 than any other DeFi protocol by a country mile. And Blast is bigger than Base \u2014 in third place behind Arbitrum and Optimism according to L2Beat \u2014 while now hiring software engineers, much to the amusement of crypto Twitter.\n\nPlenty of folks in this industry idolize the free market; so if that\u2019s your modus operandi, then the market has spoken, for now.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

According to Pal, the use of Solana comes with a whole different feel that makes it a top contender as a relatively more user-friendly option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said once someone starts using Solana, it \"feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to pull off a major comeback in its price action post-FTX implosion.\n\nOnce you play around in the $SOL ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\n\n\n\nThe best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android.\n\n\n\nBoth win. Huge. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 29, 2023\n\nRaoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.\n\nSolana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems\n\nAlmost everything Ethereum can do, Solana can do as well. It appears that Raoul Pal has broad use of some of Solana's applications, as he attested to the ingenious designs of Phantom Wallet, the most popular unhosted Solana wallet. This he confirmed when an X user asked to know what his feedback is for Phantom Wallet and in his response, he said:\n\nAbsolutely love it. Super easy.\n\nSolana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal confirming he has been bullish all year. The coin soared to its 2023 high earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH top-down analysis hints upside is capped at $2,500 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price trades in a clear consolidative trend on the weekly time frame between $1,933 and $2,141 barriers.\n\nThe daily chart for ETH shows a sweep of Monday\u2019s high is likely to be followed by a sweep of Monday\u2019s low at $1,985.\n\nIf Bitcoin price undergoes a steep double-digit correction, Ether could also slide to $1,933 and $1,829 support levels.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows an ongoing consolidation with no directional bias. But a closer look at the daily chart shows that a potential correction might ensue, especially if Ether is influenced by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum price prediction thesis and short-term bias\n\nAccording to Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analysts, Bitcoin spot ETF is likely to be approved in January 2024. This development has caused FOMO among market participants, making the overall market outlook resoundingly bullish. Interestingly, this is one of the main drivers of the 2023 bull rally.\n\nRead more: Week Ahead: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nBut as the holiday season begins to kick in, liquidity in the market will diminish. Hence, cryptocurrency prices are likely to face manipulation. Additionally, Bitcoin price has already started to slow down its rally and has flashed multiple sell signals.\n\nIf Bitcoin price faces a minor correction, altcoins will shed double digits easily due to the nature of the connection between the two. Likewise, the Ethereum price will also see a correction to key support levels.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: ETF delay and weekly swing failure could crash BTC to $30,000\n\nThis top-down Ethereum price analysis takes a look at ETH from weekly and daily time frames and forecasts buy-the-dip levels.\n\nEthereum price at critical levels on the weekly chart\n\nEthereum price has been in a multi-month consolidative trend that has produced an ascending triangle setup. While the technical formation is inherently bullish, it is only after a successful breakout. So far, ETH has not produced any discernible breakouts, just failed attempts.\n\nThe ascending triangle setup contains equal highs and higher lows, connected via trend lines. This setup shows that investors are becoming increasingly bullish and buying dips at an increasing rate.\n\nA breakout above the $2,000 psychological level was the first sign of a bullish move, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth around this level. To be precise, ETH is hovering between the second quarter high at $2,141 and weekly support at $1,933. This has been happening for the fourth consecutive week.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s trend weakening and signaling a potential double-digit correction, Ethereum price might also catalyze a downside move to flush early longs. In such a case, ETH might eye a retest of the monthly open at $1,814 and a sweep of the monthly low at $1,782. This move would constitute a 9% to 12% move.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nETH bulls likely to take a backseat soon\n\nThe daily chart for Ethereum price shows more nuanced key levels, some of which coincide with the ones seen on the weekly.\n\nFor starters, this week\u2019s Monday range extends from $2,071 to $1,985. While the Monday high was swept on November 28, investors can expect a sweep of the Monday low in the coming days.\n\nA quick move to the downside with the intention of sweeping Monday\u2019s range could lead to a steep correction, especially if it is backed by BTC bears. In that case, investors need to take a look at the 40% Ethereum price rally witnessed between October 12 and November 10. This upswing created a local top at $2,138, and the midpoint of this move rests at $1,829, which coincides closely with the monthly open at $1,814 and monthly close of $1,782.\n\nAll in all, the $1,750 to $1,850 range seems like a good place to buy the dip if it ever comes to that.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the short-term bearish or correction outlook is logical, it is completely contingent on Bitcoin\u2019s sell signals. If BTC lures shorts via a minor correction and proceeds to blast through $40,000, it would obliterate short sellers and cause a massive liquidation event that could sustain a move beyond $40,000.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could overcome the $2,232 hurdle and eye a retest of the weekly resistance level at $2,521."

        "title": "The Fabricant\u2019s Fifth Anniversary: Ethereum, Revamped Collection, AI and More - WWD",
        "content": "For its fifth anniversary, The Fabricant makes no bones about its visions of grandeur. In addition to celebrating the occasion with a revamped Deep collection, with artificial intelligence reimagining one of its earliest offerings, it is expanding the digital fashion platform with new integrations.\n\nThese moves matter, executives told WWD in an exclusive interview, because they represent the company\u2019s next step in its evolution \u2014 and its ambitions to advance virtual fashion as a whole. The plan, they said, was to finally turn digital fashion into a mainstream movement.\n\nThe work has already begun. It starts with opening up availability for virtual fashion. For Kerry Murphy, cofounder and chief executive officer, and chief technology officer Marco Marchesi, that translates to expanding The Fabricant\u2019s platform to Ethereum, one of the crypto world\u2019s top decentralized blockchain networks, as a way to become a multichain platform. Meanwhile, it is also integrating with Crossmint, which builds tools that make it easier for businesses to build NFTs at scale.\n\nMetaverse skeptics could criticize moves like this, given the tech\u2019s downturn as a cultural phenomenon. But blockchain evangelists beg to differ, and corporate America as well as global brands seem to agree. Not only have fashion brands continued to invest in virtual technology and metaverse initiatives, but Crossmint \u2014 a popular NFT partner for some of the world\u2019s most recognizable companies \u2014 recently inked another notable deal with Coinbase.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nThe original \u201cCopyCopyCopy\u201d look from the 2018 collection. Courtesy image\n\nIn an August social media share, the company announced that \u201cthe world\u2019s coming on-chain. @coinbase is integrating @crossmint to help Coca-Cola, Atari, and other major companies onboard the world to Web3.\u201d That follows the June launch of its NFT \u201cwallet-as-a-service\u201d to help companies put simplified, interoperable blockchain technologies into their existing products. The same month, rapper Snoop Dogg released a \u201cdynamic\u201d NFT collection, which evolves alongside his tour. He used Crossmint, which can work with fiat currency, as the NFT payment processor.\n\n\u201cCrossmint is the perfect partner to really remove the friction between payments and experience that you get with NFTs,\u201d said Marchesi. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the company itself, \u2018Crossmint,\u2019 so they really don\u2019t care anymore what currency you\u2019re using at other servers. And that\u2019s what we need for our community, for our users.\u201d\n\nWith the Ethereum play, The Fabricant\u2019s digital fashions \u2014 its own or those of its brand partners \u2014 are poised to become more available to a greater number of consumers.\n\nLinking to Ethereum is something of a homecoming for the company. \u201cWe sold the world\u2019s first digital fashion couture NFT on Ethereum, back in 2019,\u201d explained Murphy, referring to a high-profile collaboration between The Fabricant and artist Johanna Jaskowska, CryptoKitties and Dapper Labs that resulted in a digital blockchain dress called \u201cIridescence.\u201d The NFT was hailed as the world\u2019s first virtual-only haute couture dress and sold for close to $10,000.\n\nThe project was more about making a statement about digital fashion, said the CEO, and at the time, it prompted the press to wonder why anybody would pay such a high price for clothing that didn\u2019t actually exist. But soon enough, COVID-19 changed the equation, with people living more of their lives online amid widespread lockdowns. \u201cWe became one of the most relevant companies in the fashion industry, and we had all the physical fashion brands calling us up asking, \u2018What is this digital fashion about?\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAs he reflected on his company\u2019s five-year journey, it\u2019s clear that it was quite a whirlwind studded with major figures in gaming, from establishment giant Atari to Web3 hit Star Atlas, and notable names in fashion spanning Rtfkt, the digital sneaker start-up-turned-Nike business, to Virgil Abloh. The Fabricant has been at the heart of millions of dollars in NFT transactions and other investments and not just for partners. In 2021, it scored $14 million in series A funding, which was perhaps fortunate timing. The following year saw a cryptomarket crash that took the shine off of cryptocurrencies and, to some degree, NFTs.\n\nMurphy was quick to note that The Fabricant is not a crypto company, but it does work with the same underlying blockchain technology, so it felt the ripples. \u201c[We] had to really detach ourselves from the narrative of crypto NFT and metaverse, and really focus on digital fashion,\u201d he said, describing it as a highly successful shift.\n\nNow the company is ready to move forward and, once again, timing may be on its side, given recent advancements in artificial intelligence, brands\u2019 growing digital sophistication and greater consumer understanding of virtual experiences. Case in point: The revamped version of Amber Jae Slooten\u2019s Deep collection, as reimagined using generative AI. The original was never available \u201con chain\u201d before, but the collection totaling seven items will drop on Dec. 14 as part of The Fabricant\u2019s Ethereum expansion.\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d from the 2018 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d as reimagined by AI in the 2023 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\nAs for the future, Marchesi pointed to new experiences in development, such as augmented reality dressing. It remains a holy grail in digital fashion, and The Fabricant partnered with Snap Inc. to enable it and, by doing so, it joined myriad players from Google to DressX pursuing the same thing. The key is to not let the technology or complexity get in the way. The CTO sees it as \u201cpart of our vision, [which] is about, everyone should be able to wear digital fashion in any context with any device.\u201d The Fabricant quietly launched AR try-on as a beta feature of its platform, as it has been a work in progress, but it\u2019s ready to call more attention to it now.\n\nAnother area of interest is using virtual fashion and realistic AI models for photo shoots. The company wouldn\u2019t disclose details on that on the record, but it is actively exploring this.\n\nThere\u2019s more happening on the fashion front, including some sort of upcoming collaboration with a notable luxury brand, though neither Murphy nor Marchesi could offer details at press time. But coming on the heels of this slew of updates, exploratory projects and efforts in development, it\u2019s unlikely to be a rank-and-file debut.\n\nWhether any of it succeeds in drawing mainstream interest remains to be seen. But one thing seems quite clear \u2014 The Fabricant\u2019s swirl of activity in the last five years might be nothing compared to what the next five brings."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Ready For New ATH In 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH) price stayed relatively unchanged on Thursday despite the trading volume dropping by 20% to $8.5 billion. Intriguingly, the altcoin\u2019s market cap is holding up above $245 billion, according to market data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis has been a week of consolidation with Ethereum price sitting above the $2,000 level. Recovery has become an uphill battle leaving Ether to wobble between support at $2,020 and a short-term resistance at $2,070.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Far Is Ethereum From Breakout?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator upholds the mundane sideways trading Ethereum has displayed since Monday. Its downside is protected by the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) at $2,020 and the ascending trendline.\n\nEthereum price tends to react bullishly every time it has retraced to touch the trendline. Therefore, in case of dips towards the $2,000 mark, bulls could seize the opportunity to buy into ETH while speculating on the next breakout first to $2,200, and later to the subsequent levels at $2,500 and $3,000.\n\nTraders should exercise caution and restraint as long as Ethereum is trading below the short-term resistance at $2,040, as highlighted by the 50 EMA (red). The action above this level and the next resistance between $2,058 and $2,070 would serve as a breakout signal, paving the way for a bigger move to $2,200.\n\nThe momentum indicator will confirm the uptrend\u2019s continuation with the blue MACD line flipping above the red signal line.\n\nA triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart could nurture a bigger breakout towards $3,000 if validated. Bulls must focus on breaking above resistance at $2,120 to activate the triangle breakout. Most traders would consider going long on Ethereum slightly above the triangle.\n\nRecommended for you: Dogecoin Price Could Blast Through $0.12 Resistance If This Technical Pattern Plays Out\n\nA glimpse of the daily chart assures traders of support at $2,015 but based on the current technical, as depicted by the sell signal from the MACD, ETH might drop again before making another significant recovery attempt.\n\nHowever, backing the bullish outlook in ETH is the position of all three moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. If the MAs uphold the ongoing uptrend, the path with the least resistance is likely to stick to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Shoots To $26 Billion\n\nThe dollar value of all ETH locked in staking protocols and other decentralized finance (DeFi) networks is increasing rapidly. According to data by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $26 billion from approximately $19.4 billion in mid-October.\n\nThe growth in TVL underscores the long-term bullish outlook investors have for Ethereum price. They are willing to lock up their Ether for longer periods, expecting that the uptrend will continue into 2023. A high TVL value significantly reduces the selling pressure.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "U.Today - market dynamics are often a tale of whose trades can signal shifts in market sentiment. Recently, a whale transaction caught the eye of many, as 3,150 ETH, valued at approximately $6.37 million, were sold at an average price of around $2,023, netting a substantial profit from an earlier purchase of 2,762 ETH at $1,825 each. This move has prompted discussion among traders: is it time to take profits on Ethereum?\n\nThe chart reveals a critical juncture in price action. After a period of bullish momentum, is now testing local resistance levels, creating a moment of decision for investors. The current resistance, formed near the $2,050 mark, is a crucial threshold that has previously prompted sell-offs, suggesting that traders are eyeing this level to secure gains.\n\nConversely, the support levels paint a picture of potential bounce-back zones. The first significant support is visible near the $1,950 level, aligning with the 50-day moving average. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic support, propelling prices upward upon contact. A break below this, however, could see Ethereum's price target the next support at approximately $1,850, where previous demand coalesced to halt bearish runs.\n\nThe probability of a price reversal hinges on the to these critical technical levels. A convincing break above the current resistance could invalidate the bearish thesis, potentially leading to a continuation of the upward trend. However, recent whale activity suggests that some large holders are starting to realize profits, potentially adding to the selling pressure at this price threshold.\n\nVolume trends also provide insight, with a notable decrease in trading volume suggesting that the current price level may be unsustainable in the short term. Combined with the whale's cashout, it could signal a broader sentiment shift among investors, leading to increased volatility and a possible price correction.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

Hoskinson has been embroiled in a debate with the XRP community over alleged rumors of ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin bribing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give Ethereum a \u201cfree pass\u201d and go after Ripple. Here free pass meant Ethereum was allowed to conduct business as usual while Ripple was hit by a lawsuit.\n\nIt is important to note that Hoskinson currently finds himself in a similar situation to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, in 2020. The US SEC slammed Ripple with a lawsuit, alleging the unregistered sale of securities, here securities meaning XRP. The SEC has listed Cardano as an investment contract in its lawsuit against Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange. It is therefore clear that the regulator considered Cardano an investment contract.\n\nHoskinson commented on the rumors stating that the XRP community needs to present evidence to back its claims, or else he finds it a \u201cgrand conspiracy.\u201d\n\nFor the argument that Joe bribed the SEC to go after XRP that is the conclusion. That is the entire point of calling it a grand conspiracy. The free pass has nothing to do with the case against Ripple. They are unrelated events.

        "title": "Top 10 ERC Token Standards You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Learning about the top 10 ERC token standards can help you succeed. The Ethereum ecosystem is the largest and most popular blockchain community in the world. Ethereum has always been a strong contender in the market due to its pioneering efforts and proprietary technology.\n\nWhen you review the rise of this mighty crypto community, you can't help but realize the prominent role that token standards have had on its journey. Token standards can be seen as one of the most influential developments in the industry.\n\nPrior to token standards, you had multiple developers working on projects that may or may not be able to communicate and interact with other protocols. The introduction of standards to the crypto market, as any, helped to drive innovation and has led to a constant expansion of the most popular networks. Here are the top 10 ERC-20 token standards in use today.\n\nERC\n\nERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is a set of guidelines to ensure interoperability between new and old dApps and platforms. The original goal of the project was to streamline the creation of digital assets in-house. However, it quickly became popular for regular users and startups to expedite token creation.\n\nThe ERC token standardization movement has seen considerable growth alongside the rising number of formats available. Each of these token standards serves a unique purpose that makes it ideal for its tasks. From compliance to scalability, there's a token standard to meet your needs.\n\n1. ERC-20\n\nThe first token standard to hit the market was the ERC-20 standard. This standard emerged in the middle of 2017 after Vitalik Buterin and the rest of the Ethereum team realized that people wanted a simplistic way to launch tokens. The results of making the ERC-20 token available to everyone were immediate.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard has helped thousands of startups and developers create tokens and platforms that seamlessly merge with the Ethereum community. Notably, the standard is still widely used today, even though the competition has increased and new standards offer more specialized functions.\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard is a capable solution enabling developers to create fungible and non-fungible assets. This standard is capable of tokenizing real-world assets as well. This flexibility and its role as the first and most popular standard has made ERC-20 the top option in the market today for many. It's mostly found in stablecoins, governance tokens, and project launches such as ICOs.\n\n2. ERC-721\n\nThe ERC-721 token format was created to serve the growing NFT community. NFTs are digital assets that can represent individual assets. As such, they are best used for gaming, collectibles, and tokenization. The ERC-721 standard was made famous by the collectible game CryptoKitties.\n\nERC-721 was first proposed by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs in January 2018. The standard differs from its predecessor in some key ways. For one, it leverages an API for tokens built directly into smart contracts. This structure adds more functionality, such as the ability to approve third-party transfers. All of these factors make ERC-721 a smart option for game and collectible developers.\n\n3. ERC-1155\n\nThe continued expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem led to the eventual creation of the ERC-115 protocol. This token standard was first introduced by Enjin CEO Witek Radomski. The goal of this standard was to make a more inclusive option for developers. As such, it combines many of the features of the previous two standards.\n\nThis token standard leverages a robust interface that enables developers to fulfill deployment requirements and correct any issues that arise from one location. ERC-1155 can represent all types of digital assets, including non, semi, and fully fungible assets. Today, the token serves a crucial role as a go-to option for NFT game developers. It's also used in ICOs, digital ID systems, and gaming applications.\n\nERC-115 provides added functionality without reducing security. Developers have found that this standard is a bit more programmable than its predecessors and can scale more efficiently. Consequently, many developers have turned to ERC-1155 to solve their issues and launch their platforms.\n\n4. ERC-777\n\nThe ERC-777 protocol improves token management services for developers. The system allows creators to add more specifications on how and to whom their tokens can be transferred. This added logic makes it better suited to certain applications, such as dealing with regulated tokens and fixed assets.\n\nThe ERC-777 protocol has many benefits that make it stand out against the other options. For one, it supports unique options such as automatic swaps and send-and-receive hooks. Additionally, all ERC-777 tokens are backward compatible with ERC-20 token standards, adding to their interoperability and ease of use.\n\n5. ERC-1400\n\nThe rise of security tokens led to the creation of the ERC-14000 tokens standard. This standard emerged as a viable way to help solve some of the regulatory issues that ICOs had encountered the years prior. Security tokens are unique in that they have all regulatory compliance tasks built directly into their core coding.\n\nThis structure means that these tokens can be used to tokenize regulated assets such as real estate. The system enables developers to meet all regulatory criteria without exception. Additionally, since all the security token requirements are baked into the token itself, the asset remains compliant throughout its life cycle.\n\nERC-1400 is a popular token standard that is in use across a variety of industries. Today, you can find developments in tokenizing equity, property, debt, and much more using this standard. This standard has also found a home in the art sector where its features can help to demonstrate ownership and validate projects.\n\n6. ERC-4337\n\nOne of the safest ways to use crypto is via a multi-sig wallet. These wallets require multiple people to sign off to transfer. The same concept now goes for tokens. The ERC-4337 standard supports multi-signature wallets on Ethereum. This structure makes it easier to solve complex ownership issues and create more innovative structures around assets.\n\nERC-4337 tokens are a great way to ensure that all parties approve of the token's actions. Additionally, these tokens have found some use in governance mechanisms. Here they can ensure that only after the signers approve changes do the upgrades occur. ERC-4337 offers security, scalability, and transparency to the market.\n\n7. ERC-512\n\nNFT technology is often seen as the best option for representing digital assets. However, many people overlook its use as an identifying token. Decentralized identity management systems are on the rise, and for good reasons. They lower costs, increase efficiency, and provide high security.\n\nThanks to this token standard, implementing these digital ID systems is now easier than ever. This standard was built from the ground up to handle verification tasks such as verifying claims and credentials. Additionally, the standard is the first to support ID management systems. These systems help to protect your ID and the systems they operate within.\n\n8. ERC-6551\n\nThe ERC-6551 tokens standard was created to help reduce gas prices for transaction-intensive Dapps. The Ethereum gas price concerns have been an issue for years. The network has implemented many updates to lower these fees, but many still desire a token standard that makes this process easy.\n\nThe ERC-6551 tokens standard helps resource-intensive dApps and blockchain networks remain responsive. To accomplish this task, the protocol enables the batch processing of transactions. This feature lowers the gas prices significantly for these dApps. It also reduces network congestion.\n\n9. ERC-4626\n\nThe ERC-4626 tokens standard is the evolution of the space. This next-generation standard improves the communication between network nodes and smart contracts significantly. These tokens are designed to reduce complexity by integrating self-describing smart contracts.\n\nThese smart contracts make it easier to build complex dApps from scratch. They enable creators to offer more features and track their assets with more clarity. Additionally, their versatile nature makes them a smart option for many of the tasks that traditional ERC-20 tokens would handle.\n\n10. ERC-998\n\nThe latest trend in the NFT race is composable tokens. These are NFTs that can be created on top of each other. They are often used in gaming scenarios where users can customize their avatars or other items. This feature enables developers to create and manage complex token structures across vast networks.\n\nCurrently, the ERC-998 tokens standard is used to create collectible and gaming tokens that can be upgraded via other token add-ons. They are often used in DAOs to improve transparency. Lastly, the standard provides a reliable and effective way to tokenize real-world assets quickly.\n\nTop 10 erc-20 token standards \u2013 Just the tip of the Iceberg\n\nIt's exciting to see how the Ethereum community has continued to keep up with the changing market by expanding these token standards. Today, developers have more tools and options to consider when creating. Understanding the different token types and their purpose can help you create better dApps that cost you and the user less. As such, the Ethereum token standard movement can be seen as a pioneering force in the market that will remain a strong contender for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou can learn more about exciting blockchain projects here."

        "title": "Aragon Expands DAO Ecosystem with Deployment on Arbitrum - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "Aragon, a pioneer in DAO technology, has deployed its modular Aragon OSx DAO framework and no-code Aragon App on Arbitrum, Ethereum\u2019s leading Layer 2 (L2) solution. This integration unlocks new possibilities for DAOs by providing them access to a thriving ecosystem of protocols, applications, and assets.\n\nArbitrum, known for its rollup technology, has established itself as the industry\u2019s most popular L2 solution with over $7 billion total value locked and 55% of the L2 market share. By choosing to launch on Arbitrum, DAOs stand to benefit from several advantages that can potentially revolutionize their operations.\n\nReduced Gas Costs and Increased Voter Turnout\n\nOne of the most immediate benefits of operating on Arbitrum is the substantial reduction in gas costs. Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have long been a concern for DAOs, as they can significantly erode resources. By transitioning to Arbitrum, DAOs can conserve valuable resources while simultaneously incentivizing increased voter turnout, as lower transaction costs make participation more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nSimplified Custom DAO Deployment\n\nBuilding custom DAOs on Arbitrum is made remarkably straightforward, thanks to the platform\u2019s full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. This feature streamlines the deployment of custom integrations and allows developers to harness Ethereum\u2019s extensive developer ecosystem to tailor DAOs to their specific needs.\n\nEnhanced Security and Speed\n\nArbitrum\u2019s close association with Ethereum ensures that DAOs launching on this L2 solution inherit the robust security features for which Ethereum is renowned. This not only guarantees a safer experience for users but also provides a seamless transition for DAOs seeking to establish themselves in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, Arbitrum offers faster transaction speeds, significantly reducing the time required for DAO administration and governance activities. This acceleration in transaction processing can contribute to more efficient decision-making and overall DAO operations.\n\nIvan Fartunov, Head of Ecosystem at Aragon, said: \u201cArbitrum is by far the most adopted rollup in the EVM ecosystem, both in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and protocols launched on the network. In addition to being home to impactful multichain projects like Stargate, Arbitrum has spurred many exciting native projects like GMX, Tenderize, and Plutus. We are excited to join such a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAragon\u2019s commitment to accessibility is evident in its no-code solutions, which have already facilitated the launch of over 7,000 DAOs across Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) and L2 networks. Now, with Aragon available on Arbitrum, communities can create a DAO in under 10 minutes and manage their assets transparently through a user-friendly app.\n\nThe secure and modular design of Aragon OSx opens doors for protocols deployed on Arbitrum to customize their governance with plugins, including multichain governance and optimistic dual governance. This flexibility enhances the potential use cases for DAOs and underscores the growing synergy between Aragon and Arbitrum in their mission to bring more participants into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nRead Also: Introducing Dark Fusion: The Future of Smart Contracts and Tokens on Bitcoin"

        "content": "Recently, XRP community members looked back into history to compare XRP\u2019s price through their years of holding on to the digital asset with respect to the performance of other competing crypto projects.\n\nPer statistics from authoritative sources, XRP appears to be the worst-performing cryptocurrency when compared to others ranking in the top ten, like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).\n\nXRP Price Five Years Ago\n\nToday, five years ago, data from prominent market tracker CoinMarketCap shows XRP traded at a low of $0.3625 and a high of $0.381. At that time, it had a market cap of $14.61 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $512 million.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThroughout November 2018, the highest point XRP reached was $0.5605, while its lowest was $0.325, per CoinMarketCap statistics.\n\nXRP\u2019s lowest value five years ago, when compared to its price of $0.6 today, suggests the token has again only 86.45% all the way from 2018 to 2023. On the high side, with $0.5605, XRP has seen only 8.12% in five years.\n\nBitcoin Price Five Years Ago\n\nMeanwhile, on November 30, 2018, BTC traded at a low of $3,942.82 with a valuation of $69.9 billion and a trading volume exceeding $6 billion. The firstborn crypto\u2019s lowest value for November 2018 was $3,585.06, which translates to a 957% gain when factored against today\u2019s price of $37,902.\n\nEmphatically, Bitcoin\u2019s value five years ago compared to today implies BTC investors have reaped more than ten times more profit than XRP investors.\n\nETH and Cardano Price\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum exchanged hands at a low of $111.74 today five years ago, with a market cap exceeding $11,7 billion. In the same month, ETH bottomed at $102.45 and has grown 1887.71% since then to $2,036 today.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn other words, investors who bought ETH\u2019s dip in November 2018 have seen 21 times more profit than those who bought XRP\u2019s dip the same month. Likewise, Cardano sold at a discount of $0.0328 in November 2018. However, ADA\u2019s value has risen 1,053.05% since then to $.378.\n\nCrypto Community Reacts\n\nA crypto enthusiast with X username \u201c@Ianbins\u201d put XRP\u2019s five-year value alongside rivalry tokens with a satirical comment.\n\n\u201cBuy XRP, they said; it will make you rich, they said,\u201d he mocked, given that XRP\u2019s current value is not much different from November 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Morgan, a lawyer known for his pro-XRP stance, remarked:\n\n\u201cWow. I never realized XRP\u2019s price performance was this poor compared to other major coins and not only compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWow. I never realised XRP\u2019s price performance was this poor compared to other major coins and not only compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "title": "How to make cryptocurrency bridges from the BSC network to ETH or vice versa - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we will see how to perform a cryptocurrency bridge from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) cryptographic network to the Ethereum Mainnet (ETH), or vice versa.\n\nThe bridge represents a cross-chain transfer of digital currencies between different blockchains that, by their nature, cannot overlap and must travel on different roads.\n\nTo carry out this type of operation, we can rely on both non-custodial solutions and custodial ones.\n\nThe former maintain the component of decentralization, typical of those who want to operate in complete privacy and in a trustless mode, while the latter represent a valid alternative for those who handle large amounts of capital and prefer to enjoy greater protection in terms of cybersecurity.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nCrypto bridges from BSC network to ETH or vice versa: the best protocols\n\nOne of the most popular solutions for bridging cryptocurrencies from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to the Ethereum Mainnet (ETH), or vice versa, is to use decentralized interoperability applications.\n\nWith this specific genre of protocols, crypto such as BNB, USDT, and USDC can be easily transferred between the two networks, which due to their nature normally cannot communicate.\n\nTo use them, it is essential to have a non-custodial crypto wallet, such as Metamask or Trustwallet, and be familiar with the practices and operations typical of web3 and DeFi.\n\nAmong the most quoted and reliable applications in the specific case of the BSC to ETH bridge, we find: Stargate, Meson, Symbiosis, Orbiter Finance, and Layerswap.\n\nAll of them represent a quick and economical option that with a few minutes of waiting and a handful of dollars, will allow your tokens to teleport between blockchains.\n\nFurthermore, the liquidity on them is sufficient to guarantee the perfect functioning of operations. Stargate is by far the most popular platform in this regard, to the point of recording a volume of over 220 million dollars in the bridges of the last 30 days involving the BSC.\n\nIt is estimated that the entire cryptographic network during the same period supported a total volume of 349 million dollars across all existing applications\n\nIts dominance is largely due to speculation about an alleged LayerZero airdrop that could be released specifically to Stargate users.\n\nNow let\u2019s see practically how to perform a bridge from BSC to ETH, using the platform just mentioned as a reference.\n\nThe mechanism is identical in any other solution, with the only difference that some cryptos may be available for transfers on one platform rather than another.\n\nOnce we have entered the official Stargate website, we go to the \u201ctransfer\u201d section, select the type of currency we want to transfer, and select the sender and recipient networks.\n\nLet\u2019s enter the total number of tokens to be bridged and click on the \u201ctransfer\u201d button.\n\nAs in the following example, after a few minutes the USDT sent from BSC will be visible on ETH and can be used immediately within this ecosystem.\n\nObviously, like any operation on blockchain, this one also incurs commission costs, which in the case of the bridge from BSC to ETH can reach a few dollars, while from ETH to BSC it could sometimes exceed even more than 20 dollars (it depends a lot on the gas cost on Ethereum).\n\n\n\nThere are actually applications like Sushiswap, which have implemented the so-called \u201ccross-chain swap\u201d, which allow you to simultaneously execute a swap between two tokens while they are being transferred from one chain to another.\n\nWithdrawal of crypto from exchanges as a secure custodial solution for cryptocurrency bridging\n\nAnother method to bridge cryptocurrencies between the BSC and ETH networks is to use centralized exchanges as a support base to deposit funds from one network and withdraw them from the other. This is not a true bridge, but it still represents a very valid alternative solution.\n\nIf, for example, you have some USDT on the BSC on the Metamask wallet and you want to transfer them to ETH, you could make a BEP-20 deposit on an exchange like Binance and then withdraw the same USDT as ERC-20 on Ethereum to the same starting address.\n\nBy doing so, you give up the factors of decentralization and privacy to enjoy some advantages such as increased security.\n\nUsually those who use this bridging option do so because they handle significant volumes and do not want to expose themselves to the risks of third-party non-custodial platform smart contracts.\n\nDecentralized bridges are indeed the most vulnerable web3 environment to cyber attacks par excellence, where the funds of many users have been compromised in recent years.\n\nConsidering that in this niche, in just over 3 years hackers managed to steal about 2.75 billion dollars, which is a little over a third of all thefts that occurred in the entire crypto world.\n\nIn this regard, just a few days ago the Heco Bridge managed by the famous Justin Sun, was hacked for 86.6 million dollars\n\nTransferring your cryptocurrency to CEX minimizes counterparty risk in this type of protocol, relying solely on the reliability of the exchange in question.\n\nIt is also worth noting how this option can solve the potential \u201cproblem\u201d of high gas fees on Ethereum in the case of the bridge from ETH to BSC, significantly reducing commission costs compared to interoperability applications.\n\nThe best exchanges to carry out this type of operation are Binance, Bybit, Okx, Crypto.com, Bitget, Kraken, Kucoin.\n\nBefore making the first deposit, make sure that the platform you are using supports the tokens you want to transfer and the networks you want to rely on."

So, today, we will explore the strategies and impacts of three amazing digital assets: Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), and the current innovator, GameStop Memes (GMS).\n\nIn this article, we will shed light on whether these three currencies will be a successful investment in the world of cryptocurrencies in 2024, especially after the $4 million presale of GameStop Memes.\n\nBNB Sees Surge in Popularity\n\nIn the first corner of our crypto battlefront, we have Binance Coin (BNB), the native cryptocurrency of the world-renowned Binance exchange. BNB has been a prominent player in the crypto space, known for its utility and versatility. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB transitioned to Binance\u2019s native blockchain, Binance Chain, through a coin swap.\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s primary function is to fuel transactions and interactions within the Binance ecosystem. Users can utilise BNB to pay for trading fees, transaction fees, and even goods and services from merchants that accept them. This utility has solidified BNB\u2019s position in the crypto market and continues to evolve.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Binance Coin\u2019s popularity is its participation in various Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales on the Binance Launchpad. This has allowed investors to access promising projects at an early stage, potentially reaping significant rewards, which means it is likely to be a good investment in 2024.\n\nEthereum: An Uncertain Investment in 2024?\n\nIn the opposite corner, Ethereum (ETH) stands out for its groundbreaking approach to blockchain technology. While Bitcoin primarily focuses on digital currency, Ethereum takes a broader perspective.\n\nLaunched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralised applications (DApps) and customise blockchain solutions. This innovation opened doors to a wide range of applications beyond traditional finance.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has grappled with scalability issues. Its current infrastructure struggles to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently. This has resulted in high gas fees and slower transaction processing times, limiting its potential; therefore, Ethereum may not be a good investment in 2024.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 Disruptive Entry to Crypto\n\nNow, let\u2019s shine the spotlight on the disruptor of the hour, GameStop Memes (GMS). Inspired by the GameStop saga that made headlines, GMS takes the meme culture to new heights by turning popular internet memes into tradable assets.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 strength lies in its community-driven ethos. It thrives on the collective enthusiasm of its users, who come together to celebrate and invest in their favourite memes. While it may not possess the technological sophistication of Ethereum or the dominance of Binance Coin, it introduces an element of fun and community spirit to the crypto space.\n\nMoreover, GameStop Memes made a significant mark by amassing an impressive $4 million during its presale, signifying growing interest and support for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency. While its long-term impact on the crypto market remains uncertain, it undeniably injects excitement and unpredictability into the scene.\n\nWe\u2019ve explored the strengths and strategies of Binance Coin, Ethereum, and GameStop Memes in this crypto battle. Binance Coin excels in utility and participation in token sales, Ethereum pioneer\u2019s innovation with its smart contracts, and GameStop Memes adds a playful twist to the world of crypto.\n\nSo far, the GameStop Memes method seems effective and distinct after achieving $4 million in presale.\n\nInvest in GSM while it\u2019s still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://GameStopmemes.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopopMemes\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
