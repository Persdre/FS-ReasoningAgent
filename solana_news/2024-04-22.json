        "title": "3 Reasons Why I Sold Ethereum and Never Looked Back - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The coin's potential has been very slow to materialize.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided to offload the vast majority of my Ethereum (ETH -1.13%) tokens after holding and accumulating them over the last few years. I don't expect to buy more anytime soon, even if the price drops to attractive levels.\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. The coin's price surpassed the target level in my investing plan\n\nThe biggest reason I decided to sell nearly all of my Ethereum was that its price was above the level that I had identified as my sell point.\n\nI first started to accumulate Ethereum in mid-2020. Per my initial investing plan, I did not set a price target for a sale at the time, opting instead to reassess the issue after roughly three years had elapsed. I continued to dollar-cost average (DCA) and build up my position through roughly the middle of 2023, after which I set a firmer target and stopped buying more.\n\nI resolved to think strongly about selling after the price hit somewhere above $3,000 per token, a level the coin had surpassed in at least three of the periods I'd held it, as shown in this chart:\n\nWhen the coin broke through that price level this year, it was only a matter of time. It's entirely possible that my sale will mean that I'll be missing out on the coin's future growth. But because of the next reason we'll discuss, I won't be losing any sleep over it.\n\n2. Transaction fees were too high, and not improving by enough over time\n\nTransaction fees, known as gas fees, are perennially high on the Ethereum chain. To transact, you'll need to cough up anywhere from $5 to $80 or more, depending on the day. And despite many repeated promises from the chain's developers regarding a permanent decline of gas fees, they have remained stubbornly and painfully high for years on end.\n\nI don't day trade in and out of my cryptocurrencies, so it might seem as though it's hyperbole to complain about the infrequent transaction costs associated with building up a position. But remember, my strategy was to dollar-cost average. Making a series of purchases entailed paying gas fees on the order of $600 in total -- way too much given the relatively small size of my position and my investments.\n\nWhat's more, the thing I kept noticing again and again over the years of my holding was that the high fees were discouraging my friends from buying Ethereum as an investment or trying to use it to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Noticeable commission costs are practically extinct for most retail investors trading stocks, so the expectation that people often have is that the same will be true in cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter a while, I stopped touting the coin as an investment because I wanted to avoid the subsequent conversations about how high the gas fees were. Ultimately I recognized that behavior in myself, and it was an unambiguous sign that it was time to sell.\n\n3. It's in the uncanny valley of cryptocurrencies\n\nThe final reason that I sold Ethereum is that it is presently in a bit of an uncanny valley.\n\nIf you're not familiar, the uncanny valley is a phenomenon in which a person's reaction to a humanoid robot is warm when the robot does not appear to be very human at all, warm when the robot appears to be fully human, but ice-cold or otherwise negative when the robot appears to be nearly human-like, but is overtly not an actual human.\n\nEthereum has a number of popular meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, a blockchain intended largely for fun or outright gambling rather than investing in serious projects and fostering frontier financial technologies. At the same time, it has a handful of rather esoteric cryptocurrency utility projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), much like you'd expect from a chain devoted to hardcore technology development, financial engineering, or methodical new experiments in corporate governance.\n\nYet its high transaction costs make meme coin investing exceptionally painful. Likewise, the same source of friction is a massive drag on for-profit projects, which tend to have a higher need to transact on demand, meaning that they can't wait for fees to decline.\n\nFor other purposes, like minting and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or creating smart contracts, there are plenty of solutions on the chain to choose from. But many of the marketplaces, exchanges, and tools on Ethereum have only rudimentary feature sets or sketchy credentials.\n\nOf course, the Ethereum blockchain itself can't fully control which projects use it or how well they work.\n\nBut for a chain's native token to be a good investment relative to other options, it helps if there's a critical mass of users within at least one (large) community that's loyal to where their projects are deployed. And for this chain, the various frictions are an impediment to that critical mass continuing to build, so I don't regret selling."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now soliciting feedback from the public on BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF proposal, according to a recent filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act,\" the regulatory agency said in the filing .\n\nThose who want to weigh in on the matter can provide electronic comments via the SEC's internet comment form or via an email. The agency is also accepting paper comments.\n\nThe public will be allowed to leave comments during a 21-day period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC also called for comments on spot Ether ETF applications from Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise. Back then, ETF analyst James Seyffart opined that \"nothing\" in the filing signaled that anything had changed for Ethereum ETFs. He noted that silence from the regulator \"wasn't a good thing\" for approval odds.\n\nFor now, the consensus appears to be that the SEC is not going to approve a slew of spot Ethereum ETF applications in May despite approving a slew of applications earlier this year. The regulator has refrained from engaging with ETF issuers on this matter.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , the SEC recently postponed its decision on the spot Ethereum ETF proposal submitted by prominent investment firm Franklin Templeton.\n\nAt the same time, British banking giant Standard Chartered is convinced that the Ethereum price could reach the pie-in-the-sky price target of $8,000 by the end of the year despite predicting that Ether ETF will not be launched in May."

        "title": "Ethereum continues hinting at rally following reduced long liquidations - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum's price often takes a downward shift after FTX and Alameda sells ETH.\n\nTraders expect a price rise in ETH following reduced long liquidations and normalizing risk reversals.\n\nEthereum needs increased trading volume to break past key resistance levels.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has continued showing signs of a potential rally on Tuesday as most coins in the crypto market are also posting gains. This comes amid speculation of a potential decline following FTX ETH sales and normalizing ETH risk reversals.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows signs of a potential rally as suspected Justin Sun wallet buys heavily\n\nDaily digest market movers: FTX sale, normalized risk reversals, active wallet increase\n\nEthereum's latest price movement is hinting at a potential rally. Here are key market movers driving the second-largest cryptocurrency:\n\nSince March 1, FTX and Alameda Research have deposited 20,350 ETH at strategic points right before a price dip, according to Spot On Chain. This insight comes as FTX and Alameda deposited 4,500 ETH worth $14.4 million to Binance and Coinbase at $3,207 on Tuesday. Investors may need to observe if ETH will take a downturn as in previous times. Other investors may be using FTX's move as a sell signal, hence the consistent price drop after the firm's ETH sales.\n\n\n\nWith ETH's recent price recovery, long traders are looking to gain control as long liquidations have slowed down significantly on Tuesday compared to the past two weeks, according to data from Coinglass. Short liquidations are increasing, with over $13.45 million liquidated, while long liquidations sit at $7.4 million in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nETH risk reversals have also normalized above -4%, from -12% one week ago, indicating traders are beginning to expect a price improvement, according to QCP Capital. As a result, \"improving speculative sentiment could see short covering and a resumption of leveraged longs,\" said QCP.\n\nRead more: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nMeanwhile, Bankless podcast co-host Ryan Sean Adams pointed out the increasing number of active wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem, which has grown to over 10 million weekly active wallets. He speculated that the Ethereum ecosystem can now increase user growth by 10x to 100 million in this bull run.\n\n\n\nThe US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has also delayed its response to Franklin Ethereum ETFs, a series of the Franklin Ethereum Trust. The latest spot Ethereum ETF decision delay follows a series of timeline delays the regulator has given to other applicants.\n\nTechnical analysis: Ethereum needs increased volume to break past key resistance\n\nEthereum's recent price movement is teasing that a potential rally is on the horizon as it's attempting to break the upper side of the $2,852 and $3,300 key range. But it must first move past the $3,279 resistance to confirm.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nHowever, declining trading volume amid the price increase is a concern. While bulls appear to have taken the wheels again, the reduced trading volume indicates low commitment and uncertainty. ETH could quickly push forward to break past the $3,300 key level if increased volume accompanies the rising bullish sentiment.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nSuch a move will see ETH filling the liquidity void of April 13 and aiming for the next resistance of $3,406 formed on April 7. This resistance may prove easy to break past if trading volume increases. However, if volume fails to increase, ETH may fall back to the $3,056 support of March 20.\n\nAdditionally, with the halving behind us, Bitcoin's dominance over ETH may reduce in the long term, leaving room for the largest altcoin to craft its own path.\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,232, up 1.3% on the day at the time of writing."

        "title": "Technical analysis of Ethereum price: ETH consolidates after testing key resistance levels - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "While the cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a landscape of volatility and transition, Ethereum (ETH) remains a focal point for traders and investors, its price analysis remains constant.\n\nWith the recent price fluctuations, a detailed technical analysis provides valuable insights, especially when examining the 1-hour, 4-hour, and daily charts.\n\nThis comprehensive view provides insight into potential entry and exit points through oscillators and moving averages, guiding short-term and long-term trading strategies.\n\nFluctuations and opportunities in the analysis of Ethereum ETH price\n\nThe 1-hour chart of Ethereum reveals significant price fluctuations, ranging between 3,116 and 3,236 dollars. This variability signals promising opportunities for more agile traders.\n\nA key strategy could involve buying at or near the level of $3,116, which has emerged as a reliable support.\n\nIf the upward trends were to be confirmed, entering here and planning the exits near the resistance of $3,236 \u2013 where prices have previously reached the maximum \u2013 could optimize gains, minimizing exposure to sudden declines.\n\nSwitching to the 4-hour chart, Ethereum shows an ascending pattern, suggesting a gradual consolidation of recent gains after bouncing from the $2,864 support.\n\nThis broader perspective indicates a bullish momentum aiming for new highs. Traders are advised to monitor a strong recovery from the support level and to set stop-loss orders slightly below it to safeguard against potential declines. These strategies align with a cautiously optimistic outlook, balancing risk with the potential for profitable upward movements.\n\nOn the daily chart, the price movement of Ethereum is confined within a wider range between 2,801 and 3,730 dollars, which marks critical levels of support and resistance. An effective long-term trading strategy could involve entering near the support of 2,801 dollars, especially if a definitive bullish reversal occurs.\n\nOn the contrary, it might be wise to set the exits near the $3,730 resistance, as this level has historically represented a significant challenge for price progression upwards, making it a strategic point to secure gains before potential pullbacks.\n\nAnalysis of oscillators and moving averages and the bullish and bearish verdicts\n\nThe price movement panorama of Ethereum is further complicated by conflicting signals from technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and momentum oscillators. The MACD presents a bearish outlook, suggesting caution, while current momentum indicators appear more bullish.\n\nThis dichotomy requires a balanced trading approach, incorporating signals from both bearish and bullish perspectives on different timeframes to develop a nuanced and effective trading plan.\n\nBullish perspective:\n\nThe market positioning of Ethereum, particularly evident from the sustained lows on the 4-hour chart and positive momentum signals, indicates a bullish future. Traders should consider the opportunity to enter long positions near key support levels, taking advantage of the overall upward trajectory.\n\nThe resistance shown at these support points, combined with potential bullish reversals on the daily chart, supports a favorable outlook for the advancement of the Ethereum price in the short term.\n\nBearish considerations:\n\nDespite the optimistic indications on shorter timeframes, bearish signals such as those from the MACD and longer-term moving averages suggest caution. The resistance level of $3,730 remains a formidable barrier that has repeatedly hindered upward movements.\n\nTraders should beware of a potential drop from this high, which could lead to profitable short positions if Ethereum fails to overcome this critical resistance, indicating a possible price retreat.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ethereum shows potential for both gains and losses, the key to successful trading lies in a balanced and informed approach that takes into account the complex interaction of various technical indicators and market sentiments."

        "title": "Ethereum Price: 2 Reasons Why ETH Price is Rising ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The long anticipated Bitcoin halving is finally completed, after Ethereum (ETH) saw slow growth amid the recent market crash. This was partly fueled by the fading expectation of SEC approving Ethereum ETFs in may. ETH experienced losses by 15% slightly over a week ago, losing ground to Bitcoin. Although there was no immediate reaction to the halving event by top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin itself, Ethereum (ETH) has since seen an uptick of approximately 0.8% in its market value. As investors and enthusiasts closely monitor the next move of Bitcoin and altcoins, let\u2019s unravel why Ethereum price is rising.\n\nCurrent Market Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nOver the past day, the price of Ethereum has risen by 1.39% to $3,214.11. This increase maintains a favorable pattern for the week, increasing by 2.16%, but exhibits an 8.40% drop over the month. This shows potential volatility and market correction in the long-term\n\nEthereum holds the second position in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap, amounting to $385.8 billion. The token has experienced a slight increase of approximately 1.8% in its trading activity, by recording a trading volume of $10.16 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nETH has been trading between a low of $3,119.55 to a high of $3,210.30, indicating moderate volatility within the day. However, when compared to its all-time high of $4,891.70 it achieved on November 16, 2021, the token has recorded losses of 34.69%, indicating a notable pullback from its highest point.\n\nWhale Activity\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is underscored by significant on-chain transactions, particularly one involving a substantial withdrawal of 10,119 ETH from Binance, indicative of a notable Ethereum whale activity. According to Lookonchain investor has been progressively accumulating Ethereum, amassing a total of 127,388 ETH since April 8, totaling around $405.19 million.\n\nNotably, the average purchase price of this whale, standing at $3,172 per ETH, signals a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum\u2019s potential within the market.\n\nAdding to the rumors is the participation of Justin Sun, the creator of Tron (TRX), a well-known figure in the crypto world recognized for his financial ventures and public remarks. Claims imply that Sun has been buying Ethereum, with evidence suggesting that a wallet reportedly linked to him has been accumulating a substantial quantity of ETH since the start of April.\n\nThis wallet\u2019s activity aligns with a pattern observed from March 31, wherein large sums of stablecoins were moved from Binance to Ethereum, followed by substantial purchases of ETH from both Binance and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe similarities in transaction behavior between this wallet and another previously linked to Justin Sun, which acquired Ethereum in February, further bolster the speculation that Sun may indeed be behind these transactions.\n\nIn total, the suspected wallets attributed to Sun have reportedly acquired 295,757 ETH, valued at approximately $891 million, since February 12, at an average price of $3,014 per ETH.\n\nThese transactions, coupled with the ongoing interest and investments from notable figures like Justin Sun, contribute to the upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is still being traded at $3,206.30, indicating the current market trends and investor feelings towards the digital currency. The participation of powerful people like Sun illustrates the changing interactions within the Ethereum community, emphasizing its importance and possibility for more expansion.\n\nStrong Support Levels and Bullish Technical Patterns\n\nVarious crucial factors can be credited for the recent increase in Ethereum\u2019s price. During the pre-halving consolidation phase in the wider cryptocurrency market, Ethereum successfully held its position above the important $2,875 level. This level aligned with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, giving buyers a strong base to take charge of the market direction.\n\nFurthermore, the strong pullback seen in Bitcoin\u2019s halving phase helped boost Ethereum\u2019s price, driving it to peak at $3,198. Upon further analysis of the 4-hour chart, it is evident that a double bottom pattern has emerged, which is a common technical formation seen at the end of a downtrend, indicating the possibility of a substantial increase in price. This trend, along with the strong market momentum, boosted buyers\u2019 confidence.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price showing positive momentum, there is hope it will exceed the key resistance level of $3,300, boosting buyer confidence and possibly extending the recovery process. If this breakout occurs, Ethereum may reach higher price levels, with forecasts suggesting a potential rise to $3,730, then $4,100.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Ethereum continues to defy market pressures, its resilience above key support levels and the formation of bullish technical patterns signal a potential uptrend. With buyers eyeing critical resistance levels, the stage is set for further price appreciation in the near term."

        "content": "As the classic weather forecast goes in the Northern Hemisphere, April showers bring May flowers. Will it hold up for crypto exchange markets in Q2 of 2024 after a sharp correction this April?\n\nAnd if the market does recover in May, whose flowers will bloom brightest?\n\nBitcoin price\u2018s four-year bull run seems imminent, but will Binance, Solana, Cardano, or Aptos lead DeFi gains in the second quarter, or will the king smart contract coin, ETH, fly furthest up the chart?\n\nEthereum prices are up by almost 100% for the trailing 12-month period. Ether is down over 4% from 30 days ago. Meanwhile, ETH prices are up more than 7% over the five days ending Monday.\n\nHere are four reasons in Q2 of 2024 to jump on the fear of missing out (FOMO) bandwagon for Ethereum and four reasons to bail out in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD).\n\nFOMO:\n\nHere\u2019s what Ethereum has going for it after the Bitcoin halving at block height 840,000.\n\n1. Ethereum Price $4,000 Is New Goal\n\nEthereum crushed $3,000 in February, then notched $4,000 on crypto exchanges in March for the first time in 2 years. After a substantial retreat, the asset indecisively tested $3,200 on Monday. If bulls defeat resistance at this level, the next key resistance will be near $3,700 where the market previously peaked throughout the month of April.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap hit its historic all-time high of $4,808.74 on Friday, Nov. 12, 2021. After blowing past $3,000 last quarter, Ethereum bulls are focused on $4,000 next and potentially $4,800 sometime in 2024.\n\nAs markets closed out Q1, a post on the 2.3 million strong EthTrader subreddit predicted: \u201cETH has plenty of growth potential and will eventually return to $4k, likely bypassing its ATH as well.\u201d Furthermore, a recent report by USA Today notes: \u201cArtificial intelligence-based websites, crypto traders, and industry analysts have 2025 ethereum price targets ranging from around $6,000 to above $21,000. Industry insiders project the crypto will reach nearly $7,500 by 2025.\u201d\n\n2. Shiba Inu Is Becoming An L2\n\nOne way cryptocurrency investors evaluate the health of a Layer-1 blockchain is by gathering and analyzing metrics of activity and success among its most popular Layer-2 decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nA robust ecosystem with an active user base, high transaction volumes, and sustained growth trends tends to be a safer investment that delivers better returns. As a leading indicator of Ethereum prices in Q2, the success of the meme coin Shiba Inu \u2013 an ERC20 token \u2013 is a promising look at ETH\u2019s future.\n\nInitially, Shiba Inu started as a joke cryptocurrency like Dogecoin in Aug. 2020. But unlike DOGE, a proof-of-work (mineable) Layer-1 cryptocurrency, SHIB has become a full-fledged Layer-2 Ethereum-scaling ecosystem, with decentralized apps powered by final settlement on the latter\u2019s base chain.\n\nAn important Shiba Inu metric exploded by 1,000% in April, and a major SHIB developer made an important announcement earlier in the month. As a result, many cryptocurrency investors are terrified of missing out on Ethereum gains in 2024.\n\n3. L2 \u2013 Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism Scaling\n\nIn addition to Shiba Inu, Ethereum\u2019s other Layer-2 scaling chains, like Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OPT), are showing massive signs of strength in Q2. Perusing their X.com timelines, Monday reveals a flurry of new activity and development on these L2s, a bullish sign for Ethereum prices.\n\nGames are leaving Polygon? Check again.

Moreover, AltLayer announced on Monday the launch of a new Layer-3 powered by Arbitrum and Eigenlayer.\n\nAltLayer has deployed the testnet for @DODO_Chain, an Omni-trading Layer 3 powered by @eigenlayer & @arbitrum. From Multichain to Omnichain, enjoy a seamless new era of trading with DODOChain\u2019s interconnected liquidity layer! https://t.co/XaKpPJiPB1 \u2014 AltLayer (@alt_layer) April 22, 2024\n\n4. Ether TVS On Sharp Uptrend\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) or \u201ctotal value staked\u201d is the measure of the amount and market value of the tokens locked or staked at any given time for a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin found a way to prevent double-spending and solve the Byzantine General\u2019s Problem for a decentralized network by using electricity-intensive proof-of-work hash problems and a blockchain of validated hashes.\n\nSmart contract cryptocurrencies solve the same problem by allowing users to stake tokens to participate as a node. The higher the TVL, the better it is for the token\u2019s market value with all other things being equal.\n\nEthereum price may be worth FOMO\u2019ing over based on its TVL metrics. With a week left to go in April, Ethereum TVL is above $53 billion. Meanwhile, its nearest competitor, Tron (TRON), has $8.6 billion in TVL, according to CoinGecko data. Cryptoquant data show a very steady uptrend in Ethereum TVL from April 2021 through March this year.\n\n$29B of that TVL is staked with Liquid Staking using Lido, $14B is re-staked with EigenLayer, and $9B is staked through lending platform AAVE, according to the latest data from DefiLlama.\n\nFUD:\n\nHere are some headwinds working against Ethereum prices in Q2 2024.\n\n5. Prediction: Ethereum ETF Delay At SEC\n\nMany investors are feeling FOMO over the Ethereum price in Q2, but the outlook for the asset is not all rosy. One ongoing threat to Ethereum prices is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe danger the SEC poses to Ether prices is twofold: 1.) The commission continues to angle to get ETH tokens classified as securities. 2.) In addition, the regulator may delay approving an Ethereum ETF for Wall Street investors.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal because VanEck thinks Ethereum ETFs could outpace Bitcoin funds once approved. Bitcoin ETF issuers like Fidelity and VanEck have been waiting for an Ether ETF approval but say the SEC will not greenlight one by a late May deadline.\n\n6. SEC Investigating Ethereum As Security\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC is \u201cwaging an energetic legal campaign to classify Ethereum, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, as a security,\u201d according to a Mar. 20 report in Fortune Crypto.\n\nThe commission has issued subpoenas to a number of companies to probe their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation, kicking up speculation that the SEC will sue to get ETH tokens labeled a security.\n\nDevelopments related to this possibility represent an ongoing risk to long positions in Ethereum and a headwind for the asset\u2019s prices. Should the SEC ultimately succeed in its campaign, Ether will likely have to overcome serious FUD.\n\n7. Competition From Bitcoin and Other PoW Chains\n\nDeFi is one of the fastest-growing industry sectors in the world by far in 2024, but competition from proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Stacks (STX) is another reason to be uncertain about investing in Ethereum.\n\nSmart contract meme coins like Bonk Inu, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki Inu, and dogwifhat led cryptocurrency gains for the year in 2023. They may do so again in 2024, leading to new peaks.\n\nBut with the Bitcoin halving in the rearview mirror, the focus in 2024 could shift to supply and scarcity, with the benefit going to deflationary, PoW blockchains.\n\n8. Competition From Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also competition from other DeFi blockchains like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche for Ethereum investors to FUD over. Coin Bureau altcoin analyst Guy Turner recently told his two million YouTube subscribers that he expects a 100% rally soon to $300 for Solana.\n\nMeanwhile, there may be a mega-move ahead in the cards for Cardano (ADA) based on the technical signals on the crypto\u2019s chart. Last month, Avalanche (AVAX) achieved $329 million in daily transaction volume, levels the market hasn\u2019t seen since May 2022."

        "title": "Furrever Token Presale ROI Soars, Catching Attention of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Enthusiasts - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to ride the wave of excitement surrounding their recent halving events, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating whether Furrever Token ( FURR ) will seize the momentum and catch the presale hype train. With BTC and ETH experiencing slight climbs post-halving, investors are speculating whether FURR, with its unique approach to infusing cuteness into the crypto space, will capitalize on the current market sentiment to propel its presale to new heights. Join us as we delve into the intersection of traditional cryptocurrencies and the whimsical world of Furrever Token.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving Day and ETF Inflows Surge on 4/20 Caused a Slight Climb\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $65,177.84, marking a 2.5% increase since the halving event that took place yesterday. The timing of this halving has sparked curiosity, as it coincided with the infamous \"4/20\" meme date, leading to a curious alignment observed by Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nDespite a slowdown in inflows for Bitcoin ETFs since their peak in March, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to attract consistent inflows, with 69 consecutive days of positive inflows. Other ETFs, including those operated by Fidelity Investments, also saw significant inflows on April 19, signaling a potential return of momentum.\n\nWhile outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) were modest on the day, recent Form 13F filings have raised concerns about the penetration of Bitcoin ETFs into the mainstream investment landscape. However, Balchunas remains optimistic, likening the asset managers' approach to Bitcoin ETFs to \"hot sauce,\" suggesting that while the number of holders may be relatively small, there is significant potential for growth and adoption.\n\nOverall, the surge in ETF inflows on 4/20 raises questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin's price and the broader adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs in traditional investment portfolios.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Surges 4% Post-BTC Halving: Whales Return as Investors Seek Alternatives\n\nEthereum (ETH) has surged by 4% to reach approximately $3,163.71 following Bitcoin's halving event and the ensuing market hype. This uptrend in Ethereum's price mirrors the overall positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency market, with total market capitalization rising by 3.5% in tandem. Notably, the gains in Ether versus the U.S. dollar are largely attributed to capital inflows from the Bitcoin market, driving the ETH/BTC pair up by roughly 2.5% to 0.048 BTC on April 21. This ETH/BTC ratio surge, along with the Ethereum Dominance Index (ETH.D) growth of over 1%, reflects a pattern observed after previous Bitcoin halving events. Historically, Ethereum has seen increased capital inflows from Bitcoin investors seeking new growth opportunities post-halving. Furthermore, Ethereum's latest gains coincide with a period of accumulation among its wealthiest investors, as highlighted by the increase in Ether supply held by addresses with significant balances. Technical indicators also suggest strong support for Ether's price, with key support levels aligning closely with Fibonacci retracement lines and moving averages, indicating an attractive entry point for traders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Rides the Crypto Resurgence: Presale Momentum and Up to 15X Returns Propel its Charm\n\nIn the midst of the crypto market's resurgence following Bitcoin's halving and Ethereum's notable surge, Furrever Token ( FURR ) emerges as an intriguing contender poised to capitalize on the renewed enthusiasm. Priced at an enticing $0.000564, FURR offers investors an opportunity to partake in a project that transcends the traditional boundaries of cryptocurrency, infusing the space with an irresistible dose of cuteness and charm.\n\nAs FURR continues its journey, it is currently in the midst of its presale phase, which has already garnered significant attention and support from investors. With over $1,000,000 raised thus far and nearing the completion of stage 7 out of 10, FURR demonstrates strong momentum and investor confidence. The presale, with its ambitious target of raising $1.9 million, presents an opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards in return.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of FURR's presale is its offer of up to 15X returns, a tantalizing prospect for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto market. This generous return potential underscores FURR's commitment to delivering value to its early supporters and incentivizing participation in its presale. Moreover, the absence of buy and sell taxes when trading FURR further enhances its attractiveness to investors, offering a streamlined and cost-effective investment experience.\n\nWith its unique blend of cute cat-themed imagery, engaging community initiatives, and robust tokenomics, Furrever Token (FURR) stands at the forefront of innovation in the crypto space. As it rides the wave of excitement generated by Bitcoin's halving and Ethereum's rise, FURR has the potential to further increase its momentum and solidify its position as a leading project in the crypto landscape. By leveraging its current market momentum, FURR can continue to attract investors, drive community engagement, and deliver on its promise of revolutionizing the crypto space with cuteness and charm.\n\n\n\nDiscover the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Meme Coin Pepe Surges 16% on Coinbase Perpetual Futures Listing - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is starting the week on a relatively calm note following the buzz around the Bitcoin halving, with the global crypto market cap sitting at $2.56 trillion, a 2.7% change in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both up less than 3% today, and the trend is pretty similar among the biggest tokens in the crypto industry. However, the Ethereum-based PEPE, one of the most popular meme coins of 2024, is defying market trends and is one of the best performers in the top 100 coins by market cap today.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the price of PEPE went from $0.00000572 to its current price of $0.00000666 for a 16% spike, and a sizable 30% jump in the last seven days. Although it's down nearly 13% in the last 30 days after suffering a major correction, the token's technical indicators suggest that it's recovering and could be bouncing back to a bullish trend.\n\nThe price surge comes after Coinbase International, the global branch of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, announced the listing of PEPE perpetual contracts. This move is significant as it adds liquidity and increases the asset's exposure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n@CoinbaseIntExch will add support for Pepe perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. The opening of our 1000PEPE-PERP market will begin on or after 9:30am UTC on 23 APR 2024. \u2014 Coinbase International Exchange \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@CoinbaseIntExch) April 22, 2024\n\nThe opening of Coinbase's 1000PEPE-PERP market was originally planned for April 18, but was delayed for technical reasons. Trading will now begin on Tuesday, April 23.\n\nAnd of course, such an event was met with enthusiasm\u2014and memes\u2014all over Crypto Twitter. Coinbase also announced perpetual futures around Dogwifhat (WIF), a leading Solana meme coin, with trading set to begin on April 25.\n\nIn addition to the Coinbase announcement, PEPE's technical indicators suggest a positive trend. The coin's price trend has finally broken past the EMA55 mark (the average price of the last 55 days), indicating a potential recovery from the previous crash and a possible return to bullish behavior.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe EMA10 (the average price of the last 10 days) is also on target to surpass the EMA55 mark. This event, known as a golden cross, is usually a confirmation of a bullish phase in which prices tend to go up faster with time.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 51, suggesting a balanced market with neither bears nor bulls dominating (more accurately, 51% buyers and 49% sellers). The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 20 is also weak, showing that the power of the bearish correction is starting to diminish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which is used to determine which phase the markets are in, suggests that the bearish trend has lost force and the price is compressing in preparation for a bullish impulse.\n\nIn an optimistic scenario, PEPE could continue its bullish momentum and meet a first resistance at around $0.00000754 (for a 14.5% growth) or $0.00000882 (for a 33.6% growth, green line). However, in a pessimistic scenario, PEPE could fail to maintain momentum and test again the support of the last week at around $0.00000468 (for a -29% dip, red line).\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a week marked by notable movements in the cryptocurrency market, three coins have captured the attention of investors and analysts alike: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token ( FURR ) . Each of these cryptocurrencies has demonstrated unique behavior in response to global market conditions and internal developments, from halving events to presale successes.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes at $66,000 Following Halving Event\n\nAfter a period marked by significant fluctuations, Bitcoin's price has found stability early this week, maintaining a position around $66,000 following its anticipated halving event. The adjustment, which occurred over the weekend, resulted in the reward for Bitcoin mining being cut from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin, an essential part of the cryptocurrency's design to control inflation and reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation.\n\nThis halving, which takes place approximately every four years, is one of many steps in the long process towards the cap of 21 million Bitcoins. As of the latest event, there are projected to be 29 more such halvings before the final Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced to mere satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nLeading up to the halving, Bitcoin experienced weeks of price volatility. However, as of Monday morning, the cryptocurrency appears to be resting on a solid support level. Blockchain analytics firm IntotheBlock reports that Bitcoin is now trading just above a significant demand zone. \"With 1.66 million addresses having purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $64,800, this level may serve as strong support in the face of potential market downturns,\" stated IntotheBlock on social platform X.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the halving, Bitcoin transaction fees soared, reaching a record high of $127 momentarily during the weekend, as per data from Bitinfo Charts.\n\nIn related developments, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have also experienced modest gains, each up nearly 1% and trading at $3,100 and $152, respectively, as of Monday morning. The overall crypto market cap has seen a slight increase of 1.13%, climbing to a total of $2.41 trillion according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe crypto community continues to monitor these developments closely, considering the potential long-term impacts of Bitcoin's halving on the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Experiences Slight Increase Following Bitcoin Halving\n\nETH has successfully regained its footing above the $3,000 mark as of Friday and continued to stabilize over the weekend. Currently, the price of Ethereum hovers just over $3,200, marking a 1.3% increase in the last 24 hours and nearly matching its price level from the same time last week, with only about a 1% difference.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other positive developments, there is promising news for both Ethereum and Bitcoin as Hong Kong has conditionally approved spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. Local firms are optimistic about receiving final approvals to start issuing shares within the month. The initiation of trading is expected to alleviate some of the uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies in the region, potentially injecting $25 billion in new liquidity into the market\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Captivates Investors with Successful Presale During Market Surge\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out as a burgeoning favorite, having captured significant investor interest with its successful presale amid an overall market uptick.

With it, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices are showing promise, amid calls of a looming altcoin season.\n\nPost-halving, markets are gathering modest gains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is going back down after establishing a peak of 57.03%. As it continues to drop, the rotation is slowly gaining steam in favor of altcoins. A drop in dominance below 54% could be a good confirmation.\n\nBTC dominance\n\nAlso Read: Is Bitcoin sucking liquidity from altcoins, or will alt season begin again?\n\nBitcoin price at the cusp of a pullback\n\nBitcoin price is stuck within the lower section of the market range, confronting overhead pressure from the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $66,727. The market is leaning in favor of the downside, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appearing subdued after spending quite some time barely above the 50 mean level and hinting at buyer exhaustion.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is in negative territory. While it is above the signal line in the 12-hour time frame, the positions are reversed in the daily time frame, showing a continuation of the bearish sentiment. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator in negative territory accentuates this.\n\nBitcoin price is likely to reverse to $63,284, followed by a subsequent drop to $60,000 before a possible pullback. Notably, there remains some uncollected liquidity below this level, marked by the March 5 low of $59,005 and whose residue needs to be collected for balance.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nHowever, if the bulls can manage to breach the $66,727 roadblock and move above the most crucial Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8% at $68,391, it could open the expanse for extended gains, potentially as high as a new peak above $73,777.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price nicks $66K after halving as BTC transaction fees reverse\n\nEthereum price could rally 15%\n\nAmid speculation of an altcoin season, Ethereum price could rally 15% to $3,750, levels last tested around mid-March. This could be driven by an altcoin season, with ETH bulls primed for a rally as showed by the buy signals on both the RSI and MACD indicators, which have already crossed their respective signal lines.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the Ethereum price could extend a neck higher to $4,093, nearly 30% above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, if traders succumb to their profit appetite, Ethereum price could retract 6%, losing all the gains made over the past few days. In a dire case, the slump could extend to the April 13 low of $2,850, 10% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nRipple price must rise 25% before XRP bulls flock the scene\n\nRipple price is bending to the alt season narrative, but XRP bulls will only come in after the price closes above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.6791. With the RSI and the MACD teasing with buy signals and the AO showing a bold resolve by the bulls to recover the market after multiple successive green histograms, the upside potential for XRP continues to grow.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a rejection could send the XRP price south to find initial support at the $0.5000 psychological level or lower at $0.4500. A lower low below $0.4188, however, would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Price Outlook: A breakout or significant price movement may be imminent for Ripple\u2019s token"

        "title": "Ethereum price prediction: Buy or sell this summer? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The decline in Ethereum\u2019s network activity has turned Ether inflationary.\n\nDespite recent price troubles, ETH\u2019s long-term outlook remains significantly bullish.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] supply has become inflationary, as the general market decline in the last month has decreased user activity on the network.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound.money, the leading altcoin\u2019s supply has risen by over 4,836 ETH in the past 30 days. In the last week alone, this has grown by 9,000 ETH.\n\nETH\u2019s supply is deemed to have become inflationary when there is an uptick in the number of coins created and added to the circulating supply, thereby increasing the downward pressure on the coin\u2019s price.\n\nThis happens when the Ethereum network witnesses a drop in user activity. On-chain data from Artemis revealed a decline in the daily count of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum blockchain in the past 30 days.\n\nBetween 23rd March and 22nd April, Ethereum\u2019s daily active address count fell by 22%. This led to a corresponding fall in the network\u2019s daily transaction count. During the period under review, this dropped by 15%.\n\nDuring the 30-day period in question, the network\u2019s transaction fees peaked at $1.3 million on 12th April and initiated a decline. Between the 12th and 21st of April, Ethereum\u2019s daily fees dropped by 8%.\n\nWhen the Layer 1 (L1) network witnesses a decline in fees, it experiences a low burn rate. A reduced burn rate increases the amount of ETH in circulation, making the coin inflationary.\n\nA look into the future\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $3,173. Impacted by the general market decline in the last month, the coin\u2019s value dropped by 5% during that period, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data.\n\nHowever, despite the recent market headwinds, ETH\u2019s 50-day moving average (MA), which initiated a golden cross when the bull market rally began in October 2023, still lies above its 200-day MA on a weekly chart.\n\nThis implies that the coin\u2019s shorter-term moving average has remained above the longer-term moving average for some time. This is generally viewed as a bullish signal, as it indicates that ETH has experienced a sustained price increase since October 2023, despite a few drawbacks.\n\nMarket participants may interpret this as a sign of continued strength in the asset\u2019s price.\n\nReadings from the coin\u2019s Directional Movement Index confirmed this bullish outlook. The coin\u2019s positive directional index (green), which also crossed above its negative directional index (red) in October 2023, has since maintained this position.\n\nThis crossover is regarded as a bullish signal as it signals a rise in the bullish momentum. If it occurs over an extended period, like in ETH\u2019s case, traders view it as a confirmation of an uptrend in an asset\u2019s price and a signal of a further price rally.\n\nAnother indicator worthy of note here is ETH\u2019s Squeeze Momentum Indicator. It measures an asset\u2019s momentum and tracks the consolidation phase of the market for traders looking to trade in a sideways market.\n\nPrice chart readings showed that ETH\u2019s Squeeze Momentum Indicator has posted green upward-facing bars since November 2023.\n\nWhen this indicator shows upward-facing green bars, the asset in question is experiencing upward momentum.\n\nDespite the multiple declines in ETH\u2019s price in the past several weeks, its Squeeze Momentum Indicator continues to display green upward-facing bars, indicating that the rally will continue in the long term.\n\nAlthough the coin\u2019s outlook remains bullish in the long term, the surge in ETH profit-taking activity since mid-February has led to a decline in some of its key momentum metrics.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 58.77 and 52.01, respectively.\n\nWhile these values rest above 50, they suggest that recent market bearish trends have led to a slight decline in buying pressure.\n\nHowever, a combined reading of ETH\u2019s RSI, MFI, and the indicators assessed above showed that the coin is not in extreme overbought or oversold conditions. It also signals that the current trend may continue to be stable with a slight bullish bias.\n\nETH futures market\n\nIn ETH\u2019s derivatives market, its futures open interest reached a year-to-date peak of $15 billion on 9th April and has since declined by 33%, per Coinglass data. As of this writing, the coin\u2019s futures open interest was $10 billion.\n\nThis decline signaled a fall in trading activity in ETH\u2019s futures market. When an asset\u2019s open interest declines in this manner, it means that market participants are closing out their positions without opening new ones.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nSince the open interest decline began, the coin has closed five days with a negative funding rate, with the latest being on 22nd April. On those days, futures traders placed bets in favor of a decline in the coin\u2019s value.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s funding rate across exchanges was 0.0023%, showing that long traders have regained control."

        "content": "Bitcoin price analysis: The crypto market depicts a calm environment on Tuesday heading into the American session. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, jolted upward after halving but the momentum garnered was not strong enough to uphold gains above $67,000.\n\nFor many people in the market, it might be imperative to say that BTC lacks direction, leaving altcoin majors like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) oscillating in tight ranges.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum, for instance, steadied above $3,000 but currently pivots around the $3,200 mark. A similar outlook is depicted by Solana which climbed above $150, following the correction to $120, but failed to break above the hurdle at $160.\n\nThe two competitive smart contracts tokens ETH and SOL, are trading at $3,184 and $154 during US business hours.\n\n1. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Assessing BTC\u2019s Future Above $66,000 Support\n\nBitcoin price holds above the $66,000 level at the time of writing, but is seemingly pivotal \u2014 suggestive of the inability to find direction.\n\nThe 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (the line in purple on the chart) provides the next immediate support below the $66,000 level. Slightly under it are the other two key moving averages, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA (the blue and red lines overlaying the chart).\n\nBased on the outlook of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the neutral region at 58 bulls may continue with the struggle for a breakout in the short-term. However, sellers do not have a lot of influence, especially with investors likely to be holding onto their coins anticipating a post-halving rally.\n\nBitcoin price has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals, pointing to a parabolic post-halving rally in 2024 and 2025. According to a chart shared by @ali_charts, its available supply shrunk to approximately 4.6 million for the first time ever before the recent halving cycle started.\n\nFor the first time ever, the available #Bitcoin supply decreased to about 4.6 million $BTC before this halving cycle began. Why does this matter? The halving further slashes miner rewards, accelerating the scarcity of new #BTC. As supply tightens, and even if demand remains the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wGVmsW0K8t \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2024\n\nWith miner rewards slashed by half to 3.125 BTC, supply is expected to keep decreasing, further driving Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity. It is this fundamental quality that shrinks supply, as demand remains the same or increases which promises a significant impact on the price of BTC.\n\nBreaking above $68,000 and $70,000 may trigger FOMO and create a clear path to a new all-time high eyeing $80,000 in the short term and $100,000 toward the end of the year.\n\n2. Ethereum Price Hangs At The Edge Of A Cliff\n\nEthereum like Bitcoin, is unable to move past its immediate resistance at $3,250. On the downside, the oscillatory movement at $3,200 shows a lack of direction.\n\nThe confluence support created at $3,160 by the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA limits downward movement at the moment.\n\nHowever, with the RSI neutral and retreating toward the midline (50) and the oversold area (below 30), sellers may regain control, and trigger more losses to $3,000 this week.\n\nEthereum price tested support at $2,900 last week as geopolitical tensions thawed in West Asia between Israel and Iran. Such a move cannot be ruled out yet, especially with the expiry of Bitcoin and Ether options around the corner.\n\nOn the upside, breaking above the the yellow resistance band or the 200-day EMA could fuel the next uptick in Ethereum price targeting highs above $4,000.\n\n3. Solana Price As Correction Lingers\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) has about turned on the four-hour chart, hinting at a brewing correction in Solana price. Movement on the upside has been capped under the previous day\u2019s open of $157 and slightly above it is the 200-day EMA.\n\nIt is worth noting that, the presence of the above resistance levels does not imply immediate losses in SOL. Traders should be aware of the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA catching up to Solana price and aligning to support and prevent correction below the $150 level.\n\nIf the MFI stabilizes at 60, and bulls take up more long positions in SOL, a recovery may ensue within the American session and continue to Wednesday\u2019s Asian session for a debut above $160.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.
