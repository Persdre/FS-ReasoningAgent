        "title": "How the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Will Affect Ethereum\u2019s Market - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is on the edge of its seat as the next Bitcoin halving event approaches in 2024, an event that promises to reshape the landscape for Bitcoin and its peer cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Are you looking to know about the effect of the upcoming Bitcoin halving on Ethereum?\n\nIn this blog, we will look at the effect of Bitcoin halving on Ethereum, its effect on investor sentiment, market liquidity, and the interplay between supply and demand.\n\nImpact of past Bitcoin halvings on Ethereum prices\n\nThe effects of Bitcoin\u2019s second and third halving events on Ethereum\u2019s prices, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market, offer insights into the intricate dynamics between leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices after the second Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, and was characterized by a significant reduction in the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. This event had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market at large, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH went from $14 before the BTC halving to $11 at the time of halving. Experts noted that the price of Ethereum kept plummeting up to 25% until the halving occurred in July 2016. Post-halving, the price of ETH displayed some signs of recovery.\n\nAt the end of three months following the halving, the price of ETH was only 1.8% higher, signifying a stunted recovery.\n\nLet us understand the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s staking supply, which recently crossed 25%, providing key insights into its resilience and potential for growth.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices following the third Bitcoin halving\n\nThe third Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, further reducing the block reward to 6.25 BTC. This event preceded a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. The anticipation and aftermath of the halving contributed to a bull market in cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH, before halving, stood at $160. However, after the halving process, the price of ETH experienced a significant spike, with prices immediately reaching up to $211. After a month following the Ethereum halving, the price of ETH soared even further to a staggering $249.\n\nWithin three months of halving, ETH went up by a whopping 88.6%, priced at $398, as compared to the time of halving.\n\nHow will the upcoming Bitcoin halving affect Ethereum in 2024?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is anticipated to significantly influence Ethereum prices through various interconnected mechanisms and market dynamics. Here\u2019s a detailed exploration of the points mentioned:\n\n1. Historical performance and market dynamics\n\nEthereum\u2019s price dynamics in relation to past Bitcoin halving events offer valuable insights. This pattern suggests that Ethereum could similarly benefit from the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\nSuch trends highlight Ethereum\u2019s growing integration and responsiveness to Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles, suggesting potential bullish momentum for Ethereum in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\n2. Deflationary mechanisms\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s transition to a deflationary model, particularly through mechanisms like the Ethereum triple halving, plays a crucial role in its value dynamics.\n\nThis triple halving encompasses reduced ETH issuance, the burning of ETH via EIP-1559, and staking rewards, all of which contribute to reducing the circulating supply of ETH. This deflationary pressure is likely to enhance Ethereum\u2019s appeal as an investment, especially in the context of the crypto market\u2019s cyclical booms typically triggered by Bitcoin halving events.\n\nSuch mechanisms ensure that Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics are increasingly favorable, making it a compelling investment in the broader narrative of digital scarcity and value appreciation post-Bitcoin halving.\n\nReflect on the aftermath of the last Bitcoin halving by exploring these five essential insights, offering valuable lessons for Ethereum investors anticipating the next halving event.\n\n3. Investor sentiment and strategic investment\n\nThe anticipation surrounding Bitcoin halvings often generates significant market interest, potentially leading to increased investment in Ethereum as part of broader cryptocurrency market gains.\n\nInvestment strategies like diversification and Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) become particularly relevant as investors look to mitigate the volatility associated with halving events while capitalizing on potential market upswings.\n\nThis strategic shift in investment behavior could see more capital flowing into Ethereum, buoyed by its solid fundamentals and the speculative interest generated by the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAmid speculation about Ethereum\u2019s future, explore all potential bearish scenarios for Ethereum, providing a balanced view of its prospects as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\n4. Technological innovation\n\nThe halving event underscores Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the technological resilience of blockchain networks, setting a backdrop that encourages innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s foundational role in decentralized applications (dAFpps) and its ongoing development initiatives position it favorably for continued growth and adoption.\n\nThe broader context of technological innovation and scarcity, highlighted by Bitcoin\u2019s halving, reinforces Ethereum\u2019s value proposition, potentially driving its price up as the market anticipates increased adoption and use-case expansion.\n\n5. Regulatory landscape and security measures\n\nThe evolving regulatory framework and advancements in security protocols across the cryptocurrency sector are pivotal to Ethereum\u2019s investment outlook. As the industry seeks regulatory clarity and enhanced security measures, the overall appeal of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, is likely to increase.\n\nThis is particularly relevant in the period surrounding the Bitcoin halving, where market optimism and the influx of institutional and retail investment can be significantly influenced by perceptions of regulatory stability and security.\n\nGemini\u2019s report highlights the potential impact of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals on the market, suggesting that similar regulatory milestones could positively affect Ethereum by enhancing its legitimacy and accessibility to a broader investor base.\n\nEthereum price prediction following the 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $2800.29. As we look toward the future of Ethereum, our projections predict that by the end of 2024, Ethereum is expected to reach approximately $3200, marking a significant upturn from its current valuation.\n\nWhile this forecast positions Ethereum\u2019s price notably below its peak historical high, it signals robust confidence in the asset\u2019s growth potential and resilience within the volatile crypto market.\n\nThis anticipated rise reflects the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by continuous innovation and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, hinting at a promising horizon for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s 11th AMA sheds light on the future of scalability and security, factors crucial for understanding Ethereum\u2019s positioning in a post-halving crypto market.\n\nWhy should you invest in Ethereum in 2024?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum in 2024 could be a strategic move for various reasons, based on insights from multiple sources:\n\n1. An ecosystem of dApps\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s largest ecosystem for dApps. With almost 3000 dApps running on its blockchain, Ethereum offers a wide range of utilities beyond simple transactions, including DeFi games, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more. This diverse application base could drive further demand for Ethereum.\n\n2. Ethereum Merge completion\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, transitioning the network from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), marks a significant upgrade. It makes Ethereum greener and more scalable, which could attract more users and developers, potentially increasing the value of Ethereum over time.\n\n3. Innovation and uncensorable apps\n\nEthereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of uncensorable applications, providing a level of freedom not controlled by central authorities. This capability emphasizes its role in fostering innovation across various sectors, including electricity, healthcare, and finance, positioning Ethereum as a host for groundbreaking solutions.\n\n4. Staking rewards\n\nWith the shift to PoS, Ethereum staking has become an avenue for earning passive income. Stakers contribute to network security and, in return, receive rewards. This not only supports the Ethereum ecosystem but also offers a sustainable earning opportunity for investors.\n\n5. Long-term price potential\n\nAlthough predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently speculative, some analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory. Anticipations of continued growth in the DeFi sector and Ethereum\u2019s fundamental strengths suggest the potential for price appreciation in the years to come.\n\nThese reasons highlight Ethereum\u2019s pivotal role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains, emphasizing its potential as a valuable investment in 2024. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile, and investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial situation and risk tolerance before investing.\n\nConsider the broader market dynamics with a look at the impact of Bitcoin ETFs and three events that could trigger a bull run, offering perspectives on Ethereum\u2019s market potential in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s cyclical events.\n\nSumming up\n\nIn conclusion, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and its effect will be a watershed moment for Bitcoin and Ethereum. While it\u2019s clear that the event will have far-reaching implications, the exact nature of its impact on Ethereum\u2019s market remains to be seen.\n\nAs such, both investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor the developments leading up to and following the halving, as they will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s market in the years to come."

        "title": "Points Season: Who's Winning the NFT Marketplace Wars on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe \u201cpoints\u201d meta has overtaken the crypto space as of late, and NFT marketplaces across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin are jumping on the bandwagon (and in some cases driving it) in an attempt to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of traders everywhere.\n\nWill points translate to token airdrops? Will the NFT market return to its former glory? And if so, which company is in the best position to win the NFT marketplace wars? Here\u2019s how things are shaping up so far:\n\nMagic Eden is the latest NFT marketplace to try and lure in users through points-like loyalty models that could pay off with a token drop or other rewards. The marketplace recently launched its Diamonds rewards system, which includes a retroactive drop of rewards to Solana traders dating back to 2021.\n\nEthereum marketplace Blur pioneered the points model, and it was this time last year that the upstart platform dethroned longtime leader OpenSea by dropping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BLUR tokens to its most loyal users. By the end of the year, Blur had given away $818 million worth of BLUR tokens after users racked up points.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensor, the leading Solana NFT marketplace, has employed a similar points-based loyalty model, and similarly overtook leader Magic Eden last year\u2014but Tensor still has yet to launch its crypto token. To be clear, Tensor has yet to officially announce a token airdrop tied to the points, though it has teased such sentiments in the past.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s launch of its Diamonds system\u2014starting on Solana, but expanding to Bitcoin, Polygon, and Ethereum soon\u2014signaled an apparent attempt to catch up to Tensor. Similarly, we don\u2019t know yet what Magic Eden\u2019s points-like Diamonds will actually be used for, though there\u2019s also a separate NFT token drop coming in parallel with the rewards system.\n\nIs Magic Eden\u2019s rewards shift paying off in terms of boosting its market share? So far, not really.\n\nMagic Eden briefly saw a Solana surge that suggested it was making up ground on Tensor. On February 5, Decrypt observed that market data from analytics platform Tiexo pointed to Magic Eden claiming a 41% share of Solana NFT volume over the previous 24-hour period, compared to 53% for Tensor. That was much closer than it had been in recent weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, as of this writing, Tensor commands about 73% of Solana NFT market share over the past 24 hours, per Tiexo, compared to just 22% for Magic Eden. Zooming out a bit, there isn\u2019t a significant shift over the past weeks. In the last seven days, Tensor has over 75% share compared to 19% for Magic Eden; in the last month, Tensor claims over 73% with Magic Eden at less than 22%.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nExpanding the data to include platforms across several major NFT chains, however\u2014including Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain\u2014reveals some other interesting details about how rewards models are further reshaping the marketplace wars.\n\nLooking at the broader landscape, Blur rules the market by a wide margin, commanding about 42% market share over the past week. That\u2019s entirely on Ethereum mainnet, still the leading blockchain for NFTs, and Blur\u2019s existing token and history of sizable airdrops to users appears to be propelling its continued dominance.\n\nTensor is second overall with about 14.5% market share among tracked networks, all on Solana, followed by Magic Eden with 14%\u2014with the majority of that volume coming from Bitcoin Ordinals sales.\n\nOpenSea, which has no points system and has long resisted calls to launch its own token, lands in fourth with about 12.4% share, primarily on Ethereum and scaling network Polygon. Bringing up the rear is OKX\u2019s marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals, which are similar to NFTs, with about 7.7% market share.\n\nTiexo\u2019s 24-hour data shows some deviations due to the smaller sample size, with Blur holding an even larger share at 52.5% and Magic Eden up second with just under 12%\u2014but the majority of that volume is on Bitcoin, likely due to Tuesday's sale for the Bits gaming project. OpenSea, Tensor, and OKX bring up the rear, in that order.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nMagic Eden is readying a significant push on Ethereum with the launch of a new marketplace for that chain, created in partnership with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs. Set to debut on February 27, the marketplace has also set alliances with the teams behind major Ethereum projects like Pudgy Penguins and Azuki.\n\nWill the launch of Magic Eden\u2019s new Ethereum marketplace, with associated Diamonds rewards, help turn the tide and provide a sustainable boost as it battles rivals? We\u2019ll see later this month, as it\u2019s the next big shift on the horizon\u2014although the NFT world is ever full of surprises.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez"

        "content": "ENS Labs asks DAO about settlement offer and reimbursement for legal expenses.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) has asked the ENS DAO to vote on a potential settlement over eth.link.\n\nEth.link is used as a resolving service for .eth names. People can type a second level .eth name followed by eth.link to get the name to resolve in their browser.\n\nThe person who registered the domain went to prison for helping North Korea evade sanctions and the domain expired while he was in prison.\n\nThe domain was registered at Uniregistry, which had an expired domain auction partnership with Dynadot. Dynadot auctioned the domain for $852,000, with Manifold Finance as the winning bidder.\n\nEthereum Name Service subsequently sued GoDaddy (which owns Uniregistry), Dynadot, and Manifold Finance. The domain was transferred to ENS due to a temporary injunction, but the case continues.\n\nManifold was dismissed from the case due to a lack of jurisdiction, but might still have a claim on the domain. The company has now offered to settle the dispute for a $300,000 payment.\n\nENS Labs is putting the settlement offer out to the ENS DAO. It is also asking the DAO to reimburse its legal expenses to date, which total about $750,000.\n\nGiven the legal expenses incurred to date and likely future expenditures, the settlement seems to be a bargain for ENS, assuming that the other parties also agree to the settlement and don\u2019t demand their legal expenses to be reimbursed.\n\nIt appears that ENS Labs wants to avoid further legal expenses. It says that if the DAO refuses to reimburse it for its legal expenses, \u201cENS labs will act to minimise its further expenses by having the case dismissed.\u201d\n\nA settlement would also be helpful because ENS would no longer be entangled in a lawsuit with GoDaddy. Despite the lawsuit, GoDaddy worked with ENS to integrate its new gassless wallet connection into the GoDaddy registrar."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA wave of optimism has swept the crypto market, propelled by significant price surges for industry heavyweights Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).\n\nSolana has defied expectations with a strong price rally, seizing the fourth spot in cryptocurrency rankings by market capitalization and overtaking Binance's BNB token. While a major network outage on February 6 could have spooked some paper handers,market sentiment was bullish enough to counter the fears.\n\nThe price of Solana went up 4% today, from $112.54 to its current $117.14. For swing traders, things also look good, with the cryptocurrency registering an impressive 15.9% spike in the last 7 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere appears to be growing appetite for risk in the markets as the widely followed Crypto Fear and Greed Index hit 74 out of 100, its highest level since Bitcoin's record peak in November 2021.\n\nBitcoin is usually seen as a volatile alternative to stocks, but altcoins are even more volatile than BTC, and are very sought after in bullish times for their potential to yield high gains in short periods.\n\nBeyond overall market sentiment, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana's DeFi protocols has experienced a meteoric rise of over 944% since 2023, according to DefiLlama, reflecting heightened investor confidence and engagement in the Solana ecosystem. The solid growth comes despite the low blow that came up with the collapse of FTX.\n\nSam Bankman Fried, the former CEO of the defunct exchange was a major fan and investor in the token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a side note, preorders for the new version of the Solana Mobile Saga smartphone have surpassed expectations, achieving over 100,00 presales and giving the Solana Foundation enough room to increase its price and cash in on the brand marketing that a crypto-phone brought during a token bull run.\n\nThe Founder Window for #Chapter2 has officially closed and we\u2019re thankful to everyone who participated! The Early Adopter Window has now begun and has a preorder price of $500. pic.twitter.com/YTjtbqovb4 \u2014 Solana Mobile 2\ufe0f\u20e3 (@solanamobile) February 14, 2024\n\nEthereum maintaining momentum\n\nFollowing broader market movements, Ethereum continues its ascent. ETH has registered impressive gains today, exhibiting remarkable strength throughout the market upswing.\n\nThe price of Ethereum bounced 5.6% after a minor red candle yesterday. ETH started the day at $2,642 and went up all the way to its current price of $2,781.\n\nThe price of Ethereum hasn't see such levels since April of 2022.\n\nBitcoin's price movements have considerable pull on altcoins, including Ethereum. However, on a more fundamental level, the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum network, slated for March, promises significant efficiency improvements and has fostered a positive mood among investors and the crypto community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Why Are Creators Minting NFTs On Bitcoin Rather Than Ethereum? - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "Artists, creators, and collectors have all sought to capitalise on the explosive growth of the non-fungible token (NFT) market. While Ethereum has long been the preferred blockchain for minting NFTs, a new trend has emerged in which crypto natives are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative. This shift prompts an examination of the reasons behind this transition and an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of using Bitcoin for NFT minting.\n\nThe Rise of NFTs and Ethereum\u2019s Dominance\n\nNFTs have changed the way we perceive and monetise digital content, giving creators a means to authenticate and monetise their work in the digital world. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract capabilities and established ecosystem, emerged as the de facto platform for NFT minting and trading. Its smart contracts work under ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, providing a framework for creating and exchanging NFTs, as well as for interoperability and liquidity within the growing NFT market.\n\n\n\nHere are 5 token standards you need to know about.https://t.co/ngj3v0dUPq \u2014 nft now (@nftnow) June 8, 2023\n\nThe Case for Bitcoin NFTs\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the NFT space remains undisputed, a growing number of individuals are exploring the viability of Bitcoin as an alternative platform for minting NFTs. Here are some factors that may have contributed to this shift:\n\n1. Bitcoin\u2019s Brand Recognition and Network Effects:\n\nBitcoin enjoys the most brand recognition and network effects as the pioneer cryptocurrency blockchain. Using Bitcoin\u2019s iconic status, proponents believe that minting NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain enhances their perceived value and marketability, tapping into the broader Bitcoin community and investor base.\n\n2. Security and Immutability:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain is popular for its excellent security, stemming from its extensive hash power. By minting NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, creators benefit from Bitcoin network\u2019s unparalleled security.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions and Scalability:\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin still struggle with scalability challenges and high gas fees, and Ethereum has seen various solutions helping this challenge. However, Bitcoin, too, has seen the emergence of Layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network. These off-chain scaling solutions enable faster and more cost-effective transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it an attractive option for NFT minting.\n\n4. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Integration:\n\nThe growing need for interoperability between different blockchain networks will open up for cross-chain integration. This will allow NFTs minted on the Bitcoin blockchain to seamlessly interact with other ecosystems and platforms.\n\nBitcoin NFT project Taproot Wizards has sold out its first collection, Quantum Cats, raking in $13M from the sale of the 3,000 digital images made with the Ordinals inscriptions protocol.https://t.co/5WY0mfK33O \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) February 10, 2024\n\nAdvantages Of Using Bitcoin for NFT Minting\n\nOne significant advantage is its reliability. Bitcoin still boasts the only ecosystem that is totally decentralised. This virtue allows Bitcoin transactions to be irreversible, ensuring secure transfers of digital assets without the risk of fraud or forgery\u2014a great and appealing option for NFT minting.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s brand recognition is also an attractive attribute. As the legacy blockchain, its pull for NFT marketability and value can be skyhigh.\n\nThere is also Bitcoin\u2019s cost effectiveness. Transaction fees are typically low, making NFT creation accessible to a wide range of users. Also, the widespread acceptance of Bitcoin by exchanges and businesses simplifies the process of transferring tokens.\n\nDisadvantages of Using Bitcoin for NFT Minting\n\nOne significant limitation is its restricted functionality compared to Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain wasn\u2019t initially designed for smart contracts. This barred it from having complex capabilities to build smart contracts and, consequently, NFTs.\n\nAnother concerning issue is Bitcoin\u2019s slower block time. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain take longer to process and confirm compared to Ethereum. Such delays can frustrate both buyers and sellers waiting for their tokens.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin still trails Ethereum in terms of developer support. Ethereum boasts a larger developer community, providing a wealth of tools and resources for creating and deploying smart contracts. Bitcoin\u2019s lack of builders can make it challenging for creators to find necessary resources for NFT creation.\n\nDid you know that Bitcoin supports smart contracts?\n\n\n\nLedger Academy dives into what they are, how they work, and what you can do with them: https://t.co/No1QRYUQWp pic.twitter.com/fwN8ylKt3b \u2014 Ledger (@Ledger) January 8, 2024\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin as an alternative platform for minting NFTs shows there\u2019s a broader shift towards exploring diverse blockchain ecosystems and milking the unique features and advantages they offer. Although Ethereum remains the dominant force in the NFT space, Bitcoin\u2019s brand recognition, security, and scalability present enticing reasons for creators to consider minting NFTs on its blockchain.\n\nBut the listed challenges such as limited smart contract functionality and a less mature ecosystem shows that builders should evaluate closely when choosing between Ethereum and Bitcoin for NFT minting.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests on the specific preferences, and objectives of creators, as they navigate their project.\n\nAuthor: Adeniyi Makinde\n\n#NFTs #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Blockchain #Crypto #DigitalAssets"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano has surged past the 50-day EMA, a technical indicator often used by traders to gauge the intermediate trend direction of an asset. The 50 EMA breakthrough signals strong bullish sentiment, as ADA's price climbs to test newer highs, which is a promising sign for investors seeking growth opportunities.\n\nThe current support level for ADA is established at around $0.50, which recently acted as a strong bounce point for the price. This level will be crucial for Cardano to maintain its bullish stance. Should the price remain above this support, it could pave the way for ADA to target the next resistance level at approximately $0.60.\n\nIf ADA continues its upward momentum and consistently closes above the 50 EMA, we could witness a further increase in buying pressure. This could lead to a new resistance test and potentially bring ADA to higher price points, eyeing the significant $0.65 mark as the next major target for bulls.\n\nConversely, should Cardano's price fall back below the 50 EMA, it may enter a consolidation phase or even a retracement. In this price drop scenario, the asset would likely find its first technical and psychological support level at $0.50. A breach below this could trigger sell-offs, leading to a retest of lower support levels, possibly around $0.48.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's surprising return\n\nEthereum has achieved a new high in its valuation. The digital currency has seen its value surge, crossing a critical threshold that could indicate further upward momentum.\n\nEthereum's recent breakthrough above the $2,600 mark signals a robust upward trend. This level previously served as a significant resistance, capping the asset's price during the previous cycle. With this level now surpassed, it sets a new local high for the asset, suggesting that the price may continue to rise as market confidence grows.\n\nThe support level for Ethereum is currently at around $2,500, which aligns with the moving averages that have historically acted as dynamic support during retracements. A sustained position above this level could reinforce the bullish sentiment and support the thesis of continued growth.\n\nOn the growth front, the continued rally could be fueled by the increased adoption and utility of ERC404 tokens, which combine the liquidity of ERC20 tokens with the uniqueness of ERC721 tokens. The high network fees on Ethereum also point to significant network utilization, hinting at robust on-chain activity that could support the asset's price.\n\nHowever, should a price drop scenario occur, a retest of the $2,500 support level is likely. If this support fails to hold, Ethereum could face a sharper decline toward the next significant support area, potentially around the $2,400 level, as traders may start to take profits, and momentum could slow down.\n\nSolana weaker than expected\n\nSolana is currently at a crucial juncture, testing the upper bounds of its established price channel. The asset has shown resilience and consistent performance over the past few weeks, leading to a critical moment that may define its trajectory in the short to medium term.\n\nSolana is trading around the $113.8 mark, approaching the upper resistance line of its price channel, which is approximately at the $115-$117 zone. This resistance level is particularly significant as it has previously acted as a strong point of rejection, prompting price pullbacks.\n\nOn the support side, Solana finds its immediate cushion around the $100 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has historically provided a bounce back zone for the price, indicating strong buying interest.\n\nShould Solana successfully break through the upper resistance level of the channel, the next probable target for growth is the $125-$130 range. This would establish a new higher high, potentially inviting more investors to the market and possibly initiating a new rally."

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision during a court hearing held in White Plains, New York.\n\nThis approval authorizes Genesis to monetize its holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust.\n\nGenesis to Sell its GBTC Shares\n\nIn addition to the $1.3 billion in GBTC shares, Genesis intends to sell over 11 million shares in two Grayscale Ethereum Trusts, with a combined value exceeding $200 million, as detailed in a court filing dated February 2.\n\nThis will result in a total of approximately $1.6 billion shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) combined.\n\nHowever, Genesis\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, attempted to delay the proposed sale until after the bankruptcy court decides on the subsidiary\u2019s debt repayment plan, which is scheduled for later this month. DCG expressed concerns that premature Grayscale share sales could depress prices, minimizing potential recoveries for Genesis creditors.\n\nJeffrey Saferstein, representing DCG, also emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid the rapid unloading of shares. Additionally, DCG sought the right to seek input on selling Grayscale shares.\n\nDespite these objections, Judge Sean Lane ruled in favor of Genesis, asserting the company\u2019s right to determine the strategic sale of its assets. He emphasized that the sales would be conducted over time with the assistance of a broker to prevent any rapid unloading of shares, which could adversely affect prices.\n\nLane justified his decision by highlighting the \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d of Genesis and its creditors in crypto, suggesting that they are well-equipped to maximize the value of the Grayscale shares.\n\nSEC and NY Attorney General Settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Genesis is moving forward with its liquidation plan, which entails shutting down the company and repaying customers in cash or cryptocurrency, depending on the nature of their deposits.\n\nThe company has reached settlements with the U.S. SEC and New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month, resolving their objections to its bankruptcy plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlements, the SEC will be paid a $21 million fine if Genesis has any surplus funds after repaying customers. Furthermore, any funds recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings will be used by the New York Attorney General to assist creditors allegedly defrauded by Genesis."

        "content": "Thu 15 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nIn the particularly booming crypto market landscape lately, making a relevant choice between positioning on Bitcoin or Ethereum can be quite the dilemma. These two crypto ecosystems are the leaders of the crypto market. But they are distinctly different in terms of their functionalities and advantages. Understanding this divergence can be crucial for your crypto investment choices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the safest crypto investment over Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is often nicknamed the \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its longevity and its increasing value over time. It is now widely regarded as a store of value and a hedge against often rampant inflation.\n\nMoreover, its simplicity and history make it an appealing choice for cautious, or even wary, investors. On this point, it stands out significantly from Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum firm.\n\nThe latter offers a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just limited to being a simple cryptocurrency.\n\nThanks to its flexibility, this platform paves the way to new prospects in various sectors such as finance and logistics, among others. This leads some to say that Ethereum represents decentralized innovation where Bitcoin is a safe investment choice. However, this doesn\u2019t always settle the question of choosing between these two crypto platforms.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum: how to make the choice?\n\nThe choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly depends on your investment goals and your risk tolerance as an investor. Generally, Bitcoin is a good option if you\u2019re looking to preserve value, due to its stability and reputation as a safe asset.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for growth opportunities, Ethereum might be particularly attractive because of its potential for innovation and its diversity of applications. This characteristic makes it an undisputed solution in terms of application development, due to its structure that\u2019s especially suitable for deploying dApps in a relevant way.\n\nEither way, these two crypto platforms share one common factor. As with the majority of cryptocurrencies, they are subject to high volatility and face uncertain regulations in many regions around the world. Even though Bitcoin features a more established technology while Ethereum is constantly evolving with regular updates.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum will depend on your investor profile and your long-term goals. Hence the need to do your own research beforehand to take into account your particularities in terms of crypto investment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Starknet has announced its much-anticipated STRK token airdrop will officially start on February 20. The token distribution aims to decentralize the network and empower community governance.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation plans to airdrop 728 million STRK tokens to over 1.3 million eligible Ethereum wallets that interact. They will have until June 20 to claim the tokens.\n\nThe Starknet Provisions Program is designed for a broad distribution of STRK to those who\u2019ve substantially contributed to Starknet.\n\n\n\nHere are a few relevant details:\n\n\n\n\u27281.3 million addresses.\n\n\n\n\u272850% of the token distributed to Starknet users.\n\n\n\n\u2728Ethereum stakers until the Merge,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mANrSYHeG9 \u2014 Starknet \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Starknet) February 14, 2024\n\nStarknet leverages zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable fast and low-cost transactions while ensuring validity on the Ethereum mainnet. The network boasts Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, meaning dApps can deploy on Starknet using Cairo or Solidity code. Developers gain increased speed at lower costs.\n\nAs Starknet decentralizes with its token, the community can contribute more directly to governance decisions. Network participants also gain opportunities to help secure layer 2 through currently developing staking mechanisms.\n\nThe upcoming airdrop distribution aims to encourage broader engagement and kickstart a robust token economy. With Starknet processing over 50% of all layer-2 transactions, the launch of STRK may mark a significant milestone as ZK-rollups continue gaining market share.\n\nStarknet\u2019s combination of scalability, security, and usability presents a promising layer-2 solution amidst Ethereum\u2019s ongoing challenges with congestion and fees. The network hopes wider access to STRK will help further its capabilities and adoption."

Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported.\u201d\n\nThe digital asset had a lukewarm response to the listing, as it is trading for $4.91 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease over the last 24 hours.\n\nRender used to be an Ethereum-based (ETH) token, but it switched over to Solana in late 2023. According to Jules Urbach, the project\u2019s founder, the move greatly enhanced the utility of the protocol.\n\nSays Urbach,\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it will be supporting both the Solana and Ethereum versions of the asset, noting that the tokens have slightly different names across blockchains.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will support trading of the Render token on both Ethereum and Solana networks.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gaming community, as well as Ethereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales, are now directing their attention towards novel cryptocurrencies.\n\nDeeStream (DST) emerged as a blockchain project poised to revolutionize the live streaming industry. They perceive it as having the potential to experience a significant surge in value. This article delves into the reasons behind this growing interest and exploration of DeeStream (DST).\n\nSupporters of DeeStream (DST) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) to continue a bullish run?\n\nEthereum (ETH) recently concluded a bullish rally, experiencing an approximately 11% surge from $2361 to $2631 over the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis rally has contributed to Ethereum's notable performance, further evidenced by a substantial increase in trading volume, nearly doubling recently. The surge in volume signals investor confidence in the sustainability of this bullish trend.\n\nBinance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges\n\nDespite a modest over 6% increase in the past month, with prices rising from $303.94 to $323.22, Binance Coin (BNB) appears disconnected from the ongoing crypto rally, reflected in its relatively low uptick in trading volume compared to Ethereum (ETH). This divergence suggests that Binance\u2019s (BNB) gains may not be attributed to the broader market rally.\n\nThese developments occur against the backdrop of Binance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges and the recent criminal sentencing of its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The impact of these events is palpable in the market, as evidenced by Binance's (BNB) recent displacement from its market capitalization position by Solana (SOL).\n\nDeeStream (DST) welcomes new supporters\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales are turning their attention towards the presale of DeeStream (DST), a novel decentralized streaming platform poised to disrupt the industry. Unlike centralized platforms like Kick and Twitch, DeeStream (DST) offers a decentralized model that empowers token holders through its governance system. As the live-streaming market is projected to soar to a valuation of $247 billion by 2027, DeeStream (DST) holds a significant first-mover advantage in this burgeoning sector.\n\nStreamers can seamlessly join the platform by completing a straightforward registration process and sharing their channel link with fans. In addition to earning revenue through Dee gifts, subscriptions, and packages, streamers benefit from fan engagement, while fans can participate in reward programs and earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks and reaching milestones. Moreover, the platform offers a swap service enabling users to exchange various cryptocurrencies with zero commission charges, facilitating seamless transactions globally.\n\nInvestors keen on participating in the presale , currently underway for just $0.035."

Its market value exceeded $1 trillion, marking a significant achievement not witnessed since November 2021. A firm close above $52,700 is expected to open the door for a potential climb to $60,000 and beyond. If this trend persists, Bitcoin is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of $69,000 very soon.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cBitcoin hits $52.5k as any doubts that bears had for a return from the $50k mark were shattered because of significant buying interest from institutional investors. Blackrock alone now holds more than 100,000 BTC. The next resistance for BTC is however not very far away and a small retracement can be expected around the $53k mark. ETH (+6%) on the other hand also broke past $2.8k as it went back to May 2022 levels. Ethereum is currently in high demand from staking and re-staking derivatives in the market. If ETH and BTC do not see a heavy correction, an altcoin season might be on the cards as we approach the bitcoin halving in April.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin surged to $52,000, reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap after 26 months, hinting at further gains. Despite a Tuesday dip below $50,000 on U.S. inflation data, BTC bounced back. The rally pushed BTC's market value past $1 trillion for the first time since Dec. 2021, rising 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 6%, while Ethereum (ETH) reached $2,750, its highest since May 2022. Bullish sentiment persists, targeting $75,000, fueled by robust inflows into U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs, including BlackRock's IBIT. Analysts foresee BTC's uptrend with a key support level of $46,000 but caution about slowing momentum.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's rally above $50,000 this week saw most long-term holders profit, despite the recent market decline following the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Glassnode's analysis suggests that this decline was a typical bull market correction. Long-term holders are selling their coins, partly due to the ETF craze and the outflow of Bitcoin Trust in the grayscale. However, newer bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity and others have attracted over $10 billion, offsetting the selling pressure. With less than 13% of total supply still in the red and strong trading volumes for new ETFs, the worst of Grayscale's selloff may be behind us.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Total Crypto Market has increased by 5% from the last day to $1.95 trillion, fueled by a new Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) again for this year. The market optimism around Bitcoin halving continues as Bitcoin has regained a $1 trillion market cap above $52,000 and is just 30% away from ATH. One event investors should pay close attention to is the recent Genesis court approval to redeem its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings valued at $1.3 billion and potential impacts on the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cThe crypto market continues to rise, with Bitcoin and Ethereum hitting their highest points of the year. This growth is fueled by increased investments in Bitcoin spot ETFs and positive sentiment about the upcoming halving event. For Bitcoin to keep climbing, it needs to close above $52,000. Likewise, Ethereum aims to break the $2,900 barrier on its way to $3,300. Alts have also started showing strength, tokens like STX and IMX have surged by over 25% in just a few days.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to remain stable within the $49,000 range early Tuesday. Other top coins, including the likes of \u2014 Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor losses across the board. The PYTH token emerged as the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of over 15 percent.

Despite a dip to $48,000, it has bounced back to $49,500, showcasing a bullish trend. If Bitcoin maintains levels above $49,000 this week, the potential for growth to $50,000 and beyond is likely; otherwise, a correction within the $46,000-$48,000 range might occur.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cAfter crossing $50k early yesterday for a brief period of time, BTC corrected for about 2.5% due to the US CPI data for January where CPI print came higher than expected. The January report showed 3.1% year-on-year inflation as compared to the expectation of 2.9% which directly had an impact on the chances of rate cuts in May. Market participants now see a 34% chance of a rate cut as compared to 51% before this data became public. Since $50k is a major psychological resistance, it would be interesting to see whether BTC corrects further down. On the other hand, as crypto fear and greed hit its highest levels since Nov 2021, we are seeing the crypto market rally. In altcoin news, SOL(-1.89%) briefly overtook BNB as the 4th largest crypto by market cap, with its market being in touching distance of $50 billion. If BTC continues the rally or even starts consolidating near the current price levels, we could see great gains in fundamentally solid altcoins.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cOn Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $50,000 in response to a US inflation report that exceeded expectations, affecting projections for interest-rate cuts. The leading cryptocurrency faced a 2% downturn, sliding from an initial $50,000 to $48,700, rebounding to $49,600 afterward. In contrast, SOL exhibited increased resilience, achieving a gain of over 1%. Analysts urged vigilance concerning market optimism, highlighting that the inflation data hindered Bitcoin's rally shortly after surpassing the $50,000 threshold on Monday.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin fell below $49,000 after the release of stronger-than-expected US CPI data, dampening expectations of a rate cut. With US government bond yields and the rising dollar index, Bitcoin has faced selling pressure along with stocks and gold. However, the withdrawal may be short-lived. Spot inflows into Bitcoin ETFs remain strong, suggesting sustainable demand despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Additionally, with the upcoming supply halving and the continued influx of spot ETFs, bullish sentiment remains. Options data indicated rising investor optimism, while potential safe-haven demand amid concerns over US regional banks could further support bitcoin. Thus, declines are seen as buying opportunities, with a retest of the all-time highs at $69,000 likely in the near future.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Crypto market experienced a slight correction as Bitcoin made a pull back to $49,000 level. The next few days could see a decrease in Bitcoin Dominance and the start of a bullish trend for Ethereum and Altcoins. At the same time the Bitcoin ETF inflows have continued to increase making the demand for Bitcoin 10x more than the supply coming from miners. We may witness a continuation of the bullish trend until the halving in April this year.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the release of US CPI data showing 3.1% versus the forecasted 2.9% caused BTC to drop by almost $2000 to the $48,000 level. However, it managed to recover slightly. This drop also impacted altcoins, which fell by more than 5%, with some recovering afterward. Additionally, NASDAQ experienced a decline of more than 1.5%. Technically, BTC saw a daily bearish candle close after eight consecutive days of green candle closes. While this isn't necessarily a sign of reversal yet, BTC needs to maintain its position above $49,000 and clear the $51,850 level. On the other hand, ETH/BTC bounced back from its support level, suggesting that we may see ETH outperforming BTC for the next few days.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

It serves its role as just a cryptocurrency, earning high esteem among crypto enthusiasts for its significant worth and the distinct investment opportunities it offers. Recently, Ethereum has gained spotlight following spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. In 2023, while the US crypto market was focused on Bitcoin ETFs, Blackrock\u2019s proposal for an Ethereum-based ETF shifted the spotlight to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. This shift, alongside a positive market trend and a crypto rally in late October, helped Ethereum\u2019s value surpass $2,000, a significant milestone it hadn\u2019t reached in months. Ethereum\u2019s rise was further triggered after the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, leading to a peak in Ethereum\u2019s value in nearly two years by January 12. Looking ahead, Ethereum is set for notable upgrades with the upcoming Deneb and Cancun updates. The Dencun upgrade is particularly significant, introducing proto-danksharding to improve network scalability, reduce gas fees for users, and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, paving the way for more efficient cross-chain interactions. Amid all these, our Ethereum price prediction aims to explore the future trend of ETH price with in-depth technical analysis to offer profitable investment opportunities. Looking for crypto with more potential than Ethereum? Explore our guide to the best crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum And Its Use Cases\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015, revolutionized blockchain technology by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) beyond just supporting cryptocurrencies. It introduced its native coin, Ether (commonly referred to as Ethereum or ETH), which is used for transactions on the blockchain. [ccpw id=60480] can be traded, staked for blockchain contributions, and was initially part of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, where complex computations added blocks to the blockchain. However, this system was environmentally costly, using more energy annually than Kazakhstan, and led to slow, congested transactions.\n\nAnd we finalized!\n\n\n\nHappy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nTo address these issues, [ccpw id=60480] transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020, allowing holders to add blocks based on their ETH holdings. This shift, known as The Merge, was completed on September 15, 2022, making the network more efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Hype And Current Status\n\nCurrently, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs operational, the crypto community is speculating about the potential approval and timing of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the situation is complex. The SEC has not clarified if ether qualifies as a security, a determination that could impede an ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was contentious, narrowly passing with a one-vote margin, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s vote. Gensler emphasized that this approval does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin by the SEC and should not be interpreted as openness to approving crypto asset securities in general.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nThese factors, among others, have led to mixed opinions about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved soon. While banks generally view such approval as improbable, crypto experts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook.\n\nProponents expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval this year draw parallels to the recent approval process of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMatt Kunke, a research analyst at the crypto market making firm GSR, predicts a 75% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in May. His optimism is based on Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals victory and the subsequent green light for Ethereum Futures ETF. He believes these developments indicate that a spot Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nKunke also noted that if the SEC rejects the current spot Ethereum ETF applications in May, an appeal is likely to follow. In such a scenario, he suggests that the SEC might choose the easier route of approval, while still maintaining a cautious approach towards other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC has recently postponed Grayscale Investments\u2019 request to transform its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision came just a day after the SEC similarly deferred BlackRock\u2019s application for a comparable ETF proposal.\n\nMarket sentiment has shown a degree of optimism regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF by May 23, the deadline set by the SEC for the Ark 21Shares application. However, according to JPMorgan (JPM), the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by this date is estimated to be no higher than 50%.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Price History\n\n[ccpw id=60480] price history has seen significant fluctuations. Launching at around $2.77 in 2015, it surpassed $10 in 2016 but faced setbacks due to a hack. In 2017, it crossed $100 and briefly went over $1,000 in early 2018 during a crypto bubble, then stabilized around $300 for the next three years.\n\nIn early 2021, Ethereum\u2019s price surged, nearly reaching $4,000 in May. Despite a summer dip, it rebounded, partly driven by the NFT craze. [ccpw id=60480] hit a record high of $4,891.70 in November as [ccpw id=60415] also soared.\n\n2022 was challenging for crypto, with Ethereum nearly falling below $1,000 despite the successful completion of The Merge.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum saw a period of recovery, surpassing the $2,000 mark in April for the first time in almost a year. However, it experienced a downturn in early June, dropping to $1,624.14 by June 15. The market then rebounded, and following a decision that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security on exchanges, Ethereum peaked at $2,026.20 on July 14.\n\nBy December 9, Ethereum\u2019s value climbed to $2,401.76, the highest since May 2022. On December 13, it was trading around $2,180. The price peaked again at $2,445.02 on December 28, before closing the year at $2,281.47. However, Ethereum started this year on a bearish note as spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event in the market, plunging ETH price toward the $2,100 level.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Technical Analysis\n\nEther gained momentum after it surpassed the $2,400 resistance level, showcasing strong buying interest from investors. Over the last few hours, ETH price faced strong buying pressure near the $2,700 level and knocked the $2,830 level; however, it faced resistance from the bears. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,802, surging over 1.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nInvestors are currently attempting to hold the price beyond the $2,800 resistance, indicating a continuation of the upward trend. Should the buyers maintain the upward trend above immediate Fib channels, the ETH/USDT pair might surge to the key $3,000 mark. At this level, short-term traders could begin to take profits and trigger a correction.\n\nThe pressure is increasing on the bears. To plunge the bullish momentum, they must lower and keep the price under the EMA20 trend line. If successful, the pair could retreat to the $2,600 level and might prepare for a retest of the $2,400 level. However, this support zone will likely attract buyers to accumulate more ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction By Blockchain Reporter\n\nYears Minimum ($) Average ($) Maximum ($) 2024 1,336.16 2,802.23 3,694.71 2025 4,724.31 4,851.80 5,044.96 2026 6,432.54 6,864.13 7,024.51 2027 8,436.93 8,610.28 9,225.42 2028 7,356.01 7,853.56 8,372.82 2029 10,476.50 11,116.55 11,267.95 2030 14,884.16 15,434.11 15,892.40 2031 21,468.24 21,708.27 23,002.47 2032 30,257.37 30,703.18 31,393.21 2033 41,282.84 42,125.08 42,202.84\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nIn 2024, the price of 1 Ethereum is expected to attain a minimum level of $1,336.16.

The technical indicators used by Coincodex suggest a current Bearish sentiment, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a Neutral stance at 49. In the past 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 40% green days, showing a 5.25% price volatility.\n\nCoincodex\u2019s analysis currently advises against purchasing Ethereum. Their forecast, considering historical price trends of Ethereum and Bitcoin halving cycles, estimates the yearly low for Ethereum in 2025 to be around $2,161.48. However, they also predict that Ethereum\u2019s price could soar up to $6,389.27 in the following year.\n\nVanEck, a prominent global investment fund house, holds a bullish stance on Ethereum, viewing it as a \u201ctriple-point asset\u201d that serves as a capital asset, a consumer asset, and a store of value. VanEck believes that, under favorable conditions, Ethereum\u2019s market cap could surpass $2 trillion.\n\nBen Ritchie, the managing director of Digital Capital Management, forecasts that Ethereum could potentially end the year at around $2,500, provided positive developments continue.\n\nWell-known cryptocurrency blogs such as Gov Capital and Traders Union also share a bullish outlook on Ethereum. Gov Capital predicts Ethereum\u2019s value could reach $7,200 by 2025. Anton Kharitonov, an analyst at Traders Union, anticipates that Ethereum could be trading at about $6,196.08 by the end of 2025, with the potential to increase to $31,656.34 by 2030.\n\nIs Ethereum A Good Investment? When To Buy?\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s future performance is challenging. The cryptocurrency has shown strong buying confidence, recovering well from the news of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. Additionally, Ethereum is progressing with new upgrades and there\u2019s rising speculation about a potential spot Ethereum ETF, which has positively influenced its price.\n\nHowever, the much-anticipated Merge, expected to significantly enhance Ethereum, did not have a substantial impact on its price. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also means that Ethereum\u2019s value could decrease at any moment. It\u2019s noteworthy that Bitcoin\u2019s value declined following the approval of its spot ETFs last week.\n\nConversely, the increasing amount of Ethereum being staked indicates that The Merge has been technically successful and well-received in the community. It is suggested to invest in ETH at a price of $1,800-$1,900 for a solid return in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, renowned as a technologically advanced and established cryptocurrency, is poised to maintain its leading position in the altcoin market in the upcoming years, as indicated by the aforementioned Ethereum price prediction. Differing from Bitcoin, Ethereum functions as a utility token. While its price is significantly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s movements and broader macroeconomic factors, Ethereum\u2019s value is also affected by a variety of crypto-specific elements.\n\nAdditionally, the trends in cryptocurrency and equity markets typically exhibit parallel movements. However, over the past year, these markets have shown a divergence. For instance, numerous tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) have reached all-time highs, while the cryptocurrency sector continues to experience a bear market.\n\nRecent improvements in macroeconomic conditions, like the slowdown in inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s pause on interest rate hikes, have not led to a corresponding positive impact on cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum. This raises questions about the factors influencing the crypto market\u2019s reaction to these economic changes.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced Ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency used for transactions on its network. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is notable for enabling decentralized applications (DApps) and transitioning to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.\n\nWhat are Ethereum ETFs and their current status? Ethereum ETFs are proposed exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum. The current status is uncertain, as the SEC has not yet approved any Ethereum ETFs, and their potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s value and the broader crypto market is a subject of speculation.\n\nWhat factors could influence Ethereum\u2019s price in the future? Ethereum\u2019s price could be influenced by various factors including market trends, technological upgrades like Deneb and Cancun, regulatory decisions, the outcome of Ethereum ETFs, and overall investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Ether price crossed $2,800 on February 15th for the first time since early 2022, nearing its historic peak above $4,900 reached in late 2021.\n\nThe recent rally has been driven by a confluence of factors \u2013 anticipation of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the US, increasing levels of staking participation locking up circulating supply, and overall positive market sentiment.\n\nTLDR\n\nEther (ETH) price breaks above $2,700 on Feb 15, 2024 for the first time since May 2022 as traders anticipate potential approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US\n\nSeveral major financial firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Ark Invest have filed for a spot ETH ETF which could significantly boost institutional demand\n\n25% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply is now locked in the ETH 2.0 staking contracts as investors deposit more ETH to earn staking rewards of ~4% per year\n\nOver 943,000 validators are now active on the Ethereum Beacon Chain as staking participation continues to increase, improving network security\n\nAnalysts predict ETH price could rapidly approach its all-time high around $5,000 if bullish momentum continues, with $3,500 as a key medium-term target\n\nSeveral major financial services firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock and Ark Invest have already secured regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2023.\n\nThey are now racing to launch the first spot ETH ETF, which would open the floodgates for trillions in institutional capital to invest directly into the asset.\n\nThe SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs helped propel BTC price over $50k this year. Market participants expect a similar impact on ETH prices if spot ETH ETFs get the green light.\n\nIn parallel, staking participation on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain continues to steadily rise. 25% of the total circulating supply of ETH is now locked up in staking deposits, reducing sell-side pressure.\n\nOver 943,000 validators are actively participating in the consensus process on Ethereum as it transitions to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nValidators earn ~4% annual yield as rewards for their capital locked up as collateral, creating a passive income stream that has boosted participation.\n\nAs staking levels increase, so does the security of the chain making 51% attacks virtually impossible due to the cost associated with obtaining such a large chunk of ETH supply.\n\nETH\u2019s pivot to proof-of-stake is also environmentally sustainable, in line with institutional investors and funds growing focus on ESG mandates. This makes it likely the SEC greenlights spot Ether ETFs.\n\nWith consoldiation around the $2,800 levels, analysts say ETH looks poised to challenge its historic peak around $5,000 later in 2024.\n\nKey target levels on the way up are $3,500 which was the April 2022 top, and $4,200 which marked the pre-crypto winter peak in November 2022.\n\nContinued spikes in staking deposits locking up ETH supply, approval of spot ETH ETFs allowing new institutional capital inflows, as well as broader crypto bull run returning could be the perfect storm that sees Ether trade firmly into 5 digits for the first time ever."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can it reach $10,000 in 2024? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The Ethereum price is currently moving up quickly in the slipstream of the Bitcoin price and has been able to surpass the $2,600 mark again in the last few days . With the recent increases, there is a chance that the Ethereum price can reach new all-time highs in the coming months. Can the Ethereum price even rise to $10,000 by the end of 2024? How has the Ethereum price moved in the last few weeks? The Ethereum price has risen significantly in the last few weeks. In mid-October, the Ethereum price was still at $1,600. Then the price rose extremely sharply at the end of 2023. In mid-January, Ethereum was able to break through the $2,600 mark.\n\nIn the last few weeks we saw a significant consolidation and the price fell back to the $2,200 mark. But another bull run over the last two weeks brought the Ethereum price back above $2,600. Can the ETH price rise consistently in the coming months? The year 2024 has so far been dominated by the crypto bull run. The Bitcoin price is rising massively in anticipation of the halving. Especially as Bitcoin prices continue to rise, the prices of altcoins could rise even more in percentage terms. While many coins are highly speculative, a rise in Ethereum is still the safest behind Bitcoin. Another point that could cause the Ethereum price to explode is a possible Ethereum ETF. However, many regulatory questions still need to be clarified. Whether the ETH price rises more strongly, equally or slightly weaker than the Bitcoin price, a rally in 2024 is likely. Can the ETH price rise to $10,000 at the end of 2024? The Ethereum price could well see a new all-time high in 2024. This is above the $4,800 mark. This puts us over 50% of the all-time high at the moment. The road to $5,000 might not be far."

        "title": "Ethereum at $3200 and New Crypto Pandoshi, Currently at $0.01, to Reach $1 in Q1, Expert Traders Say - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has awoken from its slumber as analysts predict a surge to $3,200, driven by strong fundamentals of shrinking supply and rising demand. At the same time, the new crypto Pandoshi, currently priced at just $0.01, is poised to reach $1 in Q1 2024, according to expert traders.\n\nEthereum Fundamentals Fueling Next Leg Up\n\nOver 25% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now locked in staking platforms, greatly reducing the amount available for trading or investing. This supply shock comes alongside a burning mechanism reducing ETH supply by 0.21% per year. Already, 357,148 ETH valued at $947 million has been burned since The Merge.\n\nAdditional bullish factors boosting demand include the upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs and the March deployment of EIP-4844, which will significantly lower layer-2 gas fees.\n\n\u201cThis is the most basic law of economics. If demand is increasing, and supply is decreasing, then the price has no choice but to pump,\u201d said one crypto analyst.\n\nWith strong technicals and fundamentals in place, analysts predict Ethereum breaking out above $3,200 in short order.\n\nPandoshi Targets $1 Price Level\n\nPandoshi has ignited interest in the crypto market at just $0.01 per token in its rapidly selling out presale. The deflationary cryptocurrency implements a buy and burn mechanism through its PandoshiSwap decentralized exchange and its prepaid crypto cards, Cardoshi. These platforms continuously raise demand for the PAMBO token while reducing the circulating supply.\n\nAt the core of Pandoshi lies the PandaChain proof-of-stake blockchain, optimized for fast, affordable transactions. PandaChain enables frictionless interoperability between ecosystem products, including the DEX, wallet, and crypto debit cards.\n\nFollowing the end of its presale, Pandoshi will list its native token, PAMBO, on two prominent centralized exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. These tier-one exchange listings deliver instant accessibility for both retail and institutions. The token will also be available for decentralized trading on Uniswap.\n\n\u201cGetting listed on Coinbase and Binance guarantees Pandoshi exposure to tens of millions of active traders,\u201d said industry analyst Thomas Wayne. \u201cConsidering its ecosystem and tokenomics, a dollar valuation is reasonable. Pandoshi at one cent is a lotto pick.\u201d\n\nWith Phase 5 presale nearly sold out, only 7% of the PAMBO token supply allocated to presale remains available. 1 billion of the 2 billion PAMBO tokens were made available for presale buyers at the start of the campaign.\n\nAs the maxim goes, the best projects are listed on the best exchanges. By targeting listings on Coinbase, Binance, and Uniswap, Pandoshi continues to gain credibility while offering almost unlimited growth potential at its current $0.01 price discovery phase.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Ethereum fundamentals firmly in place to support a surge to $3,200, now is an opportune time for investors to gain exposure. In tandem, ultra-low priced Pandoshi presents asymmetric upside at just $0.01, with $1 in sight, according to expert analyst projections.\n\nThe dual opportunities in Ethereum and Pandoshi demonstrate crypto\u2019s wealth generating potential in 2023 and beyond.\n\nClick Here To Buy PAMBO Tokens\n\nExplore the following links for detailed information on Pandoshi (PAMBO):\n\nWebsite: https://pandoshi.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.pandoshi.com/\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
