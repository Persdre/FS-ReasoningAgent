        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: the clash between titans - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article, we compare two leading blockchains in the cryptographic sector: Solana vs Ethereum.\n\nBoth have very developed DeFi ecosystems and a wide range of successful applications built within them.\n\nThe two networks work together to create the most thriving web3 environment possible, with the goal of becoming the premier layer of the on-chain future.\n\nThe challenge is also played out on the token level, with ETH and SOL trying to offer the best return on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s see everything in detail below.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: the main differences on the technological level\n\nWe are talking about one of the most heated and intense clashes on the technological front of the last decade, as well as the most discussed in the crypto landscape: the Solana vs Ethereum war.\n\nEveryone knows by now that these two blockchains have been in conflict for years to win the title of dominant web3 infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, however, they are quite different in many aspects: Ethereum is an EVM network built with the programming language Solidity while Solana is SVM built with C, C++ and Rust.\n\nThis alone is enough to distinguish two poles in which the development of decentralized applications takes place according to different coding rules.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d also changes significantly depending on the context, whether it is used in an Ethereum or Solana environment.\n\nIn fact, on Ethereum the term account is used to describe an entity that owns ether (ETH) and can initiate transactions. It is classified as follows:\n\nEOA (Externally Owned Account): account in possession of a private key, conceptually similar to a wallet;\n\nCA (Contract Account): account for smart contracts not in possession of a private key.\n\nSimplifying, we can say that EOA does not have storage space and therefore cannot be used as a contract for carrying out operations (except for exceptions with ERC-4337).\n\nThe CA, on the other hand, is simply a software program executable by EVM with a code (contract) that distinguishes it. An EOA can therefore execute a call through CA but not vice versa!\n\nOn the opposite front of Solana, however, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d is broader and refers to an entity that can always store and save data.\n\nThe state of transactions is therefore saved using accounts in a manner similar to what happens in operating systems like Linux. It is worth noting that Solana natively supports the account-abstraction function, allowing self-calling between programs.\n\nThe accounts in Solana are of two types:\n\nExecutable account (program account): smart contracts called \u201cprograms\u201d that store the code;\n\nNon-executable account (data account): entities that can receive tokens or data but cannot execute code.\n\nBelow is a map of the main technical differences.\n\nTwo different approaches for the development of DeFi environments\n\nDescending to a less technical level, we notice that Ethereum and Solana use different marketing approaches for their respective DeFi environments.\n\nAlthough both chains are intent on attracting the widest possible base of capital and users, they focus on different segments.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum presents a more \u201cinstitutional\u201d character with its main values oriented towards the security of the network and decentralization.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has a more \u201csmart\u201d personality, oriented towards the scalability of operations and cryptographic efficiency.\n\nThey follow the limits of both blockchains on their own: for Ethereum scalability, for Solana decentralization.\n\nLIVE NOW \u2014 Ethereum vs. Solana\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the debate we\u2019re having today. On Ethereum\u2019s side, we have @Ethereum Researcher @drakefjustin, and on the @Solana side, we have Solana\u2019s Co-Founder @aeyakovenko\n\n\n\nThey give us the good, the bad, and the ugly of each other\u2019s blockchain,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MlCWd4NtOT \u2014 Bankless (@BanklessHQ) June 3, 2024\n\nEthereum presents a TVL of 59 billion dollars, much greater than Solana\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars. For this reason, the Foundation uses a softer communication with the public and with less intention to create engagement.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, focuses entirely on innovation, user experience, and transaction throughput. The latest innovations launched, such as the Saga smartphone and the Blinks, speak volumes about the approach the network uses with retail.\n\nWe can say that Ethereum is a less performant blockchain, at times less \u201cconvenient\u201d, but more secure and reliable.\n\nSolana is much more \u201cfun\u201d and efficient to use, but less decentralized based on a few clients and less secure.\n\nIf you are high-net-worth individuals with a moderate risk exposure, you will surely appreciate Ethereum more.\n\nIf you are young, fearless, and have a limited budget, you will probably find the features of Solana more appealing.\n\nThe main web3 dapps of the two ecosystems\n\nThe war between the two titans Ethereum and Solana continues uniquely in the creation of the best decentralized web3 applications.\n\nOn Ethereum the largest dapp in terms of TVL is the liquid staking platform Lido: it alone attracts almost 10 times the entire capital absorbed by Solana.\n\nNext, we find successful dapps such as EigenLayer, Aave, Maker, Ether.fi, Uniswap, RocketPool, Ethena, and Pendle.\n\nIn the suite of protocols of Solana, we find Jito as the top-ranked, with a TVL of 1.74 billion dollars. Then the most used applications are Marinade, Kamino, Sanctum, Jupiter, Marginfi, Drift, BlazeStake, Meteora, and Solend.\n\nThe majority of Ethereum dapps are integrated with various layer-2, ensuring greater scalability. At the same time, the differentiation of blockspace requests leads to a fragmentation of liquidity, which is often inconvenient.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum is often criticized by its detractors because as a Settlement Layer it has to rely on external solutions to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, the competitor is criticized for the absence of a flourishing and secure DeFi ecosystem: almost all the dapps on Ethereum surpass the total TVL of Solana!\n\nIn any case, it is worth noting how Solana is producing very interesting products, such as the recent platform pump.fun.\n\nProposed as a launchpad for memecoin, in a short time it managed to become the most profitable dapp in the entire cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nOn July 1st, it recorded record fees of 2 million dollars, even surpassing the entire revenue of the whole Ethereum blockchain.\n\nChapeau.\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking Big: @pumpdotfun Becomes No. 1 Crypto App Across All Chainshttps://t.co/VS31GZ2FXq has surged to the top spot as the leading crypto app, surpassing Ethereum with a staggering $1.99M in revenue generated over the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/59euyqCRWp \u2014 SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 2, 2024\n\nA speculative war: Solana with SOL vs Ethereum with ETH\n\nThe Solana vs Ethereum challenge can only conclude with a focus on their respective gas tokens SOL and ETH.\n\nIt is clear that the better these cryptocurrencies perform on a speculative level, the more users are interested in purchasing them and becoming part of the community.\n\nThe metric of active addresses and the volume of transactions, in fact, largely depends on the evolution of the price of SOL and ETH.\n\nBoth networks are interested in pushing the price of their respective coins upwards, both for a boost in on-chain metrics and for obvious economic reasons.\n\nIn 2024 the two coins recorded similar trends, with a growth of about 50% from the January quotations. SOL, however, grew at a faster pace in the last quarter of 2023, attracting more new buyers compared to what Ethereum did.\n\n>>Solana Vs Ethereum in 2024\n\n\n\nSolana is Winning by Huge Data Growth Margin\n\n\n\nGrowth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 Price\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Volume/Marketcap\n\n\u2013 TVL/Fees\n\n\u2013 NFT Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Transactions/ Daily Active Addresses\n\n\n\nEthereum Growth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 DEX Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Volume pic.twitter.com/Q8GV7mQ9Jy \u2014 hitesh.eth (@hmalviya9) May 30, 2024\n\nAt the moment both SOL and ETH are close to their respective all-time highs, with the latter seeming slightly advantaged.\n\nThe evolution of the prices of the two coins from now until the end of the bull market will be essential to bring more adoption to blockchain technology.\n\nPlaying a decisive role in the coming months will also be the upcoming inauguration of the spot ETFs for the two cryptocurrencies. First that of Ethereum, then (perhaps) that of Solana, will contribute to attracting more capital inflows.\n\nAt stake is the dominance as a settlement layer for the major financial operations of the cryptographic world.\n\nIt is not certain, however, that in the future only one network between Solana and Ethereum will survive, and indeed a coexistence scenario is much more likely.\n\nObviously, there will be a network that will have a larger market share but without precluding the existence of the other\n\nETH vs SOL\n\n\n\nDONT BE A MAXI.\n\n\n\nThe world is gonna be multi-chains!\n\n\n\nStop wasting time arguing about which one is better, and start learning about all the benefits and use cases each bring.\n\n\n\nMore ETFs will grow the pie!\n\nETF products will bring attention and money into the space.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MdtTDdCf7X \u2014 Gun (Kingbund.eth) (@KingBund) July 2, 2024\n\nAlthough in a perspective of coexistence, the dispute between the maximalists will continue for many years to come.\n\nAs we can learn from the historical Pepsi vs Coca Cola discount that has been ongoing for over 100 years, the fight for supremacy is always around the corner."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Holds at $3K but is Another Crash Imminent? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently experienced increased selling activity, breaching the 100-day moving average and leading to a substantial decline toward the 200-day MA.\n\nNevertheless, the price faces a significant support region, possibly leading to a temporary period of consolidation correction in the mid-term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that after an extended period of corrective retracements near the crucial 100-day moving average at $3386, sellers ultimately gained control, leading to a break below this key MA.\n\nGiven that this area was filled with buying interest and demand, the breach caused a notable long liquidation cascade, accelerating the bearish momentum. As a result, the price plummeted toward the substantial 200-day moving average of $3096 and breached it.\n\nThis price action clearly indicates a bearish sentiment in the market, with sellers dominating. However, Ethereum is currently hovering around the crucial and decisive support region of $3K and is expected to undergo a period of consolidation before initiating its next major move. If a pullback to the broken 200-day MA occurs, the continuation of the bearish trend will become more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that following a period of sideways consolidation above the $3.3K support, the price ultimately faced aggressive selling activity and breached this crucial support region. This breakout led to a notable impulsive downtrend, indicating a long-squeeze event in the perpetual markets.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has landed on the substantial support region of $3K, which has previously supported the price multiple times. This area is likely filled with demand, potentially halting the downward pressures in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI indicator has dropped below 30, indicating potential short-term market correction before the next significant move. Hence, consolidation is likely in the short term, allowing the market to rest and regain momentum. In this scenario, the price range between 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels will be the main target for the corrective movements in the short term.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has recently seen a rise in selling activity, leading to a significant decline toward the critical $3K support zone.\n\nUnderstanding the key factors behind this rejection is crucial for predicting upcoming price movements. The accompanying chart highlights potential liquidation zones within Ethereum\u2019s price action, providing valuable insights for mid-term strategies by smart money.\n\nThe chart indicates a notable liquidity pool below the crucial $3K. This pool is filled with sell-stop orders from aggressive long positions that contributed to a significant price surge in mid-May. If sellers push the price below the $3K support zone, a massive long-squeeze is expected. This would trigger the sell-stop orders, accelerating the bearish momentum. Traders should closely monitor the price action around the $3K support zone in the upcoming days to determine the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend direction."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFranklin Templeton, a veteran wealth manager with over $1.65 trillion in AUM, shares its bullish take on Ethereum (ETH) as a tech development and economic instrument. Despite savage competition, Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized economy and constantly unlocks new opportunities for the community.\n\n\"Forefront of Web3 innovation\": Franklin Templeton praises Ethereum\n\nGlobal asset management heavyweight Franklin Templeton released its \"Understanding the Value of The Ethereum Network\" report covering the tech impact of the second cryptocurrency. It displays the most important features of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, its challenges and opportunities.\n\nImage by Franklin Templeton\n\nThe analysts of the investment giant stressed that Ethereum advanced Bitcoin\u2019s accomplishments to create a robust and accessible tech basis for distributed ledger applications, enabling a comprehensive decentralized economy.\n\nAs the next step, the onset of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its Solidity smart contracts has changed the narrative in app development, making Ethereum the foundation for a wide range of decentralized applications across various segments in B2B and B2C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report particularly highlights the scaling role of Layer 2 networks in pushing the barriers of Ethereum (ETH) performance metrics and decentralization status:\n\nCollectively, L1 blockchains (Ethereum and others) and L2 blockchains provide the foundations for \u201cWeb3,\u201d the new iteration of the World Wide Web (WWW) that enables users\u2019 WWW ownership. The Web3 business models that have emerged are paving the way for a new type of network economy and approach to commercial transactions, creating a protocol-based economy that encourages democratized ownership and rewards participation\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) managed to establish a vibrant, diversified protocol economy with a diverse array of novel use cases in DeFi, GameFi, NFT, metaverse and other trending segments.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Final call?\n\nAuthors concluded that Ethereum (ETH) stands out as unique combination of a native peer-to-peer payment network, a common developer toolkit and a virtual machine for executing smart contracts that has set a new standard for blockchain technology.\n\nIt should be added that Franklin Templeton is a participant of the Ethereum spot ETF race in the U.S. It filed with the SEC for an ETF approval in February 2024.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, major analysts and community participants are sure that Ethereum spot ETFs will be green-lit as soon as this month.\n\nThe final approval of S-1 forms is expected to happen by July 12, said The ETF Store president Nate Geraci. Potentially, this hints at ETF trading launch following on July 15."

        "content": "Sun 07 Jul 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nEthereum ETFs are about to get SEC approval, marking a major turning point in the crypto world. Even Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, seems to be in favor of this development. Discover how this approval could shake up the crypto markets and what it means for investors, according to John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn.\n\nInevitable Approval of Ethereum ETFs and Investor Rush\n\nEven Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is not against Ethereum ETFs. This says a lot about the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler, known for his caution, recognizes the growing importance of crypto assets in the global financial system.\n\nIt seems that the era of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\nJohn Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn, views this positively. According to him, the approval of ETH ETFs could not only legitimize Ethereum as an investment asset but also catalyze a new wave of institutional investments.\n\nGlover highlights that the approval of ETH ETFs could attract new investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market.\n\nHe also anticipates an increase in liquidity and price stability thanks to a better market structure.\n\nFurthermore, he sees this development as a way to reduce the often-criticized volatility of cryptos.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes with many expectations and fears.\n\nIf the approval of Ethereum ETFs materializes, it could very well mark the beginning of a new era where crypto assets are more seamlessly and securely integrated into traditional investment portfolios.\n\nJohn Glover\u2019s Opinion, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, on Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe Potential Impact on the Crypto Market\n\nThe arrival of Ethereum ETFs could significantly shake up the crypto ecosystem. John Glover explains that the impact of these ETFs on the market could be twofold.\n\nFirstly, they could bring a new wave of legitimacy to Ethereum, encouraging financial institutions to invest. Glover compares this situation to the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which significantly increased institutional interest and Bitcoin\u2019s price stability.\n\nHe believes that Ethereum ETFs could follow a similar trajectory, stimulating interest and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum ETFs could improve market liquidity in the crypto space. Glover asserts that this could result in reduced price volatility, a point often cited by cryptocurrency critics.\n\nWith more liquidity, sudden and erratic price movements would become less frequent, making Ethereum a more stable and attractive investment for conservative investors.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in liquidity could facilitate large-scale transactions, making the crypto market more efficient.\n\nFinally, Glover mentions that the approval of Ethereum ETFs could serve as a catalyst for other financial innovations in the crypto sector. For example, we could see the emergence of new financial products based on Ethereum, such as investment funds and more sophisticated derivatives.\n\nThis would help diversify and enrich the crypto ecosystem, attracting even more investors.\n\nGlover\u2019s Optimistic Projections\n\nJohn Glover is adamant: the approval of Ethereum ETFs is good news for the future of Ethereum and the crypto market in general. According to him, this approval could trigger a series of positive market reactions. For instance, K33 Research predicts 4 billion dollars in inflows in just 5 months.\n\nFirstly, it could reinforce Ethereum\u2019s position as a safe haven in the crypto universe. Institutional investors, who have already begun to show interest in cryptocurrencies, might see Ethereum as a viable option to diversify their portfolios.\n\nGlover also emphasizes that this dynamic could attract long-term investments, thereby increasing market stability. He predicts a rise in Ethereum prices in the medium and long term, once the ETFs are launched and adopted by the market. And this despite the recent declines of the crypto prince.\n\nFor Glover, the diversification of financial products based on Ethereum could also pave the way for greater innovation in the sector, with increasingly tailored solutions to the needs of institutional investors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Weekends are characterized by a drop in market activity until the following Monday. The lower trading volume and reduced liquidity over the weekend caused crypto assets to stabilize after a recent sell-off. The Bitcoin price found temporary support around $55,000, easing the sell pressure on altcoins. Ethereum price also showed renewed demand around $2900. However, with several analysts anticipating the Ethereum ETF launch around mid-July, there is potential for a major reversal in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAlso Read: Justin Sun Faces $66M Loss As Ethereum Records 10% Fall, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Analysis Hints $3800 Rally Amid Healthy Pullback and Potential ETF Approval\n\nThe current correction in Ethereum price was initiated in late May as the price reverted from $3974. This fresh lower-high formation of the daily chart indicates the buyers lack sufficient momentum to chase new highs, thus shifting the price trajectory sideways.\n\nThe bearish turnaround tumbled the Ether value by nearly 30% to seek support at the confluence of $1815 and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Along with broader market correction, the U.S. SEC\u2019s delay in approving ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts has contributed to bearish sentiment.\n\nOn Thursday, Bitwise filed an amended S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF ahead of the July 8th deadline. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that the SEC\u2019s recent comments required minimal updates, indicating a quick turnaround for Bitwise.\n\nHowever, the filing has no fee details yet, which are expected to be revealed next week. Bitwise\u2019s proactive filing suggests they are expediting the approval process for their Ethereum ETF.\n\nAlso Read: Altcoins To Stake Without Hesitation As Bitcoin Goes Burst\n\nMoreover, the President of the ETF Store Nate Geraci, has expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETFs will start trading within the next two weeks, mostly around the week of July 15th. Geraci also notes that the ETH price has dropped by over 20% since the unexpected 19b-4 approvals in late May.\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026 Later next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely.

A bullish breakout from the resistance is crucial to signal renewed recovery in the Ethereum coin.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nEMAs: The 200D EMA at $3080 and 100D Exponential Moving Average at $3330 highlight the immediate resistance against buyers.\n\nRSI: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dived to the oversold region below 30%, which could attract dip investors in the market.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

        "content": "While ETH\u2019s price dropped, whales deposited tokens worth millions of dollars\n\nFew metrics and indicators suggested that ETH was undervalued\n\nAs the crypto market witnessed a crash last week, the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], also fell victim to a massive price correction. Because of the price decline, many might have lost confidence in the token. However, the trend changed over the last few hours as ETH\u2019s daily chart soon turned green.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high volatility\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s price had dropped by more than 12% in just seven days. AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of IntoTheBlock\u2019s data also revealed that ETH\u2019s average balance dropped, which can be attributed to the token\u2019s double-digit price decline.\n\nIn the meantime, Lookonchain posted a tweet sharing an interesting development. According to the same, several whales started to sell ETH as its value fell. To be precise, three Ethereum whales deposited 28,558 ETH, worth over $82.2 million, to Binance. Soon after though, ETH\u2019s price registered a trend reversal on the charts.\n\nIn fact, the altcoin\u2019s price has appreciated by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,967.81 with a market capitalization of over $356 billion.\n\nHowever, despite the rise in price, its trading volume dropped by double digits. This suggested that ETH might not sustain its bullish momentum for long.\n\nWill ETH\u2019s bull rally last?\n\nLike the trading volume, a few other metrics also looked pretty bearish.\n\nFor instance, though ETH recorded a price hike, selling pressure on the token continued to remain high. This was evidenced by looking at CryptoQuant\u2019s data, with the same highlighting a rise in ETH\u2019s exchange reserves. Simply put, several investors chose to sell.\n\nNonetheless, other metrics supported the possibility of a sustained uptrend as well.\n\nFor example \u2013 ETH\u2019s funding rate has been rising, meaning that long-position traders have been dominant and may be willing to pay short-position traders. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI), as per CryptoQuant, was in the oversold zone too. This might help increase buying pressure in the coming days, which might in turn result in a price hike on the charts.\n\nOn top of that, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that EThereum\u2019s NVT ratio dropped sharply. A fall in this metric means that an asset is undervalued, which is generally followed by price hikes.\n\nWe then planned to have a look at ETH\u2019s daily chart to better understand what to expect. We found that ETH\u2019s price touched the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands \u2013 Underlining the chances of a rebound.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, its Money Flow Index (MFI) was also about to enter the oversold zone.\n\nHowever, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish, as at press time it had a value of -0.09."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Could See 25% More US Investors: Grayscale Survey - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s recent survey highlighted the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF could increase US investor interest in Ethereum by 25%.\n\nThis increase in interest is driven by economic concerns like inflation and worries about financial stability, particularly among younger individuals and minority communities. 40% of voters from the previous year desired to invest in cryptocurrency. Due to economic instability, that percentage has increased to 47% this year, indicating that more individuals are interested in digital assets.\n\nSource: Grayscale\n\nAccording to Grayscale\u2019s survey, many Americans are drawn to cryptocurrencies because they see them as a way to achieve financial stability and manage their expenses.\n\nEconomic worries have historically influenced crypto interest. Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply allows it to function like gold, acting as a store of value. Grayscale found that familiarity with cryptocurrencies increases the likelihood of seeing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and other macroeconomic events.\n\nDemographic Ownership Patterns\n\nNearly 70% of people surveyed said they own some form of investment and around 19% own cryptocurrencies. Men, Black and Hispanic voters, and younger people have higher ownership rates. Gen Z respondents, in particular, reported a 31% ownership rate, with many saying they are more interested in cryptocurrencies because of inflation.\n\nDespite the FTX crash, enthusiasm for crypto remains strong in the US. Approximately 40% of investors believe their future portfolios will include Bitcoin.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s data shows that cryptocurrency interest transcends political boundaries. Ownership rates are similar among Republicans (18%) and Democrats (19%). Voters are split on which party is more favorable to the crypto industry, with 30% believing both parties have a favorable stance on crypto policies.\n\nThis balanced interest aligns with recent bipartisan support in Congress for the resolution of SAB 121, enabling banks to serve as custodians for crypto, making it more accessible.\n\nPolitical Views on Crypto\n\nHowever, differences exist in how each party views the importance of crypto-related issues. Republican voters are more likely to prioritize inflation and the economy, with 54% compared to 33% of Democrats. Conversely, Democrats focus more on issues like gun violence, climate change, and income inequality.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ether prices continue to be affected by government sell-offs and Mt. Gox\u2019s repayment. Bitcoin has stabilized around $57,000, while Ether stands at $3,027 as of press time."
