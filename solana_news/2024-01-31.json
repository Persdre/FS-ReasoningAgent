        "title": "Ethereum developer interest hit new all-time highs in 2023 despite a bear market - TechCrunch",
        "content": "The global web3 developer space grew in 2023, according to a new report, regardless of the ongoing bear crypto market and regulatory headwinds in the U.S.\n\nIt was especially a home run for Ethereum, one of the most well-known layer-1 blockchains. The blockchain saw software developer kit (SDK) installs increase 31% year over year to 106.4 million downloads in 2023, up from 81.4 million in 2022, according to Alchemy\u2019s Web3 Development Report for 2023.\n\nThe total Ethereum SDK installs have increased consecutively over the past five years, the report said. The number included SDK packages like ethers, web3, hardhat, truffle, foundry, eth, alchemy-sdk, viem, userops and wagmi. In 2022, there was an overall increase in developer activity. A separate report by Electric Capital found that the number of monthly active crypto developers declined 25% last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see confirmation of the clich\u00e9 that bear markets are for building,\u201d Jason Windawi, protocol specialist at Alchemy, told TechCrunch+. \u201cDuring the depths [of the downturn] it was easy to wonder if that\u2019s true; we knew it was, but it\u2019s good to have this data to show that.\u201d\n\nThe global market capitalization of the crypto market rose 113.75% from roughly $800 billion at the beginning of 2023 to $1.71 trillion by the end of the year, according to CoinMarketCap data. The two biggest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, increased 166% and 90.75%, respectively, during the same time frame.\n\nEthereum is where the liquidity is and where a lot of developers start their journey, Windawi said. But it would be \u201cfoolish to count out other chains.\u201d\n\nThe report also showed \u201cclear growth\u201d across layer-1 blockchain Solana. Solana\u2019s total transfer volumes for decentralized exchanges, NFTs and USDC on the blockchain topped Ethereum in the fourth quarter of 2023, while memecoin hype brought its DEX volume over $9 billion. As for developers, Solana\u2019s 2023 Hyperdrive hackathon had over 900 projects, an increase of 63% from its Riptide hackathon in 2022, the report stated.\n\nThere was also growth for Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs), which are basically computers that are focused on powering that blockchain. Some EVM-compatible blockchains like layer-1 blockchains Avalanche and BNB chain have their own networks that can deploy developers\u2019 codes onto Ethereum. There\u2019s also layer-2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum \u2014 like Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum \u2014 that focus mainly on scaling the blockchain.\n\nThere were over 240 million smart contracts created by Ethereum-focused layer-2 blockchains, with 158.34 million created on Polygon alone, the report found.\n\nWhile the issue of scaling Ethereum isn\u2019t fully solved, there have been huge strides toward it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a major roadblock to scaling, and it\u2019s been addressed aggressively [in the past] and will be more this year, too,\u201d Windawi said.\n\nAnd as the data showed, it\u2019s not just limited to Ethereum. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing exciting projects using a lot of different stacks in compelling ways,\u201d Windawi said. \u201cWhere developers are using tools and what kind of libraries they\u2019re downloading doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s where they end up [long term] or what they\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nA major theme for developers last year was also \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d or ERC-4337, which was introduced in the third quarter to improve the crypto experience. To date, about 1.8 million deployments for account abstractions have transpired with over 53% happening in the fourth quarter of 2023, introducing new features like sponsoring blockchain gas fees for users or simplifying login steps, according to the report.\n\nMany people have argued that crypto\u2019s onboarding process, or even using web3 dApps day in and day out, is not a friendly experience. Sometimes a person will have to pass through a handful of applications and approve even more transactions just to get one objective done.\n\nBut in order to make it simple, developers have to \u201cget complex first\u201d through the back end, to make the front end look as simple as possible, Windawi said. \u201cAccount abstraction is real; it\u2019s coming and we\u2019re excited to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nNote: The report used the following sources for data collection: Alchemy\u2019s data, Dune\u2019s verified smart contracts, npmjs.com (SDK installations and metadata) and Coingeck for token prices."

        "title": "Ethereum devs consider \u2018existential\u2019 upgrade to the EVM - Blockworks",
        "content": "If there is one Ethereum upgrade that has been ever a bridesmaid, it\u2019s the EVM Object Format (EOF).\n\nEngaged once, with plans to be married in Shanghai, it was cast aside soon after by developers swooning for a blobular future in Proto-Danksharding.\n\nIf you have no idea what that sentence means, don\u2019t fret. It\u2019s a metaphor for hours of discussion over years of Ethereum all-core developer calls.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s ACD call, we still don\u2019t know whether EOF will finally get a chance to be a bride. But at least there\u2019s a clear proposal on the table.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nDevelopers had been strongly considering EOF for the Shapella hard fork. A year ago however, after a fair bit of introspection, it was pulled in favor of keeping the focus solely on staking withdrawals.\n\nOnce Shapella had safely shipped, the candidates for inclusion in Dencun had yet again EOF among them. And again it was shelved, much to the chagrin of the feature\u2019s two main champions, Danno Ferrin and Greg Colvin.\n\nThe consensus in April 2023 was that EOF was too big to share the stage with EIP-4844 \u2014 Proto-Danksharding \u2014 and therefore one had to go. The latter, with its potential to dramatically improve the user experience of layer-2 rollups, won out.\n\nAs a consolation, Ansgar Dietrichs at the Ethereum Foundation suggested having EOF as a focus of the next upgrade, Prague. \u201cIt\u2019s too big to be the second place in a fork,\u201d he said. So, it should have its own.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nDencun, with 4844 as its \u201cdriver,\u201d remains on track for mainnet in March as developers reported an \u201cuneventful\u201d hard fork of the Sepolia testnet on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe saw finality as well as blobs showing up exactly when we wanted them to,\u201d said the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Parithosh Jayanthi.\n\nJust one testnet, Holesky, is left before mainnet, and Dencun should be given its final test on Feb. 7.\n\nPushing EOF over the finish line\n\nMost of Thursday\u2019s call was aimed at understanding the current status of the next big feature fork. Named \u201cPrague,\u201d this consensus layer upgrade is titled after the location of Devcon 4. Meanwhile, \u201cElectra\u201d \u2014 a designation inspired by a blue-white giant star within the Taurus constellation \u2014 is the term used by execution clients to refer to the same upgrade.\n\nThe priorities for \u201cPectra\u201d are slowly taking shape. Very slowly.\n\nFerrin once again made the pitch for EOF, calling it \u201cexistential to the EVM in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nAs a leader of the EOF implementers working group, Ferrin said developers \u201chave been moving into \u2018ship it\u2019 mode.\u201d\n\nEOF aims to make Ethereum smart contracts more secure, efficient and developer-friendly. It\u2019s of particular significance to Ethereum dapp developers, who don\u2019t typically join the biweekly all-core dev calls.\n\nThat\u2019s left some client teams with the impression that EOF isn\u2019t important in the past, a stigma that has been hard to shake.\n\nOn the Jan. 4 call, Dragan Rakita from the Reth client team expressed strong support for EOF, and Nethermind developer Lukasz Rozmej noted EOF is a lot easier to test than Verkle trees \u2014 the main competing focus for the next fork.\n\nRead more: Big Geth users are diversifying their clients following Nethermind bug\n\nEven Marius van der Wijden from Go Ethereum (Geth), previously an EOF-skeptic, sounded relatively on-board with the idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been warming up to EOF, [it\u2019s] just not a [priority] for me,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\nSupport built further on the Jan. 18 call. Paradigm\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Georgios Konstantonopolous said it was \u201cdoable by one person in a couple months.\u201d\n\nFerrin reiterated that sentiment on the most recent call, arguing that work on EOF and Verkle is done by different engineers within client teams, and therefore committing to it wouldn\u2019t prevent work on Verkle from progressing.\n\nBut Guillaume Ballet, a Geth developer at the Ethereum Foundation, was not yet convinced, worrying EOF could adversely affect Verkle.\n\n\u201cIf it does go first, I need to make sure we don\u2019t ship something and paint ourselves in the corner realizing we broke something,\u201d Ballet said.\n\nAndrew Ashikhmin, software engineer on the Erigon client team, proposed to commit to EOF with the caveat that it be tried on a Verkle testnet and that there be time carved out for collaboration between Verkle and EOF implementers in the coming weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, as Ferrin observed.\n\n\u201cBefore we can put it in testnet in Verkle, we need it working in clients,\u201d he said, adding that his Besu client team could have EOF up and running soon for testing purposes.\n\nBut he\u2019s convinced it should be compatible with Verkle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want \u2018shoulds,\u2019 I want to see it working,\u201d Ballet retorted.\n\nEOF is left still trying to catch the bouquet, awaiting a suitor to walk it down the aisle.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Pro-Ethereum Crowd Slams Solana-based Jupiter Airdrop as \u2018Absolute Trash\u2019 - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum enthusiasts and Solana devotees have been trading insults over one of the key mechanisms used in the airdrop for Solana-based decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter.\n\nJupiter\u2019s LFG Launchpad is a portal where traders can claim their airdrop distribution and use services to facilitate the trading of newly issued tokens. In the instance of the JUP airdrop, Jupiter traders can claim their airdrop allocation of JUP in addition to acquiring more tokens at launch by presetting limit orders or dollar cost-averaging functions.\n\nWhen traders acquire more tokens through Jupiter\u2019s LFG Launchpad, they are engaging with a single-sided liquidity pool that initially only had JUP. When the airdrop went live, traders were able to withdraw JUP from the pool and deposit USDC.\n\nRead More: Jupiter Traders Claim Whopping 545 Million JUP Tokens in First 8 Hours of Airdrop\n\nOf JUP\u2019s 10 billion total token supply, the Jupiter team allocated 250 million JUP for the single-sided liquidity launch pool and 100 million JUP for the launchpad fees, according to a forum post written by Meow two days ago that detailed JUP\u2019s token genesis event.\n\nThis means traders, who purchase tokens through Jupiter\u2019s launchpad infrastructure, are acquiring JUP directly from the 250 million pot that the Jupiter team earmarked for the liquidity pool on its airdrop launch page. On Thursday, Meow said on X that Jupiter\u2019s core members will in a week take the USDC and JUP inside the liquidity pool and place the funds into the team treasury.\n\nMoreover, 75% of the 100 million JUP allocated as LFG launchpad fees is dedicated to the coming JUP DAO and the remaining 25% is for the Jupiter core team.\n\nWhile people from the Solana ecosystem have praised Jupiter and its founder Meow for how Jupiter\u2019s core members designed and conducted its airdrop, members of the Solana-rival pro-Ethereum camp had harsh words for the decentralized exchange aggregator.\n\nEthereum Crowd\u2019s Takeaway\n\nCritics cite Jupiter and its founder Meow on two elements of Jupiter\u2019s airdrop infrastructure: the team having 250 million JUP tokens to sell and the Jupiter ecosystem keeping 100 million JUP tokens fee for launching on their own launchpad.\n\nEthereum enthusiasts have raised concerns about the Jupiter team selling tokens to the public through the token launch pool, immediately following its airdrop going live. A strategic advisor for liquid staking provider Lido and Ethereum research firm Flashbots, who goes by \u201cHasu,\u201d said on X that Jupiter selling the 250 million JUP tokens for stablecoin USDC is a \u201cTruly remarkable grift\u201d and \u201cOne for the textbooks.\u201d\n\nIn reference to the launchpad fee of 100 million JUP tokens that will end up in the pockets of the JUP DAO and the core team, Paul Dylan-Ennis, a lecturer in the College of Business, University College Dublin who writes about Ethereum culture, said on X, \u201cThis is Solana\u2019s ICO era of absolute trash.\u201d\n\nSolana Crowd\u2019s Pushback\n\nThose defending Jupiter argue that the information about the 250 million JUP tokens for the launchpad liquidity pool and the 100 million JUP tokens for the launchpad fee has been publicly accessible for months.\n\nMike Dudas, general partner at 6th Man Ventures, expressed sarcastic outrage about Jupiter\u2019s transparency. \u201cI, for one, am extremely outraged that @weremeow and @JupiterExchange launched their token in the exact manner they said they would after sharing the methodology in excruciating detail across numerous communication methods for multiple months,\u201d he shared on X.\n\nRead More: Jupiter\u2019s Airdropped Token JUP Debuts at a $878 Million Market Cap\n\nSolana enthusiasts also took the opportunity to use ad hominems to call out Ethereum loyalists. One X user in a tweet about Jupiter\u2019s controversy said, \u201c0xdumbass.eths are crying \u2013 thats just what they do \u2014 ignore them.\u201d Another said, \u201cETH Maxis can cry all they want and make unfounded statements\u2026 having haters comes with the territory.\u201d\n\nMeow defended Jupiter\u2019s decision to allocate 250 million JUP tokens inside the launchpad liquidity pool. \u201cBy doing it this way, airdrop recipients get a massive pool to constantly sell into, while prospective buyers have assurance that there is a big pool to absorb big selling pressure from airdrops that will cause them immediate massive rekt,\u201d wrote Meow on X.\n\nRivalry Going Back Years\n\nThe back-and-forth between supporters of Solana and Ethereum is the latest development in the rivalry between the two blockchain networks. For years, people have referred to Solana as the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d but Ethereum has been the incumbent leader for blockchain networks with smart contract functionality. While Solana has historically trailed Ethereum \u2014 falling further behind during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX \u2014 in the past few months, Solana has made a comeback. It\u2019s been successfully challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of several metrics such as a thriving memecoin ecosystem and trading volume on decentralized exchanges."

        "content": "What Is DAI?\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 DAI, created by the Maker Protocol, was the first collateral-backed stablecoin to adopt and implement a decentralized model.\n\n\n\n\u2014 While most stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies or commodities and managed by centralized entities, DAI is backed by crypto and managed by a decentralized organization (DAO).\n\n\n\n\u2014 DAI is a popular stablecoin used for countless apps and services within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nUnless you\u2019re new to the cryptocurrency market, you\u2019ve likely come across stablecoins before. Put simply they are cryptocurrency assets, the value of which is pegged to existing real-world assets such as fiat currencies or commodities. Like traditional cryptocurrencies, they operate on blockchain networks and thus benefit from cross-border settlement capabilities and fast transaction speeds. However, their purpose differs significantly from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. Traditional crypto assets are perfect for long-term storage. On a long-term basis, Bitcoin isn\u2019t just stable, but appreciating. However, its volatility in the short-term makes Bitcoin, and other similar currencies, much less suited for making everyday payments.\n\nIn this case, stablecoins offer a much more appropriate medium of exchange. They are a great way to unlock blockchain-based payments for institutional and day-to-day retail purposes. For example, you could use them to pay grocery bills at your local store or buy a specific service.\n\nStablecoins operate as fiat on-chain, allowing you to spend and receive funds in a similar way to cash. They are crucial for the crypto market, offering not just a medium of exchange, but also a way for crypto traders to hedge against volatility, and a stable currency to charge for crypto services.\n\nThere are various types of stablecoins available: fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed, and algorithmic. Each approach maintains the value of their respective assets slightly differently.\n\nDAI, from the open-source Maker platform, is among the top three stablecoins at the time of writing, with a market cap of over $5.3 billion.\n\nBut what is DAI and how does it work? Let\u2019s explore DAI, its history, and how it differs from other stablecoins you might know.\n\nWhat is DAI?\n\nDAI is a hybrid, multi-collateral-backed stablecoin managed by MakerDAO. It operates on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token. Using Ethereum smart contracts, DAI aims to function in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized manner. While it was created as one of the Maker Protocol\u2019s native tokens, it\u2019s now extremely popular for countless dapps outside the Maker ecosystem too.\n\nSo how did that come about exactly?\n\nHistory of DAI\n\nIn 2014, Rune Christensen formed the Maker Foundation and launched the open-source Maker Protocol. The goal was to build a decentralized, crypto-collateralized credit system for lending and borrowing without traditional intermediaries. However, the protocol needed a stable, non-volatile digital currency for loan payouts and other transactions. Thus DAI was born; with it launching in December 2017. The stablecoin borrows its name from a Chinese letter, meaning \u2018to lend or provide capital for a loan.\u2019\n\nAlthough it was created and issued by the Maker Foundation, it transferred full control to MakerDAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization now overseeing the ecosystem\u2019s distributed and community-led governance. This is just one example of how DAI has become one of the most decentralized stablecoins in existence so far.\n\nTo understand its role in the crypto ecosystem, let\u2019s dive into its use cases.\n\nWhat are the uses of DAI?\n\nDAI is a widely adopted stablecoin, supporting over 400 wallets and dApps. As such, it has a wide range of use cases. However, some of the common use cases for DAI include:\n\nTo avoid the impact of market fluctuations\n\nCryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, etc., are driven by market dynamics like supply and demand. Meaning, that their prices fluctuate heavily: going up and down several points even daily at times. Conversely, DAI maintains a stable price which lends itself to multiple use cases.\n\nAs an alternative medium of fiat currency\n\nBanks usually offer low to negative interest rates for savings deposits. That, alongside inflation, means storing fiat currencies in the bank can cost you more than you\u2019d think. If you use a non-custodial wallet to manage your DAI, you can rest assured that it will not cost you to store your funds. Plus, no one can revoke your access to them: only you control your wallet. Thus, DAI is an alternative to fiat currencies: its value is stable, just like the assets in your bank, but it lives on the blockchain which is much more secure and permissionless.\n\nEveryday payments: in dApps and DeFi platforms and the physical world\n\nAs an ERC-20 token, DAI is interoperable with countless applications, protocols, and blockchain platforms. This gives you a simple way to spend fiat on-chain. Since it can operate on any EVM chain, that also means you can use it to pay for everyday items, using a chain with much cheaper gas fees than the Ethereum mainnet. This makes it accessible and convenient for everyday purchases such as in-game items and online purchases, but also physical world purchases, such as buying a croissant or coffee in your local caf\u00e9.\n\nTaking Profits: As a Crypto Trader, Artist, or Service Provider\n\nStablecoins play a vital role in the crypto landscape, offering a reliable way for participants to take profits. For example, crypto traders often use them to take profits during market volatility. Similarly, crypto artists and service providers also periodically swap their earnings to stablecoins, ensuring their hard work isn\u2019t hostage to crypto volatility. In short, stablecoins such as DAI offer users a way to realize profits without off-ramping. To clarify, that means profits made on-chain don\u2019t necessarily need to go through the bank or even leave the network. A creator or trader can take profits without the burden of making transfers on and off-chain.\n\nHow does DAI work?\n\nDAI is overcollateralized, which means the collateral\u2019s value is greater than the issued DAI\u2019s value. This protects lenders against the fluctuations of the crypto market. As a stablecoin, DAI aims to maintain a stable 1:1 value with the USD. It has mostly achieved this goal so far, except for minor fluctuations. To achieve this stability, DAI employs a few methods:\n\nVault & Keeper Accounts\n\nIssuing and destroying DAI relies on Vault and keeper accounts. To explain, vault accounts are for depositing your collateral. Once you fill your vault account with ETH or another supported asset, you will receive newly issued DAI. Then when you want to repay the loan, you receive your collateral back and the DAI you were issued is destroyed. This process is controlled by a smart contract, meaning there are no middlemen needed.\n\nIf the value of a vault account falls below the issued value, it is liquidated. To handle this process, DAI uses keeper accounts. In short, the keeper accounts provide liquidity to pay off undercollateralized vault accounts. This keeps the circulation of DAI steady.\n\nStability Fee\n\nThe stability fee works much like interest on a loan and it\u2019s charged only when returning your DAI for your collateral, whether that\u2019s ETH or BAT. The rate of this fee is determined when your DAI is issued, and it fluctuates depending on the current supply and demand. If there is more supply than demand, the stability fees increase and vice versa. This helps alleviate the selling pressure to keep the coin\u2019s price stable.\n\nDAI Savings Rate (DSR)\n\nThe final mechanism to keep DAI stable is its DAI savings rate (DSR). It essentially operates much like a bank\u2019s savings account, but unlike a bank, these contracts operate without the need for a centralized entity. If you lock your DAI in a DSR contract, you automatically earn consistent interest.\n\nFor example, if you put 100 DAI into a DSR contract for a year and the DSR is 3.3%, you will receive an additional 3.3 DAI in your account when you unlock your collateral.\n\nThe rate itself is controlled by MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the coin. Then the interest is funded by the stability fee.\n\nIs DAI backed by fiat currency?\n\nUnlike Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, DAI is not backed by fiat currencies. Instead, it\u2019s backed by various stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. USD Coin (USDC) and Pax Dollar (USDP) account for the biggest share in DAI\u2019s backing, followed by ETH, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Compound (COMP) and TrueUSD (TUSD).\n\nUsing multiple assets for collateralization also boosts diversification, which is a better practice from a stability and risk management perspective. Then, since many of the assets DAI is backed by tend to be volatile, DAI is always overcollateralized. This is to avoid the impact of fluctuations in these underlying asset\u2019s values.\n\nAdvantages of DAI\n\nAs a versatile stablecoin, DAI has several benefits, ranging from stability to low entry barriers and robust security. From a practical perspective, however, its advantages can be seen in two broad categories.\n\nStability & Security\n\nDAI is one of the most stable stablecoins, thanks to its multi-collateral and hybrid algorithmic nature. It doesn\u2019t merely rely upon backing reserves but also has codified systems to maintain the value.\n\nBesides low-cost remittances, people in unstable or weak economies can use DAI to safely store their capital in a USD-equivalent currency, without needing an overseas bank account. This helps preserve their purchasing power against hyperinflation or devaluation.\n\nMoreover, since you can store DAI in secure, encrypted crypto wallets, your funds are much less prone to theft, etc. This is particularly true when using hardware wallets that provide top-notch security against hacks and frauds.\n\nInteroperability & Accessibility\n\nDAI is an ERC-20 token that works with any Ethereum-based dApp, wallet, protocol, or platform. This level of interoperability is pretty much unforeseen in the crypto or stablecoin space, which makes DAI unique.\n\nIts broad compatibility also makes DAI very accessible for a variety of use cases, boosting innovation and user interactions across sectors. DAI also fosters financial inclusion in this manner, as people worldwide can use this stablecoin for their financial needs and goals.\n\nThey no longer have to rely on value-sucking intermediaries or, for that matter, wear their shoes off trying to get an account with the local bank.\n\nDisadvantages of DAI\n\nGiven DAI\u2019s multi-collateral-backed nature, it must rely on the stable and efficient functioning of all the assets supporting its value. Even one of them collapsing drastically can affect DAI\u2019s stability and 1:1 value with USD. Although DAI is a robust stablecoin overall, there are some downsides to the way it operates. Let\u2019s explore how.\n\nIt\u2019s Backed partially by volatile Crypto\n\nDAI is backed by cryptocurrencies that are subject to market fluctuations, such as ETH, BAT, and WBTC. This means DAI relies on the strength of the market. If ETH and WBTC drop significantly in price, it will diminish the value of DAI\u2019s backing, thus depreciating the price of the coin; potentially leading it to depeg.\n\nTo safeguard against these risks, DAI has a pretty robust hybrid, algorithmic model: its stability mechanisms aim to minimize the impact of these possible crashes, such as over-collateralization and its stability fee. Plus, its diversification aims to soften the blow should any of its collateralized coins fail.\n\nIt\u2019s also backed by centralized Stablecoins\n\nA great portion of DAI\u2019s backing is in USDC, a centralized stablecoin. USDC is one of the most popular stablecoins to date, but unlike DAI, it is managed and issued by the centralized entity Circle. This means you\u2019re trusting Circle not to go bankrupt or mismanage funds. Believe it or not, USDC actually has a back door that allows Circle to freeze accounts and retrieve stolen funds. Although this is useful to combat on-chain crimes, it also means DAI relies on Circle to act effectively and in good faith. If Circle mismanages USDC, it will also impact the price of DAI.\n\nCounterparty Risk\n\nSince DAI is largely backed by USDC, it\u2019s important to note that USDC is backed by reserves in Circle\u2019s control. Circle keeps its reserves in centralized financial institutions, a.k.a. banks. This introduces counterparty risk as if one or more of those banks fail, USDC\u2019s price is impacted. Unfortunately, anytime USDC depegs, DAI depegs along with it. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what happened in March 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank failed. USDC kept $3.3 Billion in SVB, thus both USDC and DAI depegged by 13% under $1.\n\nFinal thoughts on DAI\n\nDAI is among the earliest and most popular stablecoins. It has established a robust market record through various ups and downs, adapting to meet various demands and needs. Today, it\u2019s one of the three most popular stablecoins, and the only one aiming to become truly decentralized. If you\u2019re into DeFi, this may be the stablecoin for you, as it doesn\u2019t have a centralized issuing body, and is not subject to the same centralization risks as some of its competitors. Plus, anyone can initiate the process to issue DAI: it aims to be truly permissionless, and you\u2019re able to collateralize it with countless supported assets\u2014not just ETH. Plus, as an ERC-20 token, it\u2019s easy to secure and manage with compatible crypto wallets.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Dive into the wonderful world of stablecoins from the safety of the Ledger Ecosystem. Using a Ledger hardware wallet device you can protect and manage DAI with a dedicated DAI Wallet to take part in multiple crypto apps and services\u2014and all with the benefit of self-custody. Because if not self-custody, then why crypto?"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJupiter\u2019s massive JUP token airdrop claim began Wednesday, and volume on the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator soared to new heights in the process.\n\nAccording to data from both CoinGecko and Jupiter itself, the platform has racked up more than $1.2 billion worth of daily trading volume over the past 24 hours. That makes it top among all crypto DEXes, beating typical leader Uniswap V3 on Ethereum with $854 million (per CoinGecko). Note that the tally does not include Uniswap volume on other chains.\n\nJupiter\u2019s 24-hour rolling tally also appears to be an all-time record for the protocol, which has recently seen surging demand. Another data source, DeFi Llama, shows that Jupiter\u2019s single calendar-day volume record is just above $1 billion on December 14, 2023.\n\nToday\u2019s traders won\u2019t get anything from the initial JUP airdrop, which serves up 1 billion tokens for earlier Jupiter users to claim. Jupiter took a snapshot of eligible wallets in November and said that about 955,000 wallets could claim tokens during the drop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to be optimistic: Jupiter has allocated another 3 billion tokens, 30% of the total token supply, for future airdrops to reward newer users. The timing for the next airdrop has not yet been announced, however, and amid the buzz of claim day and the sizable drops landing in Solana wallets, traders are eager to start racking up activity on the platform.\n\nJupiter opened up the claim at 10 a.m. ET and the coin started with a market price of about $0.42, according to data from Birdeye. JUP quickly popped over 70% to a price above $0.72, as Decrypt reported earlier, but it has since calmed to a current price below $0.67.\n\nEven with the sinking price late Wednesday, JUP commands a market cap of about $914 million based on the current circulating supply, and the token has generated over $500 million in trading volume in less than nine hours.\n\nAccording to a Dune dashboard that tracks public blockchain data, eligible wallets have already claimed about 566 million JUP tokens out of the initial 1 billion JUP airdrop allocation. Nearly 392,000 unique wallet addresses have claimed tokens so far, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL itself has fallen about 6% on the day to the current price of around $97, according to CoinGecko, after bouncing up and down since the JUP drop.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "How to bridge to Tron - OKX",
        "content": "Blockchains are usually self-contained systems and lack the ability to communicate with other chains, creating difficulties for users when transferring money. The purpose of building what the crypto space call \u2018bridges\u2019 is to address this issue. Through blockchain bridging , individuals can efficiently transfer their funds between different chains. Cryptocurrency bridges promote blockchain interoperability and enhance the ease of digital asset transfer.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll walk you through how to bridge to the Tron ecosystem\u2019s own blockchain. But first, what is Tron?\n\nLaunched in 2017 by Justin Sun, Tron quickly grew in popularity due to its speed and efficiency. Initially, it was built on Ethereum to focus on entertainment and content sharing. It shifted to its own blockchain system in 2018 and achieved complete decentralization in 2021. Over the years, Tron has developed a vibrant community and decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem featuring popular NFTs and games.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nTo begin using a bridge to Tron, the first step is selecting the appropriate wallet.\n\nOKX provides a highly secure and multi-chain OKX Web3 Wallet with all OKX accounts. Tron isn't an Ethereum-compatible chain and Ethereum wallets such as Metamask don't support it. However, the OKX Web3 Wallet has \u200csupport for major blockchains, including Tron. Also, the OKX Web3 Wallet features bank-grade security and inbuilt access to hundreds of DApps and the OKX NFT Marketplace .\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nThe first step before you bridge a cryptocurrency from one chain to another is to make sure the asset is supported. For this guide, we\u2019ll be transferring USDT from Ethereum to Tron. USDT is a supported currency on both chains.\n\nTo do the bridging, you need USDT as the asset you\u2019re sending and ETH to cover gas on Ethereum. However, make sure you have some TRON in your Tron wallet for gas fees to use your USDT after bridging.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nWe recommend OKX Swap as a safe option to bridge ETH to Tron. OKX Swap combines prices from numerous decentralized exchanges to provide the most efficient path, reducing slippage and network fees. Additionally, OKX Swap allows for effortless cryptocurrency conversions and safe transactions. Other Tron bridges you can check out are Meson and Allbridge .\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nOne simple method of connecting to Tron is through the use of centralized exchanges. By using this method, you can transfer your cryptocurrency to OKX using one network and then transfer it out using a different one. Here\u2019s a simple guide on bridging USDT from Ethereum to Tron using OKX Exchange.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX .\n\nStep 2: Once logged in, head to \u201cAssets\u201d on the top-right and select \u201cDeposit.\u201d If you don't have USDT, you can purchase some on OKX and bypass the deposit process.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cUSDT\u201d as the crypto and \u201cETH-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Transfer USDT to the provided address from your Ethereum Wallet. It may take a few minutes for the USDT to be deposited and become available in your account.\n\nStep 5: Once your funds are ready to be used, go back to \u201cAssets\u201d and select \u201cWithdraw.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Select \u201cUSDT\u201d as Crypto and the withdrawal method as \u201cOn-chain.\u201d\n\nStep 7: Type in your Tron address and select the network as \u201cUSDT-TRC20.\u201d Enter the amount of USDT you want to bridge to Tron and hit next. Upon account verification, the USDT will be deposited into your Tron wallet in a matter of minutes.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to bridge your assets is by using an exchange, since you won't have to worry about slippage or network fees.\n\nChoosing a bridge service\n\nCentralized and decentralized cryptocurrency bridges have their own benefits. Deciding which one to use is a personal choice. Decentralized bridges allow for faster movement between chains, but may have high fees and security concerns. It's important to choose a reputable bridge with a strong security history.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nTo transfer USDT to Tron, you'll need to link your wallet and move the assets. Our recommended method involves using the OKX Web3 Wallet and OKX Swap. However, the steps should be similar if you prefer to use a different wallet or bridge platform.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap .\n\nStep 2: Select \u201cConnect wallet\u201d in the top right corner, and select \u201cOKX wallet extension.\u201d If you use another wallet provider like Metamask or Phantom, select \u201cOther\u201d and choose your wallet.\n\nStep 3: Enter your OKX wallet password and select \"Confirm\" to allow your OKX wallet to connect with OKX Swap.\n\nTransferring assets to Tron\n\nNow that you\u2019re connected to OKX Swap, you can bridge USDT to Tron.\n\nStep 1: Adjust the bridge settings and specify the quantity of USDT you wish to transfer in the \"Swap and Bridge\" section.\n\nChoose \"Ethereum\" as the first network and enter the desired quantity of USDT to transfer. Choose \"Tron\" from the \"To\" network. If you can't find the network right away, select \"View all networks\" under \"Select Network\" and look for \"Tron.\" Next, choose \"USDT\" as the token. OKX Swap will then display the USDT you'll receive on Tron.\n\nStep 2 (optional): This step isn't mandatory. It should only be completed if you have a strong understanding of slippage and bridges.\n\nNetwork fee: This calculates the cost of the network to enable the bridging. Slippage: Slippage refers to the level of flexibility you're comfortable with when faced with price fluctuations. By setting the slippage to 0%, OKX swap guarantees you'll receive exactly 98.2 USDT, as shown. However, the transaction will be voided if the price changes, and you'll incur a network fee. Allowing for some slippage is important in situations where liquidity is limited. Trading route: The OKX Swap acts as a DeFi aggregator, selecting the most optimal bridge to connect to Tron at any given moment, rather than functioning as a bridge itself. You have the option to manually change the service if needed.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet pops up, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap is a user-friendly DeFi solution for transferring and exchanging cryptocurrencies with\u200c bridges.\n\nAlongside supporting swaps between different networks, OKX Swap and other bridges can also be used in the opposite direction, acting as bridges between Tron and Ethereum. To launch a Tron to Ethereum bridge, Tron must be selected as the primary network and Ethereum as the secondary network.\n\nOKX Swap also offers the capability to convert USDT to TRX during the bridging process. By selecting \"TRX\" as the second currency instead of \"USDT,\" OKX Swap will seamlessly convert the USDT from Ethereum to TRX and complete the bridge to Tron.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThere are multiple fees involved in a decentralized bridging process:\n\nEthereum gas fees : To use OKX Swap and transfer your USDT, you're required to pay a transaction fee to the Ethereum network. Bridge fees: The role of OKX Swap is to serve as both a bridge and a swap aggregator. To start the bridging process, a small fee is charged by the bridge. Tron transaction fees: Just like the gas fee on Ethereum, the Tron transaction fee is deducted to enable the transfer of USDT from the bridge to your wallet. Conversion fees: If you\u2019re converting from one cryptocurrency to another during the bridge process, such as USDT to TRX, there\u2019s a conversion fee for that.\n\nBefore making a transfer, you can view a breakdown of the conversion and bridge fees on OKX Swap. However, the Ethereum gas fee will only be displayed on the OKX Web3 Wallet pop-up when you confirm the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nJust like the fees, the transaction time also depends on multiple factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: The amount of time it takes for USDT to transfer from your wallet to the bridge. Bridge processing time: The duration for transferring your asset from one chain to The information for each bridge may differ. To access this information for OKX Swap, go to the advanced options and choose the trading route. Tron blockchain confirmation time: The USDT will be transferred to your wallet after the The bridging procedure is quick thanks to Tron's fast processing speed, so you can expect to receive it in your wallet within a few seconds.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nMaking secure transactions\n\nWhen using a cryptocurrency bridge, it's important to remember that you are interacting with a smart contract that has access to your wallet. Be aware that malicious smart contracts can be used to steal funds from your wallet. To ensure a secure transfer of digital assets on bridges, we suggest following these steps:\n\nBe sure to choose a reliable bridge for Tron, like OKX Swap, which has a good history. Refraining from using your main wallet for transactions with bridges and other DApps is recommended. Maintaining a separate cold wallet for securely storing your assets is advisable. Use tools like Revoke to remove access to your wallet once you\u2019re done bridging.\n\nAnother possibility for minimizing potential hazards is using a centralized exchange as a bridge. OKX implements cutting-edge security measures to ensure the secure and seamless exchange of USDT for global users. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nHere are some of the common pitfalls you can avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Tron blockchain:\n\nMake sure to thoroughly check all the information you enter before finalizing it. Once the transaction is confirmed, it can't be undone. Pay close attention to gas fees . During high network congestion and demand periods, gas fees on Ethereum may increase, making transactions more costly. You may want to wait for gas fees to decrease or choose to use a centralized exchange for transferring funds. High slippage and liquidity issues are another aspect to look out for. Opting for a less commonly used bridge or connecting to a coin with low trading activity could lead to significant slippage. To avoid this, it's advisable to only bridge to assets with a high level of liquidity.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nIt's common for users to come across stuck transactions, but this can be resolved by making sure that the gas fee on Ethereum is appropriate. If enough gas has been allocated, the transaction will be completed successfully. However, inadequate gas will result in a failed transaction and a refund of funds to your wallet. During times of high traffic, transactions may get trapped on the bridge. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency bridges are equipped to handle these situations and will eventually be resolved. Cross-chain compatibility: Prior to initiating the bridge, ensure that the asset being transferred has adequate liquidity and is compatible with the designated chain.\n\nWhere to seek help\n\nThe crypto community is renowned for its helpfulness. In case of any difficulties, there should be accessible resources to help you."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC pumps as FOMC meeting keeps rates unchanged - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price could rally 10% if it overcomes $43,750 barrier.\n\nEthereum price likely to revisit $2,200 as the recovery rally hits the wall.\n\nRipple price eyes a 7% fall to bottom out near $0.4746 as community digests executive\u2019s hack.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price fell after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices failed to inspire confidence as the broader altcoin community bled on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read: As monthly close draws near, significance of $43,750 grows\n\nBitcoin price confronts $43,750\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has failed to break past the immediate barricade at $43,750 despite the Fed keeping rates unchanged, in line with expectations. Based on the minutes, there may be no rate cuts until such a time when the Fed has greater confidence that inflation is moving toward its 2% target.\n\nComing into the event, however, Bitcoin price ticked up nearly 3% with technical indicators favoring the upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the 50 mean level, while the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are flashing green. These show growing momentum in favor of bulls.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Bitcoin price flip the $43,750 hurdle into support and then extend above it to $48,000. In a highly bullish case, BTC could make its way to the $50,000 psychological level, 15% above current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from $43,750 could see Bitcoin price retract to the $40,726 support. An extended fall could send BTC to $37,800, below which there would be a cliff all the way to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to support these altcoin narratives this week\n\nEthereum price could fall to $2,200\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is stuck below the ascending parallel channel, with the potential to fall as momentum is fading. The RSI, is below the 50 midline, while both the AO and MACD remain in negative territory, bolstering the case for the bears.\n\nA rejection from the lower boundary of the channel could see Ethereum price fall past the $2,200 level and the 100-day SMA at $2,177 to test the supply zone that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,059 and $2,118. Breaking below its midline at $2,091 would confirm the continuation of the pullback\u2019s potential for going as low as the $2,000 psychological level. To invalidate the bullish thesis, the price must record a candlestick close below $1,935.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if more bulls show resolve, Ethereum price could venture into the supply zone, flipping $2,388 into support. In a highly bullish case, the gains could send ETH past $2,717 range high to record a higher high above $2,800.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: $2,500 in sight as bullish metrics steer ETH back into the channel\n\nRipple price dips after hacking incident\n\nRipple (XRP) price has dipped into the daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.4927 and $0.5111. Breaking and closing below its midline at $0.5040 could see XRP price extend the fall to the support floor at $0.4746.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, enhanced buyer activity among bulls could send Ripple price north past multiple obstacles to overcome resistance due to the falling trendline. This would bring the $0.7000 psychological level in sight.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple executive\u2019s XRP accounts get compromised in $112.5 million hack"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRON, the native token of the Ethereum-based Ronin Network, continued its recent ascent Wednesday as it popped to a nearly two-year high price of $2.89, according to data from CoinGecko. It\u2019s up 5% on the day and 57% over the past 30 days.\n\nRonin, an Ethereum sidechain designed for crypto games, has seen a recent rise in users and increased momentum tied in part to the success of Pixels, a social farming game that migrated from fellow Ethereum scaler Polygon last fall. The game\u2019s play-to-airdrop campaign, which will reward top players with PIXEL tokens, helped fuel a surge in Ronin users.\n\nHowever, the latest RON pump came after a couple of notable events in the world of Axie Infinity, the NFT-based monster-battling game developer Sky Mavis originally built Ronin to support back in 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sky Mavis launched its seventh in-game competitive season in Axie Infinity Origins. Dubbed \u201cEpic Era,\u201d Season 7 will serve up 18,900 AXS and over 13.7 million SLP in reward tokens, collectively valued at about $175,000 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis axie just sold for 105 ETH ($245,843.85) \ud83e\udd2f King Durendal has a new owner.

Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Zirlin tweeted that the particular Agamogenesis Axie NFTs originally sold for 6 ETH in 2018, back when that sum would\u2019ve been worth approximately $3,300.\n\nAxie Infinity saw skyrocketing success in 2021, generating billions of dollars\u2019 worth of NFT trading volume as the game attracted millions of active players.\n\nHowever, the game\u2019s play-to-earn economy began struggling in early 2022 and the Ronin network\u2019s bridge to Ethereum was hacked for $622 million. Sky Mavis eventually repaid affected Ronin users and has since continued to evolve the Axie ecosystem, gradually onboarding more third-party game studios to the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Jupiter Volume Surpasses Uniswap: Is Solana Taking Over Ethereum As King Of DeFi? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Data from CoinGeko shows that Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter recently surpassed Ethereum\u2019s foremost DEX Uniswap in an important metric. This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum\u2019s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nJupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume\n\nAccording to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter\u2019s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.\n\nThis airdrop caused a splurge of new money into the Solana ecosystem and Jupiter in particular. While that may be the case, it also highlights a new trend that looks to be developing in the crypto ecosystem. This is in reference to the fact that the Solana network has been going toe-to-toe with Ethereum as of late.\n\nData from DeFiLlama shows that beyond Jupiter\u2019s dominance, SOL is actually matching Ethereum\u2019s numbers. In the last 24 hours, Solana recorded a trading volume of $704 million to Ethereum\u2019s $741 million.\n\nIn December 2023, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 7-day DEX volume for the first time in history. Data from the Block shows that Solana also outperformed Ethereum in terms of non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume during that same period.\n\nSOL price at $97 | Source: SOL price at $97 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSolana To Overtake Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has long been known as the network housing the foremost decentralized applications (dApps) and has continued to dominate the DeFi landscape. However, that could change soon enough if Solana\u2019s runs become constant. This is more interesting, considering that Solana has always been referred to as the \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nThe SOL network is already known to have an edge over Ethereum, considering that the former is faster and more cost-effective than the latter. Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have also continued to pose major concerns for users, and this cannot be sustained if mainstream adoption of DEXs is to be achieved.\n\nMoreover, it has become evident that more liquidity is flowing into Solana, something that could entice more DeFi users into the ecosystem. It is worth mentioning that the WEN airdrop was just the tip of the iceberg, as the JUP, Jupiter\u2019s native token, airdrop is set to take place on January 31.\n\nThe highly-anticipated airdrop is expected to drive considerable attention and trading activity towards Jupiter and Solana. For one, those eligible for the airdrop are likely to diversify their funds across the SOL ecosystem. Meanwhile, those who missed out on this airdrop are likely to look farm other DeFi projects on Solana in hopes that they will be eligible once these projects in question roll out their native tokens.\n\nFeatured image from Quora, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "The Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin lost its U.S. dollar-peg after an exploit on cross-chain protocol Abracadabra.money\u2019s cauldrons on Ethereum.\n\nThe Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin lost its U.S. dollar-peg after an exploit on cross-chain protocol Abracadabra.money\u2019s cauldrons on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized crypto lending platform Abracadabra.money was hit by an exploit on Tuesday, resulting in a $6.5 million loss to the protocol.\n\nThe exploit was flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield, which noted that the attacker funded the exploit with 1 ETH from Tornado Cash.\n\nMagic Internet Money (MIM), the stablecoin tied to the protocol flash crashed to $0.76 after the exploit. At the time of writing, the stablecoin was still trading below its U.S. dollar-peg at around $0.98.\n\nThe attacker managed to trick certain Abracadabra\u2019s isolated lending pools on Ethereum, called \u201ccauldrons,\u201d and used a nested series of smart contracts to loop the Abracadabra Degenbox\u2019s \u201cborrow\u201d and \u201crepay\u201d functions, according to analysis from Arkham.\n\nThe hacker swapped $7M of MIM for a total of $6.3M in ETH, incurring around 10% slippage when they dumped it on Curve.

MIM also destabilized after the collapse of the Terra ecosystem earlier that year."

        "title": "Montenegro's Crypto Dream Is Hanging In The Balance - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty",
        "content": "In May 2023, not far from the seaside resort town of Tivat on the Montenegrin Adriatic peninsula of Lustica, a conference on new technologies and blockchain was held that attracted little media attention at the time.\n\nSome of the country's most senior officials were there, including then-Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic and Milojko Spajic, who would take over the premier's post in October 2023. Also in attendance was Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency (by market capitalization) after Bitcoin.\n\nPodgorica made it clear that Buterin was more than welcome. A few months after the crypto confab, Buterin was granted Montenegrin citizenship. The government was optimistic that Buterin would \"contribute to the development of the blockchain industry and the Montenegrin economy.\" Wooing Buterin was also part of a broader government plan to turn Montenegro into a new crypto paradise.\n\nCould Montenegro really become a cryptocurrency haven? That could largely hinge on whether legislation being debated now in the Montenegrin parliament to regulate the electronic money market is eventually adopted by parliament. There have been concerns, in and outside Montenegro, about the European Commission's 2023 report on the country's progress toward accession to the EU, which noted disapprovingly the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market in Montenegro.\n\nThe lack of such laws in Montenegro hasn't stopped transactions from being conducted on crypto exchanges and purchases being made with cryptocurrencies, including for real estate. Cryptomining attempts have also been reported in Montenegro, along with the first cryptocurrency ATM being installed in an Adriatic resort town.\n\nIt also hasn't stopped crypto-schemers and backers from flocking to Montenegro, which has a small but well-connected community, according to Novak Svrkota, a crypto analyst, in comments to RFE/RL's Balkan Service.\n\n\n\n\"We came up with the idea of creating a crypto paradise in Montenegro. The crypto community is looking for a small country that is open and could pass crypto-friendly laws because the current laws in some countries are quite restrictive,\" explained Svrkota, who was a member of the government's short-lived Blockchain Directorate, a failed attempt to set rules for the crypto market in Montenegro.\n\nIn December 2023, Podgorica tried to woo another cybercurrency heavyweight. Spajic met with the leader of JAN3, a company that is focused on expanding Bitcoin. Also attending the meeting was Crown Prince Filip Karadordevic, the English-born son of the last Yugoslav king and a big Bitcoin booster.\n\nEarly Inroads\n\nSpajic first expressed Montenegro's eagerness to enter the burgeoning business of cryptocurrency in 2021, when he was serving as finance minister in the cabinet of Zdravko Krivokapic.\n\nTo that end, in November 2021, the Directorate for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain was established. Among other goals, it was tasked with establishing the legal framework for regulating the mining and use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many other products like NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). However, political infighting doomed the effort, and the directorate was ingloriously ditched in August 2022.\n\nThat setback didn't appear to dampen the enthusiasm. One of the benefits the cryptocurrency industry could bestow on the country, a report of the meeting said, was how \"Bitcoin can help Montenegro tap into its hydroelectric potential.\"\n\nHydropower has been tapped around the globe to feed the hundreds of computers wired up to the cryptocurrency mining business. In Montenegro, the hope was that its ample waterways could be harnessed to supply the electricity demanded by cryptocurrency activities.\n\nIn April 2023, the Montenegrin Central Bank signed an agreement with Ripple, a provider of crypto and blockchain solutions, to jointly develop a pilot program for the launch of the first digital currency -- backed by the bank -- in the tiny Adriatic nation of around 600,000 people.\n\n\"The introduction of a digital currency or a national stablecoin, i.e., a stable currency, is another step toward the digitization of financial services and the expansion of the space for the availability of financial services to citizens,\" the Central Bank of Montenegro announced at the time.\n\nThe Kwon Affair\n\nThe biggest obstacle to Montenegro's crypto dream has been the arrest of South Korean Hyeong Do Kwon, the so-called king of cryptocurrencies. On March 23, 2023, when Kwon was traveling to Montenegro, he was apprehended by police at Podgorica's airport for traveling on a forged passport.\n\nThe founder of Terraform Labs, Kwon is wanted in South Korea in connection with a $40 billion crash of the firm's cryptocurrency that crushed retail investors around the world.\n\nAlong with Kwon, another individual linked to the cryptocurrency crash, whose name was not released by Montenegrin authorities, was arrested at the time.\n\nKwon and the other man had been hiding in Serbia but moved to Montenegro after South Korean investigators tracked their whereabouts and asked Serbian authorities to detain them, officials said. The two were arrested while trying to depart for Dubai using fake Costa Rican passports, the Montenegrin Interior Ministry said at the time.\n\nTo this date, Kwon's fate still remains unresolved, with him still detained at a prison facility in Podgorica. He is awaiting an extradition ruling amid international warrants for fraud.\n\nThe opposition in Montenegro has seized on the case, potentially threatening any further advancement of the country's cryptocurrency plans.\n\nPressed by political foes, Spajic finally admitted in late December 2023 to having met Kwon but said he wasn't aware of the arrest warrants out for him. That admission didn't douse the political flames. During campaigning for Montenegro's 2023 general elections, former Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic tried to tar Spajic by accusing him of secretive business dealings with Kwon.\n\nThat accusation took on extra gravitas when a senior interior minister added what appeared to be damning details.\n\n\"The laptop [belonging to Kwon] also contains evidence of joint business between Spajic and Kwon. It may be a legal business with one of the most wanted fugitives, but it is the subject of an investigation,\" said Adzic.\n\nSoon afterward, prosecutors launched a probe into any ties between the two, but the investigation came up empty.\n\nMining In Montenegro\n\nEfforts to create new virtual coins via so-called mining have continued off and on in Montenegro, although it has not been profitable for years, according to experts who spoke to RFE/RL's Balkan Service. Cryptominers use high-powered computers to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify transactions on the network. As a reward for their work, they receive cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nEarlier this month, a citizen of Serbia tried to smuggle cryptocurrency mining hardware worth several thousand euros into Montenegro but was caught by customs officials and border police. His current fate remains unclear.\n\nThe first case of cryptocurrency mining uncovered by police in Montenegro was reported in 2020, when police arrested two individuals and seized 250 computers in the basement of a building in Podgorica. The arrests were not linked to the mining but to the illegal use of electricity in the mining, which is a very energy-intensive process requiring specialized hardware.\n\nIT expert Boris Radovic said that cryptocurrency mining -- once a profitable business -- is now largely a loss maker, due to the huge amount of time and energy needed.\n\n\"I had personal experience with mining. After five months of 'work,' four virtual coins of one cryptocurrency were mined -- worth about 800 euros. As I did not convert them into real money in time, they lost their value. Now they are worth about 120 euros, which can barely compensate for the price of electricity that was used while they were being mined,\" Radovic explained to RFE/RL.\n\nLegal Gray Area\n\nJust exactly how widespread cryptocurrencies are in Montenegro is difficult to gauge, according to Svrkota; however, they appear to be favored by those who want to hide their transactional tracks.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency is used for purchases of real estate, especially luxury villas on the coast, where developers often get part of their earnings in digital money,\" Svrkota explained. \"It is often used by people from countries like Ukraine and Russia, which are under sanctions, to avoid complications that come with interacting with the banking system.\"\n\nA virtual currency ATM was even spotted at a private club in Tivat, a picturesque Adriatic coastal town in the southwest of the tiny Balkan country, late last year. The club's owner, Yong Hon Kong, a Malaysian citizen, told police he had legally acquired and imported the device but had never put it into service for technical reasons.\n\nAt the time, officials said the crypto ATM was an illegal device.\n\n\"There is no legal basis to carry out that trade. Everything related to trade through that device is illegal,\" said then-Finance Minister Aleksandar Damjanovic.\n\nA lawyer for Kong told RFE/RL that the device remains on the premises of the club and that no legal action has been taken against his client.\n\nRegular Montenegrins can also try their luck, Svrkota said, by registering to trade on global cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nOne of them is Marija from Podgorica, who told RFE/RL that seven years ago she invested by buying a small amount of Bitcoin, the most famous digital currency.\n\n\"It was out of curiosity to try my luck without any expectation of making money. It was interesting to watch the amount in the digital wallet grow every day. At the moment when the value of bitcoin reached 10 times its value, I sold and used the money to pay for an exotic honeymoon trip and an exotic wedding trip for me and my husband,\" said Marija, who requested her last name not be used.\n\nAlthough she turned a profit, Marija said she no longer trades in cryptocurrencies.\n\nRadovic, the IT expert, said he has made and lost money trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"You never know if something will rise or fall to nothing. Fluctuations in the crypto world are far greater than in the classic stock market,\" Radovic noted.\n\nWhile individuals may be making (or losing) money on cryptocurrency in Montenegro, none of it is going into the coffers of the state thanks to the lack of legislation regulating it.\n\n\"The state loses because it does not have control over money flows and there are no tax benefits. Regulation would bring some security to companies and people who deal with it, as well as an incentive to develop businesses. And it would give the banking sector a free hand in providing services for exchanging cryptocurrencies or investing,\" Svrkota said.\n\nThe Finance Ministry told RFE/RL that preparations have begun on drafting a law that will regulate crypto assets in accordance with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MICA), hailed as a landmark framework created by the European Commission that focuses on maintaining financial stability. It entered into force in June 2023.\n\nThe Finance Ministry cautioned that it was unable to give any time lines on the adoption of any regulatory legislation. And the Central Bank states that they are working on national standards that would be harmonized with MICA.\n\nIn the meantime, Montenegro's Central Bank has cautioned potential investors of the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin su crypto e intelligenza artificiale: le idee del co-fondatore di Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, published a lengthy post on his blog regarding the relationship between cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe promise and challenges of crypto + AI applications:https://t.co/ds9mLnshLU \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2024\n\nIn particular, he tried to answer a question that he claims to receive often, namely what are the intersections between crypto and AI that he considers most fruitful.\n\nThe intersection between crypto and artificial intelligence (AI), according to Vitalik Buterin\n\nAccording to Buterin, blockchain and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly powerful, with a growing number of use cases at the intersection of the two areas.\n\nVitalik, however, also points out that some of these use cases make much more sense and are much more robust than others, while others are less interesting or less solid.\n\nHe states that he believes that the most promising and easiest to implement are those in which the underlying mechanism continues to be designed more or less as before, but the individual actors become AI, allowing the mechanism to operate effectively on a much smaller scale.\n\nInstead, he believes that the most difficult applications to manage correctly are those that attempt to use blockchain and crypto techniques to create a \u201csingleton\u201d, that is, a single decentralized and reliable artificial intelligence.\n\nActually, he says he still considers these latest applications promising, both in terms of functionality and improving AI security, but they suffer from greater risks of failure and require more caution.\n\nThe projects between crypto and artificial intelligence mentioned by Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe most mentioned crypto project in this article is Worldcoin, whose team Buterin thanks for the collaboration in writing the post together with Modulus Labs, Xinyuan Sun, Martin Koeppelmann, and Illia Polosukhin.\n\nWorldcoin is indeed a project somehow connected to ChatGPT, although it is not a project directly based on artificial intelligence.\n\nWorldcoin is a project carried out by the Worldcoin Foundation, which is a special non-profit company based in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe most well-known co-founder of the project is Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nSpeaking specifically about artificial intelligence, Buterin states that he believes the project that has done the most to reduce black-box attacks by limiting who or what can query an AI model is Worldcoin.\n\nIn fact, the project extensively uses artificial intelligence models at the protocol level, to convert iris scans into short \u201ciris codes\u201d that are easy to compare for similarity, and to verify that the object being scanned is indeed a human being.\n\nIn addition, it does not allow anyone to simply access the artificial intelligence model, but it uses reliable hardware to ensure that the model only accepts digitally signed inputs from enabled cameras.\n\nBut then he also adds that it is not guaranteed that this approach will work, because it is possible to launch attacks against biometric AI using physical patches or jewelry on the face.\n\nIt also mentions other crypto projects somehow related to AI, but without going into detail.\n\nCrypto-AI applications\n\nButerin has identified four categories in which there are potential overlaps between AI and blockchain.\n\nThe first, considered the most feasible one, is that of applications where artificial intelligence acts as a player in a game. For example, these are the applications where the ultimate source of incentives comes from a protocol with human input, such as prediction markets.\n\nThe second one, with high potential but high risks, is that of applications in which artificial intelligence acts as a game interface.\n\nFor example, these are applications where artificial intelligence is used to help users understand the crypto world around them, such as those that can help identify scams.\n\nThe third one is that of applications in which artificial intelligence establishes and controls the rules of the game, for example to help DAOs make subjective decisions.\n\nFinally, the last one is related to the use of artificial intelligence to establish the objective of the game, namely long-term strategies that involve the use of blockchains as infrastructure to build better artificial intelligence models.\n\nConcrete applications\n\nFrom Buterin\u2019s reasoning, specific concrete applications of the blockchain in relation to activities carried out by artificial intelligence do not emerge.\n\nWhat emerges are development potentials, and projects that are trying to do something about it. For example, Worldcoin uses the blockchain only to issue a token.\n\nIn fact, not by chance, it also invites developers to proceed with caution in this direction, precisely because these are new developments not without risks.\n\nThis is effectively a pioneering field of blockchain usage, also because the artificial intelligence sector itself is still in a pioneering phase.\n\nIn addition, the use of AI in the crypto field also generates challenges, such as potential overloads and contradictory machine learning.\n\nThe volume of operations that an AI model typically performs is enormous, to the point that it would be a problem to bring them all onto the blockchain.\n\nIn addition, it is often impossible to accurately understand all the steps of reasoning carried out by an artificial intelligence, making it difficult or even impossible to predict all the outcomes with precision.\n\nIn short, we are still far from being able to have widespread use of artificial intelligence in the crypto world, even though the potential is there."

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to allow exchange-traded funds to hold the cryptocurrency Ethereum in May, Standard Chartered predicts.\n\nMay 23 is the last date by which the agency must consider ETF applications from VanEck and Ark 21Shares, the bank said in a research report Tuesday. The asset managers will be the first to come up against the final deadline.\n\nStandard Chartered expects the SEC to rule on the applications on the final date, as it did on January 10, when it approved 10 Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum has key similarities to Bitcoin's legal and financial status that suggests it will follow a similar approval pattern, according to Geoff Kendrick, the head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered.\n\nLast June, the SEC left Bitcoin and Ether off a list of 67 tokens it considered to be securities. In addition, Ether \u2014 like Bitcoin \u2014 also has futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \u2014 a key surveillance tool. At about $285 billion (roughly Rs. 23,66,701 crore), Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value after Bitcoin.\n\nKendrick expects Ether's price to rise to $4,000 (roughly Rs. 3,32,168) by the projected May 23 approval date, assuming that it follows a trading pattern similar to Bitcoin through the ETF approval process. Ether traded at about $2,370 (roughly Rs. 1,96,809) on Tuesday.\n\nThat price prediction, however, is based on multiple assumptions being true, including general market sentiment for approval remaining low, implied-volatility being wrong, and the SEC approving multiple applications on the same day.\n\nEther is expected to avoid much of the selloffs that Bitcoin experienced post-ETF approval, Standard Chartered said. Bitcoin fell as much as 20 percent following the ETF approval as investors, including FTX, sold billions in holdings of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The fund was converted from a trust that holders couldn't make redemptions. Grayscale's existing Ethereum trust holds a smaller portion of the total market capitalization of Ether, compared with the Bitcoin held in GBTC.\n\n\u201cThese factors should make ETH less vulnerable than BTC to a post-approval selloff,\u201d Kendrick wrote.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg LP\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Celebrates Birthday: \"My Childhood Is Over\" - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Today, on his 30th birthday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared a moving post reflecting on the last couple of years of his life and the evolving crypto space that made him re-evaluate his role within the community.\n\nThe End Of An Era For Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin, who just three years ago was making all the headlines as the youngest billionaire at 27, reflected on his post about the role he used to have as a young developer in the crypto space. He recalled spending the last two years speaking with a new generation that has taken leading roles within the crypto space to organize and develop it further, the same way he did a decade ago.\n\nThis experience has made the Ethereum founder realize his progression into a more established position in the crypto community, as he explained:\n\nBut watching all of these people go further than I did, younger than I did, made me clearly realize that if that was ever my role, it is no longer. I am now in some different kind of role, and it is time for the next generation to take up the mantle that used to be mine.\n\nIn the post, Buterin explored his journey to reach and embrace this new role, citing that \u201cA person\u2019s identity is always tied to their role in the broader world that they are operating in, and over a decade, not only does a person change but so does the world around them.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s previous mathematic and economic-driven thinking changed after realizing that he spent the first five years of his crypto life looking for what \u201cwas impossible\u201d and not modeling the variables that truly made a difference \u201cbetween existing flawed systems succeeding or failing\u201d in practice.\n\nThough still present in his life, this once pivotal part of his identity doesn\u2019t take as big of a role in his writing or thinking.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder shares he\u2019s never been a high-agency person, and throughout his life, most of his decisions have not been driven by \u201cconviction.\u201d Instead, \u201cMost of my decisions in Ethereum involved responding to other people\u2019s pressures and requests,\u201d as he explained.\n\nButerin recalled several significant events in the world and the crypto space, such as the war in Ukraine and the FTX collapse, as the catalyst for the change of view on his role. Convulsions, as he calls them, like the fall of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, made him realize that most of the people he had looked up to and used as guidance in the crypto space back in 2014 were no more.\n\nAs he explained, it also made him understand that his passive participation within the community was a luxury he no longer had.\n\nThese two events, as different as they are in the type and the scale of their tragedy, both burned into my mind a similar lesson: that I actually have responsibilities in this world, and I need to be intentional about how I operate. Doing nothing, or living on autopilot and letting myself simply become part of the plans of others, is not an automatically safe, or even blameless, course of action. I was one of the mystical other people, and it was up to me to play the part. (\u2026) And so I decided to become careful in which of others\u2019 plans I go along with, and more high-agency in what plans I craft myself.\n\nHappy birthday to @VitalikButerin!\n\nIt's been awesome to know you these 30 years!!\n\nThank you for being the amazing human that you are \u2013\n\nfor your bright ideas,\n\nyour passion and leadership,\n\nyour innocence and kindness,\n\nyour joyful silliness!\n\n\ud83e\udd73\u2764\ufe0f\n\nP.S. Two more years to the big\u2026 pic.twitter.com/E0MtJfglnw \u2014 dima.eth (@dimabuterin) January 31, 2024\n\nThe Birth Of A New Crypto Space\n\nVitalik Buterin addressed his view on the changes the crypto space has undergone since its birth in 2008. In the last fifteen years, \u201cthe broader public discourse as a whole seems to have to a large extent moved beyond caring about money and banks,\u201d he said, later wondering if the \u201coriginal \u2018story\u2019 of crypto\u201d is falling further behind the times.\n\nButerin addressed this concern by proposing two \u201csensible responses to this conundrum.\u201d He believes the ecosystem would benefit from, first, \u201creminding people that money and finance still do matter,\u201d and second, \u201cextending beyond finance, and use our technology to build a more holistic version of an alternative, more free and open and democratic tech stack.\u201d\n\nButerin emphasized crypto\u2019s advantage over other industries as \u201cone of the few tech industries that is genuinely highly decentralized, with developers spread out all over the globe.\u201d This advantage offers the opportunity to help solve sustainably the ever-present problem that many people still face in accessing money and finance around the globe.\n\nRather than just focusing on money, or being an \u201cinternet of value\u201d, I argued that the Ethereum community should expand its horizons.\n\nAccording to Buterin, a more trustworthy, democratic, and decentralized tech stack would help evolve the crypto space to properly address the concerns and needs of the 21st century, allowing crypto to be part of a broader technology-driven story instead of \u201cjust a finance story.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin concluded his birthday post by reflecting on the ever-changing nature of the world and the \u2018rebirth\u2019 of his role in the crypto space:\n\nFor me, 2023 has been a year of watching many things, large and small, fade into the distance of time. The world is rapidly changing, the frameworks I am forced to use to try to make sense of the world are changing, and the role I play in affecting the world is changing. There is death, a truly inevitable type of death that will continue to be with us even after the blight of human biological aging and mortality is purged from our civilization, but there is also birth and rebirth. And continuing to stay active and doing what we can to create the new is a task for each one of us.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,300.\n\nETH is trading at $2,309.66 in the hourly chart.

        "title": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is optimistic about the future of blockchain and AI but warns there are pitfalls both industries must avoid in their blossoming relationship - Blockhead",
        "content": "As revolutionary as Web3 might be, artificial intelligence (AI) has been unapologetically stealing its thunder. And rightly so. The likes of ChatGPT have seamlessly placed the next-gen text right into the palms of your everyday user. None of that wallet creation, gas fees, and general rabbit hole venturing that comes with stepping into Web3.\n\nWhile AI technology dates back to the 1950s, recent advancements have enabled AI to demonstrate its purpose to even the most tech-phobic user. Once seen as a dystopian dream, AI has proven to be a capable, efficient, and innovative disrupter of industries.\n\nBut are AI and cryptocurrency mutually exclusive? Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin says no. In a lengthy blog post, Buterin dissects the intersection between the two disruptive technologies.\n\nPlayer in the Game\n\nAI has the capability of sharpening human decisions and actions. Buterin argues that AI-driven arbitrage bots in decentralized exchanges can exploit opportunities more efficiently than humans.\n\nTiming the market has long been a next-to-near-impossible task for your average trader. As Buterin highlights, market participants are often \"irrational\" and people with the \"right knowledge\" are not willing to \"take the time and bet unless a lot of money is involved.\"\n\nIntroducing AIOmen, Buterin says AI is already being used to predict the market. These AI bots are cost-effective too, working for less than $1 per hour whilst being armed with an encyclopedic knowledge database.\n\n\"If you make a market, and put up a liquidity subsidy of $50, humans will not care enough to bid, but thousands of AIs will easily swarm all over the question and make the best guess they can,\" Buterin explains.\n\nHe further added that once \"prediction markets\" are perfected, the technology can be used for a broad range of questions including investigating whether certain dApps are scams and the validity of wallets and accounts.\n\nInterface to the Game\n\nSecurity is crucial to digital assets but yet is an area the industry struggles with. Buterin highlights a couple of mechanisms already deployed by the industry including Metamask's scam detection feature and Rabby's wallet simulation feature.\n\nHe suggests that these security tools \"could be super-charged with AI,\" offering a \"much richer human-friendly explanation of what kind of dapp you are participating in.\" AI can help the user understand what exactly they are signing and whether the project is genuine.\n\nHowever, he also warns that \"pure AI interfaces are probably too risky at the moment as it increases the risk of other kinds of errors.\" For example, scammers would also have access to the same AI assistants the users have and thus could manipulate it by bypassing scam detection.\n\nRules of the game\n\nStarting with a disclaimer that this application of AI is the \"most risky,\" Buterin warns that \"we need to tread the most carefully\" when implementing AI in rule-making.\n\nButerin explains that there is already excitement about AI judges in the real world, and blockchain developers are looking to implement these features into the likes of smart contracts and DAOs.\n\nNew monster post: my own current perspective on the recent debates around techno-optimism, AI risks, and ways to avoid extreme centralization in the 21st century.https://t.co/6lN2fLBUUL pic.twitter.com/h5aIyFNCoh \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 27, 2023\n\nHe warns that such machine learning is going to present a tough challenge because: \"if an AI model that plays a key role in a mechanism is closed, you can't verify its inner workings, and so it's no better than a centralized application. If the AI model is open, then an attacker can download and simulate it locally, and design heavily optimized attacks to trick the model, which they can then replay on the live network.\"\n\nButerin believes that zero-knowledge proofs and cryptography cannot solve this issue either. AI is already computationally-intensive so Buterin questions whether pushing AI inside cryptographic black boxes is even viable. Additionally, optimizing attacks against AI models is achievable without in-depth knowledge about the model's internal workings but if too much is hidden, \"you risk making it too easy for whoever chooses the training data to corrupt the model with poisoning attacks.\"\n\nObjective of the Game\n\nAI utility can extend beyond blockchains. Buterin points towards NEAR, which aims to become \"a fully sovereign operating system that is equipped with a personal AI assistant that optimizes for users\u2019 needs without revealing private information about the user\u2019s data or assets,\" according to NEAR co-founder, Illia Polosukhin.\n\nButerin says that \"trustworthy black-box AIs\" can be used to iron out system bias or cheating, working towards a democratic governance for systemically-important AIs. \"Cryptographic and blockchain-based techniques could be a path toward doing that,\" he writes.\n\nDecentralized AI that has a natural kill switch would also address concerns that bad actors are using AI for malicious behavior.\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, Buterin is optimistic about the relationship between blockchain and AI. In particular, Buterin believes that individual players becoming AIs while allowing mechanisms to operate on a micro-scale is the most promising.\n\nThe biggest challenge is using blockchains and cryptographic techniques to create a single decentralized trusted AI. \"These applications have promise, both for functionality and for improving AI safety in a way that avoids the centralization risks associated with more mainstream approaches to that problem,\" Buterin warns, adding that there are many ways these underlying assumptions can fail.\n\nElsewhere"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, briefly managed to rise above the $43,000 mark before dipping below once again early Thursday. The US Fed\u2019s call to maintain interest rates appears to have lent a sense of stability in prices. Other top coins, including the likes of \u2014 Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor losses across the board. The SATS (1000SATS) token emerged to be the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of over 5 percent. Jupiter (JUP), on the other hand, became the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of over 60 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.51 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 8.43 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $42,051.28, registering a 24-hour dip of 2.05 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

Despite a brief surge, Bitcoin couldn't sustain the momentum. Despite attempts by bears to push the price down, bulls defended the territory above $42,000. Ethereum is trading in line with Bitcoin, and there's a likelihood it will oscillate between $2,100 and $2,400 in the near future.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cBitcoin is headed for a third consecutive red day, trading near the $42k mark even as the Federal Reserve of the US kept the interest rates unchanged \u2014 exactly as per the expectation of the market. However, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments yesterday, several big analysts like Goldman Sachs are now predicting that the Fed will start cutting rates from May this year instead of March, which could be a big reason why bears have taken some control in shorter time frames. In larger time frames, however, the BTC structure remains bullish and the current trend line supports remain at $39.3k.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cThe Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates thwarted expectations of cuts, impacting Bitcoin's valuation, now potentially encountering resistance at $40,000. The next hurdle for Bitcoin lies at $40,000 before a potential easing of selling pressure. A surge in demand, driven by reduced supply through BTC ETF access, could be the forthcoming catalyst. Currently, Bitcoin has registered a 2.25% decline in the last 24 hours, settling at $41,998.72, with a 4.79% gain over the past week. Ethereum trades at $2,257.09, reflecting a 3.59% drop in 24 hours but a 1.06% increase over the week. Bitcoin's technical indicators present a mixed outlook. Moving averages signal a \"Buy,\" while the Ichimoku Base Line remains neutral. RSI at 49 suggests a neutral stance, with Stochastic %K at 75 and ADX at 16 reflecting neutrality. MACD at -173 indicates a \"Buy,\" while Stochastic RSI and William's Percentage suggest a neutral outlook.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's recent drop below $43,000 followed a hawkish stance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, suggesting a March rate cut is unlikely. This stance prompted a market reevaluation, reducing the likelihood of an imminent rate cut. However, the broader economic environment favours Bitcoin in 2024 with expectations of a possible Fed rate cut, which traditionally boosts cryptocurrencies. Amid short-term fluctuations, investor confidence persists, supported by several optimistic factors. The emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs, along with massive demand for new offerings from BlackRock and Fidelity, is easing selling pressures. Additionally, expectations surrounding the April halving of Bitcoin and potential supportive US political and fiscal dynamics add to the bullish outlook. Despite the near-term uncertainty, Bitcoin's price trajectory is set for a potential rally to the low $50,000s, outweighing the prospect of a dip to the low $30,000s in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, noted, \"The Crypto market witnessed a fresh decline due to the unchanged interest rates by the Fed. The bullish momentum marked by decrease in grayscale sales and increase in BTC ETF offerings eventually led to a downward trend caused by the unchanged interest levels which represent the 2023 high levels. The Altcoin market also took a downturn which could change unlesss Ethereum breaches $2500 amid other positive macroeconomic factors.\"\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the past 24 hours, the crypto market experienced a shift from positive to slightly bearish conditions, triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain unchanged interest rates. BTC, positioned within its range, is currently situated in the middle, with the rising dominance of BTC causing declines in most of the altcoins. ETH reflects a parallel situation, trading within its established range. Additionally, the market sentiment is influenced by the regular movement of funds through ETFs, contributing to the overall market dynamics.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the nerdy Ethereum co-founder has been seen on X trolling the memecoin ecosystem, although his post was a response to an earlier statement made by an X user identified as fi.\n\nMemecoins Features in Vitalik-Led Banter\n\nEarlier on today, Buterin made a post stating that non-censoring builders be like \u201cI will give up my solo journey unconditionally for you, and I will not be afraid of sacrifice if I am strong for you,\u201d as translated by Google. In return, the X user took a jab at Ethereum holders noting that,\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cIt turns out that you are the luck I want to keep the most. It turns out that we and love were once so close.\u201d\n\nThis statement somewhat connotes forced love for the Ethereum protocol as an innovation hub. The banter continued and this time around, it was directed at memecoin holders. Buterin trolled memecoin holders citing that they sound like \u201cLet\u2019s meow together, meow meow meow meow,\u201d per a Google translation of the post shared in Chinese.\n\nThis statement led to a reaction from crypto community members on X with many elongating the tease as is customary of the playful memecoin world.\n\nmemecoin holders be like \u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u5b66\u732b\u53eb\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u55b5\u55b5\u55b5\u55b5\u55b5 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2024\n\nNotably, Charles Hoskinson\u2019s Cardano had similarly been trolled by community members of other blockchains. While the Ethereum co-founder\u2019s post was more light-hearted, the banter involving Hoskinson is more intense.\n\nIn one of such encounters, Hoskinson was quick to respond to the critics of the Cardano\u2019s chain. To make his argument, the founder of the Layer-1 protocol touted the scalability of the network, closely comparing it to Bitcoin.\n\nMeme Tokens Gaining Traction\n\nMarkedly, this banter comes amidst a growing positive momentum in the memecoin landscape.\n\nMany of the tokens have been seeing significant gains in price. A few days ago, canine-themed memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) registered an 11% price gain. DOGE moved from a 24-hour low of $0.07899 to a price of $0.08818. At the time of this writing, the memecoin is trading at $0.08136.\n\nShiba Inu is equally performing well with a slight price jump, although the positive sentiment is largely attributed to the potential milestones on Shibarium. Myro also markedly recently moved to the position of the third largest memecoin on the Solana network by market capitalization after hitting a new all-time high. The coin soared as high as $0.2607 with extreme growth rates recorded.\n\nSeveral other memecoins have experienced similar upshoots in their prices as well as their user engagement. The community traction from these memecoins underscores why prominent leaders in the industry are having fun with the concept.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

The market's attention is on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision today, widely expected to remain unchanged. Should Bitcoin maintain its current price level until the month's end, it will achieve its fifth consecutive monthly increase, marking the longest streak. This is likely to continue until Bitcoin halving takes place.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cEven as Bitcoin found some resistance near the $43.8k mark, the overall market structure still remains bullish in shorter time frames as well with the immediate strong support lying at $42.3k. All eyes will be on Federal Reserve today as Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged in their interest rate decision meeting today. Interestingly, markets are giving it a 44 percent chance that the Fed will start cutting rates from the next meeting. If the Fed Chair indicates otherwise in his speech, we can say another red day.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cIn terms of momentum, the MACD Level (12, 26) at -164 signals a \u2018Buy.\u2019 The Stochastic RSI Fast (3, 3, 14, 14) at 92 and William's Percentage at -20 both indicate a \u2018Neutral\u2019 position. The market has slipped into a \u2018Neutral\u2019 sentiment after a week of \u2018Greed\u2019 with the price of Bitcoin rising. However, the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision might alter that. The market is on edge awaiting the SEC's interest rate verdict, causing uncertainty about Bitcoin's next support level, contrary to Q4 2023 expectations of a rate cut. Ethereum remains optimistic, poised for a potential ETF approval in May. Altcoins like Litecoin and Astar faced recent declines amid market fluctuations. Despite the current downturn, an impending alt season is anticipated post-Bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market is in a wait-and-watch mode as the Fed meeting on the first interest rate decision of 2024 is underway. A decision to cut the interest rate will boost market liquidity and spark economic activity across sectors, there are some reports that the Fed may keep the rates unchanged. It is important to note that interest rates are at a high level due to continuous hikes in 2023 to tame inflation. Bitcoin is well-positioned to start another growth cycle owing to positive macroeconomic factors.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin rose more than 10% to surpass $43,000 and Ethereum neared $2,500, fueling discussions about price predictions. Grayscale's reduction in bitcoin sales and the performance of the US stock market fueled the rally. Despite the optimism, the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting and January jobs numbers are emerging, weighing on forecasts. Bitcoin's $43,000 recapture boosted its market cap by 2% to $1.66 trillion in 24 hours. Whales piled up more BTC despite a temporary drop to $38,000, giving Bitcoin its fifth consecutive monthly gain. Google's approval of Bitcoin ETF ads marks cryptocurrency mainstreaming, albeit with risks. Ethereum's cautious rally to $2,346.5 with resistance at $2,477.2 and support at $2,240.6 suggests neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. In particular, vigilance is recommended near key points.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the crypto market has witnessed positive momentum, with ETH standing out by outperforming BTC. This surge in ETH is attributed to the smooth implementation of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade on Sepolia. As of now, ETH is positioned slightly below the crucial range resistance level at $2380. The fact that it has reclaimed the 20EMA Daily is a positive indicator. Breaking above this range is pivotal for signalling a potential upward move. On the other hand, BTC has maintained stability, hovering around $43,000. It remains above both the 20 and 50 EMA Daily. For a substantial upside move, BTC needs to overcome the key resistance level at $44,500.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "ETH\n\nRecently deployed on the Sepolia test network, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade is a crucial step towards the anticipated \"proto-danksharding\" feature.\n\nEthereum, a pioneer in blockchain technology, is set for a transformation by deploying the Dencun upgrade on the Sepolia test network. This marks a crucial step toward the anticipated \"proto-dank sharding\" feature, offering a glimpse into Ethereum's future.\n\nBut what exactly is the Dencun upgrade, and how does it promise to enhance the Ethereum network? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n\u200d\n\nEvolution of Ethereum Since 2023\n\nIn order to understand Dencun, let's take a look back at Ethereum's journey. The Shanghai upgrade, implemented on April 12, 2023, brought significant optimizations to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and introduced various protocol enhancements.\n\nThis upgrade aimed to boost gas efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the overall user experience \u2013 a pivotal stride toward Ethereum's scalability and sustainability.\n\nThe Anticipated Dencun Upgrade: A Game-Changer\n\nNow, all eyes are on the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade, representing the next phase in Ethereum's evolution. Comprising enhancements to both the execution layer (Cancun) and the consensus layer (Deneb) of the Ethereum network, Dencun promises substantial changes to scalability, security, and usability.\n\n\u200d\n\nEthereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade Highlights\n\nCancun: Enhancing Scalability\n\nThe Cancun upgrade, focusing on the execution layer, introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at enhancing scalability and optimizing gas efficiency. Notable among them is EIP-1234, adjusting the block reward and delaying the \"difficulty bomb\" to ensure a smooth transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nDeneb: Improving Consensus and Security\n\nThe Deneb upgrade targets the consensus layer, aiming to enhance security and consensus mechanisms. Key among the EIPs is EIP-2322, upgrading the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm for increased robustness and efficiency.\n\nFinalized EIPs for Implementation\n\nSeveral finalized EIPs will be implemented, including:\n\nEIP-1559: Introducing a new fee structure to improve user experience and reduce transaction fees.\n\nEIP-2929: Enhancing security by increasing the cost of certain operations to deter potential attacks.\n\nEIP-2537: Proposing a new Ethereum-specific opcode for more efficient contract verification of elliptic curve signatures.\n\n\u200d\n\nExpected Benefits of Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade holds deep promise for the ecosystem:\n\nIncreased Security\n\nImplementing EIPs such as 4788, 6780, and 7514, Dencun addresses security concerns at both the user application and consensus levels. Measures include incorporating the parent beacon block root into the execution layer, optimizing opcode functionalities, and introducing a temporary solution for validator bloat.\n\nImproved Staking Experience\n\nOn the consensus layer, EIP-7044 and EIP-7045 aim to enhance the staking user experience and block confirmation times. The validity of voluntary exits in delegated staking will be perpetual, and validators will have more time to submit attestations, contributing to faster confirmation times.\n\nEnhanced Cost Efficiency\n\nIntroducing EIP-5656 and EIP-1153, the Cancun upgrade adds new opcodes to benefit dApp developers. These opcodes improve gas cost optimization, making smart contracts more efficient with zero trade-offs and introducing transient storage for communication within complex transactions.\n\n\u200d\n\nProto-Danksharding: Scaling Ethereum Further\n\nA significant advancement in Dencun is the introduction of danksharding and proto-danksharding, aimed at scaling the Ethereum blockchain and improving its efficiency. Danksharding involves dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller \"blobs,\" enabling parallel processing for enhanced scalability.\n\nProto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, builds upon this concept, expanding storage capacity for more efficient data processing and reduced gas fees for layer-2 solutions.\n\n\u200d\n\nDencun Upgrade Timeline\n\nInitially planned for late 2023, deployment and consensus issues pushed the Dencun upgrade to 2024. The public testnet timeline is as follows:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThe Sepolia testnet has ended, and developers are encouraged to move to Holesky for future workloads. The mainnet launch is expected in early or mid-March, with flexibility depending on the smooth progression of implementations."
