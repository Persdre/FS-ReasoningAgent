        "content": "In what could be a pivotal development, anticipation is mounting as experts speculate on the imminent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. For example, Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store, has sparked discussion on X by suggesting that approval could come next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeraci's prediction aligns with the sentiments of industry insiders such as Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas, who foresees an ETF debut as early as July 2, strategically timed to coincide with the U.S. Independence Day holiday.\n\nI\u2019m deciphering this as spot eth ETFs will be approved this week\u2026\n\n\n\nJust me tho. https://t.co/rFrMThytgC Advertisement June 23, 2024\n\nMoreover, former SEC official Jay Clayton echoed the prevailing industry sentiment, reinforcing expectations for imminent approvals.\n\nWhen, not if\n\nThe Ethereum ETF saga unfolds against a backdrop of growing institutional interest in the crypto market, particularly BTC and ETH as two major assets.\n\nCurrently, the SEC is reviewing revised proposals from major asset managers, including VanEck, BlackRock, Grayscale and Invesco Galaxy Digital. These filings, which follow recent updates to their S-1 reports, had also disclosed a management fee in particular.\n\nInterestingly, amid the buzz, Hashdex, a notable player in the ETF arena, has withdrawn its application for a spot Ethereum ETF without disclosing reasons or future plans, but presented a mixed Ethereum and Bitcoin solution.\n\nFor now, all eyes remain on the SEC's upcoming decisions, which could mark a significant milestone in the integration of crypto into the TradFi markets. With speculation high and anticipation building, next week promises to be a potential turning point for Ethereum ETFs."

        "title": "Who Holds The Most Ethereum (ETH) in 2024? - Benzinga",
        "content": "SHORT ANSWER: The Beacon Deposit Contract has emerged as the dominant force, holding a staggering 38% of all ETH.\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to power decentralized applications and fuel innovation. But who are the whales holding the vast majority of Ethereum? In 2024, the landscape of major ethereum holders might have shifted. This guide dives into the latest data, revealing the key players \u2014 from individual investors to institutional giants \u2014 who control the most ETH. Join us as we unveil the hidden forces shaping the ethereum ecosystem and explore the potential implications for the future of this dynamic cryptocurrency.\n\nWho Owns the Most Ethereum?\n\nWith the recent ethereum merge transitioning the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a new player has emerged as the biggest ethereum (ETH) holder: the Beacon Chain Deposit Contract. This contract allows users to stake their ETH on the Beacon Chain, the foundation of Ethereum 2.0. This shift to PoS likely explains the Beacon Deposit Contract's significant holding, currently sitting at over 46 million ETH, representing a whopping 38% of all ether. This translates to a staggering value of approximately $165 billion at the time of writing. Essentially, users have locked their ETH in the contract to contribute to the security and validation of transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nTop 10 Ethereum Holders\n\nLet\u2019s explore the top 10 Ethereum holder of current times:\n\n1. Beacon Deposit Contract\n\nThe Ethereum Merge to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) created a powerful new dynamic with the Beacon Deposit Contract. This contract lets users stake their ETH on the Beacon Chain, the core of Ethereum 2.0. This explains the Beacon Deposit Contract's massive holding \u2014 over 46 million ETH, a huge 30% of all Ethereum! Worth roughly $165 billion, users essentially locked their ETH to secure and validate ethereum transactions.\n\n2. Wrapped Ether Contract\n\nWrapped ether (WETH) plays a key role in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Since regular ETH isn't compatible with these platforms, WETH acts as a \u201cwrapped\u201d version that functions as an ERC-20 token. This allows users to seamlessly use their ETH on DeFi apps like Uniswap. Notably, the value of WETH remains identical to regular ETH, offering increased functionality without impacting price. Interestingly, the WETH contract holds a significant amount of ether, currently sitting at over 2.84 million ETH, making it the second-largest holder in the network.\n\n3. Binance 7\n\nBinance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is also a major Ethereum (ETH) holder. Surprisingly, just three of its main ETH addresses (Binance 7, 8, and 28) collectively hold over 3.2 million ETH, making them the network's third-largest holder. These addresses manage exchange functions and bridge ETH between Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum. The bridged ETH resides in the \u201cPeg Tokens\u201d address until it's withdrawn back to the Ethereum network.\n\n4. Arbitrum: Bridge\n\nArbitrum, a popular ethereum scaling solution, is emerging as a significant ETH holder. This technology allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy smart contracts on a faster and cheaper network compared to Ethereum's mainnet. At the heart of Arbitrum lies its bridge contract, currently holding over 1.8 million ETH. This positions the bridge as the network's fourth-largest ETH holder. As Arbitrum gains traction due to its cost efficiency, this holding will likely increase further.\n\n5. Robinhood\n\nRobinhood, the popular trading app known for its commission-free stock trading, also holds a surprising amount of Ethereum. Despite some past controversies, Robinhood is the 5th largest individual holder of Ethereum, with nearly 1.4 million ETH under a single wallet address. This means Robinhood is a major player in the ethereum world, holding a large amount of this cryptocurrency.\n\n6. Kraken\n\nDespite facing SEC charges related to staking options, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken ranks as a major Ethereum holder. Their \u201cKraken 13\" wallet alone holds over 850,000 ETH, making it the 6th largest individual holder. Given Kraken's high trading volume, they likely hold even more ETH in smaller amounts across other wallets, though these wouldn't be on the top 100 individual address lists.\n\n7. Base: Base Portal\n\nNewcomer Base Portal is making waves in the Ethereum world. This project acts as a bridge, allowing users to move their ethereum (ETH) between different blockchains easily. Interestingly, Base Portal holds a significant amount of ETH, currently ranking as the 7th largest individual holder with over 504,000 ETH. This substantial holding suggests Base Portal might play a vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem, but it's still too early to say for certain.\n\n8. Bitfinex 19\n\nAnother major exchange by volume, Bitfinex, stands at 8th position and holds a significant amount of ETH scattered across five top 100 addresses: Bitfinex 19, MultiSig 3, 20, 15, and 5. These collectively hold around 2 million ETH. Two addresses likely serve trading and exchange functions, while the \u201cMultiSig 3\" address might be their secure cold storage wallet due to its multi-signature nature.\n\n9. Gemini\n\nThe Gemini exchange, founded by the Winklevoss twins, is a major ethereum player. Their single wallet address ranks 9th largest holder, containing over 369,000 ETH. This positions Gemini as one of the top exchanges for holding ether, showcasing their confidence in this cryptocurrency.\n\n10. EthDev\n\nThe nonprofit ethereum Foundation oversees Ethereum's development. ETHDEV, a separate group of developers in cities like London and Berlin, acts as the project's development arm. As Ethereum matured, other organizations like ConsenSys joined the ecosystem to tackle specific areas. This division of labor allows focused development and benefits the entire ethereum network. Interestingly, ETHDEV holds over 309,000 ETH, ranking 10th among the largest ether holders.\n\nThe Largest Holders are Contracts, Not People\n\nThe landscape of major ETH holders has shifted significantly in 2024. The Beacon Deposit Contract, a product of the ethereum merge, has emerged as the dominant force, holding a staggering 38% of all ETH. This reflects users' commitment to securing the network by staking their ETH. Wrapped ethereum (WETH), crucial for DeFi applications, sits at number two with over 2.8 million ETH. Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kraken are also major players, holding significant amounts across multiple wallets. Interestingly, newcomer Base Portal and the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange showcase the growing involvement of diverse players in the ethereum ecosystem. While the distribution of ETH ownership highlights its decentralized nature, the Beacon Deposit Contract's dominance underscores the critical role users play in securing the ethereum network.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Set to Skyrocket to $150 Again, Ethereum (ETH) Huge Gains Ahead? Massive Reversal Pattern Formed, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Stealth 20% Surge - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana could be aiming at the $150 price threshold once again as the price starts showing reversal potential after reaching the 200 EMA. The trend flattening is often one of the first signs of an upcoming price reversal. However, it is important to stay cautious as in the midterm, Solana is still in a downtrend.\n\nThe SOL/ETH chart indicates that Solana has been steadily declining over the last several months, but there may be a shift in store as of late. The price has bounced back somewhat after touching the 200 EMA, which has served as a support level. This suggests that bullish momentum may be developing.\n\nNear the oversold area at about 35 is where the RSI is currently trading. This could mean that buyers are about to intervene and that the selling pressure is lessening. The MACD histogram also exhibits indications of a possible bullish crossover. An increase in purchasing activity is indicated by volume analysis, which may be good news for Solana.\n\nGiven the large uptick in volume bars, it appears that traders are beginning to stockpile SOL at these lower price points. Despite these encouraging indicators, it is critical to recognize the difficulties Solana may encounter while recovering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's reversal potential\n\nEthereum could be forming a ground for a price surge as the second-biggest cryptocurrency enters the falling wedge pattern formation in addition to relying on the 50 EMA. At this technical threshold, Ethereum could easily perform a reversal.\n\nThe falling wedge pattern is usually interpreted as a bullish reversal pattern indicating that an upward movement may be approaching and that the downtrend may be coming to an end. According to Ethereum's recent price action, the pattern's peak, which typically comes before a breakout, is getting closer. The blue line on the chart, the 50 EMA, has served as an important level of support. The fact that Ethereum's price has repeatedly rebounded from this level suggests that there is significant buying interest in this vicinity.\n\nEthereum's chances of a bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern are greatly increased if it can hold this support. The relative strength index or RSI is currently trading close to 46, suggesting that Ethereum is neither overbought nor oversold.\n\nEthereum has the freedom to rise from this neutral position without being under a lot of selling pressure. Volume analysis indicates that buying activity is gradually increasing, indicating that traders are starting to accumulate Ethereum at these prices. The possibility of a bullish reversal is further supported by the fact that this accumulation phase frequently comes before a notable price movement.\n\nShiba Inu's last hope?\n\nDespite the enormous 25% price drop we saw on Shiba Inu, there is still some hope for a reversal at around $0.000018. However, a quick glance at the trading volume of Shiba Inu clearly shows that it is not the most favorable asset on the market right now.\n\nRecently, Shiba Inu's price dropped by 25%, indicating a significant decline. SHIB is now at a critical support level at $0.000018 due to the drop. This stage may serve as a possible turning point in the event that buyers intervene. Nevertheless, SHIB's trading volume has been comparatively low, suggesting that there isn't currently a lot of buying interest.\n\nOne significant element that could impede a speedy recovery is this low volume. Right now, the relative strength index (RSI) is circling the oversold area. This can suggest that a reversal is imminent and that the selling pressure may have been overdone. Nevertheless, a reversal cannot be ensured by the RSI alone \u2014 higher buying volume is required.\n\nResistant moves have been made by the moving averages, especially the 50 EMA. In order to verify a reversal, SHIB must make a significant volume breakout above these moving averages.\n\nEven though the Shiba Inu market is currently difficult, there is some hope because of the support level at $0.000018. We could witness a 20% increase if SHIB can maintain this support and return toward the moving average.\n\nAn important role is also played by the larger cryptocurrency market. SHIB may benefit if Ethereum and Bitcoin begin to rebound."

        "title": "Securities and cryptocurrencies: The SEC drops the Ethereum case, but continues to pursue Ripple - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The latest news from the crypto market talks about new developments in the respective cases of the SEC against Ripple and Ethereum in relation to the security token issue.\n\nThe federal agency of the United States has definitively abandoned all investigations on the Ethereum Foundation, determining that ETH does not fall within the definition of security and thus preparing for the asset\u2019s entry into U.S. exchange-traded funds.\n\nIn the meantime, the dispute against Ripple continues, with the SEC requesting a fine of over 100 million dollars, awaiting the resolution of the case at the trial that will determine once and for all if XRP should be considered a financial security or not.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nThe SEC concludes investigations on ETH: everything ready for the launch of spot ETFs\n\nAccording to recent reports from the cryptographic developer Consensys, the SEC is about to drop all investigations into the Ethereum Foundation, first initiated in March 2023 with the intention of classifying ETH as a security token.\n\nAs reported within the post \u201cEthereum has survived the SEC\u201d and now the insiders of the well-known blockchain of smart contracts will be able to build freely without having to worry about regulatory limitations.\n\nThis very important milestone for the sector comes after Consensys had sued the SEC on April 25, only to renegotiate with the agency on June 7, requesting the case to be closed.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nETH no longer considered a financial commodity, after 6 years in which the SEC has repeatedly changed its mind on the matter. Initially, in fact, in 2018 it expressed opposition to this connection, only to return to accuse the issuers of the currency of selling unregistered securities after the chain\u2019s consensus mechanism transitioned from PoW to PoS.\n\nTo tell the truth, even Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commission, has never given a clear and precise definition regarding Ethereum, while he had expressed himself in a much more convinced manner for other cryptographic products such as those offered by Ripple, Cardano, and Dash.\n\nDuring a testimony to Congress last year, he indeed refused to answer the question of whether ETH fell under the definition of security and if it meets the requirements of the Howey Test.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC Chair Gensler refuses to answer if Ethereum $ETH is a commodity or a security while testifying before congress. pic.twitter.com/IkDTgNrfix \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 18, 2023\n\nNow that the SEC has closed the investigations on Ethereum, we can officially prepare for the listing of the cryptocurrency in the spot ETF markets in the United States.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission had already approved this kind of financial products with underlying ether in May, but the S-1 applications of the registrants were not given the green light.\n\nThe landing of exchange-traded funds for ETH could now be very close: indicatively the listing is expected by the beginning of autumn but it could also arrive in the coming weeks.\n\nThe asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise are getting ready by starting to release the first promotional videos of the next investment offering, implying that it is only a matter of time before Ethereum makes an appearance on Wall Street.\n\nUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024\n\nDespite the victory against the SEC in a historic lawsuit, Consensys warns that the broader web3 sector could still be under the watchful eye of the federal agency.\n\nAs reported in a post from last week:\n\n\u201cThe closure of the Ethereum investigation is important, but it is not a cure for the numerous blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under the SEC\u2019s illegal and aggressive cryptocurrency enforcement regime.\u201d\n\nThe SEC abandons Ethereum, but continues the case against Ripple: the 100 million dollar fine\n\nOne of the cryptocurrency companies still in the eye of the storm is Ripple, with the SEC motivated to classify XRP as a security despite a court having refuted this connection last year.\n\nAt this moment the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission is asking the company that manages the issuance of the cryptocurrency, for compensation of 102.6 million dollars after reducing the amount from an initial fine set at 2 billion dollars for selling XRP without a license.\n\nRipple refuses to give in to this bullismo, and has recently proposed a fine of 10 million dollars, citing the agreement with Terraform Labs as justification. However, the SEC has countered that such a low fine \u201cwould not meet the purposes of civil penalty laws.\u201d\n\nThe regulator has indeed clarified that Terraform Labs has agreed to destroy \u201cthe keys to all its securities in crypto assets\u201d, \u201creturn a significant amount to investors in those securities\u201d, and remove \u201ctwo of the board members in command at the time of the violations\u201d.\n\nAs stated by the SEC itself:\n\n\u201cRipple also confronts the dimension of the sanction of Terraform with the amount of the \u2018gross sales\u2019 of that defendant, arguing that the Court should impose the same ratio (1.27%). But this is not an apples-to-apples comparison\u201d\n\nIn the middle of this debate, last week Judge Phyllis Hamilton dismissed at least the 4 compensation claims in separate class actions, while still keeping the main case alive to label Ripple\u2019s token as an unregistered security.\n\nIn particular, Hamilton focused on the fact that Brad Garlinghouse, founder of the accused company, had insistently promoted the currency in 2017 while he himself was proceeding to sell large shares on the market.\n\nThe promotional activity of Ripple which Judge Hamilton may be treating with more weight than Judge Torres could give the expectation. There seems to be some additional evidence of promotional statements before Judge Hamilton. The whole remaining cause of action going forward\u2026 https://t.co/Cd1RS4xQgX \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2024\n\nDespite Judge Annalisa Torres having previously closed the XRP-security case, now everything seems to be back in the spotlight: the ball is now in the court of the trial, which will decide whether to classify Ripple\u2019s digital currency used for cross-border payments as a financial security.\n\nThe SEC is trying to assert itself by instilling fear in the entire digital token industry, in order to \u201cdiscourage future misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector\u201c.\n\nIn the meantime, while the federal agency limits the expansion of the crypto sector with these attempts at destabilization, more and more famous personalities and US celebrities are illegally promoting tokens linked to their name, which inevitably end up causing their investors to lose money."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Price Going To Crash Below $3,000 Support? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has faced intense selling pressure in the past couple of weeks despite starting June above $3,800. May was a bullish month for Ether which soared almost touching $4,000, thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nodding to spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe downturn to $3,300 in the last two weeks can be attributed to the larger macro environment. Investors in the crypto market have not been too amused by the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish stance on interest rate cuts.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis coupled with increased profit taking ahead off the start of the actual trading of the spot ETF has seen Ethereum price dive toward the $3,000 mark.\n\nShould the selling pressure increase this week, ETH price might fall below $3,000. Such a move could lead to cascading price dips as investors are likely to make irrational decisions to protect their capital.\n\nHowever, in an incoming inflation report in the US, the PCE price index could bring some level of relief to the crypto market. Experts are also looking toward the US election likely to be bullish for crypto later in the year.\n\nWhat To Do As Ethereum Price Grinds Toward $3,000\n\nEthereum is seen struggling to defend support at $3,300 during US business hours on Monday. Key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) validate the downtrend as it falls in the neutral area, getting closer to the oversold region.\n\nThe smart contracts token seems largely disadvantaged based on its position below two key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs); the 20-day and 50-day.\n\nA potential death cross pattern would further destabilize Ethereum. Its occurrence on the daily chart may trigger traders to consider shorting ETH, thus creating more headwinds for the token.\n\nThe area with the most potential for support lies around $3,000 as highlighted by the 200-day EMA. A dive to this level may result in two actions; the first being an immediate rebound toward $4,000 as liquidity is collected or a continued fall below $3,000.\n\nA previous retest of this support at $3,000 extended the correction to $2,800 following the crypto sell-off in April and early May. A similar move is possible and one that may stretch to $2,500.\n\nNevertheless, the expected start of spot Ethereum ETFs trading on July 2 according to insight from analyst Eric Balchunas could be of immense relief to Ethereum.\n\nETFs will expose Ethereum to new markets among institutional investors who may be pressured to seek exposure to the crypto on traditional stock exchanges. Bitcoin rallied, achieving a new all-time high in March after the SEC approved the spot ETFs in January.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the potential to gain momentum with increasing demand from the ETF. Therefore, this could be a good time to buy ETH and speculate on a stronger rebound in July and August.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "July forecasts for the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum: analysis by Ryan Lee of Bitget - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "According to the latest forecasts, in the month of July, the price performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be strongly influenced by a series of economic and market factors.\n\nRyan Lee from Bitget offers a detailed analysis of the main elements that could determine the trends of these two giants of cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nWhat are the price predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future?\n\nAs anticipated, Ryan Lee of Bitget has released important forecasts regarding the price trend of the two well-known cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum. One of the main factors to consider, according to him, is the macroeconomic environment.\n\nRecently, in fact, the net liquidity index of the Federal Reserve (FED) has exceeded 6.5 trillion dollars, releasing 400 billion dollars of liquidity into the market since the end of June.\n\nThis level of liquidity is the highest in the last two years. Furthermore, with the prospect of future interest rate cuts, market liquidity is expected to become even more abundant. Thus favoring a bull trend in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnother positive indicator for the cryptocurrency market is the increase in the market cap of stablecoins, which went from 160 to 162 billion dollars in June. This increase indicates a net inflow of capital into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite a contraction of the overall market cap in June, the increase in stablecoins suggests that leverage in the cryptocurrency market is currently low, leaving room for further bull movements in the future.\n\nKey events: Mt. Gox refunds and spot ETFs on ETH\n\nMoving forward, we see two fundamental events that could significantly influence the prices of BTC and ETH in July. First of all, Mt. Gox has announced that it will start reimbursing BTC and BCH at the beginning of July.\n\nThis refund has raised fears of significant selling pressure, as Mt. Gox has moved 7 billion dollars of assets on the chain. A factor that could potentially cause a substantial drop in BTC prices.\n\nD\u2019altro canto, i progressi sull\u2019ETF Spot su ETH potrebbero avere un impatto positivo su Ethereum. Alla fine di maggio, la SEC ha approvato il deposito 19b-4 e recentemente, Fidelity, 21Shares e Grayscale hanno presentato i moduli S-1 dell\u2019ETH Spot ETF alla SEC.\n\nIt is very likely that the ETF ETH will be officially launched on the US capital market in July. Thus leading traditional funds to directly purchase ETH and potentially determining a bull trend for ETH.\n\nIn summary, it is expected that in the month of July the price range of BTC will be between 58,000 and 73,000 dollars, while the price range of ETH will be between 3,100 and 4,500 dollars.\n\nIt is likely that the ETH/BTC exchange rate will continue its upward rebound, supported by the macroeconomic factors and market events described.\n\nThese developments could determine an interesting dynamic for investors and enthusiasts in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nBitcoin drops to $61,000: brief analysis of the causes of the crash\n\nBitcoin has recently experienced a significant price drop, falling towards the $61,000 level and hitting a new monthly low.\n\nVarious factors have contributed to this decline, including mining activities, Federal Reserve policies, the lack of new inflows, and market indicators.\n\nBTC miners play a crucial role in the recent decline. There has been a significant increase in sales from old wallets, predominantly held by miners, following the recent Bitcoin halving event, which cut daily production from 900 to 450 Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner reserves have dropped to the lowest levels in the last 14 years, with a decrease of 50,000 units since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis month, the miners sold over 30,000 BTC, worth about 2 billion dollars, mainly on the exchanges, directly contributing to the price drop.\n\nFurthermore, the German government has moved 600 million dollars of Bitcoin to the exchanges, selling 200 million dollars in a single day.\n\nWith holdings of approximately 3 billion dollars in Bitcoin, this sudden sell-off, likely induced by financial requirements amid economic pressures, has had a significant impact on the market.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, the spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States recorded the fifth consecutive day of outflows, totaling over 900 million dollars for the week."

        "title": "Incoming Ethereum Price Crash: Analyst Flags Warnings of Spot ETH ETF Launch - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The reaction and market sentiment towards Ethereum spot ETFs is somewhat muted in comparison to when Bitcoin products launched earlier this year.\n\nThese are the findings of crypto entrepreneur and investor Andrew Kang, who published a lengthy analysis of the impact of Ethereum ETFs on X on June 23.\n\nBitcoin ETFs opened the door for many new buyers to make BTC allocations within their portfolios. However, \u201cthe impact of ETH ETFs is a lot less clear-cut,\u201d he said.\n\nETH Price Could Tank\n\nKang estimates that the Ethereum ETF flows will be around 10% to 15% of Bitcoin ETF flows, resulting in roughly $500 million to $1.5 billion in true net buying within six months.\n\nIt was reported last week that Fidelity will seed its Ethereum ETF With $4.7 million, so the buying has already begun. In March, Standard Chartered predicted that inflows would reach $45 billion in the first 12 months of Ethereum ETF trading.\n\nNevertheless, Kang offered several reasons why the impact of an Ethereum ETF is expected to be less significant than that of Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum is seen as more of a tech asset rather than a macro asset like BTC. Additionally, there is less institutional interest and buying pressure for it since the its current valuation metrics, such as the price-earnings ratio, make it harder to justify to traditional finance allocators, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is natural that those deep in the crypto space have a relatively high mind share and buy-in of Ethereum. In reality, it has much less buy-in as a key portfolio allocation for many large groups of non-crypto native capital.\u201d https://t.co/On2KWjAlLx \u2014 Andrew Kang (@Rewkang) June 23, 2024\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s positioning before any ETFs are launched is different from Bitcoin\u2019s as the asset is already up 4x from its lows while BTC was up 2.75x before its ETF launches, he added.\n\nTherefore, Kang expects ETH to trade between $3,000 and $3,800 before the ETF launch but potentially fall to between $2,400 and $3,000 after the launch. A dump to the lower estimate would wipe 30% off the asset\u2019s current value.\n\nHowever, if BTC increases to $100,000 at the end of this year or early next, it could drag Ethereum and altcoins up with it, he predicted.\n\nKang\u2019s bearish Ethereum stance didn\u2019t end there. He expects a continued downtrend for the ETH/BTC ratio over the next year, ranging between 0.035 and 0.06.\n\nETH Prices Dip Below $3,400\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price tumbled in the past 24 hours alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, which remains riddled with uncertainty.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is found trading below $3,400, down 3.4% on the day and 5.3% on the week.\n\nThe rest of the market is also declining. Bitcoin dropped below $63K for a 2.5% loss in the last day, while BNB and Solana lost 3% and 6.2%, respectively.\n\nNot All Bearish On Ethereum\n\nThe only bullish prediction was that large asset managers such as BlackRock could use Ethereum to tokenize real-world assets, but \u201chow much value this translates into for ETH and on what timeline is uncertain,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditionally, ConsenSys said last week that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was closing its investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThis could solidify ETH\u2019s status as a commodity rather than a security, which is also very bullish for the asset and the rest of the altcoins."

        "content": "Sun 23 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe, renowned crypto analyst, anticipates a significant rise in altcoins, driven by Ethereum\u2019s remarkable resilience. While Bitcoin shows signs of weakness with substantial capital outflows from US-based ETFs, Ethereum demonstrates impressive stability. This dynamic could well herald a major turning point for the altcoin market.\n\nEthereum stands out for its resilience\n\nAs the crypto market undergoes a bearish phase, Ethereum stands out with notable resilience. Recent data shows sustained activity from Ethereum \u201cwhales,\u201d which contrasts with the movements around Bitcoin.\n\nA wallet linked to Justin Sun acquired 9,338 Ether, worth over 30 million dollars. A purchase that demonstrates increased confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future performance. In contrast, Bitcoin whales, notably influenced by the German government, continue to liquidate their positions, increasing downward pressure on the market. Similarly, Bitcoin ETFs face massive outflows. Conversely, Ethereum appears to be gaining renewed confidence, potentially setting the stage for a rise in altcoins.\n\nAn imminent rise in altcoins\n\nAccording to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum\u2019s resilience could herald a new era for altcoins. The renowned analyst highlights that the ETH/BTC pair, which has recently shown signs of strength, could trigger a significant rise in altcoins after more than two and a half years of a downtrend. Van de Poppe believes that as long as the ETH/BTC pair holds above the key level of 0.05, a trend reversal is possible. This analysis is based on on-chain data revealing increased accumulation of Ethereum by whales, contrasting with Bitcoin liquidations. This technical signal indicates that Ethereum\u2019s crypto price could climb exponentially against the US dollar, driving positive dynamics for the entire altcoin market.\n\nInstitutional interest in cryptos other than Bitcoin continues to grow, as evidenced by the imminent launch of Solana\u2019s exchange-traded product (ETP) in Canada. This trend reflects a diversification of institutional investment portfolios, once largely dominated by Bitcoin, towards alternative cryptos with attractive growth prospects.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance, measured in terms of relative market share, is also poised for a major reversal. This outlook could favor a rotation of investor liquidity towards altcoins and thus amplify their performance. towards altcoins and amplify their performance.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading inside a descending wedge, and a breakout above $64,600 signals a bullish move.\n\nEthereum price is approaching its key support at $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating within a descending trendline, with a potential bullish breakout anticipated above $64,600. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices retraced to critical support levels before gearing up for a bullish upswing.\n\nBitcoin price consolidating within a descending wedge\n\nBitcoin price is trading inside a descending channel, drawn from multiple swing highs and lows between early June and mid-June, as shown in the daily chart below.\n\nIf BTC continues to decline, it could find support at $62,451, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from a swing low of $56,552 on May 1 to a swing high of $71,995 on May 21.\n\nIf the $62,451 support holds and BTC breaks above the descending channel, it could rally 7.5% to reach its previous resistance level of $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart are below their respective mean levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nThis development would provide additional momentum to the recovery rally.\n\nIf bullish sentiment prevails and the overall cryptocurrency market shows optimism, BTC may extend its rally by 6% from $67,147 to retest its previous resistance level of $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin price breaks and closes below its daily support level of $60,800, the bullish thesis could be invalidated, leading to a 4% crash to its weekly support level of $58,375.\n\nEthereum price could retest key support level\n\nEthereum's price is declining towards its support level of $3,288, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from a swing low of $2,862 on May 14 to a swing high point of $3,977 on May 27.\n\nIf this support holds, ETH price could rally 13% to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are both below their mean level of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,288 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price set for a downward correction\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.499, its daily resistance level, and is currently trading at $0.477.\n\nIf Ripple's price breaks above $0.499, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart is below the 50 mean level, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is below its zero line. If bullish momentum persists, both momentum indicators must remain above their respective thresholds of 50 and zero. This would provide further support to the recovery rally.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if Ripple's daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, establishing a lower low on the daily chart would invalidate the bullish outlook. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "content": "Mon 24 Jun 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAmid revolutionary announcements, technological evolutions, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a territory of limitless innovations and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here is a summary of the most impactful news from the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nElon Musk says NO to crypto on Twitter!\n\nElon Musk, well-known for his support of Dogecoin, is working on launching a payment service via Twitter called \u201cX Payments.\u201d However, this service will not include cryptos initially. Twitter Payments LLC has obtained its first money transfer license in New Hampshire, signaling advances in integrating a fiat currency payment system. The decision to exclude crypto could be related to the volatility and regulatory risks associated with cryptos. This cautious strategy has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto community, with some seeing it as a step back while others see it as a strategic move that could evolve over time.\n\nTether launches Alloy: A gold-backed stablecoin!\n\nTether, famous for its stablecoin USDT, has launched a new stablecoin called \u201cAlloy.\u201d This stablecoin is backed by physical gold via Tether Gold (XAUt) and is designed to offer the stability of gold while enabling digital transactions. Alloy by Tether is a platform that allows the creation of collateralized synthetic digital assets. Users can mint aUSDT by depositing XAUt via smart contracts and price oracles, offering a new form of stability and flexibility in crypto transactions. This initiative is part of the trend towards the tokenization of real assets, offering an innovative combination of traditional security and blockchain technology.\n\nBNB Chain reduces fees by 90% with Haber\n\nThe BNB Chain network has recently activated the Haber hard fork, resulting in an impressive 90% reduction in transaction fees. This update includes the BEP-336 proposal, inspired by Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844, introducing blob transactions to optimize data storage and processing. By grouping transactions into attached blobs, verification becomes more efficient, reducing network costs to around $0.0001. This improvement particularly benefits the layer 2 solution, opBNB, and the decentralized storage solution BNB Greenfield. Despite a period of volatility for BNB crypto, the technological innovations of the Haber hard fork could stabilize and strengthen its market position.\n\nStandard Chartered enters crypto trading\n\nStandard Chartered, one of the world\u2019s largest banks, has announced the opening of a spot trading desk for Bitcoin and Ether, marking a significant step in integrating cryptos into the traditional banking sector. Based in London, this desk will allow institutional clients to trade cryptocurrencies directly, enriching their investment portfolios. The bank has worked closely with regulators to ensure compliance and security for this new service. This strategic initiative aligns with the growing trend of financial institutions adopting cryptos, with Standard Chartered aiming to position itself as a leader.\n\nRipple partners with ten governments to develop CBDCs\n\nRipple has recently announced partnerships with ten governments for the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This strategic initiative aims to use Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology to enhance the security and efficiency of global financial institutions. Among the partner countries are Bhutan, Palau, Montenegro, Georgia, and Colombia, each exploring specific aspects of blockchain technology to modernize their financial systems. For example, Bhutan focuses on cross-border payments, while Palau emphasizes an environmentally friendly digital currency. This collaboration has elicited varied reactions within the crypto community, with some fearing increased surveillance, while others see benefits in terms of transaction speed and security.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of this week\u2019s highlights.

        "content": "Sun 23 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nAnalysts from Pantera Capital, Franklin Bi, Cosmo Jiang, and Eric Wallach, have recently presented Solana as a real threat to Ethereum. Thanks to its monolithic architecture, Solana is on the verge of establishing itself as a leading blockchain, capable of capturing a significant share of the market dominated by Ethereum.\n\nSolana: The \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d Activated\n\nSolana positions itself as a serious \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d, thanks to a monolithic architecture that recalls the integrated approach of Apple with macOS.\n\nAccording to Pantera Capital, this design gives Solana notable advantages: a seamless user experience, accelerated innovation, and enhanced security.\n\nThese characteristics make Solana particularly attractive to developers, the cornerstone of any blockchain\u2019s success.\n\nThe NFT deposit platform DRiP, for example, benefits from Solana\u2019s capabilities to send millions of NFTs at reduced fees, demonstrating the network\u2019s technological superiority.\n\nPantera also highlights the versatility of Solana, issuer of the SOL crypto, capable of supporting various use cases challenging to implement on modular blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nProjects such as Hivemapper and Phoenix show how Solana\u2019s monolithic architecture allows for the development of innovative applications.\n\nAdditionally, Franklin Templeton had already highlighted Solana\u2019s advanced technology, describing it as ideal for the next waves of crypto adoption.\n\nAs a result, Solana is emerging as a major player ready to reshape the landscape of blockchain and crypto.\n\nGrowth of Solana: The Numbers Speak for Themselves\n\nThe rise of Solana is not limited to technological promises. Solana\u2019s fundamentals show impressive growth, consolidating the bullish argument.\n\nThe number of unique active addresses on the network has increased from 14,000 in October 2020 to nearly 1.34 million recently. At the same time, Solana\u2019s priority fees have exploded, reaching a historic high of over $60 million in March 2024, signaling growing demand.\n\nThe trading volume on Solana\u2019s decentralized platforms and the record number of crypto launches bolster this momentum. Solana has even established itself as the preferred platform for retail crypto investors and meme traders, surpassing Ethereum in NFT volume.\n\nThese indicators show that Solana is not just a theoretical competitor but an expanding player ready to capture a significant share of the crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Solana surpassed Ethereum in terms of DEX volumes.\n\nPrice of SOL declined materially over the last few days.\n\nSolana\u2019s [SOL] performance since the beginning of the year has been extremely positive. Due to this momentum, Solana managed to outperform Ethereum[ETH] in terms of DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes.\n\nSolana DEX volumes on the rise\n\nThis DEX volume refers to the total value of cryptocurrency actually transferred between wallets on the Solana network. These transfers happen through swaps on DEXs, which utilize liquidity pools on the network and are all verified by Solana\u2019s validators.\n\nThis DEX volume metric is considered a crucial indicator of a blockchain network\u2019s fundamental value. It reflects actual usage within the network\u2019s ecosystem, as opposed to just speculation on the price of the token.\n\nBy this measure, Solana\u2019s strong DEX volume suggests it is currently outperforming Ethereum in terms of real-world use. This could be a sign of growing adoption and potential for future growth for Solana.\n\nEven though DEX volumes for Solana were on the rise, the overall activity on the network had declined significantly by 10.7% over the past month.\n\nMoreover, the number of code commits on the network had also fallen by 20% signaling a decline in development activity.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, showed growth on both these fronts. Overall active users on the network grew by 2.2% over the past month and the number of code commits surged by 10% during the same period.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $126.47 and its price had declined by 5.21% in the last 24 hours, due to the recent market correction. Since the 21st of May, the price of SOL has declined materially.\n\nDuring this period, the price of SOL exhibited multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.\n\nThe RSI (Relative Strength Index) for SOL also fell materially over the last few days. It was below the 40 mark, indicating that SOL may be slightly oversold at the time of writing and could see a reversal soon.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) for SOL had declined indicating weakening buying pressure and potentially increasing selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the volume at which SOL was trading had surged by a significant 212% in the last 24 hours."

Despite the declining gas prices, in terms of fees paid out to validators, Ethereum outperformed other networks such as Solana [SOL] and Tron [TRX] by a large margin.\n\nThe higher validator fees, despite a gas price drop, could indicate continued strong network usage on Ethereum.\n\nEven with lower per-transaction fees, a higher volume of transactions could generate more total fees for validators.\n\nWhile validator fees might be high now, they might not be enough to offset the overall price decline of Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had fallen by 4.14% in the last 24 hours. One of the reasons for the decline in ETH\u2019s price would be its correlation to BTC which also fell considerably over the last few days.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s correlation to BTC was at high 0.78.\n\nEven with a significant decline in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price, a large portion of holders seem to be in it for the long haul.

        "content": "While Bitcoin ETFs attracted numerous new investors, making it easier for them to include BTC in their portfolios, the influence of ETH ETFs is much more uncertain, according to Kang.\n\nThis observation comes from crypto entrepreneur and investor Andrew Kang, who shared a detailed analysis of the effect of Ethereum ETFs on X on June 23.\n\nThe response and market sentiment toward Ethereum spot ETFs have been less enthusiastic compared to the excitement seen with the launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThere are 120.14 million ETH in circulation, with a yearly supply decrease of 0.24%, meaning 292,161 ETH were removed from the supply over the past year.\n\nEthereum hit its highest price of $4,867.17 on November 10, 2021, and its lowest price of $0.42 on October 21, 2015. The lowest price since its all-time high was $897.01, and the highest since then was $4,094.18. Currently, the market sentiment for Ethereum is bearish, and the Fear & Greed Index is at 51, indicating neutrality.\n\nToday, Ethereum is priced at $3,332.52 with a daily trading volume of $24.88 billion and a market cap of $400.36 billion, holding 17.73% of the market. Its price has dropped by 5.53% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin's price has dropped to $61,500, the lowest since early May, and is down over 10% from its recent peak. At the same time, other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , XRP , and Solana have seen even steeper declines, causing the total market value to shrink by $200 billion in the past week. The second major crypto ETH is also dropping. Will ETH price fall below $1000? Let's take a look at this Ethereum price prediction article in more detail.\n\nKang predicts that the flow of funds into Ethereum ETFs will be about 10% to 15% of what Bitcoin ETFs experienced, leading to an estimated $500 million to $1.5 billion in net buying within six months.\n\nLast week, it was reported that Fidelity would start its Ethereum ETF with $4.7 million, indicating that the buying has already started. In March, Standard Chartered forecasted that inflows could reach $45 billion in the first year of Ethereum ETF trading.\n\nHowever, Kang explained why the impact of an Ethereum ETF might be less significant than that of Bitcoin. He noted that Ethereum is considered more of a tech asset, unlike Bitcoin, which is viewed as a macro asset. Additionally, there is less institutional interest and buying pressure for Ethereum. Its current valuation metrics, such as the price-earnings ratio, make it a harder sell for traditional finance investors, he said.\n\nThe limited inflows and institutional interest could mean a smaller impact on Ethereum's price compared to Bitcoin, as the expected buying pressure from ETFs will be less intense.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Drop Below $1000?\n\nTo determine whether Ethereum's price will drop below $1000, we need to analyze several key factors influencing its market dynamics. Ethereum's price has increased by 75% in the last year, indicating a strong upward trend. It has outperformed 57% of the top 100 crypto assets over the same period, showcasing its competitive edge in the market. This historical growth reflects solid investor confidence and a robust market position.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading above the 200-day simple moving average, a bullish indicator that typically signals continued strength in price action. Despite recent fluctuations, maintaining this position above a crucial moving average suggests that the market sentiment remains relatively positive. This technical strength is a reassuring factor for investors concerned about potential price declines.\n\nEthereum's supply dynamics also play a crucial role in its price stability. The yearly inflation rate is negative at -0.24%, meaning the supply of ETH is decreasing slightly over time. This deflationary characteristic can support higher prices as supply diminishes, adding another layer of price support. With a high market cap and substantial liquidity, Ethereum is less prone to severe price swings compared to smaller, less liquid assets. This stability can act as a buffer against drastic price declines, further reducing the likelihood of the price falling below $1000.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been outperformed by Bitcoin recently, which may attract some investors away from ETH, this doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a price drop below $1000 but rather a potential shift in capital allocation within the crypto market. The fact that Ethereum had only 13 green days out of the last 30 (43%) suggests some short-term bearish sentiment. This could indicate potential short-term volatility, but not necessarily a significant long-term decline.\n\nDespite lower inflows expected from Ethereum ETFs compared to Bitcoin ETFs, the initiation of these financial products still reflects institutional interest. The additional buying pressure from these ETFs, even if modest, can help sustain or increase the current price levels. Analyst Andrew Kang\u2019s prediction of lower ETF inflows compared to Bitcoin and the challenges in Ethereum\u2019s valuation metrics could result in a less pronounced price increase. However, considering Ethereum\u2019s strong performance metrics, negative inflation rate, and high liquidity, a drop below $1000 seems unlikely under normal market conditions.\n\nSo, while short-term fluctuations and bearish sentiment can lead to temporary price drops, Ethereum's strong historical performance, technical indicators, negative inflation rate, and high liquidity provide a solid foundation against a decline below $1000. Therefore, based on the current data and market conditions, it is improbable that Ethereum will drop below $1000 in the near future."
