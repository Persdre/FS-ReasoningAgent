        "title": "Tether 24 hour trading volume surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC and Ethereum combined - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Tether USDT\u2019s 24-hour trading volume exceeds the combined total of the following five digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nReflecting on Tether\u2019s dominance in trading volume provides insight into market liquidity. As CryptoSlate data indicates, Tether (USDT) maintains a higher volume than Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and First Digital USD (FDUSD), pointing to its significant presence in the market. Specifically, Tether recorded a 24-hour volume of over $55 billion, far surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s $28 billion and Ethereum\u2019s $15 billion.\n\nWith a market cap of over $112 billion, the trading patterns also show that Tether\u2019s volume has consistently been robust throughout 2024, peaking at $130 billion on March 16. Tether\u2019s stability and frequent use in trading pairs make it a preferred choice for traders seeking to hedge against volatility.\n\nThese volume statistics reflect broader market trends as Tether provides liquidity and stability. Tether regularly achieves daily trading volumes exceeding $25 billion, reinforcing its status as a key liquidity provider in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nPer Glassnode data, throughout 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen around $4 \u2013 $8 billion per day, far below Tether\u2019s volumes.\n\nThe high trading volume of Tether compared to other major digital assets illustrates its integral role in daily trading activities and the broader market strategy that traders and institutions employ. This continuous high-volume trading signifies trust and reliance on Tether\u2019s stability and accessibility, making it indispensable for efficient market functioning.\n\nWhile Tether has historically faced recounted challenges regarding its reserves and use in illicit activities, these volumes showcase its resilience in combating these claims. Tether\u2019s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently told CryptoSlate that Tether is currently over-collateralized, with the firm\u2019s profits being put back into reserves to strengthen its stability.\n\nFurther, Ardoino commented how Senator Warren\u2019s discouragement of accounting firms from engaging with Tether had hindered its ability to use one of the US\u2019s top four accountants for audits. The CEO claimed that Tether is continuously seeking to hire one of the leading companies but has almost given up on it happening any time soon, regardless of their efforts to do so.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "7 Famous Ethereum Investors that You Should Know - UseTheBitcoin",
        "content": "Currently, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has started to attract more attention from investors. After December 2017 when, along with most other cryptos, ETH price hit an all-time high even more Ethereum investors have joined the market. Today we will list the 7 most famous ones.\n\nOne reason why Ethereum has become a favorite among investors is the fact that it\u2019s actually so much more than just a cryptocurrency project. In fact, one could argue that Ethereum is the world\u2019s most important blockchain project, since it actively contributes to the mainstream adoption of cryptos thanks to its platform that offers support for dApps, smart contracts, and new blockchain projects.\n\nAs with all cryptocurrencies, there are various risks involved when it comes to investing in Ethereum as a platform. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped a great number of people from doing just that, including various celebrities and big names within the cryptosphere.\n\nHere is a list of famous Ethereum investors:\n\nJoseph Lubin\n\nBoasting immense experience in fields such as software engineering, robotics, machine vision, and neural nets, Joseph Lubin is also one of the biggest names to be associated with the Ethereum project. The co-founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys (a Brooklyn-based software company focused on building dApps based on the Ethereum platform) may very well be one of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nAccording to various rumors, Joseph Lubin was one of the top buyers in the Ethereum crowd sale event that took place a couple of years ago. Joseph Lubin is regarded, by various industry insiders, as being one of the most important holders of Ethereum, with a valuation that is supposed to be as high as $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Lubin is also the founder of the Swiss-based company EthSuisse that has been heavily investing in Ethereum. With ConsenSys and EthSuisse, they do not only invest in the future of the network but also in solutions that would be able to offer better services to users.\n\nIn addition to it, Lubin has also been involved in different cross-industry groups that aimed at advancing solutions related to governance issues in the blockchain space. Thus, when you buy Ethereum, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean funds directly to developers, but it can also be by developing new services, gathering efforts to create new solutions, and expand the whole ecosystem.\n\nSource: rte.ie\n\nRichard Sherman\n\nRichard Sherman, an American football cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL (National Football League), is yet another famous person passionate about cryptocurrencies. Sherman started as a Bitcoin and Ethereum investor extremely early, after fans started asking if they could purchase products and merchandise from his official website using various digital coins.\n\nRichard declared on multiple occasions that he owns a few BTC, ETH, and LTC but is not really interested in the multitude of other smaller coins. He purchased Bitcoin when it was valued somewhere around $1,000 and managed to cash out when the prices skyrocketed upwards of 19,000. Regardless, he declared that he regrets not keeping the Bitcoins as they were.\n\nRichard Sherman has been selected to the Pro Bowl four times and has also been voted All-Pro four times. He has been playing in the Seattle Seahawks between 2011 and 2017 and in the San Francisco 49ers since 2018.\n\nMr. Sherman is not only interested in cryptocurrencies but he is also an ambassador for the trivia application FleetWit. Moreover, he has also invested in other tech stocks, showing that he has a diversified portfolio.\n\nThere are different individuals that decided to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss Brothers \u2013 Ethereum Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have made headlines on numerous occasions due to their connection with the crypto world. Even though the brothers have made a name for themselves after suing Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, claiming that he stole their idea of a social network, nowadays, the Winklevoss brothers are known as some of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nThe lawsuit allowed the brothers to settle for a whopping $65 million of Facebook stock and cash. After seeing an opportunity in blockchain and crypto technology, they decided to invest in Bitcoin. The brothers ended up buying 120,000 Bitcoin in 2012 when the price was less than $10. After their financial success, they re-invested and racked up around $350 million from other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included. The siblings are also renowned for creating the New York-based crypto exchange called Gemini.\n\nAlthough the Winklevoss brothers have been investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and focus on this digital asset, they were also holding Ethereum. Tyler Winklevoss explained that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were not compliant with securities law and that they are tokens on top of tokens. Regarding the value of the Ethereum network and its tokens, Mr. Winkleovss said that its value lies in the network itself rather than on other digital tokens.\n\nAt the moment there is no clear information regarding the amount of ETH that they hold or whether they have decided to sell a part of their stake. Nonetheless, they will continue playing an important role in the whole cryptocurrency market independently from the virtual currency they hold.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nVitalik Buterin \u2013 Ethereum Founder\n\nVitalik Buterin is a name that hardly requires any introduction, especially for those well accustomed with the crypto space. Our list wouldn\u2019t be complete without Vitalik, the mastermind behind the whole Ethereum project, and, arguably, the most important person in the crypto sphere after Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that Vitalik Buterin is a very wealthy man with one of the biggest net worths in crypto. Even though the inventor has never publicly acknowledged how much ETH he owns, there have been reports of him transferring 30,000 ETH to Bitstamp, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, somewhere in December 2017. Other forums and public posts depict Vitalik as the holder of somewhere around 500,000 ETH.\n\nAt the end of the day, nobody can answer this question apart from Vitalik Buterin himself. What\u2019s more amazing is that when most people think about Buterin, they don\u2019t see that wealthy man, but the inventor of one of the best blockchains platforms, a person for whom money is not a priority, and always looking to solve real problems within the crypto sphere.\n\nMr. Buterin has been involved in the cryptocurrency market and their investment on the Ethereum network is not merely financial. He is dedicated to Ethereum as a developer and leader of different teams that are investing their time and funds in improving the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThus, spending time and effort in the network is also a way of investing in it. Furthermore, there are many companies that rely on his recommendations and advice in order to invest their money in developers working on top of Ethereum. More adoption means stronger fundamentals for Ethereum, which would eventually be translated into a higher price of the ETH digital asset.\n\nButerin is in a similar situation as Joseph Lubin. Both of them co-founded Ethereum and they have been working in order to expand Ethereum\u2019s solutions and projects. They may not invest large amounts of money directly in ETH but they have been working in order for ETH to have more value over time.\n\nSource: Ethereum World News\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher, the Hollywood actor, is known for being passionate about technology in general. He was also one of the early investors in technologies and apps such as Airbnb and Uber, as well as for cryptocurrencies. He was one of the first celebrities to jump onto the crypto craze bandwagon and has even tweeted about Ethereum in 2014, almost a year before its initial release. Kutcher is said to be one of the big Bitcoin and Ethereum investors, even though an official number is yet to be released.\n\nSource: MarketWatch\n\nCharles Hoskinson\n\nCharles Hoskinson is also one of the co-founders of Ethereum. He is now the lead developer of Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). He has been working in order to offer alternative solutions to Ethereum.\n\nDespite that, he is an early adopter of virtual currencies. He entered the space when Bitcoin was traded close to $1. When the digital currency moved to $250 he decided to lead other major projects and start moving forward with the expansion in the crypto space.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that he is among the early Ethereum investors as the co-founder of the network. However, he didn\u2019t disclose part of his investments in the crypto project or whether he sold all his coins after some time.\n\nHe has been involved in a large number of crypto projects and now is focused on Cardano, one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. The work he has been doing is very positive for the crypto market, something that helped increase the level of technical improvements in the crypto space. Ethereum is also now trying to compete with other networks, including Cardano, which is allowing developers to offer even better solutions and products.\n\nSimilarly to what Lubin and Buterin did, Hoskinson invested his time rather than just money on Ethereum. Thus, because of him and his passion for crypto projects, we could now have a much more advanced network and cryptocurrency industry. 11\n\nCole is a freelance writer focusing on cryptocurrency and emerging technologies. Previous articles on Masternodes have been featured on leading crypto websites and quoted in Whitepapers.\n\nWant to buy Ethereum today?

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: the clash between titans - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article, we compare two leading blockchains in the cryptographic sector: Solana vs Ethereum.\n\nBoth have very developed DeFi ecosystems and a wide range of successful applications built within them.\n\nThe two networks work together to create the most thriving web3 environment possible, with the goal of becoming the premier layer of the on-chain future.\n\nThe challenge is also played out on the token level, with ETH and SOL trying to offer the best return on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s see everything in detail below.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: the main differences on the technological level\n\nWe are talking about one of the most heated and intense clashes on the technological front of the last decade, as well as the most discussed in the crypto landscape: the Solana vs Ethereum war.\n\nEveryone knows by now that these two blockchains have been in conflict for years to win the title of dominant web3 infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, however, they are quite different in many aspects: Ethereum is an EVM network built with the programming language Solidity while Solana is SVM built with C, C++ and Rust.\n\nThis alone is enough to distinguish two poles in which the development of decentralized applications takes place according to different coding rules.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d also changes significantly depending on the context, whether it is used in an Ethereum or Solana environment.\n\nIn fact, on Ethereum the term account is used to describe an entity that owns ether (ETH) and can initiate transactions. It is classified as follows:\n\nEOA (Externally Owned Account): account in possession of a private key, conceptually similar to a wallet;\n\nCA (Contract Account): account for smart contracts not in possession of a private key.\n\nSimplifying, we can say that EOA does not have storage space and therefore cannot be used as a contract for carrying out operations (except for exceptions with ERC-4337).\n\nThe CA, on the other hand, is simply a software program executable by EVM with a code (contract) that distinguishes it. An EOA can therefore execute a call through CA but not vice versa!\n\nOn the opposite front of Solana, however, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d is broader and refers to an entity that can always store and save data.\n\nThe state of transactions is therefore saved using accounts in a manner similar to what happens in operating systems like Linux. It is worth noting that Solana natively supports the account-abstraction function, allowing self-calling between programs.\n\nThe accounts in Solana are of two types:\n\nExecutable account (program account): smart contracts called \u201cprograms\u201d that store the code;\n\nNon-executable account (data account): entities that can receive tokens or data but cannot execute code.\n\nBelow is a map of the main technical differences.\n\nTwo different approaches for the development of DeFi environments\n\nDescending to a less technical level, we notice that Ethereum and Solana use different marketing approaches for their respective DeFi environments.\n\nAlthough both chains are intent on attracting the widest possible base of capital and users, they focus on different segments.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum presents a more \u201cinstitutional\u201d character with its main values oriented towards the security of the network and decentralization.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has a more \u201csmart\u201d personality, oriented towards the scalability of operations and cryptographic efficiency.\n\nThey follow the limits of both blockchains on their own: for Ethereum scalability, for Solana decentralization.\n\nLIVE NOW \u2014 Ethereum vs. Solana\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the debate we\u2019re having today. On Ethereum\u2019s side, we have @Ethereum Researcher @drakefjustin, and on the @Solana side, we have Solana\u2019s Co-Founder @aeyakovenko\n\n\n\nThey give us the good, the bad, and the ugly of each other\u2019s blockchain,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MlCWd4NtOT \u2014 Bankless (@BanklessHQ) June 3, 2024\n\nEthereum presents a TVL of 59 billion dollars, much greater than Solana\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars. For this reason, the Foundation uses a softer communication with the public and with less intention to create engagement.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, focuses entirely on innovation, user experience, and transaction throughput. The latest innovations launched, such as the Saga smartphone and the Blinks, speak volumes about the approach the network uses with retail.\n\nWe can say that Ethereum is a less performant blockchain, at times less \u201cconvenient\u201d, but more secure and reliable.\n\nSolana is much more \u201cfun\u201d and efficient to use, but less decentralized based on a few clients and less secure.\n\nIf you are high-net-worth individuals with a moderate risk exposure, you will surely appreciate Ethereum more.\n\nIf you are young, fearless, and have a limited budget, you will probably find the features of Solana more appealing.\n\nThe main web3 dapps of the two ecosystems\n\nThe war between the two titans Ethereum and Solana continues uniquely in the creation of the best decentralized web3 applications.\n\nOn Ethereum the largest dapp in terms of TVL is the liquid staking platform Lido: it alone attracts almost 10 times the entire capital absorbed by Solana.\n\nNext, we find successful dapps such as EigenLayer, Aave, Maker, Ether.fi, Uniswap, RocketPool, Ethena, and Pendle.\n\nIn the suite of protocols of Solana, we find Jito as the top-ranked, with a TVL of 1.74 billion dollars. Then the most used applications are Marinade, Kamino, Sanctum, Jupiter, Marginfi, Drift, BlazeStake, Meteora, and Solend.\n\nThe majority of Ethereum dapps are integrated with various layer-2, ensuring greater scalability. At the same time, the differentiation of blockspace requests leads to a fragmentation of liquidity, which is often inconvenient.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum is often criticized by its detractors because as a Settlement Layer it has to rely on external solutions to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, the competitor is criticized for the absence of a flourishing and secure DeFi ecosystem: almost all the dapps on Ethereum surpass the total TVL of Solana!\n\nIn any case, it is worth noting how Solana is producing very interesting products, such as the recent platform pump.fun.\n\nProposed as a launchpad for memecoin, in a short time it managed to become the most profitable dapp in the entire cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nOn July 1st, it recorded record fees of 2 million dollars, even surpassing the entire revenue of the whole Ethereum blockchain.\n\nChapeau.\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking Big: @pumpdotfun Becomes No. 1 Crypto App Across All Chainshttps://t.co/VS31GZ2FXq has surged to the top spot as the leading crypto app, surpassing Ethereum with a staggering $1.99M in revenue generated over the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/59euyqCRWp \u2014 SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 2, 2024\n\nA speculative war: Solana with SOL vs Ethereum with ETH\n\nThe Solana vs Ethereum challenge can only conclude with a focus on their respective gas tokens SOL and ETH.\n\nIt is clear that the better these cryptocurrencies perform on a speculative level, the more users are interested in purchasing them and becoming part of the community.\n\nThe metric of active addresses and the volume of transactions, in fact, largely depends on the evolution of the price of SOL and ETH.\n\nBoth networks are interested in pushing the price of their respective coins upwards, both for a boost in on-chain metrics and for obvious economic reasons.\n\nIn 2024 the two coins recorded similar trends, with a growth of about 50% from the January quotations. SOL, however, grew at a faster pace in the last quarter of 2023, attracting more new buyers compared to what Ethereum did.\n\n>>Solana Vs Ethereum in 2024\n\n\n\nSolana is Winning by Huge Data Growth Margin\n\n\n\nGrowth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 Price\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Volume/Marketcap\n\n\u2013 TVL/Fees\n\n\u2013 NFT Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Transactions/ Daily Active Addresses\n\n\n\nEthereum Growth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 DEX Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Volume pic.twitter.com/Q8GV7mQ9Jy \u2014 hitesh.eth (@hmalviya9) May 30, 2024\n\nAt the moment both SOL and ETH are close to their respective all-time highs, with the latter seeming slightly advantaged.\n\nThe evolution of the prices of the two coins from now until the end of the bull market will be essential to bring more adoption to blockchain technology.\n\nPlaying a decisive role in the coming months will also be the upcoming inauguration of the spot ETFs for the two cryptocurrencies. First that of Ethereum, then (perhaps) that of Solana, will contribute to attracting more capital inflows.\n\nAt stake is the dominance as a settlement layer for the major financial operations of the cryptographic world.\n\nIt is not certain, however, that in the future only one network between Solana and Ethereum will survive, and indeed a coexistence scenario is much more likely.\n\nObviously, there will be a network that will have a larger market share but without precluding the existence of the other\n\nETH vs SOL\n\n\n\nDONT BE A MAXI.\n\n\n\nThe world is gonna be multi-chains!\n\n\n\nStop wasting time arguing about which one is better, and start learning about all the benefits and use cases each bring.\n\n\n\nMore ETFs will grow the pie!\n\nETF products will bring attention and money into the space.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MdtTDdCf7X \u2014 Gun (Kingbund.eth) (@KingBund) July 2, 2024\n\nAlthough in a perspective of coexistence, the dispute between the maximalists will continue for many years to come.\n\nAs we can learn from the historical Pepsi vs Coca Cola discount that has been ongoing for over 100 years, the fight for supremacy is always around the corner."

        "content": "Ethereum developers are set to address the inefficiencies within the network through a new EIP-7732 proposal.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has been outshined by Pump.fun in revenue height as the Solana-based platform edges the blockchain giant by transaction cost.\n\nEthereum (ETH) developers introduce a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP-7732, to offset the challenges of inefficiencies while revolutionizing the block validation process and enhancing the speed of the blockchain.\n\nAccording to our review of this comprehensive proposal, EIP-7732 would bifurcate the block validation process into distinct consensus (consensus proposer) and execution phases (execution proposer) using an approach known as Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS).\n\nPer our research, the consensus proposer would control the selection of the execution proposer which would then produce a valid block consisting of payment or block hash for the consensus proposer. In so doing, the functionality of the blockchain would be greatly optimized to meet the needs of the growing user base.\n\nThe Need For This Proposal\n\nOver the years, delays and inefficiencies have been a gross challenge within the Ethereum network triggered by the need for validators to perform both consensus and execution tasks. To address this, the proposed validation upgrade would enable validators to concentrate on immediate consensus validation and defer execution validation without compromising network performance or security. On top of this, an effective exchange would be encouraged between builders and proposers.\n\nAdditionally, the proposal advocates for a trust-free exchange between builders and proposers, ensuring payment and the inclusion of valid blocks without the need for middleware. This aspect is crucial in simplifying the block validation process and enhancing the overall user experience on the Ethereum network.\n\nPrior to this exciting development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin reinstated the importance of fast transaction confirmation times to the average blockchain user. Commenting on this, he pointed out the considerable reduction of transaction confirmation times to between 5-20 seconds following the successful implementation of the EIP-1559.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Falls Behind Pump.Fun, Whale Faces $30M Liquidation\n\nAmid the backdrop of the validation upgrade, the supremacy of the Ethereum blockchain in terms of revenue height has drastically been reduced as token launchpad Pump.fun amasses $2 million in daily revenue against Ethereum\u2019s $1.91 million. According to experts, Pump.fun\u2019s historic milestone hinges on the Solana blockchain which has relatively low transaction costs compared to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token ETH, has also been severely affected by the ongoing market pullback, causing the asset to lose 10.42% of its value in just a week to fall from $3.5k to $2.8k. At press time, ETH had recorded a little gain of 0.08% in the last 24 hours, trading at $3000.\n\nAccording to LookOnChain, the ongoing volatility puts an Ethereum whale at risk of liquidation after creating a substantial long position on the asset. Data suggests that the whale deposited 12,374 ETH ($40 million) into the Compound Protocol, and leveraged the deposit to borrow $31.4 million in stablecoins with a health rate of 1.06. With this, a price decline to $2,984 would force the long position to be liquidated.\n\nData also discloses that another whale purchased 9,425 ETH ($30 million) via a new wallet. In addition to that, he purchased some of the popular meme coins and cryptos including BNB, MATIC, LINK, AVAX, etc. In total, he withdrew $120 million from Binance, making Ethereum the largest single purchase in the portfolio.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Ethereum ETF issuers have begun filing amended S-1 drafts following the SEC's July 8 deadline.\n\nEthereum long-term holders are depositing to exchanges despite potential rally from ETH ETF launch.\n\nEthereum shows signs of recovery after failing to push below key support level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 0.3% on Monday as prospective spot ETH ETF issuers returned their amended S-1 registration statements to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, ETH long-term holders are gradually returning to the market after years on the sidelines.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum ETF Issuers files updated S-1s\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have all filed their amended spot ETH ETF S-1 registration statements with the SEC on Monday following the regulator's July 8 deadline for issuers to return their amended drafts.\n\nSeveral top analysts expect the SEC to approve the drafts within the next two weeks as issuers have already completed most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe SEC approved issuers' spot ETH ETF 19b-4 applications on May 23 but also need to greenlight their S-1s before they can begin trading.\n\nDespite the positives from a potential ETH ETF launch, on-chain data shows that a few ETH long-term holders (LTHs) are slowly returning to the market. According to Lookonchain, Golem, which raised 820,000 ETH for $10.12 per coin during its ICO \u2014 has moved 26K ETH worth $78 million to an address. In turn, the address sends the ETH to exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nSpot On Chain also reported that a whale who had held onto its tokens for about 1.5 years moved 7,240 ETH worth $21.4 million to Kraken exchange at an estimated profit of $12.8 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Immuenfi and the Ethereum Foundation announced the launch of Attackathon, a time-boxed audit competition aimed at improving Ethereum's security. Attackathon would also feature an educational program to boost security researchers' understanding of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has seeded the event's reward pool with an initial $500,000 while calling on sponsors in its ecosystem to contribute.\n\nETH technical analysis: Is this the beginning of a recovery?\n\nEthereum traded around $2,975 on Monday, down about 0.3% on the day. ETH's slight increase earlier in the day saw shorts suffer over $49 million in liquidations, with long liquidations slowing down to around $44 million, according to Coinglass data.\n\nETH retested the support around $2,800 to $2,852 again on Sunday but failed to sustain an extended move below it for the second consecutive time as prices quickly bounced above the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nAs mentioned in a previous analysis, this level has proven to be a crucial support during downtrends experienced in April and May. Hence, ETH will likely continue to face strong buying demand around the $2,852 support level.\n\nThe chart also shows ETH posted a double bottom, a pattern that signifies potential seller exhaustion due to failure to break below a key support level \u2014 $2,800 to $2,852 in this case.\n\nETH could repeat the pattern it followed between April 12 and May 21, where it crashed from $3,550 before sustaining a horizontal movement for a while and then spiked following the SEC's U-turn to approve 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. If ETH repeats such a move, it may consolidate for a few days and then see a potential spike when spot ETH ETFs begin trading on exchanges.\n\nETH Liquidation Heatmap\n\nIn the short term, ETH could briefly move to the $3,104 price level, where there is a liquidation wall of $2.94 million."

        "title": "Crypto Market Shows Record Levels of Fear: Here\u2019s What Happened Last Time to Ethereum Tokens - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Currently, the state of the crypto market can be expressed as extremely bearish, with a notably negative impact on the Ethereum token ecosystem. This sentiment is captured by the Fear and Greed Index, which hit a low of 20, an extreme level of fear prevailing in the market.\n\nThe volatility surrounding virtual assets has instilled fear among investors, resulting in a rush to exit and, consequently, a fall in price.\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum tokens have dipped from the \u2018fear factor,\u2019 but RCO Finance (RCOF) offers safety for the Ethereum ecosystem. Let\u2019s examine past episodes of extreme market fear and how Ethereum tokens persevered through them.\n\nExtreme Fear Grips the Crypto Market\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a preferable sentiment tracker, has fallen to levels last observed in the second half of 2022. It currently stands at 26, pointing more towards a side of extreme fear in the market rather than extreme greed.\n\nThis shift in sentiment stems from several factors: The future decline of Mt. Gox, Germany\u2019s decision to sell some of the Bitcoins, and macroeconomic factors. This has caused major crypto prices to drop, and Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently been worst affected.\n\nIt is important to note that panic has been witnessed in the crypto market before, indicating that previous events can help understand the current situation.\n\nPrevious Instances of Extreme Fear in the Crypto Market\n\nExtreme fear has occurred in the crypto market at some point in the past, and such events reveal possible tendencies regarding how the market will respond this time.\n\nThe 2022 Crypto Winter\n\nThe most recent extreme fear of cryptocurrencies was experienced during the 2022 crypto winter. \u201cInfluenced by factors such as regulatory risk, macroeconomic issues, and the failure of projects such as Terra/LUNA, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to levels not observed since the bear market 2018.\n\nDuring this period, the ether price dropped, and almost all the newly developed Ethereum altcoins faced a decline in value. However, the market emerged, so the Ethereum community became active and started using Ethereum and its altcoins.\n\nThe 2018 Bitcoin Crash\n\nOne other major example of the extreme rear in the crypto market is the 2018 Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin and other forms of crypto surged in late 2017, and Bitcoin rose almost to $20000.\n\nBut it was succeeded by sharp declines, with Bitcoin\u2019s value falling to less than 20% of its preceding value. During this period, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reached lower lows as demands for digital currency plummeted due to a bearish trend.\n\nHowever, good sense prevailed, and the market finally calmed down as the crypto ecosystem grew and developed further.\n\nNavigating the Uncertain Landscape\n\nAs the broader cryptocurrency landscape grapples with uncertainty, a glimmer of hope emerges from the past \u2013 the last time such fear gripped the market, the Ethereum altcoin sector staged a remarkable rebound. As the crypto world shifts, one project, RCO Finance (RCOF), is ready to capitalize on this shift in sentiment.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): \u201cA Beacon of Hope\u201d\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum blockchain, the RCOF token benefits from the network\u2019s growing adoption and strong infrastructure. As the market stabilizes, RCOF offers a promising opportunity for investors seeking stability in Ethereum tokens. It serves as the native currency of the RCO Finance platform.\n\nRCO Finance is a crypto AI trading platform with features like AI robo-advisor tools, Debit cards for fiat conversions, and DeFi lending.\n\nRCO Finance\u2019s goal is to provide a comprehensive platform with a wide range of assets and an interactive system. This ambitious aim and the project\u2019s innovative features have generated significant excitement among crypto enthusiasts, who see it as a potential beacon in the current market.\n\nSeize the Opportunity for a Promised $3000 ROI\n\nThe RCO Finance presale is now live at $0.0127 per token, offering early investors the prospect of significant returns. The Ethereum token is expected to list between $0.4 and $0.6, potentially delivering a 3000% ROI. An initial $50 investment could grow to $1500 at launch.\n\nThe Ethereum token is safeguarded against pump-and-dump schemes and liquidity issues through advanced tokenomics to ensure stability. Additionally, SolidProof, a renowned security firm, has audited the token\u2019s smart contract for security and integrity.\n\nDon\u2019t be a victim of FOMO\u2014invest in RCO Finance (RCOF) today!\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored post.

        "content": "Ethereum ICO participants moved a significant amount of their holdings.\n\nWhale interest and retail interest in ETH declined.\n\nDue to the rising bearish sentiment in the market, the price of Ethereum [ETH] declined significantly, dipping below the $3,000 mark.\n\nInitial coin offering\n\nIn November 2016, the Golem project conducted a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), raising a significant sum of 820,000 ETH.\n\nOver a 37-day period, Golem transferred 36,000 ETH to major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance [BNB], Coinbase, and Bitfinex. This transfer amounted to roughly $115 million.\n\nDespite these transfers, Golem still held a substantial amount of ETH, with a press time balance of 231,400 ETH, valued at approximately $656 million.\n\nThis indicates that Golem maintained a strong financial position and may be strategically planning for future developments.\n\nWhen a large amount of cryptocurrency hits exchanges, it creates sell pressure. This means that more ETH is available for purchase, potentially exceeding current demand and driving the price down.\n\nMoreover, a large holder like Golem moving their ETH to exchanges can trigger speculation in the market.\n\nInvestors might interpret this as a sign that Golem believes the price of ETH is about to fall, leading them to sell their own holdings to avoid losses. This can create a snowball effect, pushing the price further down.\n\nThe sell-off of these tokens wasn\u2019t an isolated event. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data indicated that large addresses were losing interest in ETH and their holdings had declined.\n\nCoupled with that, retail interest had also decreased over the last few days. This indicated a potential lack of overall demand across different investor segments, further increasing sell pressure.\n\nNew developments on the Ethereum network\n\nDespite these factors, development on the Ethereum network continued to soar.\n\nEthereum developers recently held an online meeting to discuss the Pectra upgrade, a major update for the Ethereum blockchain. The upcoming Pectra Devnet 1 launch is on hold waiting for other software updates.\n\nResearchers presented ways to improve data collection on the software diversity used to run Ethereum. Additionally, they debated a new feature to prevent software bugs from disrupting the network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe meeting also included discussions about potentially including further changes in the future, but no final decisions were made.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,914.63 and its price had fallen by 3.19% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Must Buy Ethereum Meme Coins Before the ETH ETF Approval - CoinGape",
        "content": "The recent hype around the potential ETH ETF is causing investors to scout for Ethereum meme coins to invest in for maximum profits. Ethereum price prediction shows the ETF news is not yet priced in. Furthermore, ETH seems to be following Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory following its ETF approval. BTC\u2019s price retraced after its ETF news before surging to $73,000.\n\nEthereum is a huge network and meme coins are famous for being the best runners during impactful market news. However, not all meme coins are winners. Here are three meme coins to buy before the Ethereum ETF gets approval in July.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Ethereum Meme Coins \u2013 Turbo (TURBO)\n\nTurbo is the first AI-scripted meme coin in the history of cryptocurrencies. The token, which was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, was created using only a budget of $69 and following guidance from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The community came in later and crowd-funded the initial liquidity required to launch the project, as the previous $69 was not enough. Turbo is therefore a community token, riding both the meme coin and artificial intelligence (AI) narratives in this bull run.\n\nThe price of TURBO today is $0.003809, a 6.7% drop in the last 24 hours following Bitcoin\u2019s sell-off. Turbo did well following its launch, hitting an all-time high of $0.009632 two months ago before retracing. TURBO\u2019s market cap is currently at $294 million\u2014enough to surge 10\u201320X and transform investors\u2019 portfolios. TURBO\u2019s 24-hour trading volume is down 16.2% as market participants refrain from trading during these market conditions.\n\nThe AI revolution in the crypto industry is picking up fast, and more so within the Ethereum meme coin ecosystem. Turbo and a few other AI based meme coins may be the first runners if Ethereum gets a win with ETF approval. The current price retrace sets TURBO in an optimal buy-in position.\n\n2. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe is among the top list of the giant Ethereum meme coins that started as a joke, before quickly garnering popularity. The meme coin was inspired by Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. Furie is also the creator of several other memes on the Ethereum chain, namely, Landwolf, Andy (ETH), Bird-Dog, and Fofar. By extension, these meme coins have the potential to soar along with PEPE.\n\nThe price of PEPE today is $0.000009162, which represents a drop of 2.1% in the last 24 hours. Sitting at a market cap of $3.8 billion, Pepe has fallen by over 50% from its all-time high market cap. This is just an indicator of how volatile meme coins can be.\n\nDespite this fall in price and valuation, the number of Pepe holders is up over 5% in the last month and $0.01% in the last 24 hours per Santiment.\n\nAdditionally, the 24-hour trading volume for Pepe is down by 32% which shows there has been a decrease in market activity.\n\nPEPE price showcased incredible price performance following the announcement of the approval of Ethereum ETF 19-4b forms. Even though this approval was not the real thing since it could be contested, Pepe\u2019s price still soared and hit an all-time high price of $0.00001665 on May 28 before beginning to retrace.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki is one of the older meme coins that came out right after Shiba Inu\u2019s rise to popularity. Having been around for three years, Floki\u2019s creation drew inspiration from Elon Musk but has since transformed from just a meme coin to a recognizable brand all over the world. Floki has over 480,000 holders and boasts multiple partnerships with sports clubs, DeFi protocols, and popular blockchain companies.\n\nFloki price is trading at $0.000149, a 2.4% price surge in the last 24 hours. The meme coin has had three major peaks in its lifetime, one in November 2021 and the other two within the March-June period. The price action of Floki formed a potential double top, which may result in a further drop in price to $0.00003500. If the current support holds, Floki may enter into a consolidation zone between $0.00033 and $0.00015.\n\nBeing an ERC20 meme coin with a large holder base, Floki may be one of the top Ethereum meme coins to run hard in the case of an ETF approval.\n\n4. Apu Apustaja\n\nApu Apustaja is a recent meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. It gained popularity on the anonymous chatting platform 4Chan and quickly rose to prominence, hitting a $28 million market cap. However, the developer began dumping their holdings and eventually abandoned the project near its all-time lows. In response, the community took over the project, driving it to a new all-time high market cap of $311 million on May 21.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Apu hovered around $0.000494, marking a 16.6% increase in the last 24 hours. Apu is one of the few tokens to rebound with double-digit gains following Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. The meme coin found support around the $100 million mark and has tested this level twice in the past three weeks.\n\nCommunity takeovers (CTOs) are becoming a prominent narrative in this bull cycle, and Apu exemplifies this trend through its price history. With the potential for further market recovery, Apu shows promise for future price surges, especially if the Ethereum ETF receives approval.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe potential Ethereum ETF approval anticipation fuels interest in ERC20 meme tokens like Pepe, Floki, and Turbo. These Ethereum meme coins command attention for their ability to potentially return high rewards in a short period of time. As we approach the expected decision day, price volatility in the crypto market may increase.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Whe will ETH ETF be approved?

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s transfer of 100 Ethereum raised eyebrows: What\u2019s next? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Buterin\u2019s transfer amid market downturn sparked speculation on ETH\u2019s sentiment impact.\n\nETH held steady with moderate losses, contrasting sharply with other cryptocurrencies\u2019 declines.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin sparked intense speculation within the crypto community with a significant transfer.\n\nMany investors assumed that Buterin was making a strategic move or possibly selling some of his holdings.\n\nClearing the air around Buterin\u2019s move\n\nHowever, things got clear when Wu Blockchain shared more details.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin\u2019s move coincided with a broader market downturn, as the global crypto market cap hit $2.05 trillion at press time, down 2.67% in the past day.\n\nNow, whether Buterin\u2019s move will shift ETH\u2019s market sentiment from bearish to bullish remains to be seen.\n\nAs of the latest update, the largest altcoin was trading at $2,946.55, reflecting a 1.98% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis decline is relatively moderate compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which dropped by 2.40%. Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] experienced declines exceeding 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nBut despite the recent market decline, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis using IntoTheBlock data indicated that buying pressure continued to exceed selling pressure among bulls and bears.\n\nIs crypto adoption on the rise?\n\nNeedless to say, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight. Of late, the king coin has attracted attention from Wall Street, major institutions, and the political sphere.\n\nWhile this surge is often seen as a step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, it primarily revolves around Bitcoin rather than the broader crypto market.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Buterin\u2019s recent actions could boost ETH adoption, especially considering investors\u2019 losing interest in ETH fueled by the delay in ETH ETF approval by the SEC.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s financial influence\n\nAccording to a recent report published by on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Vitalik Buterin remains the largest individual holder of ETH.\n\nHis net worth has climbed from $552.86 million at the start of 2024 to $834.66 million.\n\nHis holdings of approximately 245,279 ETH fluctuate with Ethereum\u2019s market prices.\n\nDuring the 2021 bull market peak, ETH\u2019s value propelled his net worth above $2 billion, though subsequent downturns in 2022 reduced it by about 75%.\n\nDespite market volatility, Buterin\u2019s strategic investments and pivotal role in Ethereum continue to solidify his financial influence."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Holds at $3K but is Another Crash Imminent? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently experienced increased selling activity, breaching the 100-day moving average and leading to a substantial decline toward the 200-day MA.\n\nNevertheless, the price faces a significant support region, possibly leading to a temporary period of consolidation correction in the mid-term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that after an extended period of corrective retracements near the crucial 100-day moving average at $3386, sellers ultimately gained control, leading to a break below this key MA.\n\nGiven that this area was filled with buying interest and demand, the breach caused a notable long liquidation cascade, accelerating the bearish momentum. As a result, the price plummeted toward the substantial 200-day moving average of $3096 and breached it.\n\nThis price action clearly indicates a bearish sentiment in the market, with sellers dominating. However, Ethereum is currently hovering around the crucial and decisive support region of $3K and is expected to undergo a period of consolidation before initiating its next major move. If a pullback to the broken 200-day MA occurs, the continuation of the bearish trend will become more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that following a period of sideways consolidation above the $3.3K support, the price ultimately faced aggressive selling activity and breached this crucial support region. This breakout led to a notable impulsive downtrend, indicating a long-squeeze event in the perpetual markets.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has landed on the substantial support region of $3K, which has previously supported the price multiple times. This area is likely filled with demand, potentially halting the downward pressures in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI indicator has dropped below 30, indicating potential short-term market correction before the next significant move. Hence, consolidation is likely in the short term, allowing the market to rest and regain momentum. In this scenario, the price range between 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels will be the main target for the corrective movements in the short term.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has recently seen a rise in selling activity, leading to a significant decline toward the critical $3K support zone.\n\nUnderstanding the key factors behind this rejection is crucial for predicting upcoming price movements. The accompanying chart highlights potential liquidation zones within Ethereum\u2019s price action, providing valuable insights for mid-term strategies by smart money.\n\nThe chart indicates a notable liquidity pool below the crucial $3K. This pool is filled with sell-stop orders from aggressive long positions that contributed to a significant price surge in mid-May. If sellers push the price below the $3K support zone, a massive long-squeeze is expected. This would trigger the sell-stop orders, accelerating the bearish momentum. Traders should closely monitor the price action around the $3K support zone in the upcoming days to determine the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend direction."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana and Ripple: The biggest crypto news of the past week - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jul 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nBetween groundbreaking announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a limitless territory of innovation and a battlefield of regulatory and economic conflicts. Here is a summary of the most notable news of the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nMt. Gox: The creditors\u2019 reimbursement after ten years of waiting\n\nAfter a decade of legal battles and complex procedures, the former bitcoin exchange platform Mt. Gox is finally starting to reimburse its creditors. Founded in 2010 and handling up to 70% of global bitcoin transactions at its peak, Mt. Gox went bankrupt in 2014 following the loss of 850,000 BTC due to a security breach. Reimbursements are made in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) via designated exchanges, with 47,288 BTC already transferred for reimbursements. Creditors must confirm the validity of their accounts to receive their compensation. However, this news has had disastrous repercussions on the crypto market, leading to massive liquidations reaching $675 million in 24 hours, primarily due to the sale of the newly reimbursed BTC, which could intensify sales and put pressure on the price of bitcoin.\n\nEthereum introduces EIP-7732 and shifts into high gear\n\nEthereum developers have introduced EIP-7732, a proposal aimed at revolutionizing block validation on the blockchain by separating the process into two parts: consensus and execution. This initiative, supported by Vitalik Buterin, proposes the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS), which divides block creation between a consensus proposer and an execution proposer, with the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC) overseeing the timings. The goal is to reduce the computational load of validators, thus increasing the efficiency and speed of transactions, now confirmed between five and twenty seconds. This advancement could strengthen Ethereum\u2019s competitive position, requiring a complete network upgrade and community approval.\n\nPanic in the crypto market: Bitcoin and Ethereum collapse\n\nA shockwave hit the crypto world last week, with a sudden drop of 8% for Bitcoin and over 10% for Ethereum in a few hours. This dramatic plunge led to massive liquidations of $580 million, notably on heavily leveraged bullish positions that couldn\u2019t withstand the price drop. The massive fund movement from Mt. Gox, transferring over $2.7 billion in bitcoins to a new address in anticipation of reimbursements, intensified the selling pressure. Meanwhile, the liquidation of part of Germany\u2019s bitcoin holdings added to the uncertainty. Traders, already nervous about macroeconomic uncertainties and upcoming US presidential elections, reacted by selling off their positions massively, leading to significant losses. This increased volatility plunged the fear and greed index to alarming levels, leaving the market\u2019s short-term outlook uncertain.\n\nSolana sets new records with its memecoins\n\nThe memecoin universe on Solana is experiencing unprecedented excitement and has recorded performances exceeding all expectations. After a rocky start, Solana has managed to establish itself as a key player in the meme crypto sector, surpassing Ethereum by 800% since the beginning of the year. This success is attributed to Solana\u2019s ability to attract talented developers and create an environment conducive to the growth of memecoins. Meme cryptos like Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Billy (BILLY) have contributed to this rise, with Dogwifhat soaring by 12.34% in 24 hours and Billy seeing its market cap explode by 97% to reach $117 million. The Solana community, technological innovations, as well as the support of celebrities and investors have been key factors in this dynamic. Solana now dominates the memecoin sector with a market share of 9.64%.\n\nRipple teams up with crypto exchange Binance to counter the SEC\n\nRipple is taking advantage of a recent court decision in favor of Binance to strengthen its defense in its litigation against the SEC. On June 28, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia partially dismissed the SEC\u2019s accusations that certain cryptocurrency sales by Binance were equivalent to securities sales. Ripple quickly seized this opportunity, noting that the court adopted logic similar to that of Judge Analisa Torres in its case against the SEC in July 2023. Judge Amy Berman Jackson distinguished secondary market sales from institutional sales, criticizing the SEC\u2019s approach of regulating the bitcoin and alternative crypto industry through litigation without providing regulatory clarity. Ripple sees these observations as supporting its argument on the necessity of clarifying the legal status of cryptos, questioning the severity of the penalties demanded by the SEC.\n\nDiscover our newsletter This link uses an affiliate program.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Justin Sun Announces Gas-Free Stablecoin Solution for Tron and Ethereum\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has announced his team's development of a gas-free stablecoin solution. In a post on July 6, Sun explained that this new stablecoin would allow transfers without requiring any gas tokens, as the fees would be covered by the stablecoins themselves. However, he did not provide specific details on how this mechanism would function.\n\nSun plans to integrate this innovative solution on the Tron blockchain by the fourth quarter of this year, and will \u201clater support Ethereum and all EVM-compatible public chains.\u201d Sun believes that this gas-free stablecoin could revolutionize the way companies offer stablecoin services, significantly boosting blockchain adoption. \"I believe that similar services will greatly facilitate large companies in deploying stablecoin services on the blockchain, elevating blockchain mass adoption to a new level,\" Sun posted.\n\nCurrently, Tron leads the market in peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers, consistently processing two to three times the volume of Ethereum, according to blockchain analytics firm Artemis. Tron hosts over $50 billion of Tether's $112 billion in value issued across multiple blockchains, based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nThis new solution could position Tron as a competitor to PayPal's PYUSD, which offers certain U.S.-based users the ability to make free cross-border payments. Additionally, Circle's USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum layer-2 Base via Coinbase Wallet also allows for free transfers, highlighting a growing trend towards cost-free stablecoin transactions."

        "content": "Sun 07 Jul 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nEthereum ETFs are about to get SEC approval, marking a major turning point in the crypto world. Even Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, seems to be in favor of this development. Discover how this approval could shake up the crypto markets and what it means for investors, according to John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn.\n\nInevitable Approval of Ethereum ETFs and Investor Rush\n\nEven Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is not against Ethereum ETFs. This says a lot about the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler, known for his caution, recognizes the growing importance of crypto assets in the global financial system.\n\nIt seems that the era of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\nJohn Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn, views this positively. According to him, the approval of ETH ETFs could not only legitimize Ethereum as an investment asset but also catalyze a new wave of institutional investments.\n\nGlover highlights that the approval of ETH ETFs could attract new investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market.\n\nHe also anticipates an increase in liquidity and price stability thanks to a better market structure.\n\nFurthermore, he sees this development as a way to reduce the often-criticized volatility of cryptos.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes with many expectations and fears.\n\nIf the approval of Ethereum ETFs materializes, it could very well mark the beginning of a new era where crypto assets are more seamlessly and securely integrated into traditional investment portfolios.\n\nJohn Glover\u2019s Opinion, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, on Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe Potential Impact on the Crypto Market\n\nThe arrival of Ethereum ETFs could significantly shake up the crypto ecosystem. John Glover explains that the impact of these ETFs on the market could be twofold.\n\nFirstly, they could bring a new wave of legitimacy to Ethereum, encouraging financial institutions to invest. Glover compares this situation to the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which significantly increased institutional interest and Bitcoin\u2019s price stability.\n\nHe believes that Ethereum ETFs could follow a similar trajectory, stimulating interest and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum ETFs could improve market liquidity in the crypto space. Glover asserts that this could result in reduced price volatility, a point often cited by cryptocurrency critics.\n\nWith more liquidity, sudden and erratic price movements would become less frequent, making Ethereum a more stable and attractive investment for conservative investors.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in liquidity could facilitate large-scale transactions, making the crypto market more efficient.\n\nFinally, Glover mentions that the approval of Ethereum ETFs could serve as a catalyst for other financial innovations in the crypto sector. For example, we could see the emergence of new financial products based on Ethereum, such as investment funds and more sophisticated derivatives.\n\nThis would help diversify and enrich the crypto ecosystem, attracting even more investors.\n\nGlover\u2019s Optimistic Projections\n\nJohn Glover is adamant: the approval of Ethereum ETFs is good news for the future of Ethereum and the crypto market in general. According to him, this approval could trigger a series of positive market reactions. For instance, K33 Research predicts 4 billion dollars in inflows in just 5 months.\n\nFirstly, it could reinforce Ethereum\u2019s position as a safe haven in the crypto universe. Institutional investors, who have already begun to show interest in cryptocurrencies, might see Ethereum as a viable option to diversify their portfolios.\n\nGlover also emphasizes that this dynamic could attract long-term investments, thereby increasing market stability. He predicts a rise in Ethereum prices in the medium and long term, once the ETFs are launched and adopted by the market. And this despite the recent declines of the crypto prince.\n\nFor Glover, the diversification of financial products based on Ethereum could also pave the way for greater innovation in the sector, with increasingly tailored solutions to the needs of institutional investors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Weekends are characterized by a drop in market activity until the following Monday. The lower trading volume and reduced liquidity over the weekend caused crypto assets to stabilize after a recent sell-off. The Bitcoin price found temporary support around $55,000, easing the sell pressure on altcoins. Ethereum price also showed renewed demand around $2900. However, with several analysts anticipating the Ethereum ETF launch around mid-July, there is potential for a major reversal in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAlso Read: Justin Sun Faces $66M Loss As Ethereum Records 10% Fall, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Analysis Hints $3800 Rally Amid Healthy Pullback and Potential ETF Approval\n\nThe current correction in Ethereum price was initiated in late May as the price reverted from $3974. This fresh lower-high formation of the daily chart indicates the buyers lack sufficient momentum to chase new highs, thus shifting the price trajectory sideways.\n\nThe bearish turnaround tumbled the Ether value by nearly 30% to seek support at the confluence of $1815 and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Along with broader market correction, the U.S. SEC\u2019s delay in approving ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts has contributed to bearish sentiment.\n\nOn Thursday, Bitwise filed an amended S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF ahead of the July 8th deadline. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that the SEC\u2019s recent comments required minimal updates, indicating a quick turnaround for Bitwise.\n\nHowever, the filing has no fee details yet, which are expected to be revealed next week.

        "content": "In a remarkable shift, Solana has overtaken Ethereum, attracting significant investment amid a $441 million inflow into the crypto market. With Solana pulling in over $16 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s $10 million, the dynamics of digital asset investments are seeing notable changes.\n\nNotably, this development signals a growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies as investors seek new opportunities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Outshines With Robust Weekly Inflow\n\nSolana\u2019s recent performance has caught the attention of investors, as highlighted in a report by CoinShares. Digital asset investment products saw substantial inflows totaling $441 million, with recent price dips viewed as buying opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, the inflows were primarily driven by the U.S., contributing $384 million, while other significant contributions came from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada. According to the report, Bitcoin led the inflows with $398 million, but for the first time, it accounted for just 90% of the total, indicating a broader interest in top altcoins.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana emerged as the standout altcoin, attracting $16 million last week and bringing its year-to-date inflows to $57 million. This makes Solana the top-performing altcoin in terms of investment flows, surpassing Ethereum, which saw $10 million in inflows but has experienced net outflows year-to-date.\n\nHowever, blockchain equities did not share this positive sentiment, facing an additional $8 million in outflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $556 million. The report suggests that recent selling pressures from the German government\u2019s Bitcoin dump have impacted the market, but savvy investors are leveraging these events as opportunities to invest in digital assets.\n\nBesides, looming concerns over Mt. Gox repayments have also weighed on the broader crypto market sentiment lately.\n\nAlso Read: Matrixport Reveals Ethereum ETF Launch Timeline, Bernstein Targets ETH To $6,600\n\nPotential Reasons Behind The Robust Performance\n\nThe question remains: why is Solana outperforming Ethereum? Several factors contribute to this trend. One significant reason appears to be the ongoing discussions about a potential Solana ETF in the US.\n\nVanEck was the first U.S. firm to file for a Solana ETF with the SEC, which may have fueled optimism among investors, driving robust inflows into the asset.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s performance in the broader altcoin market has been notable. As investors diversify their portfolios beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana\u2019s technological advancements and growing ecosystem have made it an attractive option.\n\nThe network\u2019s scalability, lower transaction costs, and rapid transaction speeds position it as a strong competitor in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, regional investment patterns highlight a global interest in Solana.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains a dominant player, substantial investments from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada underscore Solana\u2019s appeal across different markets. This diverse investment base further strengthens its position as a leading altcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC delaying the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF approval might have forced some investors to shift their focus toward other low-priced altcoins.\n\nAlso Read: Binance To Delist All Spot Pairs Of These Major Crypto\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "President of ETFStore Nate Geraci does not see any reason why spot Ethereum ETF will not start trading in the next two weeks.\n\nJuly 15 For Spot Ethereum ETF Trading?\n\nGeraci believes that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will conduct all due processes for its approval of spot Ethereum ETF trading this week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026 Later next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely.

In his X post, Geraci stated that he expects the trading to begin by July 15 or around that time. It is worth noting that the ETF expert had earlier shared this same timeline for the spot Ethereum ETF trading approval.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the U.S. SEC returned the S-1 filings that it received from the potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, iShares, and Invesco.\n\nThe document returned by the regulator contained light comments in the feedback to filers. According to people familiar with the matter, the spot Ethereum ETF issuers are expected to submit the S-1 forms with the amendments by July 8. Geraci noted that the last round of S-1 revisions was quite \u201clight\u201d and the regulator will likely clear issuers for trading within the next 14-21 days.\n\nPrecisely, he stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Therefore, July 15 would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs, Geraci added.\n\nSEC Receives More Crypto ETFs Applications\n\nGenerally, it is clear that the securities regulator is having some constructive dialogue and communication with the spot Ethereum ETF filers and this may be a good sign. The optimism has even attracted other firms to also submit their filing.\n\nYieldMax, a popular ETF issuer, recently submitted a filing with the US SEC to introduce an Ether Option Income Strategy ETF. The plan is to list the ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca, as detailed in a June 21, 2024 filing. This kind of offering is designed to leverage the volatility of underlying Spot Ethereum ETFs for generating profits for investors.\n\nSimilarly, investment asset management firm Hashdex also filed to list a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the offering and published a notice to solicit comments from the public on the proposed rule change. The firm may have to wait until the regulator makes a decision on spot Ethereum ETF before its filing is considered.\n\nRead More: Celsius Network Resurfaces With Creditor Lawsuit, Here\u2019s What To Know\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

One of the reasons for the surge in Solana\u2019s growth was the emergence of memecoins.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum\n\nA recent report by CoinMarketCap highlights a significant trend in the cryptocurrency market for the first half of 2024.\n\nSolana-based memecoins have experienced exceptional growth, outperforming their Ethereum counterparts by an average of nearly 800% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nThis surge extends beyond memecoins, as the Solana ecosystem itself has garnered increased investor attention compared to Ethereum during this period.\n\nWhile this heightened interest may not directly translate to a corresponding increase in network activity, it signifies a noteworthy shift in investor sentiment.\n\nSince October 2023, both the native token SOL and the broader ecosystem, including its memecoin projects, have witnessed a remarkable uptick in both price performance and public interest.\n\nThis momentum has propelled Solana into the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape, solidifying its position as a competitor of increasing prominence.\n\nAlthough Ethereum currently maintains its dominant position, Solana\u2019s impressive growth cannot be overlooked and suggests a potential future challenge to the established leader.\n\nActivity on Solana soared in Q4\n\nSolana\u2019s network activity experienced a significant surge in the second quarter of 2024. Transaction fees and revenue grew exponentially, exceeding $26 million, a remarkable 42x increase year-over-year.\n\nThis growth reflects a booming ecosystem, further evidenced by the total SOL trading volume reaching a staggering $292 billion, nearly seven times higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nDelving deeper into the network metrics, Q2 2024 saw over 15.3 billion transactions completed, encompassing both voting and non-voting activities. This represents a substantial increase in overall network utilization.\n\nAdditionally, the total value locked (TVL) within SOL\u2019s DeFi protocols skyrocketed to $3.4 billion, reflecting a tenfold year-over-year growth. This surge indicates the growing popularity of Solana for decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe NFT sector on Solana also witnessed explosive expansion.

Despite the struggles faced by Binance, the overall state of the exchange remained positive.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nBinance released its latest, 20th proof of reserves report recently. The report details the cryptocurrency holdings of its users, providing transparency into the exchange\u2019s financial health.\n\nLooking at the user asset breakdown, we see a positive trend in Bitcoin holdings. User BTC assets reached 605,637, reflecting a 4.01% increase compared to 1st June.\n\nEthereum holdings also showed a slight increase of 1.01%, with user ETH assets reaching 4.711 million.\n\nHowever, there was a decrease in holdings for Tether (USDT). User USDT assets fell to 21.51 billion, representing a decline of 2.54% from the previous month.\n\nRegularly releasing proof of reserves reports builds trust with users by demonstrating solvency and the secure storage of their assets. This transparency can attract new users and encourage existing users to hold larger amounts of crypto on the platform.\n\nProblems overseas\n\nHowever, there were some problems that Binance was facing that could cause trouble for the exchange.\n\nOlubukola Akinwumi, the deputy director of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), raised serious accusations against Binance.\n\nLocal media reports allege that Akinwumi accused the cryptocurrency exchange of conducting financial transactions that are typically reserved for authorized banks and institutions.\n\nAkinwumi\u2019s testimony went beyond just the money laundering allegations. He specifically pointed out that Binance allows users in Nigeria to conduct transactions while hiding behind pseudonyms.\n\nThis, according to Akinwumi, directly violates CBN regulations. The central bank mandates that all parties involved in financial transactions must disclose their true identities.\n\nFurther concerns were raised regarding Binance\u2019s peer-to-peer (P2P) platform. This platform facilitates direct transactions between users. Akinwumi highlighted that these transactions involve the transfer of Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the Naira.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThese factors can tarnish the image and reputation of the Binance exchange which can even have adverse impacts on the BNB token. At press time, BNB was trading at $509.71 and its price had declined by 0.73% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe social volume around the token had spiked, however weighted sentiment declined, indicating a growing number of negative comments around the BNB token."

        "title": "Ethereum Settles Below $3K: Bearish Sentiment Points to Deeper Decline - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below $3,150 zone. ETH is again moving lower and the bears could aim for a drop below $2,800.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $3,000 and $2,950 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could correct losses, but upsides might be limited above the $3,000 zone.\n\nEthereum Price Remains At Risk of More Downsides\n\nEthereum price failed to start a recovery wave above the $3,080 and $3,120 resistance levels. ETH started another decline below the $3,000 support zone like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $2,950 and $2,920 support levels.\n\nThe price declined 6% and even tested the $2,820 support. A low was formed at $2,825 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is showing a lot of bearish signs and testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,077 swing high to the $2,825 low.\n\nEthereum is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $2,920 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,950 level.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,077 swing high to the $2,825 low.\n\nThe next major hurdle is near the $3,000 level. A close above the $3,000 level might send Ether toward the $3,080 resistance. The next key resistance is near $3,120. An upside break above the $3,120 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,250 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,950 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $2,820. The first major support sits near the $2,800 zone.\n\nA clear move below the $2,800 support might push the price toward $2,720. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,820\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,950"

        "title": "Are Ethereum ICO-Era Stalwart Golem\u2019s $100M Ether Transfers in the Past Month a Big Move or Market Exit? - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Since 2014, the Ethereum ecosystem has been at the forefront of sponsoring and pioneering countless projects and innovations through its nonprofit arm, the Ethereum Foundation. Among these, Golem stands out as an early ICO-era stalwart. Recently, Golem made headlines by transferring over $100 million worth of ether (ETH) to exchanges in just one month. This has triggered speculation \u2014 as expected \u2014 within the crypto hub about Golem\u2019s ultimate plans and the potential impact on the price of its native token, Golem Network Token (GRN).\n\nIndependent journalist Colin Wu first reported on Golem\u2019s wallet movements, sparking curiosity among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nGolem, a project that raised 820,000 ETH in ICO in 2016, has transferred 36,000 ETH to Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex, etc. in the past 37 days, worth about $115 million. Currently, Golem still has 231,400 ETH, worth about $656 million. https://t.co/EjLTyeEAmz \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 8, 2024\n\nGolem\u2019s ICO Days\n\nGolem emerged during the ICO bout of 2016, raising an impressive $8.7 million worth of ETH in a mere 29 minutes. Its vision was ambitious: to create a decentralized marketplace for computing power. Users could rent out their unused computational resources in exchange for Golem\u2019s native token, GLM. However, despite its promising start, Golem\u2019s journey has been marked by both highs and lows.\n\nGolem\u2019s main wallet has been on the move, transferring millions of ETH to other wallets, which were subsequently sent to major exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase, Arkham Intel data reveals.\n\nThese transactions, mostly below $10 million in value, occur daily.\n\nImage via: Golem ether transfers (Arkham)\n\nMarket Speculations and Selling Pressure\n\nThe $100 million ether transfer raises questions about Golem\u2019s intentions. When tokens move to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell holdings. Large amounts of tokens are rarely held on exchanges for extended periods due to security concerns resulting from past bridges on established CEXs. Speculatively, as Golem\u2019s ETH floods the market, it potentially adds selling pressure, affecting prices and investor sentiment.\n\nDespite its initial success, Golem\u2019s token value has dwindled significantly. Currently trading at around 30 cents with a market cap of $300 million, it\u2019s a far cry from its all-time high of $1.32 in the good old days of January 2018. However, Golem remains committed to development efforts, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Their roadmap spotlight released in May highlights their focus on AI-based solutions.\n\n24h Trading Data of GLM. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nLearning from the ICO Era\n\nGolem\u2019s story reflects broader trends in the crypto space. ICOs, once a popular fundraising method, lost their charm due to regulatory challenges and waning investor interest. Statista report shows that billions were raised between 2016 and 2019, but subsequent years saw a decline. Golem\u2019s journey serves as a cautionary tale for projects seeking sustained success beyond the initial hype."
