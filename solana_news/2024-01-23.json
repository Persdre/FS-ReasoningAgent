        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s decentralized mantra in tatters after execution of client bug - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Homepage > News > Tech > Ethereum\u2019s decentralized mantra in tatters after execution of client bug\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s claims of decentralization are ringing ever more hollow due to the network\u2019s lack of client software diversity, an overreliance that could pose an existential threat to ETH stakers.\n\nLast weekend, around 8% of Ethereum proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validators suddenly began producing invalid blocks due to a critical flaw in the Nethermind client software. The issue followed the release of Netherland\u2019s v1.23.0 update, requiring a frantic patch to get these network nodes back in business.\n\nWhile the order was eventually restored, a similar scenario befell the Besu client earlier this month. Besu\u2019s share of the Ethereum execution client market was around 5% at the time and has since fallen to 4%.\n\nEthereum watchers soon warned that the fallout could be catastrophic if/when a similar situation impacted the Geth (Go Ethereum) client. Geth accounted for around 84% of network execution clients at the time of the Nethermind bug, but a concerted effort to sound the \u2018eggs in one basket\u2019 alarm has since pushed this down to a mere 79%.\n\nGeth is client software developed by the Ethereum Foundation that supports network functions like transaction validation and smart contract execution. Geth is generally considered a more robust option than its rivals, which, along with the Foundation\u2019s stamp of approval, is why it accounts for such an outsized market share.\n\nRegardless, such a high concentration level would be problematic in any sector. But in an industry so prone to probing by malicious actors\u2014particularly those adept at software supply chain attacks\u2014it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n\nA Geth failure would bring Ethereum finalization to a screeching halt, but as Labrys developer Lachlan Feeney recently suggested, this vulnerability could also result in the loss of the majority of the roughly 29 million ETH currently staked by validators.\n\nBecause validators are penalized for being offline, an \u2018inactivity leak\u2019 could rob validators of two months\u2019 worth of staking rewards in just two days. Should the downtime extend for five days, a year\u2019s worth of rewards would be lost. A weeklong outage could cost validators 10% of their staked ETH, while 90% of that stake could be lost if the outage extends to six weeks. While such a prolonged outage may be unlikely, it\u2019s also not impossible.\n\nGeth-based validators would likely stampede for the exits rather than watch their stake bleed away to nothing. But they\u2019d get caught in a logjam of similarly minded validators, all of whom would continue bleeding ETH as they wait their turn to disembark this sinking ship. Given the sheer number of Geth-based validators, this bottleneck could mean that only one in 12 could exit with more than 50% of their stake.\n\nFork me\n\nThe potential repercussions of a serious Geth bug don\u2019t stop there. Should a Geth-based validator produce an invalid block, Geth\u2019s domination of the network could result in this invalid block being added to the chain, resulting in a fork that would quickly become the dominant chain. Geth validators would be blocked from the valid chain until the smaller chain is finalized.\n\nAs Feeney put it, \u201cBecause the Geth validators are stuck on the invalid chain, they are considered inactive on the non-Geth chain and will suffer the inactivity leak. No software update or bug patch to Geth will save these validators. They will be bled out until their stake represents <\u2153 of the network, allowing the non-Geth chain to finalize.\u201d\n\nFeeney estimates that this bleeding could result in an 18% reduction in the total supply of ETH. (That\u2019s definitely one method of creating artificial scarcity and thus losing the token\u2019s fiat value.)\n\nFeeney offered this warning: \u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD [the rough value of the 32 ETH required for serving as a validator] into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100% (even if that loss is unlikely)? Probably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today.\u201d\n\nLido shuffle\n\nRetail users lacking the 32 ETH necessary to stake on their own have several options for pooling their resources, but staking via a service won\u2019t necessarily protect them from the potential carnage described above.\n\nLido Finance, the largest staking service with around 9.4 million ETH staked, relies on Geth for most of its operations. On January 23, Lido stated that its preliminary Q4/23 data put Geth usage across Lido protocol validators at 67%, down from 76% in Q3/23 and 93% in Q3/22. Lido said \u201cclient diversity is fundamental\u201d to its \u201cmission to decentralize Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLido added that its Lido DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) node operators \u201care afforded high degrees of autonomy,\u201d but they \u201chave already begun to signal their commitments to reduce majority client usage, or explain how their setups avoid the possibility of being affected by supermajority bugs.\u201d\n\nCoinbase has a plan to make a plan\n\nThe Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) exchange has faced similar queries this week about its reliance on Geth. On January 22, CEO Brian Armstrong personally responded to a Coinbase customer who tweeted that they had \u201cunstaked all of the ETH I had staked with you since you offered it as a service.\u201d The user added that this \u201csingle client staking setup\u201d made it \u201cnot worth the risk\u201d of losing \u201ca large percentage of my deposit.\u201d Armstrong replied: \u201cTaking a look.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the Coinbase Cloud account tweeted that when it launched its ETH staking service, \u201cGeth was the only client that met our technical requirements.\u201d Coinbase claimed that \u201cexecution client diversity \u2026 is a critical concern,\u201d and thus, it was conducting \u201can updated technical assessment with the goal of adding another execution client to our infrastructure.\u201d Coinbase promised to provide an update on its progress \u201cby the end of February.\u201d\n\nNot everyone found this reassuring, with at least one customer suggesting that the situation wasn\u2019t \u201ca review and plan kind of phase. This is take serious and urgent action, with informed customers phase.\u201d Coinbase was urged to set up \u201can insurance fund or allow us to opt in to other clients\u201d because \u201cthe risk of supermajority failure is a *bigger* risk to your customers than minority client failure.\u201d\n\nThis probably wasn\u2019t the best week for Coinbase to run a sponsored post on Decrypt promoting the claim that its staking service \u201caims to be a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for crypto staking.\u201d One stop, one point of failure\u2026 Synergy!\n\nCoinbase rival exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex (among others) also rely solely on Geth to power their staking services. However, they have kept quiet regarding any plans they may have to inject a little diversity into their operations.\n\nAll in one\n\nDecentralization theater has been Ethereum\u2019s stock-in-trade from its inception, starting with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s oversight-bereft crowd sale that delivered the majority of ETH into the hands of a few whales. This concentration of wealth and power continues to this day via the PoS consensus mechanism that further enriches the whales who can afford to run multiple validators.\n\nThis centralization was recently cited by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of the reason it was delaying decisions on applications to offer Ethereum spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity are among those chomping at the bit to offer Ethereum ETFs to the public following the launch of multiple BTC spot-based ETFs earlier this month.\n\nIn approving those BTC ETFs, SEC chairman Gary Gensler stressed that the decision was limited to \u201cone non-security commodity\u201d (BTC) and \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d Gensler, who has previously stated his belief that ETH is an unregistered security, reiterated his \u2018don\u2019t expect ETH ETF approvals anytime soon\u2019 message earlier this week.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC posted a list of ETH-related questions for public comment before making any ETF decision. For instance, the SEC wonders if there are \u201cparticular features related to ETH and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ETH\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d\n\nInterested parties are instructed to submit their comments within three weeks. Just remember Ethereum Foundation members, you have to at least try to make it look like they\u2019re not all coming from the same address.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum,\n\nFTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market."

        "title": "Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has sold more than 1,000 Ether (ETH) in the past several weeks, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence, which has been tracking his ETH holdings for the past several months. It obtained the data through Trump's financial filings and disclosures.\n\nMost of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.\n\nThe NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn early 2024, Trump announced another trading card NFT project that has some unique rewards for owners. Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.\n\nHowever, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nTrump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.\n\nThe sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.\n\nEven though Trump said during his presidency that he was \"not a fan\" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a \"disaster waiting to happen,\" it is hard to pass on several million dollars. Though Trump is largely unaffiliated with the project, he is still earning royalties. While his stance on crypto is still up in the air, the recent sale is an interesting development in Trump's relationship with crypto.\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, it will be important to watch for news relating to presidential candidates' stances on crypto, as this could have large implications for prices, future adoption and use cases going forward.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market are down bad this week. But some of the biggest losers near the top of the market were once recently stars of the show, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn recent weeks, all three of those top 20 cryptocurrencies were making big gains as they attracted institutional investor interest. Now, each has slipped by at least 14% over the past seven days, and have posted sizable losses on the day.\n\nEthereum is down sharply this morning, per data from CoinGecko, falling 7% over the past 24 hours to a current price of about $2,200 and pushing its seven-day dip to 14%.\n\nSolana is down almost 16% over the past seven days at a current price of $82.50. It has rebounded slightly from earlier this morning, but remains down about 5% on the day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile AVAX, which is the 11th largest cryptocurrency, has plunged 19% on the week to a current price of just under $29. Like Solana, it has shored up some of its losses since this morning, now down about 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt was just over a week ago that Ethereum came just shy of hitting $2,700, its highest price since April 2022. Excitement over Ethereum grew amid the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as investors considered the next wave of prospective institutional adoption, particularly as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked up the prospect of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSOL had been on a big run starting from the end of October. It was expected to take a hit during the trial of disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, who was heavily invested in the asset via his now collapsed crypto empire, FTX.\n\nBut major companies such as Visa and Shopify sung the project's praises and said they'd use its blockchain. A growing developer base also meant the price of SOL shot up. It rose as high as $123 in December 2023, nearing a two-year high after plunging to a price of about $8 in December 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAVAX also attracted interest when investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nLong-term holders have reason to be optimistic, though\u2014despite the recent dips in price, both coins over a one-year period are doing well: SOL is up 239%, while AVAX has jumped by 64%. Even Ethereum is up by 35% over the last year.\n\nThe broader crypto market has taken a nosedive as it follows the price action of the biggest digital asset by market cap, Bitcoin.\n\nSince crypto fund Grayscale converted its flagship BTC fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and started trading on the stock market, investors have been keen to redeem shares previously locked into the product.\n\nThis has put pressure on the price of the biggest and oldest digital coin in recent days.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Polymer Labs, a modular IBC-based networking protocol, has secured a $23 million Series A co-led by Blockchain Capital, Maven 11 and Distributed Global.\n\nOther investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Placeholder, Digital Currency Group, North Island Ventures and Figment Capital also participated in the round.\n\nPolymer can be described as a modular layer-2 network that employs Cosmos SDK\u2019s IBC protocol, OP stack\u2019s settlement functionality and Eigenlayer\u2019s data availability layer. It is the brainchild of Bo Du and Peter Kim.\n\nAfter being in the blockchain industry for a few years, the Polymer founders experienced firsthand how difficult it was to build interchain products. In the summer of 2021, they made a decision to drop their side projects and focus on fixing blockchain interoperability.\n\nRead more: The Interchain Foundation puts aside $26.4M to grow Cosmos ecosystem\n\nInitially, the team wanted to design their own interoperability protocol \u2014 similar to that of many general message-passing protocols that exist today. However, during their research, they came across the Cosmos SDK\u2019s Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, Du told Blockworks.\n\nIBC is an inter-blockchain communication protocol, as its name suggests. It allows different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate with each other. The protocol is designed to ensure that information can be securely transferred between separate operating chains.\n\nRead More: DeFi users \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 what chain apps are on\n\n\u201cIBC already had years put into its design and architecture, so we decided to stick with IBC and not invent a whole new standard,\u201d Du said.\n\nKim added that at the time, IBC was the most decentralized, elegant solution to establish connections and pass messages between chains.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe realized this was something that could be expanded to other chains; basically export the technology to have industry penetration rather than just the Cosmos app chains,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe team wanted to find ways to make the already established interoperability protocol on Cosmos a mainstream standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to integrate IBC natively into all these different chains, which is why we designed the virtual IBC protocol, which essentially allows chains that don\u2019t natively implement IBC to access IBC execution through Polymer and have Polymer execute IBC on its behalf,\u201d Du said.\n\nMany blockchain interoperability protocols today are focused on the state component of interoperability, which involves aligning the status of the data stored within separate systems, but Du believes this is just one part of the interoperability problem.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBeyond the state layer, two other layers need to be considered. This includes the application layer \u2014 that is, the layer responsible for encoding and decoding sent data and the transportation layer (TAO) \u2014 which manages the routing of raw data.\n\n\u201cAll of IBC\u2019s core logic will live on the transportation layer; this becomes decoupled from the application layer, and Polymer will hold the IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d Du said.\n\nThis means that at the end of the day, the application \u2014 which lives on Ethereum \u2014 will be able to interact with the IBC network through Polymer smart contracts.\n\n\u201cPolymer will then take the apps intended actions and execute the associated IBC logic and produce a commitment to the IBC state of that chain on Polymer \u2014 so essentially, Polymer is maintaining this merkle-ized IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: 2023\u2019s top 5 DeFi protocols by revenue\n\nSimilar work to decouple state, application and transport layers is being explored by the interoperability protocol LayerZero.\n\nIBC has been around for a long period of time. Du notes that its specs cover various considerations ranging from authentication, timeouts and acknowledgment, somethings its competitors may not have.\n\nThis means that applications will not have to individually implement these different changes when there are protocol upgrades.\n\n\u201cIf you want to design a protocol that is going to last for generations of builders, you need to be able to handle these different edge cases properly,\u201d Du said. \u201cThis is a foundational level protocol.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Polymer Labs, Yuan Han Li and Joshua Rivera from Blockchain Capital, shared this sentiment.\n\nThey note in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that \u201cwhile numerous arbitrary messaging protocols have emerged to address the cross-chain interoperability, they have all done so by building a new messaging standard, paradoxically causing more fragmentation when a standardized and battle tested way to move data between heterogeneous blockchains already exists.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Polymer team is hoping to ensure that IBC becomes a widely adopted interoperability standard that will shape how blockchain applications of the future will communicate. This latest funding round will bring the team closer to launching mainnet.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

And a recent surge in price for the meme coins means that Trump\u2019s holdings are valued at about $1.1 million as of this writing, as first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe TRUMP token has jumped 222% this week alone, per data from CoinGecko, and 689% over the past 14 days. Meme coins are famously volatile and can be driven by social media sentiment and real-world events, and Trump has racked up a pair of 2024 presidential primary wins in recent days as he attempts to win a second term in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s wallet isn\u2019t associated with the creation of the TRUMP token, and in many cases, meme coins inspired by celebrities and public figures aren\u2019t created by the person in question. Instead, they\u2019re often created anonymously in an effort to ride the wave of hype and FOMO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, Trump\u2019s wallet was sent the sizable allotment of TRUMP tokens across multiple transactions in August and October 2023, per public blockchain data tracked by Etherscan. At the time of the largest transfer, on August 19, the 469,901 tokens received on that date were collectively worth approximately $5,670, per data from DexScreener.\n\nNow his stash of TRUMP tokens is valued at $1.1 million, making up the largest single holding in the Trump-affiliated wallet. Overall, it holds nearly $2.6 million worth of cryptocurrency as of this writing, including about $755,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and $731,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIn December, the wallet dumped $2.4 million worth of ETH across a period of three weeks, following the launch of his third collection of NFTs minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Only about half of the latest NFT collection has been minted so far, after the two previous collections both sold out.\n\nThe wallet was tied to Trump by Arkham last year following a financial disclosure notice from the former president, as the wallet receives royalties from the sale of his officially licensed NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist says that Ethereum (ETH) is giving off a bullish reversal signal when paired against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\nTrader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 685,700 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the coming weeks.\n\nAccording to the analyst, ETH/BTC is flashing a bullish divergence on the weekly chart, indicating that the pair may be gearing up for a move to the upside.\n\n\u201cI personally believe that Ethereum is going to outperform Bitcoin in the upcoming period and it has started since the ETF (exchange-traded fund) approval.\n\nMassive weekly bullish divergence created, but facing crucial resistance at 0.06 BTC ($2,385).\n\nSome more consolidation and then we\u2019re likely going up.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to think that ETH/BTC will rally to as high as 0.13 BTC ($5,168) sometime this year.\n\nAt time of writing, ETH/BTC is worth 0.05596 BTC ($2,224).\n\nAs for Bitcoin itself, Van de Poppe thinks BTC may fall to around $38,000 before finding support.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is at the range low and is actually in the area to be accumulated.\n\nAdditionally, this also means that altcoins are in stages to be bought as those 20-40% dips are a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $39,800.\n\nVan de Poppe is also keeping a close watch on the price action of blockchain data-aggregator Covalent (CQT). According to Van de Poppe, CQT is likely headed to its next support level at around $0.15 before igniting a strong surge.\n\n\u201cOne of the latest runners has been TIA (Celestia), but competitors are likely to pace up momentum too.\n\nCQT is one of them.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.\n\nThis potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.\n\nAdditional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum\u2019s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.\n\nBitcoin in trouble\n\nBitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.\n\nOn the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.\n\nShiba Inu gets hit\n\nThe token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.\n\nThe current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.\n\nIn terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could make a move north if it closes above the $40,726 support on the three-day timeframe.\n\nEthereum price likely to fall 5% before inflection with uncollected liquidity residing below $2,135.\n\nRipple price looks poised for recovery after a double chance on the FVG.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is attempting a recovery barely 24 hours after speculation of a \u201crespectable correction\u201d that was expected to send BTC to the $35,000 range. Ethereum (ETH) price is yet to heed BTC\u2019s cue, while Ripple (XRP) appears to have bottomed out.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price could face short squeeze, analyst says, as FTX sells nearly $1 Billion of Grayscale spot BTC ETF\n\nBitcoin price fights to find a hinge\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pulling back after a strong rejection from the $48,000 psychological level. Despite a slippery slope, BTC has managed to reclaim the $40,000 psychological level after a range low of $38,555. BTC holders remain in murky waters until such a time when the price breaks and closes above the $40,726 support on the three-day timeframe.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators remain in positive territory above their respective mean lines, inspiring hope for a possible move north.\n\nIf the bulls have their way, a decisive move above $40,726 would set the pace for Bitcoin price to breach $43,750, or in highly bullish cases, reclaim the $48,000 level. Overly ambitious outcomes could send BTC past the $50,000 psychological level, last tested in December 2021.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50 and still southbound, Bitcoin price could extend the fall, potentially slipping past the $37,800 support.

This level is critical for Ether market value, as it continues to hold Ether afloat after a prolonged consolidation since December 3.\n\nIt therefore marks a possible inflection point or another measure of quicksand to invalidate the prevailing bullish outlook.\n\nThe odds support the bearish thesis, suggesting the drop could come as the RSI is showing falling momentum as the MACD is subdued and moving in tandem with the signal line (orange band). The AO histogram bar is flashing red but still in positive territory, reinforcing the assumption that $2,135 will be critical in determining the next directional bias.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nIf the $2,135 support holds, the Ethereum price could bounce, with the potential to overcome resistance due to the midline of the channel as it targets the $2,800 level, 25% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs likely to get better deal than their Bitcoin counterparts\n\nRipple price likely to bounce from here\n\nRipple (XRP) price looks ready for recovery after a second retest of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.4927 and $0.5111. The RSI has tagged 30, suggesting XRP is oversold and a bullish correction may be due. A reentry by the bulls could see the Ripple price reclaim the support offered above $0.5442. In a highly ambitious case, XRP could extend the gains to the $0.5784 level. Beyond this, the next logical target for the XRP price could be the $0.6000 psychological level, standing around 16% above current levels.\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the XRP price extends the fall below the midline of the FVG at $0.5029, the load-shedding exercise could extend with Ripple price likely to revisit the $0.4746 support, around 8% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could gain nearly 12% as on-chain metrics signal recovery"

        "content": "In the latest development for the next wave of cryptocurrency ETFs, the SEC has delayed a decision on BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF. Following landmark approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January, BlackRock hoped its pending spot ETH ETF application would be approved swiftly, but the SEC has yet to budge.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC delays BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 24, 2024\n\nAlso Read: Solana to Surpass Ethereum by 500% \u2013 But When?\n\n\u201cThe commission finds it appropriate to delegate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d a new SEC filing says. The commission designates March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to approve or deny BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC also delayed decisions on every Spot Bitcoin ETF application before approval, including BlackRock\u2019s. Just days ago, the commission delayed Fidelity\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the SEC is not a fan of cryptocurrency. In fact, chair Gary Gensler implied shortly after approval that it was seemingly pushed to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Immediately, cryptocurrency enthusiasts went to social media to blast the commission, signaling a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Following the initial filing, the SEC had 45 days to decide on the ETFs or delay it, and the commission\u2019s deadline was Jan 25, a day after the decision to delay.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Cramer\u2019s Doubts vs. Hayes\u2019 Bottom Fishing \u2013 What Lies Ahead?\n\nHence, it is likely that the SEC is looking to prolong the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s. Other asset management firms have filed ETF applications for Ethereum in hopes of adding it to their services. However, those applications may likely be delayed eventually as well."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nProof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network Cardano (ADA) has outranked many of its major peers in monthly development activities, as measured by GitHub Commits. According to data insights from crypto analytics platform Santiment, Cardano has maintained a slight lead over its peers over the past month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer total GitHub data, Cardano recorded a total of 332.9 commits over the past 30 days, with the closest ranking peer, Polkadot, recording 329.57 commits. Per Santiment, there was no significant jump in Cardano\u2019s GitHub Commit from the previous report, as the December holidays slowed things down in terms of developer activities overall.\n\nCardano has always maintained the top spot as the biggest venue concerning developer engagement. For many months, it has not been displaced from first place, despite the emergence of numerous alternative protocols, including both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions.\n\nThis tear of development activity is one of the unique ways Cardano is showcasing its strength as a major Ethereum killer, seeing as other top chains like Ethereum are recording relatively lower GitHub commits overall. Per Santiment data, Kusama, Polkadot\u2019s canary network, came in third, with a total commit of 329.57, the same figures as Polkadot.\n\nAlternate chain performances\n\nProtocols like Optimism and Status (SNT) recorded upticks in their figures, with total commits coming in at 281.03 and 262.23, respectively. Hedera and Cosmos occupy the fifth and sixth positions, with their GitHub commits coming in at 251.57 and 246.17, respectively.\n\nInternet Computer and Chainlink were also ranked higher than Ethereum as the trio recorded 212.1, 198.87 and 195.93 commits over the past 30 days.\n\nThe GitHub Commit metrics are a testament to how much work is put in to ensure a protocol stays at the top of its game in rolling out applications and upgrades needed to function optimally. While this has not necessarily translated into price growth for Cardano or others, it shows that efforts to keep building for the future remain solid."

        "title": "How to bridge to Base - OKX",
        "content": "Blockchains are independent networks that cannot communicate with each other. To address this issue, developers have created blockchain bridges . These bridges enable users to seamlessly transfer their funds between different chains. By facilitating blockchain interoperability, cryptocurrency bridges make the transfer of digital assets even simpler.\n\nBase is an open-source Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) chain incubated within Coinbase using Optimism\u2019s OP Stack. Its roll-up architecture makes it more efficient than Ethereum regarding fees and speed. Moreover, it functions similarly to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to transfer or set up Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) without modifying the code. The underlying blockchain also has access to Coinbase's \u200con-ramps and additional services, simplifying the process for beginners to join.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nThe first step before using an Ethereum to Base bridge is to choose the right wallet.\n\nOKX provides a highly secure and multi-chain OKX Web3 Wallet with all OKX accounts. It can safely store BTC or any other cryptocurrency for as long as needed. In addition, the OKX Web3 Wallet features bank-grade security and inbuilt access to hundreds of DApps and the OKX NFT Marketplace .\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nBefore bridging a cryptocurrency from one chain to another, it\u2019s crucial to confirm that the asset is compatible. In this tutorial, we'll be moving ETH from Ethereum to Base. To do this, we only need ETH, as it is the native currency on both chains. ETH is used on both Ethereum and Base for gas fees.\n\nTo successfully bridge a different asset such as USDT, it's important to confirm that Base is compatible with USDT. One simple method to verify its availability in the bridge is to check if USDT is listed as an option. However, also make sure that you have ETH on Base to pay for any gas fees after you bridge the USDT.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nOne possible option for securely bridging ETH to Base is through OKX Swap . It combines prices from various decentralized exchanges to suggest the most efficient path, reducing the impact of price differences and transaction costs.\n\nBase also offers its own solution, Base Bridge . However, it supports a limited number of cryptocurrencies and doesn't offer swapping services. Other options you can check out are Meson and Stargate .\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nOne convenient method for bridging to Base is by using centralized exchanges. This involves depositing your cryptocurrency into OKX using one blockchain and then withdrawing it via a different one. The following is a basic tutorial on how to bridge ETH from Ethereum to Base through OKX Exchange.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX .\n\nStep 2: Once logged in, head to \u201cAssets\u201d on the top-right and click \u201cDeposit.\u201d If you don\u2019t have ETH, you can buy some on OKX and skip the deposit step.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cETH\u201d as the crypto and \u201cETH-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Deposit ETH into the address shown, from your Ethereum wallet. It takes a few minutes for the ETH to reach your account and be accessible.\n\nStep 5: Once your funds are ready to be used, go back to \u201cAssets\u201d and click \u201cWithdraw.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Select \u201cETH\u201d as Crypto and the withdrawal method as \u201cOn-chain.\u201d\n\nStep 7: Type in your Base address, and select the network as \u201cETH-Base.\u201d Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge to Base and hit next. You\u2019ll be asked to authenticate your account, and the ETH should arrive in your wallet within a few minutes.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to transfer your assets is through an exchange, since you won't have to worry about slippage or network fees.\n\nChoosing a bridge service\n\nYou have the choice between centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency bridges, both of which are effective options. If you opt for decentralized bridges, you can benefit from quicker cross-chain transactions. However, they may have downsides such as steep fees and slippage. It's important to prioritize security when selecting a decentralized bridge and to make sure it has a trustworthy history of protecting assets.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nTo bridge ETH to Base, you'll need to connect your wallet and transfer the assets. We'll use the OKX Web3 Wallet and OKX Swap for this process. If you prefer to use a different wallet or bridge service, the steps should be similar.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap .\n\nStep 2: Select \"Connect wallet\" located in the top right corner, then choose \"OKX wallet extension\". If you have a different wallet provider such as Metamask or Phantom, select \"Other\" and choose your desired wallet.\n\nStep 3: Enter the password for your OKX wallet and click on \u201cConfirm\u201d to establish a connection between your OKX wallet and OKX Swap.\n\nTransferring assets to Base\n\nNow you\u2019re connected to OKX Swap, you\u2019re ready to bridge ETH to Base.\n\nStep 1: Set the bridge parameters and the amount of ETH you want to bridge under \u201cSwap and Bridge.\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cEthereum\u201d as the network and type in the amount of ETH you want to bridge.\n\nSelect \u201cBase\u201d on the \u201cTo\u201d network and token, \u201cBASE_ETH.\u201d OKX Swap will automatically show you the amount of ETH you\u2019ll get.\n\nStep 2 (optional): This is an optional step. Only do this if you understand slippage and bridges very well.\n\nNetwork fee: This estimates the network fee to facilitate the blockchain bridging.\n\nSlippage: Slippage refers to the level of flexibility you're comfortable with when it comes to fluctuations in price. By setting the slippage at 0%, OKX swap guarantees a precise receipt of 0.4985 ETH, as indicated. If the price fluctuates at the time of the transaction and OKX is no longer able to guarantee the price shown, the transaction is cancelled. Allowing for some slippage is important when there's a noticeable lack of liquidity.\n\nTrading route: The OKX Swap isn't a bridge, but rather functions as a DeFi aggregator that selects the optimal bridge to Base for you. You have the option to manually modify the service if desired.\n\nStep 3: Click \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet shows, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap offers a user-friendly DeFi solution for transferring and exchanging cryptocurrencies through various bridges.\n\nIn addition, OKX Swap and similar bridges can function as ETH to Base bridges, allowing you to revert. To do so, you must choose Base as the primary network and ETH as the secondary network for the bridging process.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThe decentralized bridging process includes various charges:\n\nEthereum gas fees : Since you\u2019re using OKX swap on the Ethereum network, there\u2019s an Ethereum network fee.\n\nBridge fees: The function of OKX Swap is to serve as both a bridge and swap aggregator. A small fee is charged by the bridge to complete the bridging process.\n\nBase transaction fees: Like the Ethereum gas fee, a Base transaction fee is required to transfer ETH from the bridge to your wallet.\n\nConversion fees: There's an extra charge if you switch the cryptocurrency during the bridging process. For example, if you are bridging USDT on Ethereum but wish to have ETH on Base, you have the option to do so, but there will be a fee for converting USDT to ETH.\n\nBefore the transfer, you have the option to view a detailed breakdown of the conversion and bridge fees on OKX Swap. However, the Ethereum gas fee will only be displayed on the OKX Web3 wallet pop-up when you confirm the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nSimilar to \u200cfees, \u200ctransaction time is also influenced by various factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: The duration for ETH to be transferred from your wallet to the bridge is determined by the amount of gas used. Typically, only a few seconds.\n\nBridge processing time: The amount of time it takes to transfer your asset between chains varies depending on the specific bridge being used. For OKX Swap, this information can be found in the advanced options by selecting the trading route.\n\nBase blockchain confirmation time: The ETH will be transferred to your wallet once the bridging process is finished. Due to Base's fast processing speed, you can expect it to arrive in a matter of seconds.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nEnsuring secure transactions\n\nWhen using a cryptocurrency bridge, keep in mind that you\u2019re engaging with a smart contract that has access to your wallet. Malicious smart contracts could deplete wallet funds.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using a trustworthy bridge to Base, such as OKX Swap, which has a longstanding presence in the market.\n\nAvoid using your primary wallet to connect to bridges and decentralized applications. Instead, keep a separate cold wallet specifically for storing your assets.\n\nUse tools like Revoke to revoke access to your wallet once you\u2019re done bridging.\n\nAn effective approach to minimizing these risks is to use a centralized exchange for bridging. OKX is a top cryptocurrency exchange on a global scale, implementing top-notch security protocols to guarantee the safe and seamless buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for users across the world. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nHere are some of the common pitfalls you should avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Base:\n\nBe sure to review all the information you enter before submitting it. Once you\u2019ve confirmed the transaction, you can't undo it.\n\nBe mindful of the gas fees . During periods of high demand and congestion, there's a possibility for Ethereum gas fees to reach alarmingly high levels. It may be best to wait for the fees to decrease or use a centralized exchange for bridging purposes.\n\nHigh slippage and liquidity issues are another aspect to look out for. You may encounter significant slippage when using a relatively unknown or low-liquidity bridge to transfer coins. To prevent this, it's advisable to only bridge assets with a strong level of liquidity.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nStuck transactions are a common problem. Make sure to set an appropriate gas fee on Ethereum for the transaction to go through. If your gas is too low, the transaction will fail and the funds will be returned to your wallet. Bridge congestion can also cause transactions to get stuck, but cryptocurrency bridges are designed to handle them and will be resolved eventually. Patience is required in these situations.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: Before bridging, always make sure there\u2019s is sufficient liquidity for the asset being bridged and that it\u2019s compatible with the chain.\n\nWhere to seek help\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is extremely supportive. If you encounter any problems, you should be able to find assistance."

Additionally, we\u2019ll walk through a centralized bridging process using OKX to bridge USDT from Ethereum to Polygon.\n\nIntroduction to Polygon and blockchain bridging\n\nBlockchains are typically isolated systems with their native tokens and can't interact with other chains. Blockchain bridging enables blockchain interoperability and digital asset transfer between multiple chains. With each chain having its own features and applications, users must be able to move across them conveniently. Cryptocurrency bridging refers to the act of moving your funds from one chain to another.\n\nPolygon blockchain is an Ethereum-compatible chain, but faster and more efficient than Ethereum. At any given time, the transaction fee on Polygon is a fraction of what it is on Ethereum. This makes Polygon ideal for various use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Bridging from Ethereum and other chains to Polygon is essential to get into the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nThe first step before using an ETH to Polygon bridge is to choose the right wallet .\n\nThe OKX Web3 Wallet offered by OKX is known for its strong security measures and ability to support multiple cryptocurrency chains. This wallet can securely hold BTC and any other digital currencies for an indefinite period of time. It also boasts bank-level security and allows users to easily access a variety of decentralized applications (DApps) and the OKX NFT Marketplace .\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking to bridge assets from one chain to another, you must make sure you have the native assets on both bridges. Transferring from Ethereum to Polygon requires ETH to complete the initial transaction. MATIC is the native token of Polygon. While you don\u2019t need MATIC to bridge your assets, you still need it to use your bridged asset on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nNext, you must decide on the digital asset you\u2019re transferring and make sure it\u2019s supported on both chains. One easy way to do this is to check for the supported assets on the bridge of your choice before cryptocurrency bridging.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nThe most common method of cryptocurrency bridging is to use decentralized bridges. Polygon Portal is a popular ETH to Polygon bridge built by the Polygon Foundation and is a safe blockchain bridge to use. Other popular polygon bridging providers include Allbridge and Wormhole . They\u2019re good options if you\u2019re looking for advanced controls.\n\nAnother option is OKX Swap , which allows you to swap and bridge assets across multiple chains. OKX collects prices from numerous decentralized exchanges to provide the most efficient path, reducing both slippage and fees.\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nA straightforward way to bridge assets is using centralized exchanges. You can deposit your assets to OKX using one chain and withdraw them using another. Here\u2019s a simple guide to bridging USDT from Ethereum to Polygon using OKX.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX .\n\nStep 2: Once logged in, head to \u201cAssets\u201d on the top-right and select \u201cDeposit.\u201d If you don\u2019t already have USDT, you can buy some on OKX.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cUSDT\u201d as the crypto and \u201cUSDT-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Deposit USDT into the address shown in your Ethereum Wallet. It takes a few minutes for the USDT to reach your account and be accessible.\n\nStep 5: Return to the \"Assets\" section after your funds become available and select \"Withdraw.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Choose \"USDT\" as the cryptocurrency and opt for the \"On-chain\" withdrawal option.\n\nStep 7: Type in your Polygon address, and select the network as \u201cUSDT-Polygon.\u201d Enter the amount of USDT you want to bridge to Polygon and hit next. You\u2019ll be asked to authenticate your account, and the USDT should arrive in your wallet within a few minutes.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to bridge your assets is by using an exchange, since you won't have to worry about slippage or network fees.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nLet\u2019s now walk through the process of bridging ETH from Ethereum to Polygon. We\u2019ll use Polygon Portal as the ETH to Polygon bridge for this and the OKX Web3 Wallet, which we previously set up. Next, we\u2019ll also explore how we can perform decentralized bridging on OKX Swap.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to Polygon Portal .\n\nStep 2: Click \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d in the top-right corner and select OKX Wallet.\n\nStep 3: Type in the password for your OKX wallet and select \u201cConfirm\u201d to allow Polygon Portal to connect with your wallet.\n\nTransferring assets to Polygon\n\nNow that you\u2019re connected to Polygon Portal, you're ready to bridge your Ethereum.\n\nStep 1: Click on \u201cBridge\u201d on the left.\n\nStep 2: Fill in the bridge details. There are a few fields here that you need to fill in carefully. Let's break them down:\n\nTransfer from: The chain you are transferring from. In this case, Ethereum. Token: Select the token you want to transfer. We\u2019re going to select ETH here. Amount: Type in the amount of ETH you want to transfer from Ethereum to Polygon. Transfer to: Select Polygon POS since this is the chain we\u2019re bridging our ETH to. Refuel gas: Polygon's native currency is MATIC, and refuel acts as an ETH to MATIC bridge. It's optional for the bridge to go through. However, you need it to interact with your bridged ETH. Turn it on and select the amount of MATIC you want if you have none. It can also be considered a MATIC Bridge since you\u2019re converting a part of Ethereum\u2019s native currency to Polygon\u2019s native currency.\n\nStep 3: After filling in and selecting all the fields, select \u201cBridge ETH to Polygon POS.\u201d\n\nStep 4: OKX Wallet is shown with the details of your transaction. Confirm it once again and hit \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nPolygon Portal or any other bridges can also do the reverse and act as Polygon to ETH bridges if required. Note that to do so, you must select Polygon POS as the first chain and Ethereum as the second.\n\nBridge ETH to Polygon on OKX Swap\n\nOKX swap is a decentralized cross-chain swap and bridge aggregator. OKX itself isn't performing the bridging here. Instead, OKX sources the best price across multiple bridges and moves your crypto.\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap and connect your wallet. The process is the same as connecting your wallet to Polygon Portal above.\n\nStep 2: Set the parameters under \u201cSwap and Bridge\u201d:\n\nSet the first chain as \u201cEthereum\u201d and type in the amount of ETH you want to bridge. Set the second chain as \u201cPolygon\u201d and the coin as \u201cWETH.\u201d OKX automatically shows you how much WETH you\u2019d be receiving here.\n\nStep 3 (optional): Click on the small arrow next to the rate to expand the menu. This is an advanced option \u2014 you don\u2019t have to change anything here. If you\u2019re sure about what you\u2019re doing, you can manually adjust the slippage and change the trading route.\n\nStep 4: Click \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet pops up, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap is a user-friendly DeFi solution for transferring your cryptocurrencies across chains and exchanging them during the process.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThere are multiple fees involved in a decentralized bridging process:\n\nEthereum gas fees : To send your ETH and use the Polygon Portal bridge, you're required to pay a transaction fee to the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon Portal fees: Since Polygon Portal is providing the service of bridging your ETH from Ethereum to Polygon, a small fee is involved.\n\nPolygon transaction fees: Similar to the Ethereum gas fee, a polygon transaction fee is taken to facilitate the transaction of ETH from the bridge to your wallet.\n\nConversion fees: Some assets aren't native to the blockchain. This includes ETH on Polygon. The ETH is converted to Wrapped ETH (WETH) and deposited into your wallet. WETH is pegged to the price of ETH and enables the seamless transfer of assets between chains. There's a small fee involved in the conversion of ETH to WETH.\n\nBefore transferring, you can get a breakdown of the conversion and bridge fees on Polygon Portal. However, the Ethereum gas fee is only shown on the OKX wallet pop-up before you confirm the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nJust like the fees, the transaction time also depends on multiple factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: This is your ETH's time to move from your wallet to the bridge. If you use enough gas, this should take a few seconds.\n\nBridge processing time: This is how long the bridge would take to move your asset from one chain to another. It changes from bridge to bridge. In the case of Polygon Portal, you can see it below the confirmation button before you bridge. This is only an estimation and could take longer if lots of people are using the bridge at the same time.\n\nPolygon blockchain confirmation time: The WETH must come to your wallet once the bridging is complete. Since Polygon is very fast, it should reach your wallet in a few seconds.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nKeeping transactions secure\n\nCryptocurrency bridges are powered by smart contracts that have access to the funds in your wallet. Unfortunately, wallet funds can be depleted using rouge smart contracts. We recommend the following for secure crypto transactions on bridges:\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using a reputable bridge service like Polygon Portal, which has been in the market for a long time.\n\nAvoid using your primary wallet to engage with bridges and other DApps. Instead, use a separate cold wallet for this purpose.\n\nAfter bridging, make use of tools such as Revoke to remove access to your wallet.\n\nA potential solution to reduce these risks could be using a centralized exchange. As a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, OKX employs world-class security measures to enable users worldwide to buy and sell crypto safely and seamlessly. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nHere are some of the common pitfalls you can avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Polygon:\n\nMake sure to review all the information you enter before submitting it. Once you confirm the transaction, it can't be reversed.\n\nPlease keep in mind the gas fees , as they can become relatively expensive on Ethereum during periods of high network traffic. Consider waiting for the fees to decrease, or use a centralized exchange to make the transfer.\n\nAnother factor to consider is potential slippage and liquidity concerns. Using a less popular bridge or bridging to a coin with limited liquidity may result in higher slippage. It\u2019s best to bridge assets with good liquidity to prevent this.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nOne common problem encountered by users is transactions that become stuck. The only factor you can influence is the gas fee for Ethereum, which must be set correctly for the transaction to be successful. The transaction will fail if the gas fee is insufficient, and the funds will be returned to your wallet. Transactions can also get stuck when the bridge is congested. Fortunately, cryptocurrency bridges are designed to handle these situations and will eventually be resolved. It may just take longer, so it\u2019s wise to be patient.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: Before bridging, always make sure there\u2019s sufficient liquidity for the asset being bridged and that it can be used on the designated chain.\n\nWhere to seek help\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is incredibly supportive, and if you encounter any problems, you can count on finding assistance."

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: Crossing the Chasm: U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Usher in a New Era of Crypto Adoption - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "The introduction of US Bitcoin spot ETFs marks a pivotal moment in the journey toward cryptocurrency acceptance. In an earlier article, I emphasized the significance of the product adoption curve. With the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it is evident that crypto has successfully navigated the chasm phase of the curve and is now entering the realm of the early majority. On average the gains of new entrants forming the early majority, will likely be less than those of the early adopters, but they will still beat the broader market as adoption of crypto continues to increase.\n\nPhoto: Wikimeida Commons\n\nAnticipations are high that, over the coming months, traditional investors will channel substantial funds into the cryptocurrency market via spot ETFs and derivatives. This influx is expected to lead to a steady increase in cryptocurrency values. Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving in April is poised to further fuel this upward trend by slicing the daily supply of Bitcoin in half.\n\nYet, it\u2019s Ethereum that seems poised to reap the most significant rewards from the Bitcoin ETF approvals. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the premier protocol in terms of total value locked, Ethereum has experienced more substantial gains than Bitcoin since the ETF approvals. Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, Ethereum is expected to benefit from the Bitcoin halving and the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming Ethereum ETF in May. Secondly, Ethereum\u2019s inherent utility as a smart contract platform, its capped supply, and ongoing enhancements aimed at boosting its efficiency and accessibility, position it as the preferred infrastructure for global digital assets.\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum ETF, expected to launch in May, is set to solidify Ethereum\u2019s status as a frontrunner in the digital asset sphere. This ETF will draw in conventional investors seeking diverse exposure in the cryptocurrency market and spotlight Ethereum\u2019s distinct features, such as its smart contract functionality and progressive upgrades aimed at improving scalability and performance.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum will undoubtedly be compelling to observe. Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF is a significant step towards broader crypto acceptance, but Ethereum\u2019s utility and technological progress establish it as an indispensable player in the digital asset infrastructure. The advent of spot ETFs represents a critical milestone, signifying the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into conventional financial systems.\n\nTo sum up, the launch of the US spot Bitcoin ETF is a transformative event for the cryptocurrency industry, heralding a shift towards mainstream adoption. However, Ethereum is likely to be the primary beneficiary in the forthcoming months, propelled by its robust infrastructure, the anticipated ETF, and the growing recognition of the value of utility and technological innovation in the cryptocurrency sector. Moving forward, the interplay between these dominant cryptocurrencies and the wider financial ecosystem will undoubtedly shape the future of digital assets and global finance."

The existing trading level could witness increased buying, given the support at $38,500. In case of a support breakdown, the next support level is expected at $37,800, while upward resistance is identified at $40,350.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cBTC seems to have found the first level of strong support at $38.5k as a two-week-long sell-off post-ETF approval continues to keep new crypto investors from participating. It is worth noting that the next big support for BTC lies directly around the $32k mark so it is very important for the bulls to hold the $38.5k mark. While investors are turning fearful for the Bitcoin support to not hold with more than 300 million dollars worth of liquidations in the last 24 hours as per the data from Coinglass, a U-shaped recovery to take Bitcoin back to nearing $50k should is still a possibility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin encountered a significant drop, breaching the $40,000 threshold and briefly reaching $39,500, attributed to notable sales influenced by the Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF. This decline raises concerns about a potential descent to $38,000. In parallel, Ethereum grappled with its bearish momentum, experiencing a nearly 3% drop to $2,347 in 24 hours. This market movement unfolds amid a larger context where Bitcoin has seen a 20% decline post-major ETF launches by BlackRock and Fidelity. The downturn pressured Bitcoin miners with low transaction fees while institutional players strategically accumulated BTC, impacting short-term dynamics. Google Bard's AI hints at a possible further decline to $35,000, considering inflation, interest rates, and regulatory factors. Investors navigate cautiously as Bitcoin hovers just under $39,000, indicating potential price oscillation between $35,000 and $45,000.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market continues to witness selling pressure as Bitcoin ETFs have made entry and exit into the investment vehicle very easy. Users may have liquidated their positions to book profits and created new positions anticipating the next rally. Bitcoin and Ether dropped by roughly 1% and 6% respectively which resulted in a 2.14% drop in the overall crypto market cap. The next market mover can be the rate cut announcement by the US Fed which it signalled at the end of 2023.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the crypto market witnessed a decline, with BTC and ETH experiencing sharp drops. Although BTC managed to recover and close in the green, ETH remained weaker, influenced by panic selling triggered by news of GBTC ETFs selling. Technically, BTC found support at the 100 EMA D, a positive sign if it continues to rise from this level. ETH, on the other hand, is at a key support level but is yet to show signs of recovery. Critical support levels for ETH include $2,170, $2,125, and a notable support coinciding with the 200 EMA D at $2,016.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Celsius Dump Triggers Ethereum Dive: $35 Million Sell-Off Sends ETH Price Crashing - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Celsius Networks, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, has engaged in significant Ethereum transactions that are causing ripples within the digital currency landscape.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, on-chain analysts at LookonChain detected noteworthy transfers, including a 13,000 ETH deposit ($30 million) on Coinbase and an additional 2,200 ETH ($5 million) on FalconX. These transactions suggest a proactive stance by Celsius in addressing its ongoing financial challenges.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP Crash Fears Mount As Whale Dumps 26 Million Tokens \u2013 Details 8 months ago\n\nCelsius Sells $125M ETH, Maintains $1.3B Reserve\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius sold more than $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins between January 8 and January 12. The primary goal of this auction is to pay off creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also revealed a more widespread pattern of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion of staked Ethereum being redeemed during the same period. Since the Shanghai update last year, the amount of redemptions recorded is the highest.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints imposed by the court, Celsius still holds a substantial Ethereum reserve. This reserve amounts to over 557,000 coins in two staking wallets, with a total valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. The size of this reserve adds a layer of complexity to Celsius\u2019 current financial situation and underscores the evolving narrative within the crypto space.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nAs part of its obligations to creditors, Celsius has been actively liquidating its Ethereum holdings. These auctions, aimed at paying off outstanding debts, are integral to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nThe market has responded to these Ethereum transactions, resulting in a 4% decline in the price of ETH. The cryptocurrency slipped below the $2,350 mark, raising concerns among analysts, especially as ETH now wavers below its crucial demand zone ranging from $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts predict that a failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential retreat towards the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,307.2 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nWealthy Investors Trigger Ethereum Profit-Taking\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data reveals that significant transactions by wealthy investors, commonly known as whales, often trigger profit-taking activities among regular ETH holders. This phenomenon intensifies selling pressure and contributes to price declines.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMeanwhile, decreasing funding rates suggest an underlying optimism in the market, hinting at a possible cooldown in previously overheated perpetual markets. This situation leaves room for ETH to rebound once the selling pressure subsides.\n\nAs the bankruptcy drama of Celsius unfolds, the scrutiny on its Ethereum transactions and the resulting market dynamics will persist. Investors and observers are closely monitoring the situation, eagerly awaiting further developments and anticipating the broader implications for both Celsius and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"

        "content": "The Ethereum EIP website has accepted AllianceBlock's draft proposal for a new ERC token standard, and the Nexera protocol will be the first reference implementation of the ERC-7208.\n\nThrough his X (formerly Twitter) account, AllianceBlock's founder and CEO, Rachid Ajaja, verified this, calling it \"a significant milestone in the Company's spectacular journey.\" He also extended an invitation to cryptocurrency members to observe the evolution of the Draft to Final state by providing knowledge and experience that will be vital in improving the ERC interfaces and advancing them to the 'Final' stage, where they will be accepted by all.\n\nToday marks a significant milestone in our journey. Thanks to your incredible support, which has garnered 4,300 views, 70 replies, and 309 likes\u2014landing us at the top spot on the Ethereum Magician forum\u2014we've officially been accepted as a Draft on the Ethereum #EIP website\u2026 \u2014 Rachid Ajaja ?????? (@AjajaRachid) January 19, 2024\n\nWhat is ERC-7208?\n\nAllianceBlock released a draft proposal, known as ERC-7208, for a new Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) token standard. The idea of a new token type called \"Real World Asset\" (RWA) is introduced in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7208. Enhancing on-chain data processing and Real World Asset management across the Ethereum blockchain network is the main goal of this proposal.\n\nTokenizing Real World Assets requires consistent and predictable interactions between tokens; this is addressed in the ERC-7208 standard. In order to improve the functionality and interoperability of ERC tokens, it seeks to provide a set of interfaces known as the On-Chain Data Container (ODC), with a particular emphasis on managing on-chain data pertaining to Real World Assets.\n\nAllianceBlock's dedication to promoting innovation in the blockchain realm, particularly in the areas of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the tokenization of physical assets, is demonstrated by the creation of ERC-7208. The proposal is at the final stage of approval clearly demonstrating its importance within the Ethereum community.\n\nERC-7208 Empowering The world of Real World Assets (RWAs)\n\nSince its introduction in June 2021, ERC-7208 has been sparking lively discussions within the crypto sphere. Enthusiastic members of the Ethereum network have been actively participating in development forums, eagerly anticipating the potential expansion of the network. This is all pending the successful passage of the final draft of EIP7208 by AllianceBlock and its subsequent complete adoption on the Ethereum website. The recent Twitter announcement of this development also mentions the Ethereum Magician forum, a popular hub for developers and stakeholders to come together and suggest enhancements for the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP7208 aims to revolutionize the web3 and blockchain landscape by simplifying data transfer beyond traditional financial transactions. By streamlining the process of creating Real World Assets (RWAs) and also simplifying the rationalization and on-chain trading of these assets, tokenization of these assets will be made easier thanks to EIP7208 . This will be achieved with the introduction of a specialized token standard designed to handle real-world assets (RWAs) on the Ethereum platform, thus solidifying the network's position as a top player in the world of decentralized finance.\n\nJoin the Ethereum Crypto community and have discussions with other crypto enthusiasts on the importance of having ERC-7208 on the Ethereum website."

        "content": "Investors in the DeFi project, CBDAO (BREE), are scratching their heads after it became evident that the people behind the project have vanished. The project\u2019s website, Telegram group, and Twitter handles are no longer online, with the total lost funds exceeding over $1 million in ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, the BREE token which had traded as high as $50 in early September was trading at a $0.43 price, representing a 99.1% decrease from that all-time high.\n\nCBDAO exit scam\n\nAccording to information from its now-deleted website, CBDAO dubbed the \u201cUltimate DAO sandbox\u201d was a DeFi project that promised investors up to 30% APR. BREE tokens can be earned via farming and staking, with the project aiming to deliver a Governance as a Service (GaaS) solution that allows new decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to bootstrap their governance processes.\n\nAs per a detailed Medium post by a supposed investor, \u201cthe team had been developing the project and meeting deadlines,\u201d and even \u201cpushed a new website the night before the attack.\u201d\n\nThe team had announced a token swap for users to swap BREE tokens for Synthetic Bree (SBREE) tokens, and it was a backdoor on the newest token contract that the attacker exploited. They minted 50,000 SBREE, converted to BREE, and dumped onto the open market in fourteen separate transactions for roughly $60,000. That was in ETH addition to the roughly $1 million that the project initially raised, leaving investors bewildered about why the paltry sum was the last act of the exit scam.\n\nWill the identity of CBDAO founders be uncovered?\n\nWith the project existing for as long as two months, investors claim to have uncovered the identity of some of its founders and have already reached out to law enforcement agencies. Other crypto exchanges that reportedly did business with the CBDAO team, including Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex (listed SBREE), Somish Labs, and Etherscan (advertiser), have been contacted.\n\nMeanwhile, angry investors who lost thousands of dollars to the CBDAO exit scam created a Telegram group vowing to uncover the identity of the project\u2019s founders.\n\nSee Also: Degen DeFi User Farming UniCats tokens Ends up Losing $140,000 UNI tokens to Exploit"
