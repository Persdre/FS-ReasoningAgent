However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate investing products to write unbiased product reviews.\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets that are created and run on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin and ether are two popular cryptocurrencies, but there are many others.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency can be extremely risky, and the underlying technology is very new.\n\nInvestors need to understand how cryptocurrencies work, who creates and controls them, and why you might want to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile there may be opportunities to build wealth, there are a lot of risks involved with crypto investing, and you need to be mindful of scams.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that investors can buy and sell along the blockchain. Unlike banknotes or minted coins with a tangible physical form, cryptocurrencies can only be accessed using computers and other electronic devices.\n\nA decentralized currency is not issued by a government or financial institution. In fact, no single person, company, or government controls a cryptocurrency's blockchain. Instead, it's run by a decentralized network of computers worldwide. Anyone with advanced technology skills and coding experience can create a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe lack of a central authority can also make cryptocurrencies more secure. \"It's hack-proof because there's no one central point of failure,\" explains David Donovan, executive vice president at Publicis Sapient.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies work?\n\nWhile there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, many with unique traits, they all work similarly. It's hard to avoid jargon when discussing cryptos, but the concepts can be relatively easy to understand.\n\nBlockchain technology\n\nA cryptocurrency's blockchain is a digital record of all crypto transactions. Copies of the blockchain are stored and maintained by computers around the world. They're often compared to general ledgers, part of traditional double-entry bookkeeping systems where each transaction leads to debit and credit in different sections of the books.\n\n\"It works like a general ledger \u2014 it's that simple,\" says Donovan. Perhaps you start with two coins and send one to someone. \"On the blockchain, it would say I'm sending you one coin, and I now have one coin, and you have one coin.\"\n\nEach grouping of transactions is turned into a block and chained to the existing ledger. Once a block is added, it can't be reversed or altered \u2014 which is why people describe blockchains as \"immutable.\"\n\nSome cryptos have their own blockchain. For example, there are Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. However, some cryptos are built on top of an existing blockchain rather than starting from zero.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, but is also available for trading on other exchanges like Coinbase, Binance.US, Ninjatrader and Robinhood.\n\nPublic transactions under pseudonymous\n\nCryptocurrencies have another defining feature. The blockchains are public ledgers, which means anyone can see and review the transactions that occurred. However, they can also provide a degree of anonymity.\n\n\"You have a private key, which is how you initiate transactions, and a public key, which is how someone identifies you in the market,\" says Donovan.\n\nA blockchain's transactions are tied to a crypto wallet's public key, but nobody necessarily knows who controls that wallet. This is why cryptos are often described as pseudonymous \u2014 the public key is a person's pseudonym.\n\nComing to consensus\n\nCryptocurrencies commonly use one of two mechanisms to create a system of trust and determine which transactions are valid and added to their blockchain:\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of work . This relies on people around the world, known as miners, competing to be the first to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and add the next block to the blockchain. The winners are paid after the other network members confirm that the required amount of computing power was used to find the solution. \"The way you ensure all the participants are validating the transactions is the hard work, effort, and money they're spending solving the problem,\" says Donna Parisi, global head of financial services and FinTech at Shearman & Sterling. However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power.\n\n.

However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power. Proof of stake. This is a newer and less energy-intensive mechanism. \"Proof of stake is they validate transactions on the blockchain by people putting value on the line,\" explains Parisi. \"They stake some of the currency they own to make sure they only validate true transactions.\"\n\nTypes of cryptocurrencies\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there were more than 25,149 different cryptocurrencies with a global market value of about $1.16 trillion as of May 30, 2023. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include:\n\nBitcoin\n\nDogecoin\n\nEther\n\nLitecoin\n\nTether\n\nBinance coin\n\nDai\n\nTRON\n\nCronos\n\nUSD coin\n\nBitcoin cash\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was launched in 2009 as an alternative type of decentralized and digital money. Since then, people have also created cryptocurrencies that serve other functions or are designed for specific types of transactions. All non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are often referred to as altcoins.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies can have many different uses,\" says Parisi. \"Some are used in gaming environments to earn rewards in a game, while others facilitate payments. Some are designed for cross-border remittances \u2026 some are designed for micro payments.\"\n\nFor example, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that try to maintain a steady and fixed exchange rate with another asset, such as the US dollar. Governance tokens are another example of a specialized cryptocurrency. They give token holders voting power in a corresponding crypto project.\n\nInsider's Featured Crypto Apps Public Investing\n\nWealthfront Investing Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

This money has no physical equivalent, unlike tangible forms of currency like banknotes or minted coins. But just like physical money, digital currencies can be used to purchase goods and services.\n\nHowever, you'll be limited to online platforms and communities, such as investing platforms, gaming sites, and gambling portals. Some of the most popular forms of digital currency include cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\n\"There's a strive toward decentralization,\" says Nisa Amoils, a managing partner at A100xx Ventures. \"Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies continue to be a worthwhile investment for many investors.\"\n\nDigital currencies come in two forms:\n\nCentralized currency: Currencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public.\n\nCurrencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public. Decentralized currency: Currencies not issued by governments or financial institutions. Instead, decentralized currencies operate through peer-to-peer financial networks to eliminate the middleman (aka banks) and allow lending, trading, and borrowing directly with merchants.\n\nDigital currencies like crypto are often appealing to investors who are wary of government-issued funds and are that are seeking alternatives.\n\n\"Some people who had been excluded from the traditional financial system, or have had their currencies devalued, are seeking an opportunity to participate in the markets, and this is a retail-driven phenomenon first,\" says Amoils. \"There's this crisis of trust, and people want wealth creation for themselves. And so that spurred this whole kind of trading speculative movement.\"\n\nHow to invest in cryptocurrency\n\nYou can start investing in cryptocurrencies through existing crypto exchanges and investing platforms. Some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Kraken and Coinbase) offer assets like staking rewards, goal-planning features, low fees, and more.\n\nSome of the best investment apps that offer cryptocurrencies (such as Robinhood Investing) include a range of investment types, low fees, market access, and more.\n\nIf you want to get more advanced and start trading, note that you can strategies such as shorting crypto that are popular with day traders who don't buy and hold for the long term.\n\nYou can create your own crypto\n\nAnyone with coding skills and/or advanced technical knowledge can create their own cryptocurrencies \u2014 although this is not always an easy feat and isn't recommended for beginners. The three ways to create crypto are:\n\nBuilding a new blockchain: The most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.\n\nThe most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more. Modifying a blockchain: If you can't create your own blockchain, you can modify an existing blockchain's open-source code to your liking. Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge.\n\nIf you can't create your own blockchain, you can modify an existing blockchain's open-source code to your liking. Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge. Building upon a blockchain: The simplest way to make your own coins or tokens is by expanding upon an already existing blockchain. But keep in mind that the success of your cryptocurrency will be reliant on the success of the original blockchain. Some blockchains that allow this are Binance and Ethereum.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies secure?\n\nThe blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies can help ensure that the coins and systems remain secure. \"What's never been refuted is the value of blockchain,\" says Donovan. \"The way the ledger system is set up and every transaction is recorded. And the fact that it's immutable.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you don't need to worry about security. The crypto world is rife with scams. Of course, that's also true of traditional financial systems and currencies. Someone asking you to pay with a gift card or wire transfer is a red flag that you're dealing with a scammer. But several factors could make crypto scams especially worrisome.\n\nFor example, cryptocurrency transactions can't be reversed. There's also less regulation of cryptocurrencies and platforms than of traditional financial services in the US. Plus, some people may feel pressure to act quickly and send or invest their money because they're worried about missing out on an opportunity.\n\n\"One way to avoid a scam is to invest in more well-established cryptocurrencies,\" says Parisi. \"You still may be subject to scams or fraud in terms of how you hold it, send it, or receive it.\" But you can have some certainty that the cryptocurrency itself isn't a scam.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies a good investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies may present a good investment opportunity, and there are many ways to invest in the crypto world.\n\nYou could buy a coin (or coins) and hold onto them, hoping they'll increase in value. Or you could use your coins in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to earn interest through staking or lending. You also might take a more traditional route, such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is tied to cryptocurrencies. There could even be opportunities to invest in projects or supporting industries rather than in the cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\n\"From an investment perspective, crypto is rapidly evolving,\" says Parisi. \"You shouldn't put an amount of assets you're not willing to lose. It should be, relatively speaking, a small portion of your portfolio.\"\n\nBefore making any investment, consider the potential pros and cons:\n\nPros Cons Easy to invest\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity\n\nFaster and cost-effective transactions\n\nDecentralized currency\n\nSecurity and transparency through the blockchain Cryptocurrencies can be very volatile\n\nSome crypto projects may fail\n\nThe investment may be a scam\n\nEnvironmental impact due to excessive power consumption through ASIC computers\n\nLacking refund and cancellation policies\n\nShould you invest in crypto?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency investing is a hotly debated topic, it's worth understanding what's going on so you can make an informed decision. If you decide to get started, you could fully jump in or just dip your toe.\n\n\"Learn about crypto by opening up wallets, accounts, trading currencies, and learning more about the use cases,\" says Parisi. \"But do it in a reasonable way. We're still in the early days, and regulation of crypto is still evolving.\"\n\nDonovan suggests opening an account with a regulated and publicly traded company like Coinbase. But, he says, \"It's really about being smart and using the system to take baby steps.\"\n\nCrypto FAQs\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an electronic version of money that verifies transactions using cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information). As Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur Jimmy Song says, Bitcoin is \"decentralized, digital, and scarce money.\" Bitcoin is decentralized because this code is run by thousands of computers (i.e., 'nodes') spread across the globe, digital because it exists as a set of code that determines how it operates, and scarce because its code caps its overall volume to 21 million bitcoins.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing platform network. The Ethereum network works like the Bitcoin network in that it's built on blockchain technology, essentially a digital public ledger where financial agreements can be verified and stored entirely by software \u2014 without the intervention of a third party.\n\nWhat are privacy coins? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that obscure transactions on their blockchain to maintain the anonymity of users and their activity. Participants in a transaction will know the amount transacted and the parties involved. However, the same information will be unobtainable to any outside observer.\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. A crypto wallet is a software program or physical device that allows you to store your crypto and allow for the sending and receiving of crypto transactions. A crypto wallet consists of two key pairs: private keys and public keys. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to send crypto to the wallet.\n\nWhat is hash rate? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Hash rate is a measure of the total computational power being used by a proof-of-work cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain. It can also be a measure of how fast a cryptocurrency miner's machines complete these computations.\n\nWhat is yield farming? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your cryptocurrency, similar to how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account. And similarly to depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called \"staking,\" for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is crypto staking? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Crypto staking is similar to depositing money in a bank, in that an investor locks up their assets, and in exchange, earns rewards, or \"interest.\" \"Staking is a term used to refer to the delegating of a certain number of tokens to the governance model of the blockchain and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time,\" says Nicole DeCicco, the owner and founder of CryptoConsultz, a cryptocurrency consultancy in the Portland, Oregon area.\n\nLouis DeNicola Louis DeNicola is the president of LD Money Media LLC and an experienced writer who specializes in consumer credit, personal finance, and small-business finance.

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Will Hit $5,000 by 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are two key catalysts that could propel Ethereum to a new all-time high next year.\n\nUp more than 50% through the first half of 2024, Ethereum (ETH -7.12%) now appears to be on track to regain its all-time high of $4,891 from the previous crypto bull market rally. Given Ethereum's current price of $3,400, that would imply a rally of more than 40% within a relatively short period of time.\n\nThat's certainly possible, given how well Ethereum has performed over the first half of the year. But a lot still needs to go right. Here's a closer look at two key factors that could propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\n1. Continued growth of Ethereum's blockchain ecosystem\n\nFirst and most importantly, Ethereum needs to see continued growth in core segments of its sprawling blockchain ecosystem. One of the most important of these segments is known as decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to traditional financial products and services reinvented with the help of blockchain technology. As such, DeFi offers the potential for faster, cheaper, and better solutions than those currently offered by traditional Wall Street providers.\n\nIn order to come up with a reasonable future price forecast for Ethereum, it is important first to come up with a ballpark figure for how much market value Ethereum can realistically create over the next few years. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has crunched the numbers and determined that blockchain networks such as Ethereum could potentially generate $5 trillion in new market value by 2030.\n\nThat may sound like a huge, pie-in-the-sky number, but not when you take into account emerging trends such as asset tokenization, which refers to the process of transforming traditional financial instruments into digital assets that live on the blockchain. The faster that the process of asset tokenization takes place, the more valuable Ethereum becomes. According to consulting firm McKinsey, asset tokenization could be a $2 trillion market opportunity by 2030, and Ethereum stands to be a key beneficiary.\n\n2. Mainstream investor acceptance of Ethereum ETFs\n\nEven if you don't buy into the idea of blockchain-powered financial products transforming the modern financial system, there is one other path to Ethereum soaring to the $5,000 mark: the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs, which are scheduled to begin trading this summer. In a bullish scenario, as much as $4.8 billion in new investor money could flow into these new ETFs, helping to boost the price of Ethereum.\n\nTo get a sense of how much of a boost these ETFs may provide, consider the example of the spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.33%) ETFs, which began trading in January. Over the ensuing six months, the price of Bitcoin soared from approximately $45,000 to $70,000, for a gain of nearly 55%. For the sake of argument, let's assume that the new Ethereum ETFs are not as successful as the Bitcoin ETFs, and the gains are not as significant. But even a rally of 40% would still be enough to propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a $2 trillion asset?\n\nIn fact, a price forecast of $5,000 may turn out to be conservative. For example, investment firm VanEck came up with a base-case price forecast of $22,000 for Ethereum for the year 2030. This assumes that Ethereum can continue to make inroads in areas such as DeFi and Web3, and that key blockchain metrics continue to see improvement over the next five years. At a price of $22,000 per coin, Ethereum would have an implied valuation of more than $2 trillion, making it more valuable than all but a handful of companies in the world.\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, keep in mind that crypto can be incredibly volatile and unpredictable. There's always the chance that Ethereum will no longer continue to see rapid gains after a remarkable first decade of growth. Tech issues could prevent it from scaling past a certain point, and the arrival of new competitors could blindside it.\n\nThat being said, if you think that we're on the cusp of a major bull market rally, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar as a cryptocurrency capable of soaring in value over the next several years."

Although things have slowed down in July\u2014the protocol has seemingly attracted only $65.1 million worth of deposits, according to data provided by crypto analytics service Flipside.\n\nGiven Tornado Cash\u2019s nature as a mixer, the total value locked (TVL) metric used for judging an ecosystem\u2019s activity level is not as reliable. Total value locked refers the the value of assets that have been deposited into a decentralized application. That's why TVL isn't typically used to measure activity on Tornado Cash. The expected use case is to deposit funds and then withdraw anonymized funds\u2014rather than keep them in the protocol for a long time like with most decentralized finance services.\n\nStill, DeFiLlama data for Tornado Cash\u2019s TVL shows sizeable growth, with the protocol starting the year at under 160,000 ETH and currently standing at nearly 168,600 ETH. In U.S. dollars, this is a growth from $374.4 million to the current value of $572.82 million \u2014 when taking asset value growth into account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Tornado Cash?\n\nTornado Cash is a coin mixer that was created to preserve the privacy of crypto users. Using zero-knowledge proof cryptography, the protocol anonymizes user deposits and allows their withdrawal to a new address that cannot be traced to the old one.\n\nThe Ethereum mixer has seen inflows from wallets associated with major hacks, including the hacker behind the Poloniex hack sending $3.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to the mixer back in early May. Due to transactions linked to hacks\u2014including some allegedly linked to North Korea\u2014the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash in early August 2022.\n\nThis was then followed by the lengthy legal prosecution against Tornado Cash developers which was seen as a major overreach by much of the crypto community. This prosecution is still ongoing, with a last week ruling delaying the money laundering trial of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, over the objections of the prosecution.\n\nCoinbase's chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in April that the U.S. Treasury is \"bending old laws past their breaking point\" by placing blame for Tornado Cash\u2019s misuse on developers and TORN holders.\n\nImmutable, open-source software code isn\u2019t property, which creates a real issue for Treasury, as it\u2019s authorized to regulate only 'property' in which a foreign national has an interest, he said at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in late May that Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev being sentenced to 64-months in prison was \u201creally unfortunate,\u201d and continued to back privacy-centric crypto tools, encouraging people to develop \u201cnext-gen\u201d solutions.\n\n\"I think a lot of people have been going under the assumption [...] that just building software is something that\u2019s okay,\" he said during a fireside chat at DappCon in Berlin, \"and is a totally legal and legit way to fight for privacy.\"\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "5 Tokens to Buy Before the Ethereum ETF Trade Starts\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a calm period, a sort of calm before the storm. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting the next big bull run. During this time, altcoins present some of the best entry points. Although they have begun to show signs of rising, they haven't yet skyrocketed, making them ripe for investment. With the Ethereum ETF trade on the horizon, this transitional phase hints at massive potential gains across the board.\n\nThis article unveils five tokens that are particularly poised for impressive growth as the market braces for the ETF impact.\n\nCYBRO Presale Advances as Demand for AI-based Tokens Surges\n\nThe CYBRO presale has rapidly advanced to its fifth stage, amassing over $1.3 million. This AI-based yield aggregator offers users the potential to enhance their earnings within the Blast ecosystem, delivering unparalleled rewards for staking ETH and stablecoins. Smart investors see great potential in $CYBRO tokens as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the hottest trend in crypto nowadays,\n\nBenefits for CYBRO Token Holders:\n\nCompetitive staking rewards\n\nAccess to airdrops\n\nReduced trading and lending fees\n\nA robust insurance program within the platform\n\nIndustry experts forecast a potential return on investment of 1200%, with CYBRO tokens currently available at a presale price of just $0.03 each. This technologically advanced initiative has already garnered attention from prominent crypto whales and influencers, reflecting strong market confidence and interest..\n\n\n\nWith only 21% of the total token supply allocated for the presale and approximately 64 million tokens already sold, now is an opportune moment to secure a position in this innovative project, which holds significant potential to become a major player in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200%<<\n\n\n\nHigh Hopes for ETH as Altcoin Season Nears Amid Bullish Patterns\n\nEthereum, also known as ETH, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. It\u2019s known for its smart contract technology, which allows developers to create decentralized apps. Despite recent market dips, ETH is showing strong patterns similar to 2021. This suggests the coin could see significant gains soon. Its technology has many uses and a solid track record, making it an attractive option. With the potential for a bull run, ETH stands out as a promising investment.\n\n\n\nXRP: The Hidden Gem Ready to Shine Despite Market Challenges\n\nXRP, developed by Ripple Labs, is designed for fast and low-cost international payments. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP focuses on making cross-border transactions easier and quicker for banks and payment providers. The coin\u2019s technology allows for almost instant transfers with minimal fees, making it an attractive option in the financial world. As we see repeat patterns from 2021, XRP\u2019s strong fundamentals and real-world use case could make it a top performer in this market cycle. Its resilience and utility make it a hidden gem worth watching.\n\n\n\nSOL\u2019s Hidden Potential: Why Solana Could Be the Star of the Next Bull Run\n\nSolana (SOL) stands out with its fast and low-cost transactions. This coin uses a method called Proof-of-History, making it different from other coins. Developers love it because it can handle many transactions at once. This makes it great for DeFi and NFTs. With the market now looking for strong coins after the latest dip, SOL could be in the spotlight. Patterns from 2021 suggest a chance for another big rise. Solana looks very attractive as the next big thing in the crypto market.\n\n\n\nTON Coin: A Hidden Gem Ready to Shine in the Next Altcoin Boom\n\nTON Coin is catching eyes in the crypto world. Originally developed by Telegram, it\u2019s designed for fast transactions and strong security. It uses blockchain tech to deliver blazing speed and low fees. Even with the latest market slump, similar to 2021 patterns, smart investors are seeing its potential. The unique technology and vision behind TON make it a strong contender in the next altcoin surge.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nETH, XRP, SOL, TRX, and TON might have limited short-term potential. However, CYBRO, an innovative DeFi platform, provides unique chances for investors. Its AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain enhances earnings. It offers lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The user experience is exceptional with easy deposits and withdrawals. CYBRO focuses on transparency, compliance, and quality, making it a standout project. Strong interest from crypto whales and influencers further underscores its promise.\n\n\n\nSite: https://cybro.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Cybro_io\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/xFMGDQPhrB\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/cybro_io\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "What is Optimism (OP): Guide to One of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-Two Scaling Solutions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry, in general, has become much more popular in the past couple of years. This saw the development and launch of hundreds if not thousands, of decentralized applications (dApps) in various fields, such as DeFi, gaming, learning, trading, investing, and so on.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, including but not limited to the massive bull run in 2021, the rise of non-fungible tokens, the popularity of memecoins, and more. This saw hundreds of thousands of users flocking to whatever the next trend may be.\n\nUnlike previous cycles, however, this time, we also saw regular users take advantage of on-chain availabilities and interact with various dApps such as Uniswap, OpenSea, and so forth. And while this had a massively beneficial effect on the industry\u2019s growth and valuation, it also highlighted some very critical issues.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum\u2014where the lion\u2019s share of dApp activity takes place\u2014struggled in terms of affordability, scalability, and even accessibility. Layer one alternatives like Solana also proved insufficiently effective in handling the massive load of user requests.\n\nThis brought up a topic that\u2019s been largely discussed in the cryptocurrency community for years\u2014scalability. Now that scaling solutions have become essentially imperative for the industry\u2019s future growth, projects like Optimism have seen the light of day.\n\nOne of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions, Optimism aims to solve some of the network\u2019s underlying issues, with a particular focus on scaling.\n\nQuick Facts About Optimism\n\nOptimism\u2019s mainnet went live on December 2021\n\nOptimism launched its native token (OP) on May 31st, 2022.\n\nA total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum scaling solution. In essence, its purpose is to help the main network run smoothly by taking some of its transactional load. In technical terms, Optimism is an \u201cOptimistic rollup,\u201d and it\u2019s important to understand what rollups do before diving deeper.\n\nWhat is a Rollup?\n\nRollups are one of the multiple scaling solutions intended to help Ethereum achieve a higher transaction throughput.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation explains that they \u201cperform transaction execution outside layer 1, and then the data is posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached.\u201d\n\nThe main benefit of this is that it reduces the load on the main network while also guaranteeing the broadcasted information by its native security.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups, mainly differentiated by their security models:\n\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups \u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain.\n\n\u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain. Optimistic rollups \u2013 these assume that transactions are valid by default and only run computation through fraud-proof if there\u2019s a challenge.\n\nOptimism falls within the second category, and, as you may have probably guessed already, its parent chain is Ethereum.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nThe big idea that makes Optimism interesting to most is the Optimistic Rollup. The following is a brief explanation of the concept\u2019s fundamental principles.\n\nHowever, the TLDR is that an Optimistic Rollup is another way of calling a blockchain designed to take advantage of the security of another network that acts as a parent one.\n\nBlock Storage\n\nAll of the blocks on Optimism are stored within a specific smart contract that\u2019s built on Ethereum and is called CannonicalTransactionChain \u2013 CTC to make it easier. They are helped within a list that\u2019s inside of the CTC, and it\u2019s append-only.\n\nThe CTC contains code that guarantees that the current list of blocks can\u2019t be altered by newer transactions on Ethereum. However, this guarantee can be broken if the Ethereum network itself undergoes a reorganization (reorg) and the order is changed.\n\nBlock Production\n\nThe \u2018sequencer\u2019 is the single party that manages block production on Optimism. It helps with the network by delivering the following:\n\nInstant transaction confirmations and state updates;\n\nConstructing and executing layer-two blocks;\n\nSubmitting user transactions to layer one.\n\nIt has no mempool, which means that the transactions are accepted (or rejected) immediately. This happens in the order they are received. When someone sends a transaction, the sequencer will check if it\u2019s valid (pays a sufficient fee) and apply it to the local state as a block that\u2019s pending. These pending blocks are then batched and periodically submitted to Ethereum\u2019s network for finalization.\n\nThe main goal of this batching is to reduce the overall transaction fees by spreading certain fixed costs over all of the transactions within a single batch. Of course, this fee may vary depending on the network load at the time when the transactions were sent to the sequencer.\n\nBlock Execution\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that Ethereum nodes download blocks from Ethereum\u2019s network that\u2019s peer-to-peer. Optimism nodes, on the other hand, download blocks directly from the CTC append-only contract.\n\nTwo primary components make up Optimism nodes: the Ethereum Data Indexer and the Optimism Client Software.\n\nEthereum Data Indexer\n\nIt\u2019s designed to reconstruct the optimism blockchain from blocks that are published to the CTC contract. It\u2019s also called the data transport layer.\n\nOptimism Client Software\n\nThis one closely resembles Geth, which means that Optimism, overall, is very similar in its design to Ethereum. This is also because Optimism shares the same Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), account and state structure, gas metering mechanism, and fee schedule.\n\nFault Proofs\n\nUsing an Optimistic Rollup means that state commitments are published to Ethereum\u2019s network directly without requesting proof of their validity. Fault proofs are requested when a state commitment is challenged. If it\u2019s challenged successfully, it is removed and eventually replaced by another one.\n\nThis documents provide a more in-depth and technical explanation of the terms and overall process described above.\n\nHow to Bridge Assets Between Layers\n\nWith layer-two scaling solutions such as Optimism, being able to swap assets between different layers is obviously of paramount importance.\n\nThere are multiple ways to do it. First and foremost, you can hop on the official website and use the bridge provided there. This would only require you to have a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask.\n\nFrom there, you have to select the network from which you want to bridge tokens. This is the supported list:\n\nThere are also options to bridge from centralized exchanges, but it\u2019s critical to note that these happen through providers that Optimism has simply linked to\u2014meaning there\u2019s no endorsement. You should proceed with caution and after conducting thorough due diligence.\n\nFrom there, the process is particularly simple, as all you need to do is confirm the amount and sign the transaction in your wallet.\n\nThere are a couple of options for bridging assets from optimism. You can use a third-party bridge or the official bridge instead. The following is an example of the latter, but keep in mind that bridging from Optimism to Ethereum takes seven days.\n\nAll you need to do is click the arrow in between the value boxes, and this will switch the above transaction. If you haven\u2019t added Optimism to MetaMask, this will also handle it for you. From there, you only have to confirm the amount and sign the transaction:\n\nGovernance: Optimism\u2019s Model\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Optimism ecosystem is the OP token.\n\nOptimism is governed by the so-called Optimism Collective. According to the official website, the collective is:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThat said, the governance of the Optimism Collective itself will consist of two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe Token House\n\nThe launch of the OP token and the Token House set forth the beginning of the governance of Optimism. OP itself was distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses, who engaged in community-oriented behavior through the first airdrop (more on that later.)\n\nIn any case, members of the Token House are responsible for deliberating, submitting, and voting on various proposals. To do so, OP holders can either vote directly o choose to delegate their voting power to a third party.\n\nIn essence, the Token House votes on proposals of the following types:\n\nProtocol u grades\n\nInflation adjustment\n\nTreasury appropriations\n\nRights protection\n\nGovernance fund grants\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 House\n\nAt its core, the Citizens\u2019 House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model. It is responsible for retroactive public goods funding.\n\nThe above brings us to our next point, which is the OP token.\n\nIntroducing the OP Token\n\nThe OP token was launched through an airdrop, which distributed a total of 5% of the total supply.\n\nThat said, qualifying users included:\n\nDAO voters\n\nMulti-Sig signers\n\nRepeat Optimism users\n\nGitrcoin donors\n\nIf you suspect you are eligible, you can check out any associated wallets on the official claim page.\n\nMany wonder if there will be a new airdrop, and the short answer is \u2013 yes. The team has made it clear that it plans to allocate a total of 19% of the supply for this purpose. Here\u2019s what the overall tokenomics of OP look like:\n\nPlease visit the official website for a more complete look at the economics behind the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nOptimism has quickly become one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions. Most recently, the Optimism Foundation released a proposal to upgrade the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, which is a new generation of decentralized Rollup architecture developed by Optimism Labs. Speaking on the matter, the team said:\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the post-Bedrock experience will be a positive change for developers in the Optimism ecosystem and have received consistent excitement for the upgrade from our partners. We are committed to making this upgrade a success and are eager to see the results in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to monitor how the different layer twos fare in the coming years as the battle between optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups continues."

        "content": "Sat 20 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEvery new milestone is eagerly anticipated by investors in the crypto sphere. The latest news? The launch of the first spot Ethereum ETFs, scheduled for July 23, 2024.\n\nThe big day for Ethereum ETFs is approaching\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) recently confirmed the date: the spot Ethereum ETFs will start trading on Tuesday July 23, 2024.\n\nAmong the listed funds, there are prestigious names such as 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV). This diversification offers investors a multitude of choices to allocate their funds according to their preferences and investment strategies.\n\nETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to directly buy the crypto. Indeed, it significantly simplifies access to the market.\n\nMoreover, ETFs offer a regulated and secure way to invest, which could attract more institutional investors, thereby bringing increased stability and legitimacy to the crypto market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave its preliminary approvals in May, marking a significant shift in its position towards Ethereum.\n\nThis turnaround surprised many observers, as the SEC had previously scrutinized Ethereum-centric companies very closely, seemingly treating this asset differently from Bitcoin. Indeed, the final approval of the ETFs by the SEC, expected before July 23, is a formality eagerly awaited.\n\nWhat This Means for Investors\n\nWith these new ETFs, investors have new options to diversify their portfolios. Instead of focusing solely on Bitcoin, they can now add Ethereum to their investment strategy via a more traditional financial product. This diversification can reduce risks and maximize opportunities for gains, particularly in a market as volatile as crypto.\n\nThe arrival of Ethereum ETFs is also likely to attract more institutional investors to the crypto market. These investors, who often manage significant portfolios, are looking for secure and regulated ways to access this growing market. ETFs offer exactly that: exposure to Ethereum without the complexities and risks associated with direct crypto ownership.\n\nIt is plausible that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs will have a significant impact on the asset\u2019s price. The increase in institutional demand could drive prices higher, bringing a new dynamic to the market. However, as always in the crypto world, it is essential to remain vigilant and not fall prey to excessive speculation.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Critiques Ethereum\u2019s Decentralization Compared to Bitcoin - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has a detailed analysis of decentralization in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin and other networks. The issue of centralized mining and staking in blockchains has remained contentious as analysts view models shifting from the core. Buterin also addressed debates with the mainnet and layer 2 solutions.\n\nVitalik Buterin Lauds Decentralization on Ethereum\n\nHe pointed out that Ethereum is in a better place than Bitcoin in terms of robustness and decentralization. Speaking at the ETHCC in Brussels, Vitalik Buterin noted that two mining pools account for 50% of the computing power of Bitcoin while four make up 75%. Drawing lines with Ethereum, he said that a large portion is unidentified which means they are operated by a group of individuals or independent stakers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe added that The Lido portion comprises 37 different validators, making the overall system largely decentralized. This generally attracts benefits like a multi-client ecosystem, different users across jurisdictions, and a multi-center knowledge ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThere are Geth execution clients and non-Geth execution clients, and the proportion of non-Geth execution clients exceeds that of Geth execution clients. A similar situation also occurs in the consensus client system.\u201d\n\nEthereum moved to a proof-of-stake consensus model after the much anticipated Merge. This essentially swapped miners with stakers reducing its energy use. However, while this method was tipped to aid the network, centralization claims were hammered by critics because of the 32 ETH benchmark.\n\nAlso Read: WazirX Hack Update: Will Investors Get Their Money Back?\n\nValidators and Threshold: A tradeoff\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted the obstacle of the 32 ETH staking threshold explaining the tradeoff for a cheaper fee. Today, the network has about 1 million validators and if the minimum threshold lowers to 4 ETH, the network would have about 8 million validators and so on increasing the trade-off.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a tradeoff. Ethereum has historically tried to be in the middle of that tradeoff. But if we can find any way to improve it, then we have extra stat points that we can choose to spend on reducing the minimum requirements, or on making it easier to run a node.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Ethereum co-founder described blockchains as truth machines providing the same over messages.\n\nA blockchain is a \u201ctruth machine\u201d in the specific sense that it provides consensus approximate-truth over when messages were sent. It doesn\u2019t tell you \u201cwas the moon landing real?\u201d. This reduces the blockchain\u2019s attack surface by a lot, but it does mean we need other tools to\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 20, 2024\n\nAt press time, ETH price is trading at $3,492, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume is flat over the last day as the market prepares for spot Ethereum ETF launch next week.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple (XRP) Case Update: Lawyer Dismisses SEC Meeting and Settlement Link\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nETH ETF products are expected to start trading this summer, fueling ongoing market optimism. Institutional market data provider Kaiko has released a report, projecting that Ethereum will outpace Bitcoin following the launch of spot Ether ETFs. The current conversation centers on whether Ethereum can reach $5,000 by the end of 2024.This year, spot crypto ETFs have dominated market spaces, attracting billions from investors. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 sparked renewed market optimism, paving the way for Ethereum. The success of Bitcoin products has increased investor interest in Ethereum, driving crypto prices to new highs.Just as the current web is the result of countless contributions from a diverse range of programmers, Ethereum is the product of the innovative efforts of thousands of individuals, each bringing unique ideas to the table. These pioneers are working tirelessly on various facets of blockchain technology, decentralized applications, smart contracts , and more. Their collective ingenuity and dedication are what drive Ethereum's continuous evolution, making it a powerful, decentralized platform that is reshaping industries and paving the way for the future of digital finance and beyond.Traditional investors are increasingly drawn to Ethereum because of the smart contract functionality and the numerous decentralized applications (dApps) in its ecosystem. The Ethereum ecosystem hosts over 4,000 dApps and millions of smart contracts. With the growing adoption and utility of Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, these figures are expected to increase significantly over the next few years.According to the latest data, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum Layer 2 networks has surged to an all-time high of $47 billion, marking a tenfold increase since March this year. This milestone underscores the growing importance of Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Arbitrum One leads with a TVL of nearly $19 billion, followed by OP Mainnet and Base, each exceeding $6 billion. Other networks, including Blast, Mantle, Linea, and Starknet, also boast TVLs surpassing $1 billion.The introduction of ETFs is pivotal as they attract institutional investors who bring substantial capital and a long-term investment outlook, thereby contributing to market stability. This influx is expected to significantly accelerate the growth of the asset class.The Bitcoin ETFs have already set a positive narrative in the market, with over $50 billion invested in 10 newly launched Bitcoin ETFs within five months of their introduction.Institutions already invested in Bitcoin ETFs are likely to diversify into these newly approved Ethereum ETFs. If Ethereum ETFs experience similar success, substantial institutional investments combined with bullish speculative trading could drive ETH prices to new all-time highs.According to media sources, VanEck, a global fund manager, expressed optimism regarding the future potential of Ethereum Layer 2 networks. The firm forecasts that these networks could achieve a valuation exceeding $1 trillion by the year 2030.Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Pectra upgrade, scheduled for Q1 2025, is anticipated to be a significant milestone for the network. This upgrade will further help Ethereum maintain its leadership in dApps and smart contracts, advancing the broader blockchain industry.Building on the success of the Dencun upgrade, Pectra aims to enhance Ethereum's efficiency and functionality through various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), notably EIP-3074. This proposal introduces features such as grouped transactions, allowing users to sign into a transaction only once regardless of its complexity, thereby improving transaction management and wallet usability. Furthermore, Pectra aims to streamline network operations, reduce transaction costs, and simplify complexities. A notable aspect of EIP-3074 is its \"social recovery\" feature, enabling users to recover access to their crypto wallets without relying on seed phrases.Ethereum has been on a strong bullish trajectory, currently trading around $4,000. Its current momentum suggests it is well-positioned to sustain and potentially continue its upward rally.With the introduction of Bitcoin and ETH ETFs, the floodgates have opened for more crypto exchange-traded products, including the potential for a Solana-based ETF. This surge in Crypto ETFs marks a shift in perception, transitioning crypto from being perceived solely as a speculative asset to becoming a foundational element of investment portfolios.The increased involvement of financial institutions adds further credibility to crypto assets.This broader acceptance is expected to drive mainstream adoption and reflects a maturing regulatory environment, which in turn contributes to legitimizing the entire digital asset space.(The author Sumit Gupta is Co-founder, CoinDCX.

        "content": "Ethereum has been on the verge of surging past the $3.5k resistance level over the last five days\n\nTraders can anticipate a rally towards $3.9k, but chances of a bearish reversal thereafter would solidify\n\nEthereum [ETH], at the time of writing, was trading below the $3.5k-$3.6k resistance zone. Its momentum has stalled over the past week. In fact, a recent report revealed that the taker buy-sell ratio fell below 1 too.\n\nThis indicated a reduction in buying pressure in recent days.\n\nThe daily RSI signaled bullish momentum, but the OBV was closer to the lows of a range from May. This was not a good sign for the bulls.\n\nHence, AMBCrypto investigated whether the on-chain metrics leaned bearishly or bullishly.\n\nRecent positive netflows explain stalled momentum\n\nThe exchange netflow data revealed that over the past week, 57.98k ETH flowed into exchanges. Over the past month, 70.11k ETH flowed in.\n\nThis meant more inflows than outflows, which in turn precipitated potentially greater selling pressure in the altcoin\u2019s market.\n\nAdditionally, the in/out of the money graph revealed that by volume, the $3171-$3276 zone was the strongest demand zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the $3.5k and $3.7k resistance levels might pose as opposition to the market\u2019s bulls.\n\nOn-chain metrics underline Ethereum\u2019s stagnancy\n\nThe 180-day mean dollar invested age (MDIA) metric has been trending higher since April. A prolonged uptrend is not welcome as it indicates reduced network activity and investments getting stagnant.\n\nOn the other hand, the development activity has been robust regardless of ETH\u2019s price trend, which long-term investors would appreciate.\n\nThe daily active addresses and network growth saw a spike on 22 June, but both metrics have receded since. The age-consumed metric has also been quiet over the past week.\n\nOverall, the metrics showed that Ethereum would have a tough time climbing past the $3.6k-$3.7k resistance.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThis point was reinforced by AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the liquidation heatmap. After sweeping the pool of liquidity at $2.8k, Ethereum has rebounded healthily. Two liquidity clusters at $3.7k and $3.9k loomed ahead.\n\nIt could attract prices to them and reverse the trend, just as investors get excited about the potential for Ethereum to break the $4k resistance level."
