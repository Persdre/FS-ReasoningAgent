        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are two important reasons Ethereum could soar higher in 2024.\n\nDespite being up nearly 50% for the year, Ethereum (ETH 1.11%) seems to have fallen out of favor with investors. While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 2.47%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It's still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum's price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum's market dominance at a faster pace, it's safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that's exactly what I'm looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum's success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum's market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, \"If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?\" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn't some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don't forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn't have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it's still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You're getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang."

        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machines: Your Guide to create, create2 and create3 - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Creating contracts on blockchains that work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) involves the use of special instructions called opcodes. Among these instructions:\n\n\u201cCREATE\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE2\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE3\u201d\n\nWhile the first two are actual opcodes, \u201ccreate3\u201d is a useful library that acts similarly. This guide will give you a quick overview of what each one does and why they matter.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate\u201d Opcode\n\nThe create opcode is the most commonly used contract creation opcode. When contracts are deployed from scripts or other development environments, the create opcode is the low-level instruction executed by the EVM to deploy and generate a contract address.\n\nUse-case:\n\nCreating new contracts within a contract dynamically. More cost-effective for deploying multiple contracts. When the address predictability is not a requirement.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate2\u201d Opcode\n\nA fixed prefix, which is always 0xFF . The sender\u2019s address ensures the contract is tied to a specific creator. A chosen salt value adds uniqueness to the contract address. The bytecode contains the code of the new contract to be deployed.\n\n\n\nBy combining these parameters, CREATE2 computes a deterministic address for the new contract, which remains the same even as the blockchain evolves.\n\nUse-case:\n\nEnsuring a deterministic and predictable address for a new contract. Useful in state channels, contract wallets, and off-chain interactions. Offers an added layer of security by checking for existing contracts before deployment.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate3\u201d Opcode\n\nCREATE3 is similar to CREATE2 but without including the contract initCode on the address derivation formula. It can be used to generate deterministic contract addresses that aren\u2019t tied to a specific contract code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE3 is a way to use CREATE and CREATE2 in combination such that bytecode no longer affects the deployment address. CREATE3 is more expensive than CREATE or CREATE2 (Fixed extra cost of ~55k gas).\n\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense pragma solidity ^0.8.0; /** @title A library for deploying contracts EIP-3171 style. @author Agustin Aguilar <[email protected]> */ library Create3 { error ErrorCreatingProxy(); error ErrorCreatingContract(); error TargetAlreadyExists(); /** @notice The bytecode for a contract that proxies the creation of another contract @dev If this code is deployed using CREATE2 it can be used to decouple `creationCode` from the child contract address 0x67363d3d37363d34f03d5260086018f3: 0x00 0x67 0x67XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX PUSH8 bytecode 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x02 0x52 0x52 MSTORE 0x03 0x60 0x6008 PUSH1 08 8 0x04 0x60 0x6018 PUSH1 18 24 8 0x05 0xf3 0xf3 RETURN 0x363d3d37363d34f0: 0x00 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x02 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0 cds 0x03 0x37 0x37 CALLDATACOPY 0x04 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x05 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x06 0x34 0x34 CALLVALUE val 0 cds 0x07 0xf0 0xf0 CREATE addr */ bytes internal constant PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = hex\"67_36_3d_3d_37_36_3d_34_f0_3d_52_60_08_60_18_f3\"; // KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = keccak256(PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE); bytes32 internal constant KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = 0x21c35dbe1b344a2488cf3321d6ce542f8e9f305544ff09e4993a62319a497c1f; /** @notice Returns the size of the code on a given address @param _addr Address that may or may not contain code @return size of the code on the given `_addr` */ function codeSize(address _addr) internal view returns (uint256 size) { assembly { size := extcodesize(_addr) } } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode) internal returns (address addr) { return create3(_salt, _creationCode, 0); } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @param _value In WEI of ETH to be forwarded to child contract @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode, uint256 _value) internal returns (address addr) { // Creation code bytes memory creationCode = PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE; // Get target final address addr = addressOf(_salt); if (codeSize(addr) != 0) revert TargetAlreadyExists(); // Create CREATE2 proxy address proxy; assembly { proxy := create2(0, add(creationCode, 32), mload(creationCode), _salt)} if (proxy == address(0)) revert ErrorCreatingProxy(); // Call proxy with final init code (bool success,) = proxy.call{ value: _value }(_creationCode); if (!success || codeSize(addr) == 0) revert ErrorCreatingContract(); } /** @notice Computes the resulting address of a contract deployed using address(this) and the given `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error @dev The address creation formula is: keccak256(rlp([keccak256(0xff ++ address(this) ++ _salt ++ keccak256(childBytecode))[12:], 0x01])) */ function addressOf(bytes32 _salt) internal view returns (address) { address proxy = address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex'ff', address(this), _salt, KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE ) ) ) ) ); return address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex\"d6_94\", proxy, hex\"01\" ) ) ) ) ); } } contract Child { function hola() external view returns (string memory) { return \"mundo\"; } } contract Deployer { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3(keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), type(Child).creationCode); } } contract Child2 { uint256 meaningOfLife; address owner; constructor(uint256 _meaning, address _owner) { meaningOfLife = _meaning; owner = _owner; } } contract Deployer2 { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3( keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), abi.encodePacked( type(Child).creationCode, abi.encode( 42, msg.sender ) ) ); } }\n\nFeatures:\n\nDeterministic contract address based on msg.sender + salt.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto\u2019s JPEG market is showing signs of life\u2014despite mass layoffs at prominent marketplace OpenSea on Friday\u2014as NFT trading volume grew by $99 million in October compared to the month before, according to a report released by crypto data firm DappRadar.\n\n\u201cThe yearlong downward trend in NFT trading has been broken,\u201d DappRadar wrote, noting that NFT trading volume increased 32% from $306 million in September to $405 million last month. The firm described it as levels of sales not seen since August.\n\nNFTs are unique digital tokens that represent the ownership of an item, often digital art. While the market for NFTs was bubbly in 2021 and early 2022, this year has been tough for many profile picture (PFP) projects so far\u2014as hype for collections like Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) chills amid a prolonged crypto winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, signs of warmth in the broader digital assets industry could be at play. The uptick in NFT trading volume came as the price of Bitcoin bounced above $35,000\u2014touching its highest price in 16 months on anticipation that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the U.S. soon, analysts say.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report highlighted Solana as a notable network in terms of growth. NFT trading volume on the speedy layer-1 grew 15% from $24 million to $27.6 million, DappRadar reported. Meanwhile, the price of Solana itself surged 65% in October, jumping from $23 to around $38, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNFT trading volumes across a breadth of blockchains that support the class of tokens are captured in DappRadar\u2019s report. And across all networks, a 50% jump in NFT trading volume on Ethereum\u2014crypto\u2019s second-largest coin\u2014kept it \u201cleading the pack,\u201d DappRadar said.\n\nAs the flow of JPEGs grew in October, the floor price\u2014or cheapest listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014for some popular PFP projects increased as well. For example, the floor price of NFTs from the aforementioned Bored Ape Yacht Club rose from $40,000 worth of Ethereum to around $55,000.\n\nAn uptick in the price of PFP projects boasting large market capitalizations was recently touched on by Punk9059, director of research at NFT startup Proof. \u201cUptober has arrived,\u201d the pseudonymous researcher said on Twitter last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've had 4 consecutive weeks of rising NFT volume. pic.twitter.com/GnuqmxA5xN \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 3, 2023\n\nWhile DappRadar\u2019s report could provoke WAGMI-like hopes among some NFT traders, $405 million in NFT trading volume throughout October is a paltry sum compared to the $2 billion in JPEGs that traded hands in March. Additionally, NFT sales continued to slump last month.\n\nDespite the rise in trading value, the overall number of NFTs sold in October slid by 5%, from 3.58 million in September to 3.4 million last month, DappRadar reported. Still, the decrease was less severe than when NFT sales fell by 290,000 in August.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Peter Brandt Predicts Ethereum Rally to $1,993 Upon Breakout of Right-Angled Expanding Triangle - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran trader with over 40 years of experience, has set a target of $1,993 for Ethereum (ETH) following the asset\u2019s breakout of a recently formed right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nBrandt made this projection yesterday during his latest analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements. The trader shared a daily ETH chart on X, identifying the formation of a right-angled expanding triangle pattern, which was completed on Oct. 23.\n\nA right-angled expanding triangle, or a right-angled broadening wedge, features an upper trendline and a lower trendline, with both lines expanding apart. The pattern can either signal a potential continuation of the previous trend or a reversal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nData from Brandt\u2019s chart suggests that the beginning of this pattern dates back to Aug. 17. Notably, ETH collapsed 6.76% on the day, dropping to a low of $1,683.5. However, this massive red candlestick formed the base of the right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s swings and lows since Aug. 17, the asset formed the broadening triangle, as it continued to trade within its confines until Oct. 23. Brandt\u2019s analysis emphasizes that ETH completed the formation of the triangle on Oct. 23 amid a 6.17% increase that day.\n\nETH Forms Flag Pattern, Poised to Rally 8.6%\n\nInterestingly, ETH broke above the upper trendline of the triangle, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend that began on Oct. 12. However, after the breakout, Ethereum formed a flag pattern that lasted for nine days, from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1.\n\nBrandt identified this flag pattern in his analysis. According to him, ETH recently completed the flag pattern, which is a further re-confirmation of the right-angled expanding triangle, which the asset completed on Oct. 23.\n\nNotably, flags are typically consolidation patterns that suggest a brief pause in the prevailing trend before a potential resumption of that trend. Since breaking above $1,800, ETH has consolidated between $1,744 and $1,865, but with an upward trajectory.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe asset has now completed the nine-day flag, and a bullish continuation of the uptrend is expected. Brandt\u2019s chart suggests a target of $1,993 for when Ethereum engineers another massive run. ETH would need to appreciate 8.5% from its current price to hit $1,993.\n\nEthereum trades for $1,836 as of press time, per CoinMarketCap data. The asset is up 1.76% over the past 24 hours, with its eyes set on conquering the $1,874 resistance. Impressively, ETH\u2019s trade volume has increased 71.30% to a current value of $11.6 billion, ranking it third in volume."

        "content": "Render price slipped to trade at $2.22 after a nearly 8% decline following the failed breach of $2.55.\n\nThe Render Network successfully completed upgrading its core infrastructure to Solana from Ethereum.\n\nRender Foundation, in accordance with the upgrade, allocated $2.5 million worth of RNDR as a reward to migrate RNDR tokens to the Solana blockchain.\n\nRender price exhibited a reaction opposite to market expectations after the Render Network achieved a milestone, upgrading from Ethereum to Solana. The network, seeing as to how the transition might affect its users, is assisting by granting subsidies using RNDR tokens.\n\nRead more - Breaking: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts, including stealing $8 billion from users\n\nRender moves to Solana from Ethereum\n\nRender Network, which is a blockchain and crypto-enabled protocol that enables individuals to contribute unused GPU power to help projects render motion graphics and visual effects, was launched on Ethereum back in 2017. But after six years, the project is moving from the \"home of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\" to Solana, also known as the \"Ethereum killer\".\n\nThe move was touted to be a \"watershed moment\" for Render and seen as an attempt at capitalizing on the benefits of the Solana blockchain. Jules Urbach, the founder and architect of the Render Network, commenting on the transition, stated,\n\n\"Solana's incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture make it a perfect fit for the Render Network as we continue building a scalable and decentralized metaverse infrastructure.\n\nIn the announcement, Render Network noted that the transition of assets from Ethereum to Solana is being facilitated by Wormhole. Furthermore, to ease the transition for its users, Render also stated that it has allocated up to 1.14 million RNDR worth about $2.5 million at the current price in grants.\n\nThis would be used to subsidize user transfer fees on Ethereum associated with the upgrade for up to three months.\n\nInterestingly, the market reacted much differently than what was expected out of RNDR.\n\nRender price takes a hit\n\nRender price at the time of writing, trading at $2.22, noted a 7.8% decline in the past day despite the historic milestone. The influence of the broader market cues trumped the impact of the network upgrade, resulting in RNDR falling through the support level at $2.26.\n\nThe altcoin is still in the bullish zone, as noted on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), albeit observing a downtick. If the investors' sentiment remains negative, a further downfall can be expected, which might bring RNDR down to $2.08 and RSI to test the neutral line at 50.0 as support.\n\nIf the broader market cues further push the Render price downward, losing the support of $2.08 is possible, sending the token to tag the support line at $1.91. This level is also coinciding with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nRNDR/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Render price bounces above $2.08, it could invalidate the bearish thesis. The confirmation of the same would be achieved when the RSI bounces off the neutral line. This would enable RNDR to reclaim the support at $2.26."

Security and Decentralization: A More Robust Network\n\nThe move to PoS enhances the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Validators, who replace miners in validating transactions, are incentivized to act honestly by staking their own cryptocurrency as collateral. This reduces the risk of attacks, making the network more secure and resistant to manipulation.\n\nA more secure and decentralized network can attract a wider range of applications, including those in sectors where data integrity and trust are paramount, such as healthcare and supply chain management.\n\n4. Staking Opportunities: Passive Income for Cryptocurrency Holders\n\nEthereum 2.0 introduces the concept of staking, where users can lock up their cryptocurrency as collateral to validate transactions and earn rewards. This provides an opportunity for passive income for cryptocurrency holders, potentially making Ethereum more attractive for long-term investors.\n\nThe ease of participation in staking can attract a broader demographic of users and investors, further expanding the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n5. DeFi and NFT Growth: Fueling the Crypto Renaissance\n\nEthereum is already the epicenter of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Ethereum 2.0\u2019s improvements will only enhance these sectors. Faster transaction speeds and lower fees will make DeFi applications more efficient and user-friendly. Moreover, the increased security will boost confidence in DeFi platforms.\n\nFor NFTs, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s scalability will enable artists and creators to mint and trade NFTs with less environmental impact and lower costs, potentially fueling the growth of the digital art and collectibles market.\n\n6. Cross-Chain Compatibility: A More Interconnected Crypto Ecosystem\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s enhancements are not limited to its own blockchain. The introduction of shard chains and the Beacon Chain will facilitate greater interoperability with other blockchains. This cross-chain compatibility could lead to the creation of a more interconnected crypto ecosystem, where assets and data can flow seamlessly between various networks.\n\n7. The Broader Impact: Eth2 Beyond Crypto\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0\u2019s primary focus is on blockchain and cryptocurrency, its impact extends beyond these realms. The emphasis on energy efficiency aligns with global sustainability goals. The security and trust elements are applicable to various industries, from logistics to legal, where blockchain can be a transformative force.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ethereum 2.0: What\u2019s New and What Is The Future Of Ethereum 2.0\n\nHow ethereum 2.0 has changed the world?\n\nEthereum 2.0, often referred to as Eth2 or Serenity, is poised to bring significant changes to the world, not just within the crypto ecosystem but also in broader technological and financial contexts.

        "title": "Tron Surpasses Ethereum In Stablecoin Transactions - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, a rising player is grabbing the spotlight for stablecoin transactions: Tron (TRX). The blockchain, which might not be the largest or the most famous, has been stealthily catching up to, and at times surpassing, the likes of Ethereum in the stablecoin arena, particularly when it comes to USDT transfers.\n\nA revealing insight comes from none other than global search trends. Data from Google Trends highlights a surging interest in Tron\u2019s USDT, matching the traction of Ethereum\u2019s USDT over the last year. This wave of interest in Tron is echoed in a recent paper by the asset management giant Brevan Howard, which dubs the stablecoin market\u2019s growth as \u201crelentless.\u201d Tron\u2019s share of the action? A solid 35% of the volume, 37% of transactions, and an impressive 49% of active stablecoin addresses between January and August 2023.\n\nThe shift is not merely a fluke but a part of a broader trend seeing Ethereum\u2019s grip on stablecoin activity loosen, with blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon picking up the slack.\n\nSo, what\u2019s fueling Tron\u2019s ascent in the stablecoin universe?\n\nEmerging markets are where Tron\u2019s growth is most explosive. Google Trends points to high levels of interest in countries like Iran, Russia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and Australia, whereas Ethereum still holds the fort in the United States. Particularly in Latin America, Tron\u2019s allure seems irresistible. Conversations with sources in Argentina suggest a staggering 95% of stablecoin transactions are carried out on Tron, attributed to the blockchain\u2019s low fees and swift transaction speeds.\n\nIn regions battered by inflation, such as Argentina where rates soared past 120% in 2023, the appeal of affordable and fast stablecoin transactions is undeniable. They\u2019re not just a financial strategy; they\u2019re a lifeline for those trying to shield their assets from the voracious jaws of inflation.\n\nTron\u2019s growth spurt is also backed by tactical moves by the Tron Foundation. Its partnership with Curve Finance in August 2023 to introduce the latter\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) to Tron\u2019s network, and the integration with Google Cloud in early October to pump up on-chain activity, are bold strides toward expansion.\n\nDespite Tron\u2019s upbeat performance in 2023, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The Tron Foundation and its founder, Justin Sun, have navigated choppy waters within the crypto community. Sun, a polarizing figure, has been in the crosshairs of an SEC lawsuit over allegations of selling unregistered securities in March 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Tron\u2019s strategic positioning in the stablecoin market is a narrative of tactical growth and market adaptation. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies continue to evolve, Tron\u2019s journey offers a captivating glimpse into the forces shaping the future of digital finance. It stands as a testament that in the crypto arena, being the biggest doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being the most utilized, and that a focus on practical benefits like cost and speed can pay dividends."

Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways on lower-than-average volume, while rejecting the important $36,000 mark on each attempt. The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock\u2019s or crypto\u2019s RSI is above 70%, it\u2019s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin\u2019s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin \u2014 But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "A trader who accurately predicted the crypto bottom in November of 2022 is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 54,100 YouTube subscribers that he foresees Bitcoin getting a \u201cmassive pump\u201d that will siphon funds from altcoins and into BTC.\n\nDonAlt says that Bitcoin could afterward consolidate, a move that would positively impact altcoins.\n\n\u201cAnd then you might see another [Bitcoin] consolidation like this [BTC ranging roughly between $33,400 and $35,200], another rotation into altcoins where people chase the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and then maybe we get a little bit of nice altcoin action.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $35,223 at time of writing, after hitting a new 2023 high of just under $36,000 earlier in the day.\n\nOn the likely next course of action for Ethereum (ETH) over the short term, the trader says,\n\n\u201cETH\u2026 my view on it is I think there\u2019s a good chance it bounces in general like altcoin sentiment seems to be up, like people are kind of euphoric right now on the altcoin front, even though like they\u2019re only bouncing a tiny percentage of what they lost before. So as long as that maintains you could see a little bit of a bounce.\u201d\n\nETH is trading at $1,831 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), DonAlt says a buying opportunity could arise if and when the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap starts consolidating after the recent rally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real good pullback level to buy [Solana]. I think if it goes back to $30, that is scary. It\u2019s a pullback level but it\u2019s scarily close to where it\u2019s actually just full-blown invalidated. And it starts looking really shitty.\n\nOn this one, if this consolidates maybe you just buy the consolidation, like that\u2019s a pullback of sorts that I could see.\n\nOtherwise, if Bitcoin tops [out], this probably goes down. If Bitcoin rips, this probably just keeps on going.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $43.21 at time of writing, up by more than 30% over the past week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Why everyone is talking about Solana in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Solana surges in 2023, joining top blockchains with its unique tech, large user base, and promising price forecasts, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nAs of 2023, Solana (SOL) has earned its place among the top 3 layer-1 blockchains, sharing the spotlight with giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Chain (BNB).\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly intriguing is that while Solana\u2019s market capitalization sits at about 7.5% of Ethereum\u2019s at nearly $16.5 billion, its daily active user base stands at 66% of Ethereum\u2019s, signaling an engaged and growing community.\n\nOver the last 30 days, SOL\u2019s price experienced a remarkable increase of nearly 90%, with a substantial 30% growth occurring in just the previous week. This aligns with the debut of Firedancer, its highly awaited scaling solution, on the testnet.\n\nMoreover, this year has been kind to Solana, showcasing a marked improvement in metrics such as uptime and transactions per second. Coinbase, a prominent US crypto exchange, acknowledges Solana as a formidable contender to Ethereum in the layer-1 blockchain space.\n\nLet\u2019s uncover the elements fueling Solana\u2019s growth, understand what it is, dissect its technological advancements, and take a closer look at its expanding community and ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Solana, and how does it work?\n\nSolana, often abbreviated as SOL, is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects at large scales.\n\nFor instance, a real-world application on Solana might be a decentralized exchange (DEX) where thousands of trades happen every second. The architecture of Solana facilitates the processing of these trades, aiming for efficiency, security, and accuracy.\n\nSolana introduces a mechanism known as proof of history (PoH), setting it apart from some traditional consensus methods. PoH is designed to generate a historical record to verify the occurrence of an event at a specific time.\n\nThis is achieved by encoding the passage of time in the data before it becomes a part of the ledger. The intention is to streamline the consensus-reaching process across nodes, as they have a shared, trusted notion of time.\n\nThis emphasis on time-saving is further realized in Solana\u2019s Tower BFT, a byzantine fault-tolerant derivative of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus.\n\nTower BFT utilizes the synchronized clock provided by PoH to reduce messaging overhead and latency. This allows for faster confirmations of transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana also features the Gulf Stream protocol, which attempts to optimize transaction handling by pre-processing and sending them to validators prior to the completion of the previous transaction set. This approach is intended to reduce confirmation times and improve network efficiency.\n\nWhen considering all these mechanisms together, Solana aims to support a high volume of transactions per second, positioning itself as a competitive entity in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana\u2019s tokenomics: understanding SOL\u2019s role and distribution\n\nSolana\u2019s financial structure is centered around its native token, SOL. This token has multiple functions within the network. The primary use of SOL is for transactions and for users to interact with dApps on the Solana platform.\n\nSimply put, if a user wants to carry out an operation or use a dApp on Solana, they need SOL.\n\nYou might also like: Solana close to 1-year high amid declining open interest\n\nStaking is another important function of SOL. Users can help secure the network by staking their SOL tokens. They can do this by either becoming validators themselves or by assigning their tokens to existing validators.\n\nThose who stake their tokens are rewarded, and the annual percentage yield (APY) for this is typically between 7-8%. However, it\u2019s important to mention that this rate can change based on several factors.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the network\u2019s security. They receive new SOL tokens as rewards, as well as a share of transaction fees. This approach encourages active participation in the network and aims to ensure its stability.\n\nRegarding the distribution of SOL, recent data shows that out of a total supply of 561 million tokens, about 420 million are in circulation. This implies that approximately 141 million SOL tokens have been burned over time.\n\nSolana use cases\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology has nurtured a variety of use cases due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Here are some notable use cases:\n\nDecentralized finance (defi)\n\nSolana\u2019s high throughput and low transaction fees make it a fertile ground for defi applications like DEXs, lending protocols, and digital wallets. Examples include Solana-based DEXs like Orca and Serum, and lending platforms like Apricot Finance and Solend\u200b.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nSolana facilitates the creation of NFT platforms and marketplaces where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Notable platforms include Metaplex and Solanart, which allow users to interact with digital artwork and other unique assets\u200b.\n\nGaming\n\nSolana hosts games with play-to-earn (P2E) systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs through gameplay. Examples include online metaverses like Chainers and Aurory, and survival-puzzle games like Naga Kingdom\u200b.\n\nWeb3 applications\n\nSolana supports the development of web3 apps that leverage modern internet technologies. Examples include Audius, a decentralized audio streaming app, Squads, a treasury fund management application, and Alchemy, a platform for building dApps quickly\u200b.\n\nCross-chain functionality\n\nSolana has also been leveraged for cross-chain transactions, as seen with the integration of USDC-SPL in Trust Wallet, enabling users to send and receive USDC with minimal fees and swift transaction times.\n\nSolana\u2019s hurdles in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Solana navigated a rough path marked by several network outages, casting a shadow on its robustness.\n\nThe most notable was a slowdown in block production on Feb. 25, following an upgrade attempt from validator software version 1.13 to 1.14, which led to considerable disruptions. Efforts to revert to version 1.13 were insufficient, ultimately necessitating a network restart.\n\nThe Solana network is currently restarting after an issue during the upgrade from 1.13 to 1.14 that slowed block finalization\n\n\n\nOnce validators with 80% of stake have restarted the network will resume\n\n\n\nYou can track the progress of the restart here:https://t.co/HclrUqWQ2y \u2014 Solana \ud83e\udded Compass \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc83 (@SolanaCompass) February 25, 2023\n\nThe February incident wasn\u2019t singular; Solana contended with multiple outages in the past, spotlighting stability as a critical area for improvement. These technical difficulties attracted criticism from the broader blockchain community and competitors, stirring a debate about Solana\u2019s reliability as a Layer 1 solution.\n\nComplicating matters, the root causes of certain outages remained elusive, even to Solana\u2019s developers, leaving some issues unresolved over extended periods. This ambiguity and the recurring downtimes prompted concerns regarding Solana\u2019s reliability, particularly given the fierce competition in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana long-term trend and price prediction\n\nThe Solana price has attracted attention recently, with many keeping a close eye on insights into its potential trajectory amid bullish market sentiment.\n\nAccording to DigitalCoinPrice, the Solana crypto price is set to reach around $83.44 by the end of 2023. The Solana price prediction for 2024 is approximately $94.60. By 2025, it\u2019s anticipated to climb to $141.53 and $389.83 by 2030.\n\nDespite the potential shown by Solana in various domains, it\u2019s essential to consider the rocky patches it navigated through in 2023, which have led some crypto analysts to project a lower price trajectory for SOL.\n\nReflecting on the slowdown in block production and recurring outages this year, some analysts have exercised caution in their forecasts, predicting an average SOL rate of around $23.89 in January 2024, which could potentially dip to a minimum of $23.34, with a maximum cap at $24.43.\n\nYou might also like: Solana gaining momentum according to Nansen report\n\nYet, those interested in the Solana crypto price should be wary of banking solely on forecasts. The volatile nature of the crypto market, combined with ever-evolving Solana news, suggests that price predictions shouldn\u2019t be the sole basis for investment decisions.\n\nInvestors must exercise caution and adhere to the cardinal rule of investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. It\u2019s advisable to conduct thorough research, understand the inherent risks, and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before making any investment decisions."

The Coinomi wallet supports both main types of Tether.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e (What We Don\u2019t Like)\n\nCoinomi doesn\u2019t support fiat currency, and it\u2019s not possible to exchange cryptos with each other or with fiat in the wallet. While it\u2019s suitable for storing various altcoins, Coinomi is a very limited solution when it comes to actually spending crypto.

It\u2019s hosted on the Omni blockchain, one of the blockchains established to support USDT. Users control their own keys, appealing to crypto die-hards but potentially alienating users seeking custodial support.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e (What We Don\u2019t Like)\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that OmniWallet is specialized in handling Omni Layer tokens and may have limited support for other cryptocurrencies. Users utilizing this wallet should be aware that a small amount of Bitcoin is required in the wallet to cover transaction fees since Omni Layer transactions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHow to Choose a Tether Wallet?\n\nBefore choosing the best USDT wallet, it is worth noting that Tether (USDT) is available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ERC-20), Tron (TRC-20), and others.\n\nDifferent crypto wallets are compatible with specific blockchains, and some may exclusively support a single type of Tether (USDT). Therefore, it\u2019s essential to choose a Tether wallet that aligns with your specific requirements. Certain crypto wallets are well-suited for multi-use scenarios, supporting multiple cryptocurrencies on diverse blockchain networks.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the type of USDT wallet you prefer, such as a software wallet or hardware Tether wallet. Investors will need to choose from a non-custodial or custodial Tether wallet.\n\nSoftware wallet companies offer options like mobile apps and desktop software, while hardware wallets are tangible devices. Each type of Tether wallet comes with its unique set of advantages and disadvantages, which we delve into further in the upcoming section.\n\nSecurity is a paramount concern when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets. It\u2019s crucial to choose a reputable wallet provider, enable two-factor authentication, and safeguard your private keys or recovery phrases.\n\nBest Cold Wallet for Crypto\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most secure Tether wallet available, a cold wallet might be the right choice for you. A \u201ccold\u201d or hardware wallet is a physical device which holds your keys. As a result, it is much more difficult for anyone to access your wallet remotely. They give you an added layer of protection from malware or phishing attacks.\n\nTo use a hardware wallet, you\u2019ll need to plug it into a computer or supported device. You can unlock your wallet and access your keys with a PIN and a recovery seed phrase. A seed phrase is a list of words you\u2019ll use to re-generate your keys. Then you can create a transaction and confirm it on your wallet\u2019s display.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of cold Tether wallets for you to choose from. The best cold wallet will be the one that suits your needs and budget. Cold wallets are the most expensive option, however, they offer the highest level of protection.\n\nSome traders will store the bulk of their funds in a hardware wallet and then use an insured software wallet like CryptoWallet.com for day-to-day trading online.\n\nLedger lets you store over 1,1000 different cryptocurrencies including Tether. They have three wallet options available, we have reviewed the Ledger Nano X and feel it offers great security. It supports USDT-Omni, USDT-ERC20 and USDT-TRC20 (Tether on the Tron Network), so it\u2019s a great option for storing any Tether tokens you have.\n\nBest Free Wallet For Cryptocurrency\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing a crypto wallet and one important thing to consider is the price. Hardware wallets can cost over $100 which can be a hefty initial investment. Many crypto traders prefer to use a secure free wallet.\n\nFree software wallets are by far the most convenient option. They can be set up in minutes and integrated with your mobile phone or browser. They usually don\u2019t require KYC to trade solely in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, free software wallets are often more susceptible to hacking or malware. Being constantly online means that your funds could be at higher risk in an online wallet. Here at CryptoWallet.com, we don\u2019t believe you should have to choose between security and cost.\n\nCryptoWallet.com supports the five highest-cap currencies including Tether in our free cryptocurrency wallet.

Castelluzzo sold cocaine and \u2018designer drugs\u2019 for bitcoin between 2010 and 2015 and mailed the sold product to his customers.\n\nHe made a further 30,000 Ethereum Classic in 2016 and continued to invest in different cryptocurrencies. However, the operation was eventually discovered and he was arrested, charged, and pled guilty in May of that year.\n\nCastelluzzo was sentenced to 21 years in 2018.

On his X (formerly Twitter) account, Tate promoted his cryptocurrency university, which aims to teach students how to make money in the crypto space. His latest stance marks a significant departure from a statement he made back in April.\n\nEveryone on my team made money on $BTC It was as easy as listening to the professionals who have worked every day for YEARS to make sure they get it right. You could have won too You could win on future dumps and future pumps But you won\u2019t do it alone. https://t.co/BoAS3LFM8V pic.twitter.com/8V06ye4D5e \u2014 Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) October 26, 2023\n\nIn April, Tate criticized the crypto space and crypto influencers, saying that \u201cthe easy money isn\u2019t in crypto anymore.\u201d However, his university now aims to teach crypto enthusiasts how to accurately predict crypto pumps, stating that \u201cin Hustler\u2019s University, we actually tell you when to buy and when to sell crypto.\u201d\n\nAndrew Tate has remained a polarizing figure for his views, both within and outside the crypto space. Specifically, he has been criticized by many for his indirect promotion of meme coins and rugpulls.\n\nHow does Andrew Tate\u2019s endorsement affect the futures of Ethereum (ETH) and VC Spectra (SPCT)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWhat does Andrew Tate\u2019s endorsement of Crypto mean for Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nBeing a top ten cryptocurrency, many believe that only the endorsements of institutions, leading businessmen, or industry experts could drive a surge in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price. Accordingly, Ethereum (ETH) dropped from $1,804.04 on October 26 to $1,795.55 on October 29, a nominal 0.47% decrease in price.\n\nWhen asked how high Ethereum can go, the ETH price prediction from bulls is very optimistic. According to these experts, with the SEC likely to approve the Bitcoin ETF applications before it, the Ethereum (ETH) price could reach $2,500.00 by 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, bearish analysts\u2019 ETH price prediction for Q4 remains pessimistic. This ETH price prediction is based on Ethereum technical analysis backed by indicators such as the Cumulative Delta and RSI. Based on their analysis, they think Ethereum (ETH) could decline further to $1,350.00 by the end of Q4 2023.\n\nVC Spectra: The expert-vetted top ICO of 2023\n\nGiven that Andrew Tate has become a crypto crusader, he will be well-poised to further explore the dynamic cryptocurrency space. One of the top DeFi projects he might consider is VC Spectra (SPCT), a groundbreaking decentralized hedge fund and trading platform.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund at the forefront of the blockchain and fintech revolution, positioning it as a leading blockchain ICO within the burgeoning DeFi landscape. It offers investors access to new ICOs and exclusive voting privileges.\n\nAt the heart of VC Spectra\u2019s governance is SPCT, a deflationary Bitcoin BRC-20 token, which features a burn mechanism that could drive future increases in SPCT value. Currently, in Stage 4 of its public presale, SPCT is priced at $0.055, providing early investors with an impressive ROI of 587.5%. This rapid ascent in SPCT\u2019s value is primarily due to mounting interest from institutional investors.\n\nMarket experts have stated that VC Spectra\u2019s token, SPCT, is poised to surpass its end-of-presale price target of $0.080. Moreover, VC Spectra offers a momentous bonus on all deposits, further solidifying SPCT\u2019s status as one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Photo: File\n\nIn today's cryptocurrency market, optimism abounds, with a sea of green dominating on Thursday, November 2.\n\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, which could either fuel the ongoing crypto rally or potentially dampen market sentiment.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's recent announcement was met with applause from the market.\n\nDuring Wednesday's FOMC meeting, the central bank decided unanimously to maintain its benchmark interest rates at their current levels, keeping the key federal funds rate within the 5.25%-5.5% target range, where it has remained since July.\n\nNotably, this decision followed a series of 11 rate hikes, including four in 2023.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts have much to celebrate as Bitcoin's price experienced a 2.77% increase, reaching $35,363.40, and its trading volume surged by 60.64% to $25.03 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe market cap also received a boost of 2.80%, reaching $690.77 billion. Over the past week, Bitcoin's price has appreciated by over 2%.\n\nEthereum's price didn't lag behind, with a 2.29% increase, now trading at $1,846.22, accompanied by a 66.85% rise in one-day volume, reaching $11.38 billion.\n\nSimultaneously, XRP's price also saw a 3.24% rise, landing at $0.606, while its 24-hour volume decreased by 14.42% to $1.87 billion.\n\nAmong other prominent cryptocurrencies, Solana's price surged by 9.94% to $41.82, while Cardano's price witnessed a 6.42% jump, with trading volumes rising by 151.41% and 13.46% to $3.74 billion and $357.96 million, respectively.\n\nEven meme coins joined in on the optimism, with Dogecoin's price increasing by 2.62% to $0.06889, although with a 0.23% decrease in trading volume to $483.85 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu's price surged by 3.53% to $0.000007959, with trading volume up 5.58% from the previous day, reaching $169.30 million.\n\nThese gains across major cryptocurrencies contributed to a notable upswing in the overall crypto market.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap rose by 2.85% from the previous day, reaching $1.31 trillion, with a market fear and greed index reading of 74, indicating a \"greed\" sentiment.\n\nThe total market cap increased by 43.49% in the last 24 hours, now standing at $57.9 billion.\n\nThe crypto market's surge underscores the growing interest in digital assets, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming stance, set to have a significant impact on the market's future trajectory."

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is expected to reach new all-time highs in Q2 2024, following the next Bitcoin halving event\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets\n\nETH rose +2133% after the previous BTC halving to reach its all-time high of $4864, Sporia on TradingView expects a similar level of upside this time around\n\nHere\u2019s how high AI predicts Ethereum price will go after next halving\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently valued at $1788 after dropping -2.67% in the past 24 hours. This follows a period of upside in which ETH climbed +23.22% over the course of a 3-week period at the end of October.\n\nThe recent surge from ETH means that it has now reclaimed the 50% level on its July-October range in a single bullish move. So far, ETH has held up well at the range\u2019s midway point and early forecasts are suggesting that the positive price action could continue over the coming months.\n\nThe ETH price prediction algorithm has forecasted a +253% move by Q2 2024. This would place ETH at $6,339 \u2014 a new all-time high for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The main catalyst for the projected move is the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, where the total mining rewards in each BTC block are cut in half.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving and when is it due to happen?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event occurs every 210,000 blocks, which works out to approximately every four years. The process of reducing the blockchain\u2019s total mining rewards by half provides a greater level of deflationary pressure \u2014 after each halving event, the current circulating supply for BTC becomes increasingly scarce.\n\nWhen each block miner was awarded 12.5 BTC, the circulating supply increased by 1,800 BTC each day. After the 2020 halving event, each block miner was then awarded with 6.25 BTC, which meant that there were just 900 BTC being created each day. As a result, the proportion of the circulating supply that is newly mined is continually reduced, making those that are already in circulation more scarce, and in theory, more valuable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets. BTC formed new all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021 \u2014 approximately one year after a halving event took place. Right now, the next Bitcoin halving event is expected to occur on 15th April 2024.\n\nHow high could ETH go after the next halving event?\n\nETH shot up +2133% in total after the previous BTC halving. The move cemented Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, taking the ecosystem\u2019s native token from $217 to $4,864 in a period of 18 months.\n\nA trader who goes by the username Sporia on TradingView shared a long-term projection for the price of ETH. The chart highlights two parallel channels in which ETH has been trading since the 2018 alt season, including a strong support line that has been held throughout the bear market of 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe reversal indicator signal has fired off just 4 times in ETH\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. Image source: TradingView (@Sporia)\n\nSporia expects that ETH will continue to hold this market structure over the next 5 years. The upper resistance line provides the ETH price target during the next two bull stages of Bitcoin\u2019s 4-year cycles, including a $16,090 price target in 2025. In total, this would be a +799% price increase from the current level.\n\nBottom line: AI sets bullish near-term target for ETH and long-term outlook remains positive\n\nETH has been a relative straggler during recent bullish moves in the crypto markets, climbing +60% while the total crypto market cap climbed +80% over the past year. The relative underperformance of ETH during this time frame has increased Bitcoin dominance to more than 50%, which in itself is a metric that has historically heralded a fresh period of upside for the entire crypto market.\n\nThe slight underperformance from ETH in recent times should not be a cause for concern. The network was upgraded during the bear market as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism changed from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during The Merge, which helped make the blockchain more energy efficient.\n\nETH also benefits from new ETFs and a degree of regulatory clarity from the SEC. On top of that, Ethereum\u2019s various layer-2s have been making major progress in isolation and each one provides an increasing level of buy pressure for the native ETH token.\n\nTo summarize, there are plenty of bullish catalysts for ETH, and it seems only a matter of time before the digital asset starts gaining momentum. As things stand, the ETH price prediction algorithm expects a +253% move in the next 7 months, which would take ETH to a new all-time high just 2 months after the next BTC halving event."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Investing The Dawn of the Next Crypto Bull Run: When and Why? InvestingJournal The Dawn of the Next Crypto Bull Run: When and Why? Torsten Hartmann\n\nThe cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, is a realm of digital assets that has seen periods of exponential growth, often referred to as \u2018bull runs\u2019.\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a potential surge, it\u2019s crucial to understand the factors that could trigger this event, the key players that might lead the charge, and the strategies to navigate this dynamic market.\n\nQuick summary: crypto bull run prediction Topic Description \ud83d\udcca Driving Factors Several factors could potentially drive the next crypto bull run: demand and supply, market news sentiment, institutional adoption, economic and political factors, and scarcity of alternative investment. \ud83c\udf10 Ethereum\u2019s Role and Layer 2 Solutions Ethereum is a major player in the crypto market and is preparing for significant changes, including layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs. \ud83d\udd2e Looking to the Future The upcoming development of zkevm in the Ethereum ecosystem could further improve scalability, making Ethereum an even more attractive platform for developers and users. \u23f0 Challenge of Timing the Crypto Market Timing the cryptocurrency market can be challenging, but traders and investors use strategies like technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and market economy analysis to time the market more effectively. \u2744\ufe0f Crypto Winter and Anticipation of a New Bull Run The recent crypto winter saw a significant drop in cryptocurrency prices, but there are signs of recovery with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices recently surging. \ud83d\udcc5 What Year is the Next Bull Run in Crypto Historical price trends and market cycles suggest that the next crypto bull market may commence in the first half of 2024, following the subsequent Bitcoin halving, and reach its zenith in 2025.\n\nThe Driving Factors\n\nSeveral factors could potentially drive the next crypto bull run:\n\nDemand and Supply: The interest of investors and traders can influence the demand for crypto assets, leading to an increase or decrease in prices. Market News Sentiment: Partnerships, optimistic bulletins, new projects, or technology roll-outs that draw investors\u2019 interest will usually increase the asset\u2019s price. Institutional Adoption: This signifies the utility of cryptocurrency, which could cause a ripple effect on retail users to hop on mainstream adoption. Economic and Political Factors: Economy development and political stability help advance cryptocurrency adoption and increase financial inclusion. Scarcity of Alternative Investment: Slow-moving or low-return assets are less popular during uncertainty, resulting in a surge for higher-volatility, high-return assets like crypto. As the demand increases, the price of crypto will naturally increase too. Inflation and Interest Rate: Higher interest rates typically mean it is easier for an investor with spare cash to invest in speculative and riskier assets like a high-liquidity cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role and the Impact of Layer 2 Solutions\n\nEthereum, a major player in the crypto market, is gearing up for significant changes. Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, has emphasized the need to solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues before the next bull run. He warns that if these issues are not addressed, a spike in on-chain activity could result in Ethereum users being hit with sky-high transaction fees.\n\nTo address these scaling issues, Ethereum and its community have been developing and implementing Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism. These solutions are designed to increase the blockchain\u2019s capacity, thereby improving the scalability of Ethereum and reducing transaction costs. This improvement in scalability and reduction in costs could lead to increased adoption of Ethereum, potentially driving the next bull run.\n\nLooking to the future, zkEVM is an upcoming development in the Ethereum ecosystem. This technology could further improve the scalability of Ethereum, making it an even more attractive platform for developers and users.\n\nThe majority of crypto development and innovations happen on Ethereum, and these improvements in scalability could lead to even more development and innovation on the platform. This could create a positive feedback loop, with increased development and innovation leading to increased adoption, which in turn could drive the next bull run.\n\nThe Challenge of Timing the Crypto Market\n\nTiming the cryptocurrency market can be challenging as prices fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably. However, there are several strategies that traders and investors deploy to time the market more effectively. These include technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and market economy analysis. While these strategies can provide some insights, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no 100% accuracy for market prediction.\n\nRead also:\n\nThe Crypto Winter and the Anticipation of a New Bull Run\n\nThe recent crypto winter, which saw a significant drop in cryptocurrency prices, has led to speculation about the start of a new bull run. However, predictions vary, with some experts suggesting that the crypto winter may extend into 2023 or even 2026. Despite this, there are signs of recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices recently surging in Q3 and Q4 of 2023.\n\nWhat year is the next bull run in crypto?\n\nForecasting the precise moment of the upcoming cryptocurrency bull market is a complex task due to the market\u2019s inherent volatility. Nevertheless, historical price trends and market cycles suggest that the next crypto bull market may commence in the first half of 2024, following the subsequent Bitcoin halving, and reach its zenith in 2025, as per coincheckup.com.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event, which transpires approximately every four years, slashes the block reward for miners by 50%. Historically, this event has resulted in a heightened scarcity of Bitcoin, potentially driving up prices as demand surpasses supply, according to coincheckup.com.\n\nAdditional factors that could precipitate a new crypto bull market include:\n\nMarket sentiment and hype: Positive news, endorsements from prominent figures, and increased media exposure can generate a hype cycle, thereby instigating a bull market, as noted by coincheckup.com. Adoption and acceptance: The widespread embrace of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions, businesses, and governments can set off a bullish trend, as highlighted by coincheckup.com. Technological advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can pique investor interest, as stated by coincheckup.com.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market is subject to a myriad of influences, and accurately predicting the onset of the next bull market is virtually impossible. Consequently, it is vital to diligently monitor market trends and indicators, and base investment decisions on these insights.\n\nFor those gearing up for the next crypto bull market, a long-term investment strategy is recommended, coupled with a diversified investment portfolio and thorough fundamental analysis to gauge the growth potential of cryptocurrencies, as advised by coincheckup.com.\n\nIt is important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor prior to making investment decisions.\n\nWhile the timing of the next crypto bull market remains uncertain, with varying opinions among experts, some posit that the bull market has already commenced in 2023. Others forecast that the next Bitcoin bull run will kick off post the Bitcoin halving in 2024, reaching its peak in late 2025. Some traders even speculate that the bull run could materialize as early as 2024. Regardless of the differing viewpoints, it is imperative to recognize the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility and unpredictability. Hence, investors should always conduct their own research and make informed decisions that align with their risk tolerance and investment objectives.\n\nStrategies for the Next Bull Run\n\nIdentify Underrated Projects: One approach to anticipating the next bull run is to identify underrated projects that have the potential to gain significant traction. This strategy implies that the next bull run may occur when enthusiasm for the overall market is at a low point, creating opportunities for undervalued projects to shine. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of focusing solely on meme coins and gambling for quick gains, investors should consider targeting projects with strong fundamentals. By analyzing the underlying technology, use cases, and potential growth prospects, individuals can identify cryptocurrencies that have a higher likelihood of achieving substantial returns. NFTs and the Growth Sector: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may play a significant role in the next bull run, potentially emerging as the largest growth sector. NFTs have gained considerable attention and adoption in recent years, attracting both artists and investors. If the trend continues, the growing interest in NFTs could contribute to the overall market momentum and trigger the next significant upswing in the crypto market. On-Chain Trading and Edge Development: On-chain trading allows individuals to gain insights from blockchain data, enabling a deeper understanding of market dynamics. Although new traders may initially experience losses, gaining experience and knowledge can prove highly rewarding when new money flows into the market during the next bullish phase. Web2 to Web3 Transition: The integration of blockchain technology into traditional internet applications could attract a wider user base, generating increased interest and investment in the crypto market. Therefore, the emergence of innovative Web3 applications might serve as a catalyst for the next market upswing.\n\nIn conclusion, the anticipation for the next crypto bull run is high, with various factors expected to drive this surge. However, it\u2019s important for investors to do their own research and understand the risks involved in the volatile crypto market. The dawn of the next crypto bull run could be just around the corner, and those who are prepared stand to reap the most benefits."
