        "title": "Top Ethereum Contributor Makes Epic U-Turn With Unexpected Gas Fee Statement - U.Today",
        "content": "Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, recently made a surprising statement about transaction fees on the ETH network. Adams, who leads the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, declared that users should never have to worry about \"gas fees.\" This unexpected opinion has added a new dimension to the ongoing debate about Ethereum's high transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdams' statement comes amid a heated discussion about the expenses associated with Ethereum transactions. Recently, artist Iggy Azalea commented on the issue, questioning how gas fees are used and expressing skepticism about their impact. Although Azalea incorrectly assumed that all fees directly benefit Ethereum's founders, her comments have once again highlighted the issue of high transaction costs.\n\nNo user should ever have to hear the term \u201cgas fee\u201d Advertisement June 8, 2024\n\nThe debate over Ethereum's gas fees has become more intense with the rise of Solana, a blockchain known for its lower transaction costs. Solana's recent performance has led some to speculate about the blockchain's future and its ability to compete with more affordable alternatives.\n\nKey Ethereum developers, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have been addressing the gas fee problem for some time. Last month, Buterin introduced EIP-7706, a proposal aimed at optimizing transaction calldata and reducing gas usage. This proposal includes a new type of gas specifically for calldata transactions, with the goal of creating a separate fee market and making calldata more affordable.\n\nAmid Adams' words, Uniswap has continued to succeed, earning over $3.64 billion in total commissions to date. In the past 24 hours alone, Uniswap collected $1.62 million in fees, and over the last month, it amassed $65.95 million."

        "content": "Ethereum Price: Over the past two weeks, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum witnessed shrunk volatility carrying a consolidation trend above $3600. The daily chart projecting short body candles and rejection on both sides indicates a lack of direction among market participants. Will the BTC price drop below $70000 push a prolonged correction in the altcoin market?\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Prices Today June 8: Bitcoin & ETH Take Bearish Turn, Wormhole & INJ Pump\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Defend Key Support Amid Broader Uncertainty\n\nDuring mid-May, the Ethereum price rebounded sharply from the $2860 support indicating the investor continued to accumulate this asset at market dips. The renewed buying force uplifted the ETH value by 39% to reach a 10-week high of $3975.\n\nHowever, with broader market uncertainty the recovery momentum in Ether stalled resulting in a sideways action above $3630. This support coinciding closely with the 20-day EMA slope and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level creates a high area of interest for buyers.\n\nThe notable rejection of candle tails at this support indicates the buyers are defending this support. For risk-averse traders, a breakout above the overhead resistance of $4090 will give a better confirmation of a prolonged rally.\n\nWith sustained buying, the Ethereum price prediction hints at a rally to challenge the ATH (All-time-high) resistance of $4880.\n\nOn a contrary note, a breakdown below $3630 will accelerate the selling pressure and may extend the current correction for a week or month.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Selloff: Here\u2019s Why Bitcoin, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE Prices Slips Today\n\nHistorical Trends Show June\u2019s Mixed Fortunes for Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s price performance in June has shown significant volatility over the past years, with both notable gains and sharp declines. The largest drop occurred in 2022 with a steep decline of -44.79%, while the highest gain was in 2017 at +26.19%.\n\nOn average, June tends to yield negative returns, with an average of -6.76% and a median of -2.53%. This negative bias suggests that June is often a challenging month for Ethereum. However, the data also hints at the potential for sharp reversals, as seen in the positive return of +8.86% in 2019 following a significant drop of -21.34% in 2018.\n\nThese variations are likely influenced by broader market conditions, including macroeconomic factors and regulatory news. Given this historical performance, investors might approach June with caution.\n\nHowever, with steady development for the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs, the market is better leaning in buyers\u2019 favor.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The Ethereum price trading above the daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the path to least resistance is upward.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The downtick in ADX slope at 33% indicates the current consolidation could assist buyers in recuperating exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Why Ethereum Layer-2 Network Taiko Is Spending $100K Daily on Blobs - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn Ethereum layer-2 network named Taiko is dominating the market for so-called blobs, or dedicated data storage for Ethereum scalers\u2014but those endeavors are resulting in tens of thousands of dollars worth of costs for the little-known scaling solution each and every day, even topping the $100,000 mark multiple times this week.\n\nThe Taiko protocol, which went live in late May, seeks to offer users cheaper and faster transactions than on Ethereum's mainnet, while borrowing elements of the network's security. Since going live, Taiko has spent a whopping $900,000 on blobs in less than two weeks to funnel users\u2019 transactions over to Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiko\u2019s competitors, such as the Optimism network, rarely spend more than $1,000 per day on Blob-related fees. Introduced in March as part of an Ethereum upgrade, blobs were billed as a new resource for layer-2 scaling networks to post Ethereum transactions more cheaply.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s maker Taiko Labs announced in March that it had raised $15 million in a Series A funding round. Leveraging \u201czero-knowledge\u201d cryptography in its design, Taiko is striving to differentiate its scaling design in an increasingly competitive field that includes dozens of different scaling networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTaiko just launched its mainnet, and there\u2019s a lot to be figured out before it becomes stable,\u201d Taiko Labs CEO Daniel Wang told Decrypt in a written statement. \u201cWe knew that we will use more blobs than other layer-2s. This is a design decision, not a bug.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 networks often work by bundling batches of transactions together and processing them on a separate chain before posting receipts back to Ethereum. However, Taiko\u2019s design differs from that formula, where lots of transactions are rolled up into batches elsewhere.\n\nInstead, the process of ordering transactions, known as sequencing, takes place on Ethereum itself. In a blog post, Taiko Labs said this process, dubbed \u201cbase sequencing,\u201d is more decentralized than that of other layer-2s that rely on centralized sequencers\u2014which are controlled by a network\u2019s development team and collect a small portion of users\u2019 fees.\n\n\u201cThat sounds expensive,\u201d Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of Bitcoin layer-2 network BOB, told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIt makes it more secure, but not as secure as [Ethereum], and you\u2019re also much more expensive than most layer-2s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA game of tradeoffs\n\nStill, Wang stated that the costs associated with Taiko\u2019s functionality could easily reach the point of break-even if \u201cTaiko is fully utilized by users,\u201d providing a sustainable amount of gas fees.\n\nWang added that Taiko is fully aware of the pros and cons associated with its sequencing method, and he hopes that Ethereum researchers will study Taiko\u2019s on-chain data to explore improvements that could allow Ethereum to better support similar scaling networks.\n\nSome Ethereum researchers, including Justin Drake, believe that Taiko\u2019s team is trailblazing a new form of decentralized sequencing that could solve key hurdles in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt is making a leap forward in the decentralization, credible neutrality, and composability of rollups,\u201d he told Decrypt in a written statement.\n\nIf more layer-2 networks shifted the sequencing of their transactions to Ethereum itself, then fragmentation issues holding the entire space back could be solved, he stated. As of now, liquidity and assets are largely spread out across different layer-2s, effectively siloing users and applications within a given scaling solution while all being tied to Ethereum.\n\nWhen it comes to layer-2 networks on Ethereum, the introduction of blobs represented a significant shift in how those protocols interact with the underlying blockchain. Before blobs were available as a separate fee market, layer-2s could only post bundled transactions in the form of Ethereum \u201ccalldata,\u201d a space for data to be contained within transactions.\n\nInstead of trafficking users\u2019 transactions in bulk alongside regular Ethereum activity, blobs serve almost as a dedicated lane on a highway, where less congestion can reduce costs. However, the best way to package those transactions before they\u2019re shipped is still up for debate.\n\nBlobs blobs blobs\n\nIn some cases, centralized sequencers can be leveraged to grind a network to a halt, puncturing the veil of permissionless activity that is synonymous with crypto. Sometimes, centralized sequencers can be abused to delay transactions too. However, Taiko\u2019s commitment to decentralization may not be the most efficient, according to one of its community advocates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSadly, it\u2019s kind of expensive,\u201d the pseudonymous crypto researcher arixon.eth said on Twitter (aka X). \u201cBecause of based sequencing, we need to post a blob every 12 [seconds], and if there aren't enough [transactions], then we just won't fill the blobs.\u201d\n\nBecause of based sequencing, we need to post a blob every 12s and if there aren't enough txs then we just won't fill the blobs Sadly it's kinda expensive, so we really need based preconfs \u2014 arixon.eth (@arixoneth) June 1, 2024\n\nWang of Taiko Labs said changing this pace could be a potential solution enacted soon, stating that Taiko\u2019s community is \u201cconsidering lowering the block proposing frequency a bit.\u201d\n\nThe constant stream of blobs, regardless of how full they are, has made Taiko a top user of them. On Sunday, for example, Taiko posted 25% of all blobs on Ethereum, according to a popular Dune dashboard. That day, Taiko spent nearly $63,000 on blob-related fees.\n\nOn Thursday, Taiko paid $123,000 in fees for blobs\u2014representing 73% of all costs paid for them across layer-2s\u2014which was its second straight day with a six-figure fee tally. And while most layer-2s pass cost savings onto their users through lower fees, the premium Taiko is paying for decentralization, as of now, isn\u2019t a bill that users need to foot.\n\n\u201cFor now, it's partially subsidized by the team,\u201d arixon.eth said, adding that the process could be modified in the future so that \u201cblocks are missed until there are enough [transactions] in the mempool for a proposer to push a block to [Ethereum] profitably.\u201d\n\nAmid the network\u2019s first airdrop on Wednesday of TAIKO tokens, the network\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the layer-2 averaged around 6.42 transactions per second, according to L2BEAT. Meanwhile, Ethereum registered around 13.6 transactions per second itself.\n\nSo far, the performance of Taiko\u2019s token has been turbulent. After crashing 40% an hour after it launched, to $2.27 from $3.80, the token\u2019s price had recovered to $2.45, as of this writing, showing a nearly 3% decrease over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Wintermute CEO questions Ethereum's leadership paradox amid celebrity memecoin controversy - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum leaders faces criticism for trying to merge capitalist and social goals.\n\nShare this article\n\nEvgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, said if Ethereum fails in the future, it will not be because of technical shortcomings compared to competitors like Solana. Instead, the core issue is the contradiction in Ethereum\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cIf ETH fails in the future it [won\u2019t] be because \u2018Solana is faster\u2019, it will be because the [ETH] \u2018elite\u2019 is still stuck in a massive contradiction,\u201d Gaevoy stated in a recent post on X.\n\nHis remarks come as a response to the controversy that erupted following Vitalik Buterin\u2019s critique of celebrity memecoins. According to Buterin, projects should aim to deliver societal value and leave participants content, rather than focus on enriching celebrities and early investors.\n\nButerin\u2019s stance drew a sharp rebuke from hip-hop artist Iggy Azalea, who recently launched her own memecoin, MOTHER. She posted a meme showing her holding a baby that resembled Buterin.\n\nAzalea\u2019s photo prompted Uniswap Labs co-founder Hayden Adams to defend Buterin\u2019s role.\n\nHe criticized Azalea for downplaying Buterin\u2019s contributions to the crypto community, expressing disappointment that instead of reacting positively and using profits to support social causes, the singer chose to mock Buterin.\n\nNo issues with memecoins or celebcoins \u2013 I think there\u2019s value to memetic attention and it\u2019s cool to create markets for it That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social\u2026 https://t.co/FQhawNl7GP \u2014 Hayden Adams \ud83e\udd84 (@haydenzadams) June 6, 2024\n\nThat was when the Wintermute CEO jumped into the debate and criticized Ethereum\u2019s leadership. He argued that Ethereum leaders are attempting to create a capitalist blockchain system while simultaneously addressing social issues\u2014a stance he sees as inherently contradictory.\n\n\u201cYou are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I\u2019m sorry, you really [can\u2019t] have both,\u201d Gaevoy added.\n\nGaevoy\u2019s comments sparked controversy among crypto members. Many disagreed with his view, saying that being against celeb memecoins does not equate to building a socialist system.\n\nNot sure how Hayden and Vitalik saying how they don't like certain trends means they are against capitalism (or aren't involved in building capitalist systems anymore) They both have a certain vision of crypto, in terms of the types of things people will build and what people\u2026 \u2014 Mike van Rossum (@mikevanrossum) June 6, 2024\n\nExcuse me, but in what way Vitalik or Hayden are building socialism? Being against obvious rug pulls != building socialism \u2014 DeFi Made Here (@DeFi_Made_Here) June 6, 2024\n\nIn response to these disagreements, Gaevoy said it all came down to the underlying principle.\n\nAccording to him, if capitalism is the foundation, integrating features to mitigate its negative impacts is beneficial. However, if the primary goal is \u201csocial justice\u201d or creating \u201conly good things,\u201d capitalism should not be an afterthought.\n\nTo me its about the primary guiding principle. If you key guiding principle is capitalism and then you make extra steps to make it less damaging \u2013 I'm all for it. If your guiding principle is, idk, \"social justice\" or \"only good things should be built\" and then you attach\u2026 \u2014 wishful cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) June 6, 2024"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin and crypto investors received a lot of good news this week, even though the market still can\u2019t manage to break free from its highs three months ago.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs absorbed net inflows of $887 million\u2014the second-best daily performance for the ETFs to date. The price of Bitcoin surged above $71,000 in the process, reaching its highest price since March.\n\nThat performance was followed by not one, but two high-profile Bitcoin ETF sponsors assuring investors that a second, much larger wave of institutions was coming to buy Bitcoin through the funds. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan wrote in a memo that crypto regulatory progress on Capitol Hill was untapped \u201calpha\u201d for investors, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson said the ETFs had only been touched by their \u201cfirst wave of the early adopters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJUST IN: Franklin Templeton CEO on #Bitcoin ETF adoption says \u201cThis is really the first wave of the early adopters. \u2026the next wave is the much bigger institutions.\u201d WATCH\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/G52jWUEetX \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) June 5, 2024\n\nAnd at least in the memecoin world, the bull market appeared to be back in full swing. Bitcoin\u2019s very first BRC-20 token, ORDI, surged by over 30% to $60 as of Friday, while PUPS and Bitcoin Wizards (WZRD) more than doubled in value intraweek, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nOther more popular memecoins like PEPE, BONK, and SHIB weren\u2019t as lucky, all posting losses this week.\n\nThe Solana-based meme coin GME seriously spiked, blasting up 467% at its height this week, building on the momentum of its stock market namesake Gamestop (GME). Meme influencer Roaring Kitty\u2014who sparked the Wall Street-confounding GameStop movement back in 2021\u2014gave the stock a second wind with his surprise returns to both YouTube and live streaming, with his net worth briefly edging toward $1 billion\u2014before a Friday cold shower from the game retailer.\n\nPerformance-wise, between Bitcoin and meme coins is Ethereum, which kept pace with Bitcoin\u2019s gains this week as its progressed toward a spot ETF launch. VanEck analysts posted a lengthy report arguing that ETH will reach $22,000 per unit by 2030, after sucking away financial market share from Apple, Google, and big banks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, with both the Bank of Canada and European Central Bank lowering interest rates this week, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes told followers that it was officially time to start apeing into Bitcoin and shitcoins.\n\nYet his call may have been a tad premature: at the end the week, a liquidation cascade on Friday sent Bitcoin crashing from $71,000 to $68,000, and ETH down from $3,800 to $3,600. Meanwhile, GME\u2014both the stock and the memecoin\u2014cratered by over 35% each.\n\nRoaring Kitty is the greatest business communicator since Steve Jobs.

        "title": "Ethereum whale\u2019s $56M sell-off could have THIS impact on the market - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "A major whale sold part of its ETH holdings\n\nAltcoin\u2019s price fell, while Ethereum\u2019s network growth declined too\n\nEthereum [ETH]\u2018s price registered a massive hike over the last few weeks, one fueled by news of new spot ETFs for ETH. Despite the optimism around the network, however, a large whale recently decided to sell its holdings.\n\nWhales shy away\n\nOn 8 June, a significant transaction occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. A major whale transferred 15,200 ETH, worth approximately $56.47 million, to Kraken. This particular address received massive holdings of 67,000 ETH directly from the Ethereum Foundation. It is further believed that this same address also received an initial 200,000 ETH during the Ethereum Genesis block, likely signifying participation in the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) that launched the Ethereum network.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that despite this recent transfer, the wallet still holds a balance of 41,000 ETH \u2013 Valued at approximately $151 million.\n\nThis large transaction may be interpreted by some investors as a sign that the whale is losing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future, prompting it to sell its holdings. This fear-based selling could trigger a domino effect, driving the price down further.\n\nAdditionally, the unknown purpose behind the transfer can spur further uncertainty.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,683.83, with its price down by 3.14% in the last 24 hours. Despite this sudden dip in ETH\u2019s price, however, the overall trend of the price movement looked relatively positive.\n\nAnd yet, the network growth for ETH declined significantly over the last few days, implying that new addresses were losing interest in ETH and were not ready to buy ETH at the current rate. If the price dips further, there may be a chance that ETH may begin to look lucrative to new investors in the future.\n\nCoupled with the declining network growth, the velocity at which ETH was trading also fell materially.\n\nIn terms of overall activity on the network, gas usage on the Ethereum network declined over the last few days. Additionally, the overall NFT trades on the network plummeted as well.\n\nThe lack of activity on the Ethereum ecosystem can be detrimental to both the the network and the price of ETH in the long run.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

        "content": "Ethereum fell below the $3,700 threshold, failing to break through the consolidation channel. With the price failing to surge upward, we might see another period of consolidation where the moving average could catch up with the massive volatility witnessed a few weeks ago and potentially provide some ground for a rally continuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince this level has been a crucial area of support for ETH, the recent decline below $3,700 is especially raising some concerns and questions. If it breaks below, it may indicate that bulls need to reorganize as bears are becoming more powerful.\n\nSharp swings in price action are characteristic of a volatile asset like Ethereum. Based on the current trend, it appears that ETH is having difficulty keeping up its upward momentum.\n\nEthereum went through a consolidation phase, fluctuating between support and resistance levels, as the chart illustrates following a significant rally. This type of activity typically occurs before a notable change in price either upward or downward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA deeper drop toward the 200-day MA, a more reliable measure of the direction of the long-term trend, could occur if it is unable to hold. In the near run, this might entail increased downside risk. An additional important consideration is volume.\n\nHigher-than-average trading volumes were seen along with the recent decline, suggesting that sellers are more active. This could indicate that more traders are cutting their positions, which would put more pressure on the price to decline. The RSI, on the other hand, is circling around neutral. This shows that Ethereum has room to recover if the mood of the market turns around, and it is neither overbought nor oversold."

        "content": "ETC\u2019s market structure was bullish at press time\n\nMomentum and volume indicators turned bearish on the charts though\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] retested the $25-support level and nearly flipped its higher timeframe market structure bearishly. This came after an unfavorable U.S May Jobs Report. Its short-term momentum seemed bearish too.\n\nIn a recent report, AMBCrypto noted that the $28.4-$29 zone could be revisited before a bounce. Ethereum Classic dropped more than expected. Ergo, the question \u2013 How do traders react to the recent price action?\n\nThe $29-support level did not hold\n\nThe recent higher low was set at $25.19 on 13 May. The price drop on 7 June, touched $25.07, but did not close a daily session below $25.19. Hence, the bulls seemed to have the upper hand on the higher timeframe, though it appeared tenuous.\n\nThe Directional Movement Index saw the -DI (red) jump above the 20-mark. It was an early sign that the trend could be shifting bearishly, as the ADX (yellow) would also need to climb past 20 to signal a strong downtrend in progress.\n\nThe CMF was at -0.09, indicating significant capital flow out of the market. This selling pressure has been present for a week. It would need to turn around for bulls to regain some hope.\n\nFutures market highlighted intense bearishness\n\nOver the past 10 days, Ethereum Classic has steadily risen from $31 to $28.6. The past 24 hours saw a flurry of selling activity spurred by Bitcoin [BTC] though.

The spot CVD continued its downtrend too.

        "title": "Should You Buy Solana Right Now While It's Below $200? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Solana can convince investors it's the next Ethereum, it could skyrocket in value.\n\nIn 2023, Solana (SOL 0.81%) was one of the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, up an eye-popping 900%. In 2024, Solana has continued to turn in a stellar performance. At its current price of $165, Solana is up more than 60% through the first five months of the year.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Solana appears to be running into a wall right now. It is down nearly 20% since it hit an intra-year high of just over $200 in March. Should you view this as a potential buying opportunity, or as a warning sign that Solana's impressive recent gains could be coming to an end? Let's take a closer look.\n\nIs Solana the next Ethereum?\n\nThe primary reason to invest in Solana right now is that it could eventually become the next Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Solana is a direct challenger to Ethereum in the Layer 1 blockchain space, and has been steadily gaining ground in every major niche, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For nearly four years, Solana has been tagged as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and now it finally seems to be delivering on its promise.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest raved about Solana last year, calling it a faster, cheaper, and more efficient version of Ethereum. That's backed up by real numbers. Solana, for example, says it can process 50,000 transactions per second. Ethereum, by way of comparison, can only process 15 to 20 transactions per second. To achieve faster transaction processing speeds, Ethereum relies on a confusing mix of Layer 2 scaling solutions that even developers say is becoming too hard to use.\n\nSolana's secret weapon\n\nMoreover, Solana has a secret weapon that Ethereum simply cannot match: A mobile crypto strategy that is finally gaining traction with customers. Solana officially launched its new \"crypto phone\" (the Saga) last year. Early sales were weak, but a clever marketing promotion based around Solana meme coins has led to sales taking off.\n\nFrom the outset, Solana's mobile strategy was designed as a way to onboard new crypto users. The goal was to get a mobile phone into people's hands, give them plenty of apps they couldn't find anywhere else, and design new mobile experiences to make crypto easier to use. That, in turn, could result in people beating down the door to become part of the Solana blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAdmittedly, this might be a very long-term strategy. But it might just work. According to investment firm VanEck, all Solana needs is a single \"killer app\" with at least 100 million users, along the lines of a ChatGPT. If Solana can find a \"killer app\" for its mobile phone, it could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nVanEck ran the numbers and determined that, in a bull-case scenario, Solana might be worth over $3,200 by 2030. So, yes, if you buy into this analysis, you should be buying Solana while it's still below $200. At today's prices, you might be able to make a 20-fold return on your investment.\n\nThe case against Solana\n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons to be concerned about Solana. For example, the current bout of meme coin popularity taking over the Solana blockchain seems to be leading to some unsustainable performance. All of the improvement that we've been seeing in Solana's metrics -- such as new users, new unique wallets, and spikes in transaction activity -- might just be a lot of smoke and mirrors.\n\nMoreover, Solana continues to stand in Ethereum's shadow when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the end of May, the SEC granted approval for new spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading soon. If they are anywhere near as successful as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could lead to a huge influx of investor money flowing into Ethereum. That's fantastic for Ethereum holders, but it could act as a negative drag on Solana's price over the short to medium term. Money that otherwise might have gone into Solana will now be going into Ethereum.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nThat being said, I'm taking a long-term approach when it comes to Solana. As Solana steadily gains market share at the expense of Ethereum, and as it continues to build out its mobile crypto strategy, I'm highly confident that it can continue to boost its valuation. Solana is still 36% below its all-time high of $260, which could be a reasonable near-term price target.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, of course, Solana will find the one \"killer app\" that it needs. If that happens, it could skyrocket in value and achieve what many have been predicting for several years now."
