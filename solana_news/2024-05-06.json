        "title": "What Is the EIP-3074 Proposal on Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "EIP-3074 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that aims to improve account management for Ethereum users.\n\nEIP-3074 has been approved for inclusion in the Prague/Electra Ethereum hard fork, scheduled for Q4 2024. The proposal aims to streamline transaction processes and decrease expenses by introducing third-party transaction sponsorship. EIP-3074 represents an advancement in Ethereum\u2019s account model, paving the way for future developments.\n\nSo, what exactly is EIP-3074, what implications does it hold for Ethereum, and how is it different from EIP-4337?\n\nWhat Is EIP-3074?\n\nEIP-3074 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that revolutionizes account management within the Ethereum network. It allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to delegate control to smart contracts, enabling more advanced transaction strategies.\n\nEIP-3074 was introduced in 2020 by Ethereum core developers and researchers Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, light clients, and Micah Zoltu.\n\nIt introduces two new operations, \u201cAUTH\u201d and \u201cAUTHCALL,\u201d to empower EOAs to transition seamlessly into smart contracts without requiring the deployment of new contracts.\n\nThe primary goal of implementing EIP-3074 is to enhance the wallet user experience by enabling gas sponsorship, facilitating batch transactions, and enabling wallet asset recovery processes.\n\nSee the illustration below to understand the flow of transactions.\n\nHow Does EIP-3074 Aim to Improve Ethereum?\n\nEIP-3074 proposes delegating control of EOAs to smart contracts which offers developers a flexible framework for innovative EOA transaction strategies. This transformation is facilitated by two instructions: \u201cAUTH\u201d and \u201cAUTHCALL.\u201d\n\nThe AUTH establishes the \u201cauthorized\u201d context variable based on ECDSA signatures. On the other hand, AUTHCALL initiates authorized account transfers, allowing for additional logic to be implemented around \u201cAUTHCALL\u201d without compromising security or user experience.\n\nThe AUTHCALL opcode functions similarly to the existing CALL opcode within Ethereum. It establishes the authorized address as the message sender in the subsequent call, effectively permitting the invoker contract to act on behalf of an EOA when interacting with other contracts.\n\nIn practice, the process involves the EOA address user signing the transaction off-chain, then either the EOA user or a gas sponsor sending the transaction to the invoker contract, which verifies and calls each target contract using \u201cAUTH\u201d and \u201cAUTHCALL.\u201d\n\nThat way, EIP-3074 enables any EOA to function as a smart contract wallet without contract deployment, facilitating more complex transaction schemes. This introduces various exciting use cases to Ethereum, such as gas sponsorship, batch transactions, and wallet asset recovery.\n\nGas sponsorship allows dapps, projects, and third parties to cover gas costs for users, removing the need for users to hold ETH themselves, which is particularly user-friendly for new Web3 users.\n\nIn addition, EIP-3074 supports executing multiple operations in a single transaction, streamlining non-ETH token trading by eliminating the token approval process. Hence, this enhances transaction efficiency and reduces costs.\n\nFor wallet asset recovery, EIP-3074 allows users to recover assets via a special invoker contract when they lose their private keys through a social recovery mechanism.\n\nEIP-3074 vs. EIP-4337: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nEIP-3074 and EIP-4337 tackle unique aspects of account abstraction on Ethereum. They are similar in that they both address execution abstraction, enabling functionalities such as batching multiple calls to multiple destinations, ensuring atomicity, and enhancing dapp-specific user experiences.\n\nHowever, they are quite different in how they work.\n\nEIP-3074, primarily focused on enhancing the capabilities of EOAs, introduces a novel approach by supercharging EOAs with arbitrary execution logic through invokers. It extends the functionalities of EOAs without necessitating asset migration to new accounts.\n\nHowever, EIP-3074 only addresses execution abstraction and doesn\u2019t deal with decentralized access. It prioritizes simplicity and aims to streamline transaction processes for existing EOAs.\n\nEIP-4337 takes a broader approach, aiming to abstract the entire account, involving all five functionalities. It looks to preserve Ethereum\u2019s core properties of decentralization and censorship resistance while mitigating potential vulnerabilities, such as DoS and griefing attack vectors.\n\nUnlike EIP-3074, EIP-4337 necessitates migration to a smart account as it cannot extend the capabilities of EOAs. It aspires to achieve full account abstraction without compromising the fundamental tenets of the Ethereum network.\n\nReasons For and Against EIP-3074\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the benefits that will come with the new EIP-3074 token standard proposals.\n\nReasons For EIP-3074\n\nNew Opcodes: EIP-3074 introduces new Ethereum opcodes, enabling EOA users to authorize smart contracts to execute actions on their behalf within a single transaction. This improves security and control, as users don\u2019t need to permanently transfer their private keys.\n\nUser-Friendly Utilities: The new opcodes enable various user-friendly utilities, including transaction batching, sponsored transactions, conditional transactions, meta-transactions, and delegated security. These utilities streamline transaction processes, improve efficiency, and expand possibilities for decentralized applications (dapps) and users.\n\nEasier Migration: EIP-3074 allows easier migration to smart accounts by empowering EOAs. Previously, the effort and gas cost of migrating existing assets posed a challenge for users switching to smart accounts. With EIP-3074, migration is smoother and in a single batched and gas-sponsored transaction.\n\nUnified User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DevEx): dApps can enhance user experiences without excluding EOAs, thereby increasing incentives to leverage sponsored transactions and transaction batching. This introduces standardization around these features and allows for the integration of smart account functionalities into development frameworks.\n\nHybrid Accounts: EOAs can designate smart accounts as invokers, enabling hybrid custody use cases and facilitating testing of smart accounts before asset migration. This flexibility gives users more control over their assets and opens up new possibilities for custody solutions.\n\nReasons Against EIP-3074\n\nWhile EIP-3074 provides many advantages, it also has some potential downsides.\n\nSecurity Concerns: The security of invokers is a significant concern associated with EIP-3074. Poorly implemented invokers could pose a threat to user funds. To address this risk, rigorous audits of invokers and safeguards in EOA wallets need to be implemented.\n\nRequirement for Hard Fork: The adoption of EIP-3074 necessitates a hard fork due to new opcodes. This requires agreement and integration, which can be a lengthy process and has brought some resistance to the EIP-3074 proposal.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe decision to implement EIP-3074 came from the community\u2019s recognition that the journey of achieving full account abstraction (AA) through proposals like EIP-4337 and RIP-7560 may require more time than initially anticipated.\n\nAt this time, focusing on enhancing EOAs offers immediate benefits. By fixing EOAs, EIP-3074 enables greater on-chain flexibility and execution abstraction within the existing Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe seamless integration of EIP-3074 into the Ethereum ecosystem and its reception by wallets and decentralized applications (dApps) will be crucial to its success. Moreover, ongoing efforts to address security concerns and ensure safe, user-friendly operations will be important for the widespread adoption and sustained effectiveness of EIP-3074."

        "title": "Ethereum devs propose new transaction type with EIP-7702 - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The proposal outlines a new transaction type that temporarily upgrades externally owned accounts.\n\nShare this article\n\nA group of prominent Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, has proposed a new transaction type (EIP-7702) to enhance the functionality and security of Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). The proposal aims to address common issues such as transaction batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation.\n\nAccording to the EIP-7702 draft, the new transaction type \u201cadds a contract_code field and a signature, and converts the signing account (not necessarily the same as the tx.origin) into a smart contract wallet for the duration of that transaction.\u201d The proposal is intended to offer similar functionality to EIP-3074.\n\nThe motivation behind EIP-7702 is to provide short-term functionality improvements to EOAs, increasing the usability of applications and, in some cases, allowing for improved security. The proposal outlines three particular applications: batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation.\n\nWhile EIP-3074 solves these use cases, the authors of EIP-7702 believe it has forward-compatibility concerns. They state that EIP-3074 \u201cintroduces two opcodes, AUTH and AUTHCALL, that would have no use in an \u2018endgame account abstraction\u2019 world where eventually all users are using smart contract wallets.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, they argue that EIP-3074 \u201cleads to the development of an \u2018invoker contract\u2019 ecosystem that would be separate from the \u2018smart contract wallet\u2019 ecosystem, leading to possible fragmentation of effort.\u201d\n\nThe specification of EIP-7702 details the transaction payload format and the process of executing the transaction, which involves setting the contract code of the signing account temporarily and reverting it back to empty at the end of the transaction.\n\nThe authors provide a rationale for how EIP-7702 can convert EIP-3074 use cases, stating that \u201cit requires fairly little work to convert an existing EIP-3074 workflow.\u201d\n\nThey also argue that EIP-7702 is designed to be forward-compatible with future account abstraction, avoiding the creation of separate code ecosystems and the need for new opcodes that may become obsolete.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, the authors acknowledge that EIP-7702 breaks the invariant that an account balance can only decrease as a result of transactions originating from that account, which may have consequences for mempool design and other EIPs.\n\nAs with any proposal requiring users to sign contract code, the authors emphasize the importance of user wallets being cautious about which contract_code they sign, highlighting the shared security considerations with EIP-3074."

Following him will keep you informed about the latest developments in the crypto world.\n\nPros and Cons of Following Ethereum Influencers\n\nIt is not recommended to take every word from an influencer\u2019s tweets on social media or a podcast and digest them hook, line, and sinker. Just like everything else that exists, there are perks and drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand their influential materials, you must learn to differentiate what works from what doesn\u2019t.\n\nPros\n\nReliable Sources: These influencers are often the most reliable references to turn to when you encounter random news about Ethereum. They commit themselves to being the avenue through which others stay updated on recent events in the space. Spreading false information would only tarnish their reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Up to Date: When Bitcoin ETFs were under consideration by the SEC, those following BTC maximalists were continuously kept informed about the proceedings. Ethereum ETFs have also been hinted to arrive soon. Can you guess where you\u2019ll find this information? Exactly\u2014ETH maximalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Information: Influencers provide real-time updates on various aspects: market volatility, trends, legal challenges, crypto-government conflicts, recent launches, upcoming airdrops, and more. No one reports it better than these maximalists.\n\n\n\nDeep Insights and Content on Cryptocurrency: First, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) are the go-to sources for news, updates, and events. But beyond that, they analyze these developments and share market sentiments through various mediums such as social media posts, YouTube videos, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), and blogs. KOLs engage in fact-based speculations, discussions, and provide expert opinions.\n\nCons\n\nInformation Overload: Someone needs to tell influencers to cut us some slack. There are too many influencers, each sharing their individual opinions. It\u2019s overwhelming to take in and comprehend all the updates, analyses, and news that come in droves. We have too little time to make sense of it all.\n\n\n\nMisinformation: Having influence doesn\u2019t guarantee that their content is always accurate, especially for those who are not part of the Ethereum team. To avoid this, follow reputable sources like Vitalik and steer clear of influential farmers.\n\n\n\nMarket Influence and Bias: Predictions and analyses by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) can sometimes be wrong. KOLs are not supreme beings with the ability to control the market through their thoughts. Instead, they use sentiments to sway their audience. Occasionally, they spread hate or bias toward other opinions or chains, subtly influencing their followers.\n\n\n\n**False Hope:**Being bullish is fine, but delivering doses of \u2018hopium\u2019 to susceptible followers who hang on your every word goes against crypto principles. However, for many ETH maximalists, the hype should remain alive.\n\n\n\nEnd Words\n\nEthereum is the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin and the most actively engaged blockchain in the history of distributed ledgers. This prominence places the pioneer smart contract network at the center of numerous discussions within the crypto space.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing criticisms, making comparisons, and staying updated all require experts who can readily highlight and clarify complex topics. Their insights help followers make informed decisions and take enlightened steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the term \u2018influencer\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply blindly following their investment advice. While influencers play a valuable role, you should never let them entirely dictate your crypto investment decisions. There will always be digital currencies, NFTs to explore, bridges to test, and DeFi projects to consider. But don\u2019t rush into decisions solely because an influencer recommends it. Instead, make your own choices, build a solid rationale, and remember the crypto mantra: DYOR (Do Your Own Research).\n\nFAQs\n\nWho are the best ETH influencers? Vitalik Buterin and every other dedicated Ethereum supporter on social media have everyone\u2019s interests at heart. They are undoubtedly crypto influencers too.\n\n\n\nWill $ETH supersede $BTC? Crypto remains uncertain, leaving room for possibilities. However, $BTC stands strong as the pioneer of crypto, making it challenging for other cryptocurrencies to surpass it.\n\nFrom every perspective, Ethereum\u2019s goal is not to replace Bitcoin but to serve as the decentralized open-source smart contract layer for applications to build upon.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct competition between $BTC and $ETH\u2014only mutual respect (except for the maximalists who might think otherwise).\n\n\n\nWhat impact will the launch of more \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d have on Ethereum? From my viewpoint, it won\u2019t have a significant impact. Ethereum will continue to thrive. The crypto space operates as an open-source collaborative environment.\n\nEthereum will persistently evolve, while other blockchains may create forks. In the end, survival will favor those who adapt.\n\n\n\nWill the growth of other cryptocurrencies affect the future of the Ethereum Blockchain? Ethereum proudly remains the mother of smart contracts. Most ecosystems either build on it, adopt its architecture, or strive to provide better scalability. Therefore, the growth of these projects cannot undermine ETH, as it plays a crucial role in the crypto industry.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Can Tron Overtake Ethereum? - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nTron: Huge in Asian markets despite regulatory scrutiny, powered by Tether.\n\nEthereum: Favored in Western markets for its compliance and innovation, powered by USDC.\n\nEthereum has a higher market capitalization, while Tron sees greater daily user activity, suggesting different levels of market engagement.\n\nThe potential outcomes for Ethereum and Tron range from one dominating the market, both coexisting, or both being overtaken by a new blockchain.\n\nBefore the advent of radar and satellite navigation, sailors often relied on the flight of birds to determine the presence of nearby land masses. Similarly, in the blockchain markets, the \u201cflight patterns\u201d of stablecoins can often tell you quite a lot about the fortunes of a blockchain project.\n\nAs of this writing, Tron is leading Ethereum in USDT supply, with $57 billion on Tron versus $50 billion on Ethereum. What might this mean for blockchain investors? Can Tron overtake its older, more popular rival as the premier Layer-1 smart contract blockchain?\n\nIn short, which token is the better buy in the long term \u2013 ETH or TRX?\n\nIn this guide, we analyze the fundamentals, history, and regional dynamics of both Tron and Ethereum to see if we can find a winner.\n\nThe Fundamentals\n\nBehind bitcoin, Ethereum is the second largest crypto in the world, with a market cap of $386 billion. At just $10.6 billion, Tron is a distant 13th on the table overall (and 9th if you only look at L1 blockchains). Bitcoin towers above them all, with a market cap of $1.24 trillion.\n\nToken Price and Supply\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was worth $3,169, an increase of 178% year over year and 1557% from its value in Q4 2020. Naturally, this price movement has made ETH a popular option among investors for long-term holding.\n\nTRX presents a study in contrast in many ways. Since its launch in 2017, the token has never ventured above a peak of $0.23 in price. At the start of Q2 2024, 1 TRX is worth $0.120, a 6000% increase since 2017 and 173% year-on-year.\n\nBoth ETH and TRX do not have any limits on the number of tokens that can be issued over time. In both blockchains, a set amount of tokens are regularly burnt off to regulate the available supply and maintain an upward price pressure.\n\nDaily Active Users\n\nOn Daily Active Users, our favorite metric, Tron is comfortably ahead of its rivals. The network has around 1.9 million daily users. After crossing the one million milestone in 2022, the numbers have remained relatively stable, with noticeable spikes in 2023 and early 2024.\n\nOn Ethereum, the number of daily active users is only around 465,000. The graph looks relatively flat over the years, barring a few minor spikes here and there. Although there is a slow upward trend, it is pretty clear that holders of ETH typically use the network less often than TRX owners.\n\nNetwork Fees\n\nHigh gas fees have been a perennial problem for the Ethereum network. This has spawned the development of Layer-2 networks (L2s) and sidechains prioritizing lower transaction costs. L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism and sidechains like Polygon offer lower gas fees than the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEven in 2024, subject to network congestion and demand, gas fees on ETH mainnet can range from less than a dollar to $70 or more. In contrast, transactions on the Tron network usually cost between $1 - $3, subject to network activity.\n\nFurther, Tron also offers free transactions. Users willing to stake TRX on the network can enjoy transactions without gas fees. The limits can vary depending on the quantity of TRX staked.\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum's annualized fees were around $2.75 billion, with a monthly fee of $226 million. Meanwhile, Tron reported annualized costs of $1.52 billion and monthly fees of $125 million.\n\nReputation and Regional Dynamics\n\nAny discussion of the Tron network would be futile without a look at its controversial founder, Justin Sun. A fugitive from the Chinese government, Sun has been accused of everything from insider trading to market making, tax evasion, various forms of financial fraud, money laundering, and more.\n\nEven sections of the Tron white paper were allegedly plagiarized from white papers written by Protocol Labs, another blockchain organization. Sun, who owns the Tron Foundation, was charged by the SEC in 2023 for fraud and violations of US securities laws related to the sale of TRX tokens.\n\nUndoubtedly, investor perception of Tron has been heavily influenced by the negative press generated by Justin Sun over the years. However, despite its early wobbles, Tron has gained traction in key markets outside the US and the EU.\n\nTwo key developments were responsible for this:\n\nThe addition of USDT to the Tron blockchain as a TRC20 token\n\nPartnership with Binance to support the Tron network on the popular exchange\n\nTron enjoyed the early mover advantage in providing an easily accessible electronic payment system based around a stablecoin, with very low fees and instant transactions. This proved highly attractive in regions that suffered from the following situations:\n\nLack of modern banking systems and high cross-border transaction fees (Asia, Africa)\n\nHigh levels of inflation that rendered the national currency unusable (Latin America)\n\nWestern sanctions blocking international bank payments (Russia, Iran)\n\nIn these regions and China, the users have acute real-world payment needs that Tron effectively meets. Most do not care about Justin Sun's reputation; many users may not even know his existence.\n\nUS regulators have repeatedly targeted USDT and Tron for non-compliance with financial regulations. However, they are both entrenched in the global market due to the early mover advantage\u2014rival options like USDC and Arbitrum arrived much later.\n\nHow Ethereum (and USDC) Compares\n\nRegarding reputation, Ethereum\u2019s equivalent to Justin Sun \u2013 co-founder Vitalik Buterin \u2013 has had no major scandals or controversies associated with him. He is generally recognized as an innovator and pioneer of blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum also has a relatively clean reputation, which has aided its adoption as a platform for crypto innovation and investment in Western markets. In tandem, Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin has emerged as a popular alternative to USDT due to its focus on compliance with US financial regulations.\n\nThe critical thing to note is that while ETH is incredibly popular in the West, it is not widely used for real-world solutions like payments. Crypto is primarily seen as a tool for investment and wealth generation through holding or trading.\n\nIn contrast, Tron and USDT have gained popularity in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Russia as they offer viable alternatives where traditional banking and payment systems have failed.\n\nApplication Ecosystems\n\nA quick look at Dappradar.com reveals a clear mismatch between the two networks. Ethereum has well over 4,000 apps, with over a dozen showing thousands of unique active wallets (UAWs). Here is a quick look at the top 5 dapps on Ethereum:\n\nXterio: A gaming app with over 67k UAWs and transaction volumes of $716k in 24 hours\n\nUniswap V3: A popular trading and AMM protocol with 32k UAWs and $2.7b transactions\n\n1inch Network: A liquidity and DeFi aggregator with 9.4k UAWs and $225m transactions\n\nEigenLayer: A radical new restaking protocol with 8.8k UAWs and $392k transactions\n\nUniswap V2: The predecessor to V3, with 7.87k UAWs and $137m transactions\n\nFurther, Ethereum has over 236 core developers who made over 1.69k code commits in 30 days. According to DeveloperReport.com, the blockchain attracts the maximum number of active developers, with 2,392 as of December 2023.\n\nTron has more modest stats in comparison. Apart from 8 core developers, the blockchain reportedly has only 16 independent developers. The ecosystem is far from thriving, and developer activity seems dead mainly, although the platform has around 1380 apps and protocols.\n\nPayNet Staking: A high-risk staking app with 743 UAWs\n\nDegree Crypto Staking: Another decentralized staking app with over 500 UAWs\n\nTron NRG: A protocol that allows TRX stakers to rent their energy, with 171 UAWs\n\nBitget Swap: A trading wallet with 157 UAWs and $32.6k transactions in 24 hours\n\nJustLend DAO: A decentralized lending app with 119 UAWs and $277k transactions\n\nThese numbers show that Ethereum is way ahead of Tron in terms of ecosystem evolution and developer activity. The vast majority of Tron users are interested only in its USDT payments feature, which is not bad. It has a niche use case that has gained traction in specific parts of the globe.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is miles ahead when it comes to testing and developing new ways to use blockchain technology. If you are looking for innovative services and apps that could gain mainstream acceptance in the future, you are more likely to find those on Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\nScalability and Other Technical Aspects\n\nEthereum and Tron are highly scalable blockchains, unlike bitcoin, which relies on an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus model. While Ethereum uses a basic proof-of-stake model, Tron relies on a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEthereum, in particular, has a significant lead when working on scaling solutions. Dutzende of L2 chains and side chains are currently under development. Tron presently has one primary L2 under development linked to Bitcoin.\n\nTransaction Speeds\n\nDue to the delegated PoS, Tron can process transactions much faster than Ethereum, resulting in a claimed average speed of around 2000 transactions per second (TPS). The Ethereum 2.0 mainnet can only handle between 15 and 30 TPS.\n\nThis could change with the addition of newer features like sharding to Ethereum via future updates. Besides, the blockchain already offers faster transaction speeds through sidechains and L2s like Arbitrum (4000 TPS), Polygon (65,000 TPS) and Base (2000 TPS).\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nEthereum is more friendly towards developers as it supports a wide array of programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Rust, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, and Javascript. In contrast, Tron has adopted a narrower approach, supporting only Python and Solidity.\n\nFuture Prospects: Coexistence or Competition?\n\nGiven the highly chaotic and relatively unregulated nature of cryptocurrency markets, making confident predictions about anything is difficult. On the future of the ongoing competition between Ethereum and Tron, we can see at least three ways in which it can play out:\n\nScenario 1: Winner Take All\n\nEthereum's more likely outcome here is a win. It has wider investor acceptance, and its main weakness is slow and expensive transactions. These issues can realistically be solved via future updates and L2s.\n\nA Tron win is less likely for a multitude of reasons. Apart from the charges against Justin Sun, Tron is also under investigation for using its platform to evade sanctions in Russia and for dangerous activities like terrorism financing in the Middle East.\n\nScenario 2: Coexistence\n\nBoth Ethereum and Tron gravitate towards opposing extremes in the crypto world. Ethereum thrives in highly regulated and developed markets as it can attract and sustain more institutional investors. The SEC approved ETH futures in 2023. Spot ETFs could follow suit, probably after another legal battle in the US courts.\n\nMeanwhile, Tron seemingly thrives more in grey, unregulated financial markets and regions where financial inclusion faces significant challenges. As regulators in the West exert greater pressure on the blockchain industry, Tron and USDT could focus more on markets in Asia, Latin America, and Russia.\n\nScenario 3: Another Blockchain Wins\n\nIn this scenario, either an existing or brand-new L1 could rise and disrupt the entire ecosystem, vanquishing Ethereum and Tron. We already have one such contender, Solana (SOL).\n\nSolana already has faster and cheaper transactions and scalability. It is also the fifth most valuable crypto at the time of writing, with a market cap of $61 billion. It is arguably the top L1 contender that has a reasonable chance to overtake Ethereum in the next decade.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nBoth ETH and TRX present interesting opportunities for crypto investors.\n\nETH is the world\u2019s second most popular crypto with exciting long-term holding prospects, decent staking APY, and significant institutional backing.\n\nTRX offers the chance to earn high APY through staking and the advantages of near-zero transaction fees. However, it is significantly more vulnerable to regulatory action.\n\nThese two cryptos have different evolutionary trajectories, audiences, and potential use cases.\n\nMuch depends on your risk appetite and jurisdiction. For US/EU investors who care about compliance and transparency, ETH and USDC are likely safer alternatives to TRX and USDT. But a savvy investor could always buy both.\n\nJoin us at Bitcoin Market Journal and get the best analysis of the leading projects each week."

        "content": "Michael Saylor thinks they won\u2019t launch at all, and even some fund issuers think it\u2019s unlikely this year. Meanwhile, other countries are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nThe battle to launch exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum\u2019s spot price in the U.S. is heating up \u2014 and so far, the journey looks similar to Bitcoin\u2019s long and messy road to approval.\n\nOnce again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dragging its heels on offering a definitive answer to the applications already made. A green light matters because it would allow investors to gain exposure to ETH without owning the underlying asset.\n\nGrayscale and Franklin Templeton were both due to receive a response from the SEC in April, but the regulator\u2019s now pushed their deadlines back to June.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock have had similar applications kicked into the long grass as well. VanEck and ARK Invest are due to receive a response later this month, but hopes of approval have been dwindling fast.\n\nWhy? Because there are signs that the regulator believes that Ether is a security, and not a commodity like Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: What\u2019s next for global finance?\n\nA growing dispute\n\nBack in June 2023, speaking in front of the House Financial Services Committee, SEC chair Gary Gensler had refused to say whether he believes ETH is a security.\n\nThe lack of a clear answer had spooked the crypto industry \u2014 especially considering this contradicted earlier guidance made by his predecessor Jay Clayton.\n\nAnd even earlier than that, around the time of The Merge in September 2022, Gensler had hinted that the staking process may fall under securities rules.\n\nEther\u2019s status matters because it determines which organization holds regulatory oversight in the U.S. \u2014 and if it is a security, this could cause big problems for other altcoins.\n\nConsensus recently sued the SEC and leapt to Ethereum\u2019s defense \u2014 arguing the commission\u2019s \u201cunlawful power grab threatens to undermine America\u2019s position as a leader of the next generation of the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Case for #Bitcoin on the Corporate Balance Sheet pic.twitter.com/LcZ4V2nqV0 \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) May 3, 2024\n\nSaylor\u2019s prediction\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin supporter who spearheaded efforts to add hundreds of thousands of BTC to the company\u2019s balance sheet, doesn\u2019t believe that ETFs based on ETH\u2019s spot price will ever see the light of day. Speaking at the annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, he warned:\n\n\u201cSome time this summer, it\u2019ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a cryptoasset security, not a commodity. After that, you\u2019re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano \u2014 everything down the stack \u2014 is just a cryptoasset security unregistered. None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as cryptoassets. [Bitcoin] is the one universal, consensus accepted, institutional-grade cryptoasset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d Michael Saylor\n\nOf course, you could argue that Saylor was bound to say this \u2014 especially considering that he believes BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is technically and ethically sound. Speaking at the Blockchain Economy Istanbul Summit back in July 2022, he had warned that Ether\u2019s continual upgrades \u201cintroduce new attack surfaces\u201d that undermine security and reliability.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe bigger challenge now appears to be that there\u2019s a lack of dialog between the SEC and firms hoping to bring an Ether ETF to market. As Barron\u2019s reported last month, applicants aren\u2019t being given \u201cthe critical feedback needed to finalize their products.\u201d By contrast, BTC ETF issuers had engaged in a \u201crobust back-and-forth\u201d before their funds started trading.\n\nJan van Eck, whose eponymous investment firm is awaiting a verdict from the SEC, candidly told CNBC in April that he believes the application will \u201cprobably be rejected\u201d \u2014 while Jean-Marie Mognetti from CoinShares predicted that no approvals will happen in 2024.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to be paralyzed by regulatory uncertainty, where a lack of clarity on Ether\u2019s status is leaving crypto firms exasperated, other jurisdictions are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nAlthough trading volumes were rather tepid on the first day, it remains significant that Hong Kong has now launched an ETH ETF, amid speculation this could one day open the door to investors from mainland China.\n\nAs S&P Global recently noted, funds based on Ether\u2019s spot price have already been approved in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany \u2014 with some offering additional yield by offering staking returns as well.\n\nWith ETFs in other territories now boasting billions of dollars in assets under management, the U.S. risks falling further and further behind."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNearly all stablecoin transactions are tied to \u201cinorganic activity,\u201d according to payments giant Visa and enterprise blockchain data provider Allium.\n\nThe companies have launched a new data dashboard designed \u201cto remove potential distortions that can arise from inorganic activity and other artificial inflationary practices,\u201d and its adjusted figures reveal upwards of 90% of tracked transactions occur without human involvement.\n\nThe dashboard tracks Tether's eponymous USDT, Circle's USDC, Paxos's USDP, and PayPal's PYUSD. All of them are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and keep cash or cash-like (U.S. treasury bonds) reserves to back their tokens. Visa doesn't attribute the \"inorganic activity\" to any particular stablecoin, but comparing the adjusted and unadjusted figures casts a stark light on just how infrequently humans are the ones initiating stablecoin payments.\n\nFor example, Visa reports that $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed on Sunday, May 5. That's the unadjusted figure. When the data is adjusted to remove so-called inorganic activity, the number plummets to $4.6 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Visa data analysis was conducted, at least in part, in response to a Coin Metrics chart making the rounds on Twitter claiming that stablecoin were catching up with established settlement networks.\n\nIn a blog post last week, Visa's head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, argued that transactions initiated by smart contracts\u2014without any human explicitly involved\u2014aren't directly comparable to the kind of transactions handled by traditional payment processors.\n\n\"For instance, developers can create automated bot programs that perform activities such as stablecoin arbitrage, liquidity provision, and market making, among others,\" he wrote. \"These activities are vital for sustaining the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, the on-chain transactions resulting from interactions with these automated programs don't resemble settlement in the traditional sense.\"\n\nOther notable data points emerged from the analysis. According to Visa, USDC usage has experienced marked growth in the past eight months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn September 2023, USDC was used for 23% of all the stablecoin transactions analyzed by Visa. But by the end of the year, that rate of use had more than doubled, surpassing 50% of all stablecoin transactions\u2014as high as 60% in February\u2014every month since December, according to Visa."

        "content": "Ethereum developers can\u2019t see eye to eye on a proposed code change that could potentially improve user experience with wallets.\n\nSome developers believe EIP-3074 could introduce security risks to the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s next major hard fork Pectra would introduce a host of new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), but one of them is facing pushback from the developer community, including the blockchain\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin himself.\n\nThe proposal, known as EIP-3074, introduces Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) opcodes: AUTH and AUTHCALL. The former allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to authorize actions via a signed message and a commit, and the latter executes transactions on behalf of the authorized EOA.\n\nLearn more about it: What Is the EIP-3074 Proposal on Ethereum?\n\nAuthors of EIP-3074 expect that this change will make EOAs easier to use because of the ability to sign off on batched transactions together and also having third parties sponsor transaction fees, opening the doors for decentralized protocols to potentially cover these costs for their users.\n\nEIP-3074 is coming in the next Ethereum hard fork. This is a big deal. Wallet UX will 10x. Congratulations to Ethereum and the EIP-3074 sponsors. Reth has already implemented and tested it. We are fans. Let's go. https://t.co/lUiK2kb3UT \u2014 Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) April 11, 2024\n\nWhile the proposal is an effort in Account Abstraction (AA), aimed at making wallets more flexible, it has faced pushback from authors of EIP-4337, which was deployed to the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023.\n\nEIP-4337 is also an AA proposal, which supports introducing features to EOAs such as paying gas fees in tokens besides ether and account recovery mechanisms. However, that proposal sets out to achieve the goals AA using an offchain transaction relayer, without requiring any changes to the consensus layer.\n\n\u201cThis is of course NOT simply a matter of \u2018my AA proposal good, your AA proposal bad,'\u201d said ZeroDev CEO in a blog explaining that developers behind the two proposals had fundamentally different visions for the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThe core disagreements include whether EIP-4337 is the endgame for AA and if it is more urgent to solve censorship resistance or user experience issues. Those in the EIP-4337 camp believe that Ethereum should prioritize censorship resistance even if it means delaying UX improvements, while those in the EIP-3074 camp think that the network is already censorship-resistant enough.\n\nThe big really valuable and necessary thing that ERC-4337 provides for account abstraction is a *decentralized fee market* for user operations going into smart contract wallets.https://t.co/JUigSO5OtW \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 1, 2022\n\nWhile the proposal would bring about more immediate user experience improvements, some developers think that including EIP-3074 in the Pectra hard fork would introduce security risks to the network.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s account model is complex for users and thus introduces security risks,\u201d wrote Ethereum developer Yoav. \u201cWe need to improve it, not to weaken it. After 3074 inclusion I expect we\u2019ll see more rugpulls, replay attacks, wallets drained. I hope to be proven wrong here as well.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is hosting a discussion on the proposal on Tuesday, which may determine its future."

        "title": "Joseph Lubin Defends Ethereum Against SEC Overreach - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent interview with Wired, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, shed light on his ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nConsensys is a leading blockchain software technology company with a core focus on the Ethereum ecosystem. They develop a comprehensive suite of tools, products, and infrastructure designed to empower developers, businesses, and individuals harnessing the potential of Ethereum. Consider ConsenSys a pivotal player in constructing the foundation for the decentralized web.\n\nThe conflict, which centers around the SEC\u2019s alleged attempts to classify Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, as a security, has far-reaching implications for the future of the decentralized web.\n\nLast month, Consensys received a Wells Notice from the SEC, indicating that the regulator is considering suing the company over its MetaMask wallet. The SEC takes issue with two specific features of MetaMask: token swapping and staking. However, Lubin believes that the SEC\u2019s actions go beyond MetaMask and represent a broader effort to assert control over Ethereum and the decentralized technologies built upon it.\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s notice, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the regulator, accusing it of an \u201cunlawful seizure of authority over ETH.\u201d The company argues that ETH does not possess the characteristics of a security and that the SEC\u2019s actions could have disastrous consequences for the Ethereum network.\n\nLubin explains that if the SEC were to successfully classify ETH as a security, it would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on Ethereum users in the United States. Individuals would be unable to legally acquire ETH, and software developers would be hindered in their ability to further develop the Ethereum protocol or build applications on top of it. Moreover, Lubin fears that the U.S. could use its influence to pressure other countries to reduce access to decentralized protocols and financial disintermediation.\n\nBy bringing the lawsuit against the SEC, Consensys aims to clarify the limits of the regulator\u2019s jurisdiction and encourage the broader crypto industry to push back against what Lubin describes as \u201caggressive and unlawful SEC overreach.\u201d He argues that the SEC has been \u201cgaslighting the industry\u201d by secretly treating ETH as a security while publicly stating otherwise.\n\nLubin likens the current situation to the early days of the internet, when new technologies caused confusion and required open dialogue and clear regulation. He believes that, ultimately, the situation will be resolved favorably for Ethereum, but acknowledges that the industry is currently in a \u201cpainful stage\u201d marked by resistance from regulators.\n\nA favorable outcome for Consensys would be a clear declaration that ETH is a commodity, not a security, and the eventual approval of ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the SEC. Lubin believes that such a development would open \u201cfloodgates\u201d of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, driving further growth and maturation of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nLubin dismisses the notion that the SEC\u2019s interest in Ethereum intensified following The Merge, a major upgrade to the network\u2019s consensus mechanism. He argues that the post-Merge Ethereum network is more decentralized and secure, and that staking rewards should be seen as income, not investment contracts.\n\nWhen asked about the SEC\u2019s motivations, Lubin offers a \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d suggesting that the U.S. government and big banks are resistant to the disintermediation and direct financial agency that decentralized technologies offer. He believes that the SEC\u2019s actions are less about expanding its jurisdiction and more about slowing down or killing new technologies that threaten the status quo."

        "title": "Ethereum Witnesses a Significant Drop in Daily ETH Burning - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum Witnesses a Significant Drop in Daily ETH Burning\n\nThe Ethereum network has experienced a notable decline in the daily amount of ETH burned, reaching its lowest level this year. This has resulted in fewer ETH being burned. On Sunday, only 610 ETH was burned, setting a record low for this year as Ethereum's gas fees remained minimal. In contrast, during the first four months of the year, the daily amount of ETH burned stood consistently above 2,500-3,000 ETH.\n\nThe ongoing decline in gas fees can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there has been a shift in activity towards Layer 2 scaling solutions, which offer improved scalability and lower transaction costs. Additionally, the adoption of blob transactions, introduced with the Dencun upgrade in March, has contributed to reducing transaction costs on Layer 2 solutions.\n\nThe London hard fork, also known as EIP-1559, implemented in August 2021, brought about a fundamental change to Ethereum's fee structure. This upgrade introduced a base fee that is burned and a priority fee that serves as a tip to validators. The relationship between gas fees and ETH burning is closely monitored as an essential aspect of Ethereum's economic model. While lower fees are advantageous for network users, the decrease in ETH burn has implications for the deflationary nature of Ethereum.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum's supply has shifted towards being inflationary, with a growth rate of 0.49%, according to ultrasound.money. However, if activity picks up and more ETH is burned than issued, Ethereum could return to a deflationary state, where the supply decreases over time."

        "content": "Mon 06 May 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAmid groundbreaking announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove it is both a territory of boundless innovation and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here\u2019s a rundown of the most striking news from the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, etc.\n\nMicroStrategy perseveres despite everything!\n\nMicroStrategy continued to increase its Bitcoin holdings, reaching an impressive total of 214,400 BTC with a recent acquisition of 122 Bitcoins for $7.8 million. Despite a net loss of $53 million in the first quarter of 2024 and a 5.5% decline in revenue compared to the previous year, the company maintains its strategy of massive investment in crypto. These market movements occurred in a context of increased volatility, affecting the value of the company\u2019s digital assets.\n\nThis bold strategy, although risky given the volatility of the crypto market, is a bet on the long-term profitability of Bitcoin. However, this approach has led to significant financial losses and prevented MicroStrategy from joining the S&P 500, a blow to the company\u2019s attractiveness to investors. The future of this strategy remains uncertain, but it demonstrates a firm commitment to the potential of Bitcoin.\n\nLight sentence for Changpeng Zhao despite serious charges\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, has been sentenced to only four months in prison and a $50 million fine for charges of fraud and compliance failures. This sentence is markedly more lenient than the three years requested by prosecutors and is perceived, by some, as a sign of leniency that downplays the seriousness of the infractions and thus sets a worrying precedent for the industry.\n\nFurthermore, this case highlights the challenges regulators face in an ever-evolving sector and underscores the need for a balance between promoting innovation and protecting investors. Zhao\u2019s case also illustrates the tension between strict regulation and the potential to push key players toward more permissive jurisdictions.\n\nTreasury takes aim at crypto fraudsters in France\n\nIn France, the gap between actual crypto usage and tax reporting is alarming. According to European Central Bank figures, about 5 million French people are crypto users, but only 150,000 tax filings have been recorded. This discovery has prompted Treasury action to take drastic steps to combat tax fraud, partly inspired by the massive fraud already observed in other schemes like MaPrimeR\u00e9nov, where 400 million euros were misappropriated.\n\nTo combat this scourge, the Treasury decided to deploy artificial intelligence for more effective and targeted surveillance. A new anti-fraud legislative framework, including a crypto-specific component, is in preparation. Artificial intelligence will be used to analyze blockchains and detect suspicious activities in real time, modeling fraud patterns to better track and unravel the most complex money-laundering circuits. This technological approach promises constant vigilance and an increased capacity to respond to fraudulent schemes.\n\nBNP Paribas invests in Bitcoin\n\nMay 1, 2024, is marked by a contradictory event in the world of Bitcoin ETFs, with record outflows of $563.7 million in a single day. Despite this tumultuous context, BNP Paribas, the second-largest European bank, has made a significant move towards Bitcoin adoption by investing approximately $40,000 in BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF. While modest, this investment is symbolic of the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin by traditional European financial institutions.\n\nThis move by BNP Paribas could mark the beginning of broader institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Until now, this adoption had been mainly by American asset managers and regional banks. BNP\u2019s commitment could encourage other major banks and asset managers to invest in Bitcoin, thereby accelerating its acceptance by the general public and boosting inflows into ETFs and other regulated vehicles.\n\nRippleX revolutionizes XRP with a new feature\n\nRippleX has recently launched an innovative feature, the XLS-68d specification, which aims to simplify and democratize transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This new specification allows platforms to manage fees and account reserves for their users, significantly reducing the complexity and financial barriers associated with using XRP. Users will benefit from what\u2019s called \u201csponsored transactions,\u201d where they can include sponsor signatures in their transactions while maintaining full control of their accounts.\n\nThis advancement is seen as a major step toward the mass adoption of XRP, as it enables platforms to cover the costs of transactions for their users, making XRP accessible to a broader audience.\n\nSEC controversy: Accusations of lying about Ethereum\n\nGary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, is accused of misleading the U.S. Congress about classifying Ethereum as an unregistered security. These revelations, stemming from internal SEC documents exposed during a lawsuit with the company Consensys, show that the agency considered ETH a security for over a year. These actions contradict the public statements of Gensler, who has declined to clarify the SEC\u2019s position on Ethereum during a hearing, avoiding direct questions on the subject.\n\nPatrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has openly criticized Gensler for what he considers deception towards Congress. This situation sheds light on the challenges and contradictions in the SEC\u2019s regulation of cryptos. The outcome of these regulatory debates could have significant implications for the legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the United States.\n\nPayPal expands its crypto offerings with MoonPay\n\nPayPal has significantly expanded its crypto offerings through a strategic partnership with MoonPay. This collaboration allows PayPal to offer more than 100 different digital assets to its users, thus simplifying the purchase of cryptocurrencies just like an ordinary online purchase. Similarly, this partnership enhances the compatibility of crypto transactions with traditional banking systems and reduces transaction failures, providing a smooth and secure user experience.\n\nTo conclude, this integration guarantees better protection of customer personal data, who no longer need to provide their information separately to MoonPay for transactions. With the addition of popular cryptos such as Solana, Tether, and Dogecoin, PayPal broadens the possibilities for its users in terms of investment and everyday usage of cryptos.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast As DeFi TVL Jumps To $57B, ETH Poised For $4,000 This Week? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price forecast: ETH is nearing its highest level in a little over a week in tandem with a strong crypto rebound from last week\u2019s bottom. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, upholds the bullish outlook closing in on the $65,000 mark.\n\nLeading altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and XRP are also in the green, rewarding patient investors. Nevertheless, market doldrums cannot be ignored, especially in light of the many internal and internal factors in play.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExternally, skyrocketing inflation is a hindrance to risk asset classes like crypto. Recently the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged amid persistent inflation in the US since January.\n\nThe outlook for the first rate cut in the year has shifted as the Fed battles to bring inflation to 2%. Experts project that the first-rate cut may come late in the year as opposed to June.\n\nThe current Ethereum price forecast shows the leading smart contracts token hovering at $3,122 on Monday, down a modest 0.5% in 24 hours. Ranking #2 in the market, Ether boasts $374 billion \u2014 a value backed by $10 billion of trading volume.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Does DeFi TVL Impact ETH Technical Outlook?\n\nAccording to data processed and graphically presented by DeFi Llama, the cumulative value of all the assets locked in smart contracts within the ecosystem is back on the move, rising to $57 billion. Although this figure is a pale shadow of the $109 billion record high, persistent increases reduce potential selling pressure.\n\nInvestors show confidence in the long-term value of a coin by staking their holdings to grow their wallets. Staking rewards are distributed daily on an annualized basis, allowing the community to participate in processing transactions and securing the network.\n\nA high total value locked (TVL) reduces the circulating supply and subsequently, the potential selling pressure. Sentiment also improves encouraging more people to buy ETH, thus propping the token for gains.\n\nCan Ethereum Rally To $4,000 In May\n\nInvestors are holding firmly to their positions as the crypto market rebounds in May. April broke several months of a bullish streak ignited in Q4 last year. With major cryptocurrencies waking up strongly this week, aiming for higher levels this week and a rally to $4,000 before the end of May.\n\nThe bullish bet on Ethereum price hinges on the falling wedge seen on the daily chart. Although a bullish pattern, it remains unconfirmed until the price breaks above the upper trendline.\n\nTraders activate their buy orders following this breakout and anticipate a move equal to the distance between the widest points of the wedge \u2014 roughly 25%.\n\nOn the sell side, traders cannot ignore the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46. A careful examination reveals the indicator stuck below the trend line resistance. Should this trend continue, selling pressure will be a ticking bomb.\n\nEthereum price also sits below two bull market indicators; the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA. Bulls must reclaim these two key levels to validate their strong grip on the uptrend.\n\nOtherwise, there\u2019s a glaring possibility of another sweep at the $3,000 and $2,800 support areas to collect more liquidity.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Bitcoin price must break through either $70,000 or $50,000 to decide next stable directional bias on weekly time frame.\n\nEthereum price action offers bullish reversal play in the cards for 25% upside potential.\n\nRipple price could climb 8% to $0.60 as XRP bulls sustain higher lows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains devoid of a directional bias on the higher time frames. In the lower time frames, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the one-day timeframe shows both bulls and bears have folded their hands. This has altcoins in a state of confusion or disarray.\n\nAlso Read: Addressing the crypto investor dilemma: To invest or not?\n\nCryptocurrency prices FAQs How do new token launches or listings affect cryptocurrency prices? Token launches like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB airdrop and Optimism OP influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset\u2019s network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. How do hacks affect cryptocurrency prices? A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. How do macroeconomic releases and events affect cryptocurrency prices? Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates influence risk assets like Bitcoin, mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher. How do major crypto upgrades like halvings, hard forks affect cryptocurrency prices? Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset\u2019s price climbs. This has been observed in Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nBitcoin price needs a stable directional bias\n\nBitcoin price remains range-bound between $60,660 and $70,000. It is trading horizontally and without directional bias. Based on the volume profiles, both bulls and bears are playing it safe, seeing as there are no spikes within the vicinity of the current price.\n\nHowever, with the RSI above the mean level of 50 and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in positive territory, the odds lean in favor of the upside. To confirm this directional bias, however, the bulls must haul BTC to close decisively above $70,000 on the weekly chart.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if bears take over the market amid falling momentum shown by the nose-diving RSI, Bitcoin price could drop below $60,660. In a dire case, the dump could send BTC to the $50,000 threshold, below which the bullish bias would be invalidated.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price consolidates as buyer momentum flatlines, but MicroStrategy tops BTC ownership list\n\nEthereum price has 25% upside potential up its sleeve\n\nEthereum price could make a 25% run north if the descending wedge pattern, a bullish reversal technical formation, is activated. For this to happen, either of two scenarios must take place. First, Bitcoin price must give a clear directional bias that bodes well for altcoins, or secondly, altcoins must suck liquidity from Bitcoin price to initiate an alt season.\n\nA 25% climb above the breakout point for Ethereum price will send ETH to $4,250. For this to happen, however, ETH bulls must clear the resistance order block due to the volume spikes near $3,500 where a lot of bearish activity is waiting to descend on ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could send Ethereum price below the $2,900 support. In a dire case where ETH records a lower low below $2,800, the bullish thesis would be negated.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum could see a brief rally despite Michael Saylor's jab at ETH ETFs\n\nRipple price eyes $0.60\n\nRipple price recorded an intraday high of $0.5703 on Monday with the potential for more gains as XRP bulls continue to show strength. If bulls manage a stable move above the peak of the market range at $0.5715, it would clear the path for a continuation of the uptrend above the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of the larger market range at $0.5847. This could set the tone for Ripple price to test the $0.6000 psychological level, nearly 10% above current levels.\n\nThe RSI continues to record higher lowers, signifying growing bullish strength. A stable move and close above the 50 mean level would confirm the continuation of the uptrend.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if bears take over and profit-booking takes form, the Ripple price could extend its fall. A candlestick close below $0.4952 would encourage more sell orders. For the bullish thesis to be invalidated, however, the price must close below $0.4500 on the one-day time frame.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple lawsuit to see SEC response on Monday, XRP nears 4.5 million mark in liquidity pools"

        "content": "Marius Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum (ETH) developer, has just implemented a revolutionary feature into his cryptocurrency management system. Sina Mahmoodi designed the live tracer to trace real-time balance modifications in Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens across multiple addresses. Moreover, this solution grants users an opportunity to download full CSV reports for each address, thus making it a powerful tool for tracking asset movements.\n\nThis feature is an important improvement in cryptocurrency tracking. It promotes openness and offers crucial information that can be a reference point for users to make good financial decisions. The platform\u2019s capability to provide such detailed information on asset movements is a testimony to Van Der Wijden\u2019s innovation and customer-centered solutions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Electra Hard Fork on the Horizon\n\nA recent development within the Ethereum community is that the developers are making great progress on the next consensus layer-focused hard fork, Electra. According to Coingape, the Electra specifications, which would include four essential Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), are expected to be prepared for a testnet launch by the end of April. Among these, EIP 6110 is of special significance since it is intended to improve the security and stability of the Ethereum network by altering the way in which validator deposits are handled.\n\nFurthermore, another change will be in the engine API, which will be introduced via EIP7002 based on triggerable exits at the execution layer, with additional minor adjustments currently being discussed. One more important proposal, EIP 7251, suggests raising the maximum effective balance of validators to 2048 ETH. Developers are discussing this feature, and it is not clear whether custom ceilings for partial withdrawals are necessary for validators with a balance of over 32 ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Confounds Traders\n\nIn the last 24-hours, volatility was seen in the Ethereum market. The cryptocurrency started trading at about 3,138, reached its peak in the middle of the day, and dropped to nearly 3,078 at the end. This market behavior in the second half of the day points to the bearish posture of Ethereum, which is an indicator of the sentiment of investors and the general market.\n\nThis trading conduct affirms that cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Predicting price movements for investors and traders remains challenging, and it touches on factors such as market sentiment, the global economic situation, and technological progress within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nRead Also: Crypto Regulation: CFTC Chair Predicts More Crackdowns In 6-24 Months\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "title": "Solana NFTs revive, beat Polygon: What about Ethereum NFTs? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "In the last 24 hours, SOL\u2019s NFT sales exceeded $3 million\n\nEthereum continued to dominate Solana and Polygon in the NFT ecosystem\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed some traction in its NFT ecosystem last week as a few popular collections migrated back to SOL.\n\nDoes this mean that Solana\u2019s NFT ecosystem is poised to witness further growth in the coming weeks?\n\nSolana outperforms Polygon\n\nThe NFT ecosystem boomed last week as sales across multiple chains increased. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at NonFungible\u2019s data revealed that the total number of NFT sales last week increased.\n\nThe total number of unique sellers also went up during the same time.\n\nWhile the market grew, Solana onboarded popular NFT collections like y00ts and DeGod, which had migrated to other chains earlier.\n\nTo be precise, y00ts returned from Polygon [MATIC], while DeDod left Ethereum [ETH]. The inclusion of such top collections helped SOL\u2019s NFT space.\n\nAs per a tweet from SolanaFloor, SOL\u2019s NFT sales reached $25 million in the last seven days. The number was commendable, as Polygon\u2019s weekly NFT sales stood at a mere $8 million.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum remained the top player, as its weekly sales volume was $48 million, as per Cryptoslam.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed the top-performing collections on Solana. Both y00ts and DeGods made it to the top 5, along with Mad Lads, Frogana, and SMB Gen 2.\n\nIs Solana still ahead of Polygon?\n\nTo see whether Solana continued to dominate Polygon, AMBCrypto checked their last 24 hours\u2019 performances. As per our analysis, Solana continued to outperform Polygon.\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s 24-hour sales volume stood at just over $1 million, SOL\u2019s number touched $3 million.\n\nHowever, it was interesting to note that despite high sales volume, SOL\u2019s total transactions dipped by more than 10% while Polygon increased by 17%.\n\nNonetheless, they were both still considerably behind Ethereum. The king of altcoins\u2019 24-hour sales volume exceeded $6 million, which was a 17% increase from the previous day.\n\nEthereum\u2019s total number of buyers, sellers, and transactions all increased by 9.8%, 8.9%, and 12%, respectively, in the past 24 hours.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nSOL turned bullish\n\nWhile the blockchain\u2019s NFT space flourished, its native token\u2019s price action also turned bullish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL\u2019s price increased by more than 14% in the last seven days.\n\nIn fact, in the last 24 hours alone, it surged by 6%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $155.92 with a market capitalization of over $69.7 billion, making it the fifth-largest crypto."

        "content": "Metrics suggested that Ethereum was undervalued.\n\nMarket indicators gave ambiguous signals regarding an upcoming bull rally.\n\nEthereum [ETH] came back on track on the 6th of May as its price once again crossed $3.1k. While the token crossed the psychological resistance, it also consolidated inside a bull pattern.\n\nA breakout above the pattern could allow ETH to reach new highs in the coming weeks.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nLast week was not in investors\u2019 best interest as the king of altcoins\u2019 price plummeted to $2.8k. However, the token gained bullish momentum on the 1st of May as its price moved up steadily.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price increased by over 1.55% in the last 24 hours. At press time, it was trading at $3,144.11 with a market capitalization of over $377 billion.\n\nIn the meantime, World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a falling edge pattern on ETH\u2019s chart.\n\nThe token started to consolidate inside the pattern since the beginning of March. As per the tweet, the correction phase for ETH was over as it was headed towards the upper trendline of the falling wedge.\n\nA successful breakout from the falling wedge pattern could lead to a 45%-50% price rise in the coming weeks. Predicting Ethereum\u2019s price, it might as well surpass its March high if a bull rally happens.\n\nIs Ethereum ready for a rally?\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics to see whether they supported the possibility of a breakout.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a downtick after a sharp increase. A drop in the metric means that an asset is undervalued.\n\nOur analysis of Santiment\u2019s data pointed out a few other bullish metrics. For instance, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio improved over the last week. Its Network Growth was also high.\n\nThis meant that more new addresses were created to transfer the token, reflecting high activity.\n\nHowever, Lookonchain\u2019s latest tweet pointed towards a sell-off. As per the tweet, a whale sold 7k ETH, which, at press time, was worth over $22 million, according to AMBCrypto Converter.\n\nThis seemed bearish, as it hinted that the whale was expecting a price drop.\n\nTo better understand whether a breakout above the falling wedge pattern was possible, AMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAs per our analysis, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and had a value of 49.7, suggesting that the chances of an upward price movement were high.\n\nNonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) supported the bears as it was resting below the neutral mark of 50."

        "title": "Just In: SEC Delays Decision on Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF to July - CoinGape",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again announced that its decision-making process for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF will be further delayed. The SEC is now planning to issue its decisions by July 5, 2024. Such an extension allows the regulatory body to make the required investigations in detail and adequately solve the questioned areas. This move, however, is a continuation of the recent pattern of postponement of the decision-making on spot Ethereum ETF applications from leading financial companies.\n\nSEC Extends Review of Invesco Ethereum ETF\n\nThe latest filing by the SEC stated the necessity of more time to analyze the rule change proposal by the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF properly. The SEC is thus attempting to ensure a thorough review of the many intricacies involved in the offered approval. This action is taken against the background of a series of delays that have been bothering many other companies that seek similar approvals, like Grayscale and BlackRock.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC\u2019s tread-softly strategy mirrors the general regulatory ambiguity of cryptocurrency products. Though Ethereum Trust of Grayscale is already registered, complications persist, as revealed earlier this year by the SEC\u2019s request for additional public commentary. This repetition of delays highlights the balancing act that financial regulators face as they try to strike a balance between regulation and the increasing interest in cryptocurrency investment products.\n\nDoubts Grow Over Ethereum ETF Approvals\n\nThe continued delays have, however, significantly dimmed hope within the investment community that Ethereum-based ETFs are about to become a reality. Some of the key market analysts, including Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg, have made substantial changes to their forecasts, and now the probability of approval by the end of May has fallen from 70% to only 25%. This change in mood is reflected by the broader market, which remains hungry for such inventive financial products while being somewhat restrained by regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAdditional doubt from financial analysts such as Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has further clouded the current situation. Their views, resonating with a large segment of the crypto investment community, imply a cautious regulatory posture regarding the approval of Ethereum ETFs in the short run. This prudential view emphasizes the regulatory barriers that still need to be overcome in the market for securities based on cryptocurrency.\n\nThe repetitiveness of SEC delays affects Invesco Galaxy and creates an example for other firms waiting for approvals of their ETFs. With VanEck and Ark Invest decisions due later this month, all eyes are on the first clue of any change in the SEC\u2019s approach. The continued postponements pose the question of what the future panorama of cryptographic investment products will be like and the probability that the market will widely accept digital asset ETFs.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Client Geth Releases Advanced Live Tracer Tool\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Tue 07 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C. \u25aa\n\nThe modular Layer 1.5 \u201cghost layer\u201d is intended for both institutional and retail use cases and is constructed to give public blockchains compliant privacy.\n\nIn order to allow users to store their assets privately and facilitate omnidirectional value transfer, the ghost layer makes use of a zk-based system and 0VM. Additionally, it enables users to create private access channels into various blockchain-operating execution layers to employ pre-existing apps.\n\nNovachrono, the founder of Silent Research Labs, said in a tweet that,\u201d if you create a system where the processing of the state(computation) and storing of the data depends on its own nodes you can call that a Layer 1; but if you create a system whose state is processed by itself but the validity of the data is stored elsewhere, it becomes a layer 2;\u2014 however if you create a ledger whose state is decided by the base ledger but the computation is stored elsewhere- you can call it a Layer 1.5\u201d.\n\nThe concept of privacy has been ingrained in cryptocurrency since its inception, and the industry as a whole has been searching for a highly effective, modular, and fully compliant privacy system; nevertheless, most architectures and system designs are unable to satisfy practical requirements and use cases.\n\nIn 2023, Silent Protocol unveiled EZEE as a solution to the issue of state denial, also known as the lack of a \u201cglobal shared state,\u201d and to provide a fully detachable architecture for functional privacy.\n\nDevelopers are unable to create an ecosystem of applications around a framework without composability, which results in isolated systems. To prevent malicious users from abusing the system, Silent Protocol also developed silent compliance VM, a decentralized selective revealing protocol.\n\nThe silent compliance virtual machine powers the ghost layer, which is an implementation of the EZEE architecture designed for the Ethereum environment.\n\n\u201cThe ghost layer is rooted out of Ethereum supporting Ethereum assets, but achieves modularity not because it captures value vertically but enables horizontal composability on different chains,\u201d said Silent cofounder Isa Sertkaya.\n\nIn order to update the system\u2019s state forward, Silent Protocol also uses 0VM. However, instead of utilizing 0VM to verify the update, it uses the base ledger and zksnarks to validate the state.\n\nThe goal of Silent protocol is to create a compliant, modular framework that will enable institutions to use Ethereum in a secure, confidential manner, just like they do now.\n\nWith the same liquidity available on the mainnet, developers of various blockchains can convert their current applications into 0dapps, or privacy-preserving apps.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Want to strategize how to invest in crypto? Go whale watching! By emulating the crypto whales, one stands a better chance at investment success than most. With the BNB ATH within reach, whales are feasting \u2013 but not just on BNB. Ethereum is seeing a ton of crypto whale activity and more. The new meme-fi AI token Raboo is seeing a crypto whale feeding frenzy on its presale as tokens are gobbled up at $0.0042.\n\nBNB (BNB): BNB ATH comes closer \u2013 when will it reach $700?\n\nSo far, yet so close. The BNB ATH (all-time high) was $686.31 in May 2021. Currently, BNB is trading a mere 14% below that. BNB briefly broke $600 in March but remains stubbornly in the high 500s. That extra 15% push it needs to get to BNB ATH seems just out of reach. Or is it?\n\nApril was a horrible month on the market, and crypto whales saw the prices plummet before swooping in and taking advantage of the market correction. But \u2018when in doubt zoom out\u2019, and BNB climbed 96% in the last three months. Suddenly, the BNB ATH doesn\u2019t look that far off and may even break the mythical $700 mark within the next month.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Crypto Whales Lifting Ethereum Tide\n\nEthereum is the 2nd-ranked token for a reason, but Ethereum has its challenges. It is slow and expensive to operate. The result of this is that Ethereum does not respond as fast to market forces as the rest of the cryptosphere, and while other coins are threatening to reach their ATHs, Ethereum is struggling to make it back to $4k, a spot it briefly held in the second week of March before April left a bloodbath.\n\nBut Ethereum seems to have found support at $3,064. With 24-hour volumes reaching $11 billion, Ethereum is creeping upward as crypto whales return to the largest layer 1 solution in the cryptosphere.\n\nRaboo (RABT): Crypto Whale Presale Feast\n\nIt happens daily: a new coin nobody has heard of is on the market and showing a massive growth of several thousand percent, only for investors to wonder where this new coin came from. The crypto whale investing secret: ICOs & presales. The true crypto whale not only hunts on the open markets and exchanges but also searches for ICOS, where tokens are available at a set price. These tokens then explode, and massive returns are made. This is why the crypto whales flock to Raboo.\n\nRaboo is a new meme coin luring all the crypto whales with its combination of solid financial foundations and internet-culture allure. But with an AI-driven turbo engine. Raboo has already collected over $1 million in presale liquidity, and looking at its tokenomics, it\u2019s easy to see why this is such a lucrative investment opportunity.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCrypto whales are acquiring tokens right now, as they know the market can only go up from here, driving up prices in Ethereum and may even set up a BNB ATH. However, the wise ones are now participating in the Raboo presale, waiting for the massive returns when Raboo (RABT) brings a 100x return when it lists on the markets.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here."

        "title": "Crypto Synthetic Assets Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Traditional vs. Crypto Synthetic Assets\n\nTraditional assets are tangible or monetary items traded on established financial markets, such as equities, bonds, and commodities. Crypto synthetic assets, on the other hand, are digital representations based on blockchain technology that are designed to mimic the value and performance of conventional assets.\n\nTraditional assets are tangible or paper-based, whereas crypto synthetic assets exist solely in digital form on blockchain networks. Despite the fact that crypto synthetics have advantages over traditional assets in terms of accessibility, liquidity, and programmability, they come with their own risks and complexities.\n\nTraditional Assets Crypto Synthetic Assets Nature Physical/Financial Digital Market Accessibility Conventional DeFi Ecosystem Ownership Physical Ownership Digital Ownership Liquidity Limited High Liquidity Programmability Limited Control Smart Contract Flexibility Regulatory Oversight Stringent Evolving Regulation Custodial Requirements Often Required Variable Counterparty Risk Centralized Decentralized Transparency Varies On-Chain Transparency Asset Variety Limited Range Wide Range of Assets Accessibility To All Limited Access Global Access\n\nTypes of Crypto Synthetic Assets\n\nCrypto synthetic assets appear in various forms, like synthetic stablecoins, tokenized commodities and equities, leveraged and inverse tokens, and yield-bearing synthetic assets.\n\nSynthetic stablecoins\n\nSynthetic stablecoins are digital tokens designed to replicate the value and stability of fiat currencies, such as the United States dollar or the euro. They provide a method for exchanging products and services and storing value in the cryptocurrency ecosystem without being subject to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Developed on the Synthetix platform, sUSD is an example of a synthetic stablecoin. It seeks to provide users with access to a stable digital currency whose value corresponds to that of the U.S. dollar.\n\nTokenized commodities and equities\n\nOn blockchain networks, tokenized commodities and equities serve as digital representations of physical assets such as gold, oil, stocks, and other commodities. These synthetic assets enable the fractional ownership and exchange of conventional assets in a decentralised manner. sOIL, which is also developed on the Synthetix platform, is an example of a synthetic asset that monitors crude oil prices. Without actually possessing any oil, investors can become more exposed to price fluctuations.\n\nLeveraged and inverse tokens\n\nSynthetic assets, known as leveraged and inverse tokens, are developed to amplify or counteract the price changes of an underlying asset \u2014 inverse tokens profit when the underlying asset\u2019s price decreases, while leveraged tokens magnify profits and losses. For example, BTC3L (Binance Leveraged Tokens) aims to generate daily returns that are three times greater than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price. If Bitcoin increases by 1%, BTC3L should increase by 3%.\n\nYield-bearing synthetic assets\n\nWithin the DeFi ecosystem, yield-bearing synthetic assets offer holders the opportunity to generate passive income through staking or lending. cDAI, created by the Compound protocol, is an example of a synthetic asset. Dai (DAI) stablecoins can be used to participate in lending operations and collect interest on the Compound platform. Since cDAI accrues interest to holders over time, it qualifies as a yield-bearing synthetic asset.\n\nApplications of Crypto Synthetic Assets\n\nTraders pursuing increased profits, investors diversifying their holdings, and DeFi enthusiasts engaged in yield farming can utilise crypto synthetic assets.\n\nTrading and investing opportunities\n\nCrypto synthetic assets provide access to numerous trading and investment opportunities. They permit traders to engage in leveraged trading, thereby increasing their exposure to market fluctuations and potentially generating greater returns (or losses) than they could with conventional trading. Moreover, synthetic assets encompass a vast array of underlying assets within the crypto ecosystem, such as stocks and commodities, thereby providing investors with a simple method to diversify their portfolios.\n\nYield farming and liquidity provision\n\nUsers who stake cryptographic synthetic assets in DeFi protocols can engage in yield farming, earning additional synthetic assets or governance tokens for actively participating in liquidity provision and DeFi operations. Additionally, synthetic assets considerably increase liquidity pools and the overall liquidity of DeFi platforms, which is crucial for facilitating trading, lending, and borrowing within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nRisk management and hedging strategies\n\nSynthetic assets provide effective risk management and hedging instruments. Traders and investors may employ inverse synthetic assets as effective hedges to safeguard their portfolios against declines in the underlying assets. Additionally, synthetic stablecoins offer a decentralised alternative to conventional stablecoins, safeguarding the value of assets against the inherent volatility of the market.\n\nRole of DeFi in the Creation and Trading of Synthetic Assets\n\nDeFi democratises finance by upending established financial systems and increasing global financial inclusion by enabling users to create, trade, and diversify their portfolios with synthetic assets.\n\nThe creation and trading of synthetic assets are crucial to the transformation of the conventional financial environment, and DeFi is a key participant in this process. DeFi platforms revolutionise the way we interact with financial instruments by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate the issuance, creation, and trading of synthetic assets.\n\nDeFi improves accessibility and productivity by eliminating the need for intermediaries. By collateralizing cryptocurrencies, users can issue tokens that represent the value of real-world assets such as stocks, commodities, and fiat currencies.\n\nSecond, the open and permissionless design of DeFi encourages innovation by allowing programmers to experiment with various synthetic asset designs and trading strategies. This innovation has democratised access to international markets by giving consumers access to a vast array of assets around the clock.\n\nDeFi platforms provide liquidity pools where users can trade synthetic assets without difficulty. These systems encourage yield cultivation by rewarding users for monetary donations and ecosystem participation.\n\nAdvantages of Crypto Synthetic Assets\n\nCrypto synthetic assets offer a plethora of benefits, including diversification, leverage, engagement with DeFi, liquidity enhancement, and risk mitigation.\n\nCryptographic synthetic assets offer numerous advantages to the digital finance sector. The ability to provide access to a variety of assets, including traditional stocks, commodities, and currencies, is the most significant of these benefits because it enables users to seamlessly diversify their portfolios within the cryptocurrency space, thereby reducing risk and enhancing investment strategies.\n\nThese assets also provide access to leverage, enabling traders to increase their exposure to asset price volatility and potentially generate greater returns. They play a crucial role in DeFi, allowing users to actively participate in yield farming and liquidity provision and receive rewards for their efforts.\n\nIn addition, synthetic assets serve as the basis for liquidity pools, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity of DeFi platforms \u2014 a crucial element for facilitating efficient trading and lending activities. These resources also serve as indispensable risk management tools, equipping consumers with the knowledge they need to safeguard their investments against unpredictable price fluctuations.\n\nChallenges and Risks Concerned With Synthetic Assets\n\nWhile synthetic assets offer novel opportunities and solutions, they are not devoid of challenges and dangers, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidity issues, the unpredictability of regulations, and oracle-related issues.\n\nThe use of synthetic assets in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries involves a number of hazards and concerns that must be carefully considered. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits, which could result in significant losses. In the infamous DAO attack of 2016, for instance, a smart contract vulnerability led to the seizure of approximately $50 million worth of Ether (ETH), highlighting the risks associated with these complex financial instruments.\n\nAnother concern is market liquidity, as some synthetic assets may have less liquidity than their real-world counterparts. This could lead to price manipulation or slippage during trading, threatening the market\u2019s overall stability.\n\nIn addition, regulatory supervision remains a major concern as governments around the world struggle to define and regulate these unique financial products. The continuing legal disputes and regulatory changes involving stablecoins like Tether (USDT) provide an example of the possible legal difficulties that synthetic assets may encounter.\n\nIn conclusion, an excessive reliance on oracle systems, which grant smart contracts access to real-world data, poses security risks. For example, if an oracle is compromised, it may provide erroneous information, which can affect the utility and value of artificial assets that rely on it."

        "title": "Solana Price Jumps Nearly 5% as Bitcoin, Ethereum Lag Behind - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt's been a quiet Monday morning so far near the top of the cryptocurrency charts, as most of the biggest coins by market cap are trading either sideways or slightly down. Solana is the notable exception, rising nearly 5% over the past day.\n\nSolana is currently trading at $154, pushing its weeklong gain to over 12% per data from CoinGecko. Like many cryptocurrencies, Solana has had a rough month, swinging from a high of $184 to a low of nearly $120 during that span. But it's been ticking back up over the last week as gains outpace those of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThat's true over the last 24 hours as well, with Bitcoin sitting at a price of $63,650, down over 1%, while Ethereum is down over 2% to $3,092 as of this writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin is up by 1.3% while Ethereum remains down by 2.6%.\n\nExpanding out to the top 100 coins by market cap, a couple of the biggest gainers are also deployed on Solana. JUP, the token of decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter, is up 6% today to a current price of $1.14, while meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) is up nearly 5% to $3.43.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana's recent revival also comes as the network sees a surge in new tokens deployed via the network's SPL standard. On Saturday, 14,648 new tokens were deployed on Solana via data from Solscan, setting a new all-time record, and every day over the last two weeks has yielded at least 10,000 new tokens on the network."
