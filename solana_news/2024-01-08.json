        "title": "Ethereum-Bitcoin ratio drops to historic low as ETF approval speculation heightens - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s value against Bitcoin has dropped to historical lows as market anticipation grows for an imminent launch of a spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nData from Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko showed that the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily declined since the smart-contract-enabled blockchain transitioned into a proof-of-stake network in September 2022. During the last 24 hours, the metric dropped to 0.048, its lowest point since May 2021.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial measure for gauging Ethereum\u2019s performance in relation to Bitcoin. When this ratio rises, Ethereum gains strength or maintains its value better than Bitcoin, suggesting a market preference for ETH over BTC.\n\nConversely, a decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to Bitcoin, potentially signaling investor leanings toward the perceived safety of Bitcoin.\n\nThis ratio goes beyond mere price movements as it encapsulates shifts in investor confidence and market sentiment between these two prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data shows that BTC\u2019s price has greatly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s over the past year. During the period, the top cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose by more than 170% to a 21-month high of more than $47,000, while ETH was able to post a modest gain of 74%.\n\nBTC\u2019s positive run could be attributed to the surrounding market optimism and demands for the potential approval of a spot ETF. Over the past several months, several asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, and others, have actively engaged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the applications, fueling speculations that these products could begin trading as early as Jan. 11.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s lukewarm price performance came amid the launch of several futures-based ETFs for the digital asset last year. These ETFs barely made a ripple in the market as they saw tepid demand, forcing asset manager CoinShares to describe ETH as the \u201cleast loved altcoin\u201d compared to rivals like Solana.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC could approve the world's first spot Bitcoin ETF later this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 0.01%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA -1.31%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Shares 4 Financial Tips - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin offers four financial tips to help new and seasoned investors mitigate risks amid massive volatility in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum boss shared the tips after famous blogger Alexander Voigt highlighted how diversification strategy helped Microsoft founder Bill Gate to build his net worth.\n\nHow Microsoft Founder Boosts Portfolio Using Diversification Strategy\n\nVoigt noted that when Gates became friends with prominent American businessman Warren Buffett, he sold most of his Microsoft shares. According to Voigt, the move helped Gates to diversify his portfolio and acquire other stocks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result of the decision, the Microsoft founder built his fortune to $138 billion. Voigt emphasized that Gates would have been worth only $1.33 billion if he did not diversify his portfolio.\n\nEthereum Founder Reacts, Offers 4 Financial Tips\n\nReacting, Buterin characterized Voigt\u2019s financial tip as awful. However, he offered four tips, which he described as \u201cactual financial advice.\u201d\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum founder first recognized the importance of diversification. Diversifying one\u2019s portfolio cannot be overemphasized, as it helps mitigate risks. Spreading your investment across various assets would ensure that the negative performance of one asset does not entirely affect your portfolio.\n\nSecondly, Buterin pointed out the importance of saving. He recommended that people should accumulate sufficient funds to the point where they can cover multiple years of expenses. It bears mentioning that there is no guarantee in investing, given the recent economic downturn that has wreaked havoc on most financial markets. Hence, saving more could help shield one from the problems associated with investing.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor the third point, Buterin encouraged investors to be boring with most of their portfolios. The concept of being boring with one\u2019s portfolio suggests that people should opt for low-cost and low-risk assets. Here, Buterin recommends that people be prudent with investing instead of committing their funds to high-risk assets.\n\nLastly, the Ethereum founder warned against using high leverage when investing in the futures markets. Specifically, he cautioned against using over 2X leverage. This advice is necessary, especially in crypto trading, where volatility is rife. Recall that following a 7% dip in Bitcoin price last week, over $655 million worth of long positions were liquidated. The majority of long traders who got liquidated were mainly those who used high leverages.\n\nButerin\u2019s financial tips are suitable for both new and seasoned crypto investors. They serve as a reminder, urging people to be prudent as they seek to bolster their portfolio."

        "content": "Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory for the past few months. The cryptocurrency value has soared from under $2,000 to $2,400, indicating a positive trend. However, the current market displays mixed sentiments about its future direction. The digital currency has been fluctuating within a defined range, showing signs of both strength and uncertainty.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price value has impressively hit $2,270, marking a 0.78% increase in just 24 hours. This rise suggests a positive market mood. The trading volume, according to data by CoinMarketCap, has also seen an 84% jump in the same period, reaching $509 million. With a market capitalization of $10 billion, Ethereum ranks second among cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum faces a consolidation phase, especially under the $2,400 mark. The leading smart contracts token has been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400 in the past week, with bears and bulls struggling. In the past year, Ether experienced a significant increase of over 79%, demonstrating resilience and optimism as bullish sentiment prevails despite occasional minor dips.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Investment Tips for Ethereum Enthusiasts\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared some investment wisdom. This came after a noted blogger, Alexander Voigt, discussed how diversification aided Bill Gates in wealth accumulation. Buterin, however, termed Voigt\u2019s advice as subpar and offered his own financial guidelines.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s tips are simple yet profound. He emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that a varied portfolio can reduce risk. He advises investors to save enough to cover multiple years of expenses, stressing the value of financial safety and freedom. Buterin also recommends keeping the bulk of one\u2019s portfolio in stable investments and strongly advises against using more than 2x leverage.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly relevant for both new and seasoned investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Adhering to such prudent strategies could potentially pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s price to surge past the $3,000 mark. If the bullish trend persists, this milestone could soon be within reach.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Supporting a Bullish Outlook\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price movement adds another layer of optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around the 50 mark, suggesting a balance in market momentum. On a 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased since breaking above the 200-day moving average and exiting a major descending channel. This bullish trend is visually evident through the formation of three four-hour green candlesticks.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has overtaken the signal line, indicating a positive market outlook. The rising histogram supports this bullish sentiment. The 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on an upward curve, and the 50-day MA crossing over the 200-day MA reaffirms the bullish market sentiment. The Chaikin money flow indicator is also in the positive region at 0.04, indicating a bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Riding the Shift from Ethereum to Solana in the NFT World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of NFTs, artists are often confronted with the challenge of finding the right platform to showcase their work. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a dominant force in the NFT space, recent trends indicate a shift in energy and excitement towards alternative blockchains like Solana. This shift underscores a crucial message for artists: adaptability is key, and venturing into new territories can be a game-changer.\n\nThe Rise of Solana: A Beacon for NFT Artists\n\nThe past few months have seen a substantial increase in collector activity on platforms like @exchgART, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. This uptick is more than just a fleeting trend; it represents a significant movement of collectors exploring alternatives to Ethereum. Solana\u2019s appeal lies in its cost-effectiveness and faster transaction times, making it an attractive option for both artists and collectors. As the NFT landscape evolves, Solana is quickly becoming a hub of innovation and engagement.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Challenges: A Call for Diversification\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s pioneering role in the NFT space, it faces challenges that can be daunting for emerging artists. High gas fees and a highly competitive environment, coupled with a currently lower collector base, make it difficult for new entrants to gain traction. This situation necessitates a strategic pivot, encouraging artists to explore other blockchain ecosystems where opportunities are burgeoning.\n\nEmbracing Change: The Importance of Exploring New Frontiers\n\nThe key takeaway for artists is clear: to stay relevant and successful in the NFT market, one must go where the people \u2013 and in this case, the collectors \u2013 are heading. Solana, with its growing collector base and artist-friendly environment, presents a compelling alternative. But the exploration shouldn\u2019t stop there. The NFT world is vast, with numerous other blockchains offering unique opportunities. Artists must remain agile, continually seeking new ideas, wallets, chains, and communities to engage with.\n\nTLDR: As the NFT landscape shifts, with excitement and energy moving from Ethereum to Solana, artists must embrace this change to thrive. Exploring Solana and other blockchains is not just an option but a necessity for artists seeking growth and engagement in the evolving NFT market."

Transactions on the Limit Order Protocol (LOP) and 1inch Fusion increased in the quarter, while transactions in the Aggregation Protocol fell.\n\nFusion transactions rose by 66% in the fourth quarter , a strong rebound after falling 29% in the previous quarter.\n\n, a strong rebound after falling 29% in the previous quarter. The amount of 1INCH staked increased, as the DAO worked to configure the resolver competition to improve token accrual through a fair and competitive market.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\nThe 1inch Network (1INCH) is an all-in-one decentralized finance (DeFi) service provider operating on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, zkSync Era, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Gnosis, Fantom, Klaytn, and Aurora. Launched in 2019, 1inch Aggregation Protocol (AP) allows users to route trades across various markets and realize the best available rate compared to any individual decentralized exchange (DEX). In late 2020, the 1inch Liquidity Protocol introduced a native automated market maker (AMM) to the network, which enabled users to provide liquidity and earn passive liquidity mining rewards.\n\nThe network\u2019s third product, the 1inch Limit Order Protocol (LOP), was introduced in June 2021 to support conditional limit and stop-loss orders with no fees. In late December 2022, the 1inch Swap Engine enabled Fusion mode, which is partially based on the existing tech, including the 1inch Limit Order Protocol and the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. This new feature empowers DeFi users to place orders with a specified price and time range without paying network fees. All three protocols, and Fusion mode, are governed by the 1inch DAO using the network\u2019s native 1INCH token.\n\nNote: This report includes data from Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Gnosis Chain, Fantom, and Base. Data from zkSync, Klaytn, and Aurora are currently not included. We are working to improve access to this data.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Telegram\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nProtocol Usage\n\nAs the leading DEX aggregator, 1inch has benefited from increased trading activity in the space. Beneath the surface, the newer protocols and products from 1inch led the volume growth. While volumes on the Aggregation Protocol increased 59% from the previous quarter, volume on the limit order protocol (LOP) increased over 90% in Q4. 1inch LOP executed over $6.4 billion of trades for the first time since Q1\u201923. Volume through 1inch Fusion also increased by 88% in the quarter, surpassing $5 billion and showing a growing user preference for the new execution venues.\n\nAggregation Protocol volume growth was broad, with four 1inch EVM deployments doubling their volume or more from Q3 to Q4. Aggregation Protocol volumes on mainnet increased by 45% to roughly $173 million per day. Not including Gnosis and Base, which launched at the end of Q3, Avalanche and Arbitrum volume increased the most, by 176% and 129%, respectively. Arbitrum ended the quarter accounting for 16% of 1inch Aggregation Protocol volume, responsible for $3.8 billion in Q4. In its first full quarter, 1inch\u2019s Base deployment grew volumes to over $220 million in Q4. Fantom was the only chain that saw a fall in volume in the quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average size of a transaction in USD terms grew substantially in Q4, especially for the Aggregation Protocol, as volumes rose while transactions fell nearly 3% QoQ. For the Aggregation Protocol, the fall was largely driven by Polygon, which made up 32% of 1inch transactions in Q3 but only 22% in Q4. While volumes on Fantom fell in the quarter, the number of transactions increased by 31%. The increase surpassed every other 1inch deployment besides BNB Chain and Base, which was only live for part of the third quarter. BNB Chain accounted for the most transactions in the quarter, representing 28% of 1inch transactions or over 22,000 per day. Ethereum transactions increased by 15.5% from 14,000 per day to over 16,000 per day in Q4.\n\nThe Limit Order Protocol saw transactions fall on Gnosis, Optimism, and Fantom, even though transactions rose overall by 44% in the quarter. Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon activity increased dramatically, with daily transactions rising 95%, 82%, and 81%, respectively. Those three EVM deployments made up 70% of 1inch LOP transactions in the fourth quarter, or nearly 8,000 per day.\n\nFusion transactions rose by 68% in the fourth quarter, a strong rebound after falling 29% in the previous quarter. Average trade size rose on all three protocols, increasing by 60% in the Aggregation Protocol, by 35% in the LOP, and by 23% on 1inch Fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion volumes grew 88% in the fourth quarter, and 1inch Labs resolver increased its share to 44% of volume. A new competitor, Rizzolver, began competing at the end of September and grew its market share to 26% in Q4, executing over $1.2 billion of Fusion orders. Rizzolver achieved its growth by offering the most 1INCH rewards to delegates. The top 3 resolvers executed 88% of volume in Q3, but only made up 83% of volume in Q4. However, there were fewer total successfully participating resolvers, with only 7 completing transactions in Q4 versus 12 in Q3.\n\nAs discussed in depth in the Qualitative Analysis section, the DAO is focused on increasing competition for resolvers. This quarter, DAO members voted to set a cap for gas consumption for resolvers, which should enable resolvers to earn more and thus be able to pay more in rewards to stakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Share Analysis\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the share of 1inch trades executed on Uniswap V3 and V2 increased by 8 and 3 percentage points to 40% of trades and 8% of trade volume, respectively. Volume from 1inch on the two Uniswap versions increased from $5.6 billion in Q3 to $10 billion in Q4. The share gains largely came from Curve and Dodo, the second and now sixth most common execution venues. PancakeSwap received over $1 billion of trade volume from 1inch for the second consecutive quarter, or 7% of 1inch volume in Q4.\n\n1inch\u2019s fourth-quarter growth in volume was significantly higher than peers, helping it increase its market share from 59% of trades in Q3\u201923 to 63% in Q4\u201923. The only large competitor to increase share in Q4 was CoW Swap, which commanded 11% of aggregator volume on Ethereum in the quarter. ParaSwap and 0x respectively commanded 11% and 10% of aggregator volume in Q4.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasury and Staking\n\nThe 1inch DAO continued to invest its treasury and diversify its stablecoin holding, swapping 1 million USDC into DAI and depositing to earn interest as sDAI. This is the first allocation following the 1 million USDC deposited in Aave to earn interest in Q2. On the expense side, the DAO spent just over $1 million split between three different transactions. On December 30, the DAO sent $890,000 USDC to fund support services for 1inch Network users (discussed in depth in the Qualitative Analysis section).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of 1INCH staked increased by 7% in the fourth quarter. Staking 1INCH gives Unicorn Power (UP), which can be used to vote in governance and delegate to resolvers. Staking and delegating to resolvers create an important value accrual pathway for the token, as resolvers give 1INCH rewards to attract delegates so the resolver can compete in completing Fusion transactions. The top resolvers are currently offering over 45,000 1INCH to delegates.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nImproving Resolver Competition\n\nOn October 7, 1inch DAO voted to create new rules governing resolvers interacting with 1inch Fusion. In the past, only five resolvers competed to fill orders, which was insensitive to gas costs to win the transaction. As a result, the resolver business turned into a gas war, significantly increasing expenses and thus hurting resolvers\u2019 profitability. If resolvers were more profitable, they would be able to better compensate 1INCH stakers.\n\nThe core of the proposal revolves around the introduction of a smart contract-enforced gas fee limit, aimed at regulating the priority gas fees in the 1inch Fusion mode. This cap is designed to fluctuate based on the block's baseFee:\n\nBaseFee < 10.6 gwei: PriorityFee capped at 70% of the baseFee.\n\nBaseFee 10.6 - 104.1 gwei: PriorityFee capped at 50% of the baseFee.\n\nBaseFee > 104.1 gwei: PriorityFee capped at 65% of the baseFee.\n\nAttempts to circumvent this limit (including direct payments to block builders) will be considered violations.\n\nThe proposal also introduces a stringent penalty system for violators. Using a tiered approach, it ranges from an official warning to a substantial 365-day block from filling orders for repeat offenders.\n\nThe proposal intends to lower the Unicorn Power (UP) requirement for Resolvers from 10% to 5%, in order to democratize access to the Fusion Mode ecosystem. The more lenient entry threshold has already led to more diversity and robustness within the system. From a market perspective, the changes could mean a more competitive environment with more options for stakers and hopefully increased resiliency for traders.\n\nThe rationale behind these proposed changes is grounded in a pragmatic approach to tackling the high operational expenses currently faced by resolvers, primarily due to the inflated gas fees during auctions. Given that this situation often escalated into \u201cresolver gas wars,\u201d it has been a pain point for participants in the 1inch Network, affecting both profitability and trade rates. The proposed solution seems to be a well-considered strategy to address these challenges head-on.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that need to be addressed. For one, this new system might inadvertently penalize resolvers who are more gas-efficient, especially since builders tend to prioritize transactions based on total ETH paid on gas. While the proposal argues that this shouldn't be an issue as builders are incentivized to maximize fee collection, it still requires careful monitoring post-implementation.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposal comprehensively addresses current challenges faced by resolvers in the 1inch network. Its success hinges on competition between resolvers and continuous monitoring to ensure its changes do not lead to unintended consequences. Higher earning resolvers should attract new resolvers, which will need to attract UP by giving rewards to 1INCH stakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for an Improved User Experience\n\nThe 1inch DAO has approved a proposal to fund comprehensive support services aimed at enhancing the 1inch Network ecosystem's growth and user experience. These support services encompass various aspects, including issue management and reporting across multiple communication channels, documentation management, monitoring reviews, special investigation for complex refund cases, and support for the token listing and delisting process. The 12-month subscription fee for these services amounts to $890,000. The primary motivation behind this proposal is to ensure that 1inch Network users receive efficient and responsive technical support, which is crucial for brand credibility, user retention, and network expansion.\n\nAs crypto matures and the initial products grow beyond just finding product-market fit, winning the consumer becomes more important. The support services will enhance the overall experience for 1inch Network users, potentially leading to higher user satisfaction and retention. Effective customer support can establish brand credibility and reputation, contributing to the long-term success and growth of the 1inch Network ecosystem. The proposal covers various aspects of support, including bug-bounty program management and participation in conferences, which can contribute to the continuous improvement of the network.\n\nThe proposal is not without risks, namely an annual subscription fee of $890,000 paid upfront. In addition, the DAO relies on the service provider to meet the specified KPIs, and there is a risk of service quality not meeting expectations, which could harm the network's reputation.\n\nIn sum, the approved proposal seeks to provide valuable support services to the 1inch Network ecosystem, aiming to enhance user satisfaction and brand reputation. 1inch DAO and Network continue to focus on winning the consumer as part of its growth strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe return of the bull market in Q4\u201923 helped the category leader grow, as volumes soared to over $35 billion in the quarter. The work in the bear is helping, as 1inch\u2019s limit order protocol and Fusion product drove transaction usage, while L2 deployments led volume growth. Resolver competition and market design remain in flux, as the DAO tries a new approach by setting a gas limit. The amount of 1INCH staked in the quarter increased, and $1 million from the treasury was newly invested. 1inch grew its dominant market share as the leading DEX aggregator on Ethereum in the quarter.\n\nLet us know what you loved about the report, what may be missing, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form.

        "content": "Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje, known as the godfather of decentralized finance (DeFi), further raised concerns over probabilistic finality in blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market sees expanding use cases and adoption in traditional finance. He said Fantom has already solved state bloat as Ethereum developers look to solve state bloat in the chain.\n\nAndre Cronje Says Fantom Has Resolved S tate Bloat Issue\n\nIn response to Ambient Finance founder Doug Colkitt\u2019s belief that Ethereum is the only chain looking to solve state bloat in its long-term plan, Andre Cronje said \u201cI am pretty confident in saying we already solved state bloat at Fantom.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum roadmap entails using Verkle trees to allow for \u201cdata to be small enough to be attached to every block.\u201d It could help validators and nodes to become stateless as all \u2018state\u2019 can be stored more efficiently off-chain.\n\nHowever, Andre Cronje said any blockchain that uses probabilistic finality or any variant of the longest chain rule won\u2019t resolve this issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum chains depend on probabilistic finality. Finality refers to when a block of transactions is considered permanent and cannot be altered or reversed.\n\nFantom uses aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, which does not require the longest chain rule.\n\nMoreover, Fantom introduced the new database Carmen, a flat storage method that does not use tree or dictionary structures while maintaining a cryptographic signature of the world state. This greatly reduces the bloat of the current active state (two epochs). Carmen supports real-time pruning, and although archive nodes still need to retain all data, most validators can enable pruning.\n\nAfter adopting the above technology, Fantom\u2019s status is reduced from about 2TB (archive) to 60GB (archive). Cronje said state bloat has been one of Fantom\u2019s core milestones since its early days.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock And VanEck Files Updated S-1 For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

        "content": "Wallet drainers have now started targeting Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities to execute phishing scams. Earlier, they focused on conducting crypto scams via EVM chains. However, the trend has changed after they expanded their reach into well-established crypto groups.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Scam: Trading Platform Coinspaid Might be the Latest Victim\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Wallet Drainers\u2019 Airdrop Scam\n\nAccording to a post by Scam Sniffer on X, phishing scams have been initiated by attracting crypto enthusiasts via fake airdrops. They have designed a webpage wherein one can claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThe scammers term the airdrop scam as an \u201cexclusive opportunity\u201d for the community. Moreover, they encourage people to connect their primary wallet to be able to access these airdrops. In addition, Scam Sniffer noted that these fraudsters can drain various types of crypto wallets via this webpage.\n\nThis update is an alarming one considering the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, Solana, and Tron. It could instill crypto investors into believing such wallet drainers in anticipation of high-end crypto rewards. Thereby, millions and billions of digital asset investments could be wiped off owing to such wallet drainer scams.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify such scams via a few checks. The snapshot shared by Scam Sniffer shows that the concerned airdrop scam webpage has grammatical errors, which could be a way to be safe from such fraudsters. But, they can upgrade their strategies from time to time.\n\nHence, it\u2019s always better to check the source of such links. If a trusted entity isn\u2019t posting such airdrop updates, then avoid such offerings completely. Moreover, it\u2019s time to be even more cautious since hackers have been hacking reputed companies\u2019 X (formerly Twitter) accounts to promote crypto scams.\n\nCertik and Mandiant Official X Accounts Get Hacked\n\nEarlier this month, Certik, a blockchain audit firm, witnessed its X account being hacked. Thereafter, malicious links were posted that promised people to return the digital assets they lost to various crypto scams. The dubious link was available on their website for quite sometime before the Certik team managed to regain access.\n\nThe X account of Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, was successfully reclaimed by its rightful owner on January 4, 2024, after falling victim to hacking. The incident unfolded over several hours on X, with users presenting evidence of the account takeover. The attackers, posing as the Phantom, a non-custodial crypto wallet, used the compromised Mandiant X account to promote a cryptocurrency scam.\n\nAlso Read: Just In: Founder of ACE Crypto Exchange Arrested for Fraud\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Top 5 Blockchains for Low-Cost Gaming Development - PlayToEarn",
        "content": "The blockchain gaming sector has seen impressive growth, driven by platforms offering unique benefits such as high transaction speeds, scalability, robust ecosystems, and low gas fees. Let's take a look at 5 leading blockchains that have emerged as frontrunners due to their low transaction costs: Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Immutable X.\n\nSolana's High-Speed, Low-Cost Gaming Landscape\n\nSolana is a standout blockchain, mainly due to its high transaction throughput and low cost. It processes transactions at an impressive speed, handling tens of thousands per second. This is attributed to its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, which significantly reduces processing time.\n\nWith that, Solana's network allows for smooth and delay-free gameplay. The platform is rapidly expanding and hosts various top-tier gaming studios. It's quickly becoming a hub for gaming development, underpinned by its vast developer community and a range of AAA games.\n\nPolygon: Ethereum's Scalable Companion\n\nInitially known as Matic Network, Polygon operates as Ethereum's layer-2 (L2) scaling solution. It's renowned for offering enhanced transaction speeds and lower costs than Ethereum's mainnet. Polygon's architecture, which by theory, supports up to 75,000 transactions per second (TPS), is a testament to its scalability and performance.\n\nPolygon features a multi-layered design that separates validation and execution processes. Its EVM compatibility also allows developers to harness Ethereum's infrastructure while benefiting from Polygon's superior performance. This has made it a popular choice among game devs in the Web3 space.\n\nAvalanche: A Rising Force in Web3 Gaming\n\nAvalanche sets itself apart with its high-performance capabilities, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. Its unique consensus mechanism contributes to rapid transaction finality and minimal fees.\n\nWhile Avalanche's gaming ecosystem is still in the early stages, it's gaining momentum among developers for its efficient transaction handling and smart contract support. It represents a growing force in the gaming sector, offering a viable platform for game devs looking for speed and cost-effectiveness.\n\nImmutable X: Zero Gas Fees for Blockchain Gaming\n\nImmutable X (IMX) is noteworthy for offering a solution that eliminates gas fees with fast transaction confirmations. As an L2 solution built on Ethereum, it provides the security and decentralization of Ethereum without its drawbacks.\n\nIMX is appealing for Ethereum-based games and NFT platforms, as it addresses issues like high gas fees and slow transactions. The platform has partnered with prominent games and platforms like Polygon to introduce technologies like zkEVM, allowing developers to access Ethereum's ecosystem more efficiently. This has positioned IMX as a go-to platform for game devs prioritizing cost efficiency and high throughput\u200b\u200b.\n\nEthereum: A Major Leader Facing Modern Challenges\n\nDespite struggling with transaction speed and high gas fees, Ethereum holds a major position in crypto gaming. It's the largest and most established platform for dApps, including games. Popular blockchain games like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox debuted on Ethereum. However, these limitations are set to be addressed with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn short, selecting the most suitable blockchain for game development depends on factors such as transaction speed, scalability, ecosystem development, and, notably, gas fees. Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Immutable X each offer distinct advantages that cater to various requirements. Their respective features \u2013 from Solana's high TPS to Immutable X's zero gas fees \u2013 illustrate the diversity and potential of blockchain tech in reshaping the gaming sector. Developers must weigh these attributes against their project's specific needs to choose the most appropriate blockchain platform."

        "content": "Too long, didn\u2019t read? Buying Ethereum in Australia is very simple and can be done with just a few clicks. There are several exchanges to choose from, each with their pros and cons. Our pick as the best exchange to purchase ETH is Swyftx due to their easy-to-use app, low trading fees, helpful customer support and wide range of additional features. Simply sign up, verify your identification, deposit AUD and then purchase your desired amount of ETH.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralised ledger that runs on blockchain technology. It was designed to host decentralised applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts, the first of its kind. Additionally, projects can easily create tokens that reside on the Ethereum blockchain. These types of tokens are known as ERC-20.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum network runs on a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which requires network participants to stake ETH instead of mining crypto.\n\nRelated: Ethereum staking guide\n\nThe Ethereum platform is powered by Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency in the world based on market cap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to buy Ethereum safely in Australia\n\nThe safest way you can buy Ethereum (ETH) in Australia is through a reputable crypto trading platform or exchange. Some exchanges offer more crypto assets than others, however, most crypto exchanges will allow trading for popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors and regulates digital currency exchanges so that it complies with national standards, it is highly recommended to go through an AUSTRAC-registered exchange.\n\nBelow are four key steps to purchasing Ethereum:\n\nCreate an account with a registered exchange Verify your identification Deposit Australian Dollars Buy Ethereum\n\nFor this example, we\u2019ll be using the Swyftx cryptocurrency exchange to demonstrate how you can buy and store Ethereum in Australia. Swyftx is an AUSTRAC-registered exchange with offices located in Brisbane and Sydney.

        "title": "Solana\u2019s Co-Founder Drops Bombshell: Massive Shift in Road Map - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Solana doubles down on Layer 1 scaling, aiming to synchronize a global atomic state machine while welcoming Layer 2 solutions.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum leans on Layer 2 options to tackle congestion, with over $20 billion TVL in these solutions.\n\nIn a recent announcement, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of the blockchain platform Solana (SOL), has reaffirmed the project\u2019s commitment to scaling at the Layer 1 level and achieving a global atomic state machine.\n\nWill @solana ever require Layer 2 solutions? There's nothing stopping developers from creating Layer 2s on Solana. However, Solana's aim is to synchronize a global atomic state machine as fast as the laws of physics allow. In this end state, any Layer 2, side chain, or\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) January 5, 2024\n\nThis stance contrasts with other blockchain networks like Ethereum, which increasingly rely on Layer 2 solutions to address scalability challenges. Yakovenko\u2019s remarks shed light on Solana\u2019s unique design principles and determination to provide a high-performance, low-cost environment for decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nLayer 1 Scaling Takes Center Stage\n\nSolana\u2019s primary objective is to synchronize a global atomic state machine as rapidly as the laws of physics permit. While developers are welcome to create Layer 2 solutions on the Solana network, the platform\u2019s core focus remains on scaling at the Layer 1 level. This approach starkly contrasts Ethereum\u2019s strategy, which leans heavily on Layer 2 solutions to alleviate network congestion and high transaction fees.\n\nSolana\u2019s commitment to Layer 1 scaling means any Layer 2, side chain, or zero-knowledge proof valadium. However, valuable innovations, in their own right, are seen as external execution environments that do not ensure atomic composition with the rest of the Layer 1 state. The platform aims to enhance the single virtual machine instance on Layer 1, ideally through future hardware upgrades.\n\nSolana\u2019s Confidence in Its Unique Design\n\nYakovenko acknowledged the innovative nature of technologies like side chains, data availability validating bridges, and zero-knowledge proof valadiums but stressed that they do not expand the atomic global state machine. This strategic decision underscores Solana\u2019s confidence in its ability to meet global demands without resorting to external execution environments, a path many other blockchain networks have chosen.\n\nIt is important to note that Solana has faced challenges related to network reliability in the past, raising questions about its ability to provide a consistent and stable platform for dApps. To address these concerns, the platform has plans to upgrade its client by introducing \u201cFiredancer,\u201d a development aimed at increasing node reliability and overall network performance.\n\nWhile Solana focuses on Layer 1 scaling, Ethereum has taken a different route by increasingly relying on Layer 2 solutions. In a recent developer call, they decided not to increase Ethereum\u2019s gas limit beyond the 30 million gwei level. This decision indicates a delay in Ethereum\u2019s on-chain scaling ambitions, as it looks toward off-chain and sidechain solutions to alleviate congestion and reduce transaction costs.\n\nLayer-2 options such as Optimism and Arbitrum have gained popularity within the Ethereum community for their ability to offload transactions from the mainnet while maintaining compatibility with existing smart contracts. Data from L2Beat shows that these Layer 2 solutions have a combined Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $20 billion, with Arbitrum leading the pack at $10 billion in managed assets as of January 5.\n\nIn addition to discussing Solana\u2019s commitment to Layer 1 scaling, Yakovenko highlighted potential vulnerabilities in Ethereum and Solana. He pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s major threat lies in the centralization of value in execution hotspots, potentially compromising decentralization.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana\u2019s vulnerability is tied to the importance of atomic composability in the blockchain industry, a fundamental aspect of Solana\u2019s design.\n\nAs of the latest update, Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, traded at $95.53, representing a 6% decline in just seven days. The market\u2019s reaction to Solana\u2019s strategic development and Yakovenko\u2019s insights into potential vulnerabilities adds an intriguing layer to the ongoing narrative in the blockchain space\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "10 Best Crypto to Buy Now in January 2024 - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "As we have stepped into the first month of 2024, many are wondering about the best crypto to buy now. The crypto market has proven to be a hotbed of innovation, offering investors new opportunities and challenges alike. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned trader or a novice looking to venture into the exciting realm of digital assets, staying informed about the latest trends and potential investment options is crucial.\n\nIn this article, we embark on a journey to explore the 10 best cryptocurrencies that stand out as promising picks for January 2024. As the crypto market continues to mature and diversify, making informed decisions becomes increasingly important. From established giants to rising stars, each of the selected cryptocurrencies has unique features, potential for growth, and a compelling narrative that makes them noteworthy in the current market.\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, was first conceptualized in 2008 and officially launched in early 2009. The pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains unidentified to this day. Bitcoin revolutionized the digital currency landscape by introducing the innovative concept of a blockchain, offering a highly secure and fully decentralized form of currency.\n\nIts implementation of Proof-of-Work ensures the integrity of transaction history, making it exceptionally challenging to manipulate or duplicate coin transactions. The network\u2019s security is maintained by miners, who earn BTC as rewards for contributing to the expansion of the Bitcoin blockchain through block additions.\n\nDespite the emergence of numerous cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms following Bitcoin, BTC continues to maintain its status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and emerges as the best crypto to buy now. As per recent reports, BlackRock anticipates the approval of its Bitcoin spot ETF application by the SEC on Wednesday, January 10.\n\nThe report further notes that other companies seeking approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF are also optimistic about the outcome. Various companies putting forth their Bitcoin ETF offerings have disclosed the fees they intend to levy on investors. Regarding BTC price performance, Bitcoin has been on an upward trajectory, nearing the $47,000 threshold. Naturally, if the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF is imminent, heightened volatility in the market can be anticipated.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, a blockchain designed to facilitate smart contracts, empowers intricate applications such as decentralized lending protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Initiated by Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum project saw the publication of its whitepaper in late 2013, followed by the blockchain\u2019s launch in July 2015.\n\nPresently, Ethereum boasts a dynamic ecosystem of decentralized applications spanning decentralized financial services, NFT marketplaces, publishing platforms, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and beyond. In our view, this diverse landscape positions Ethereum as the best crypto to buy now. ETH serves as the intrinsic asset on the Ethereum blockchain, motivating users to contribute to network security.\n\nInitially employing a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake in September 2022. Developers within the Ethereum community have set January 17, 2024, as the targeted date for launching the Dencun upgrade on the testnet. The chosen testnet for the upgrade is Goerli, scheduled at epoch 231680. Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation indicates that testnet clients supporting the update are expected to release around January 10.\n\nAs of now, the tentative timeline for the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet is late February. However, Ethereum developers have not established a definitive deadline yet. This upgrade is set to incorporate five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and marks the first significant enhancement to the Ethereum mainnet since the Shapella upgrade. Launched in April of the current year, Shapella enabled users to withdraw staked ETH.\n\n3. Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nArbitrum is a layer 2 solution built on optimistic rollups technology for the Ethereum network. The primary objective of the Arbitrum platform is to provide users with faster and more cost-effective transactions, all while leveraging the robust security of the Ethereum network. While relatively new in the cryptocurrency domain, the Arbitrum platform has swiftly emerged as a major player in the DeFi ecosystem, boasting one of the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among blockchains.\n\nArbitrum maintains its dominance in the Ethereum Layer 2 realm, commanding a substantial 49.8% market share, as reported by the layer 2 aggregator L2Beat. The platform\u2019s TVL has experienced a consistent uptrend since mid-October of the previous year, currently standing at $9.79 billion. This makes ARB be listed as one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\nIn a recent development, the Arbitrum project has implemented a feature allowing projects utilizing Arbitrum Orbit custom blockchains to employ custom gas tokens. Notable projects already leveraging custom tokens for their Arbitrum Orbit chains include XAI (Binance Launchpool\u2019s latest project), Caldera, AltLayer, and Conduit.\n\nSimultaneously, the second phase of the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s grant program has commenced, aiming to offer financial support to projects developing decentralized applications on the Arbitrum platform. These projects encompass areas such as gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), NFTs, social media, and beyond. Notably, Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token has demonstrated robust performance, registering a 46.60% gain over the past 30 days.\n\n4. Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana stands out as a smart contracts platform distinguished by its distinctive architecture, enabling it to handle thousands of transactions per second at remarkably low costs. This efficiency is realized through the utilization of a distinctive Proof-of-History algorithm and a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The native SOL token is recognized for its cost-effectiveness, with users typically paying less than $0.001 per transaction, making it one of the most economical cryptocurrencies for transfers in the market.\n\nDespite experiencing a significant decline in value during the 2022 bear market, Solana maintains one of the most remarkable ecosystems in the cryptocurrency industry and emerges as one of the best crypto to buy now. Solana remains a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market, witnessing a recent 32.59% increase over the past 30 days. This positive momentum aligns with a series of favorable announcements and fundamental developments.\n\nA clear testament to Solana\u2019s current momentum is the substantial trading activity on its decentralized exchanges, amounting to $10.1 billion in the past 7 days. Notably, this figure surpasses the trading volume generated by decentralized exchanges on Ethereum during the same period, which stood at $8.8 billion. This achievement is particularly noteworthy considering that the market capitalization of SOL is approximately eight times smaller than that of ETH.\n\nDiscussing market capitalization, SOL has surpassed XRP, securing the 5th position in the cryptocurrency market rankings. It is currently within reach of BNB, hinting at the possibility of ascending to the 4th spot soon. In parallel developments, Trezor, a prominent hardware cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer, has recently added support for SOL and tokens following Solana\u2019s SPL token standard.\n\n5. XRP\n\nXRP facilitates swift and economical transfers, rendering it well-suited for applications such as remittances. Unlike relying on either Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, XRP employs the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. Participants within the XRP network have the autonomy to select a set of validators they deem trustworthy. Ripple has seamlessly integrated the XRP cryptocurrency into its products, with On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) being a notable example.\n\nCollaborating with cryptocurrency exchanges, ODL utilizes XRP to facilitate efficient cross-border money transfers. XRP has experienced a notable surge lately, with a 26% gain over the past week, reaching its highest price point since July and surpassing BNB in market capitalization. While this uptrend might suggest a potential overextension and the likelihood of a price correction, it\u2019s crucial to note that the recent rally follows several positive developments associated with Ripple and XRP.\n\nIn October, the SEC dropped its claims against key Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, despite the ongoing legal battle between the regulator and the Ripple company itself. In recent developments, Ripple has entered into a partnership with the National Bank of Georgia to supply the technology supporting a pilot program for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nThe pilot project, known as Digital Lari, will utilize the Ripple CBDC Platform. Additionally, XRP has gained acknowledgment from the Dubai Financial Services Authority and received approval for utilization within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Overall, XRP has been witnessing many positive developments and this makes it one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\n6. BNB\n\nBNB, introduced by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange in 2017, functions in two key capacities. Token holders enjoy exclusive privileges when utilizing Binance, such as reduced trading fees, participation in the exchange\u2019s Launchpad and Launchpool programs, cashback on Binance Visa card transactions, and additional benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the token operates as the native asset on the BNB Chain blockchain. BNB Chain, a derivative of Ethereum, provides users with considerably lower transaction fees and enables developers to seamlessly deploy EVM-compatible decentralized applications. Formerly identified as Binance Coin, BNB has undergone an extensive rebranding.\n\nAs BNB is the sole non-stablecoin cryptocurrency eligible for Launchpool staking, the Launchpool announcements have markedly heightened the demand for BNB. As of the current writing, BNB demonstrates a 25.07% surge in the last 30 days. As we have approached mid-January, BNB has emerged as one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\nThrough Binance Launchpool, individuals have the opportunity to stake their BNB and earn tokens from upcoming blockchain projects. The flexibility to unstake BNB at any time allows users to receive additional tokens as a beneficial incentive while assuming relatively low risk\u2014holding BNB or stablecoins throughout the staking period. It would be prudent to monitor Binance in the upcoming days to determine if they announce another Launchpool or perhaps introduce a new Launchpad program.\n\n7. Cosmos (ATOM)\n\nCosmos is a network specifically crafted to enable seamless interoperability among diverse blockchain platforms. Central to the Cosmos network is the Cosmos Hub, which operates on a Proof-of-Stake blockchain model. The Cosmos Hub is strategically structured to foster connections not only within the Cosmos ecosystem but also with external blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCommunication among the various blockchains within Cosmos is facilitated by a protocol known as IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). Cosmos features its native asset called ATOM. Users have the option to stake their ATOM tokens, contributing to the network\u2019s security while earning staking rewards and a share of collected transaction fees. The Cosmos community has endorsed a proposal to limit the inflation rate of the ATOM token to 10%.\n\nPresently, the inflation rate hovers around 14%, with the cap established at 20%. Upon implementation, the proposal will decrease the influx of new ATOM tokens into circulation. However, it will also lead to a reduction in the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staking ATOM tokens, decreasing from approximately 19% to around 13.4%.\n\nAs per the proposal, research findings suggest that the Cosmos Hub blockchain is currently overspending on its security measures. The proposal further contends that diminishing the inflation of ATOM could yield favorable impacts on decentralized finance protocols and money markets within the Cosmos ecosystem. All these positive developments make ATOM one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\n8. Litecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin, an established cryptocurrency, made its debut in October 2011, ranking among the earliest \u201caltcoins\u201d in the market. Initially, Litecoin closely mirrored Bitcoin, essentially emerging as a modified version of Bitcoin\u2019s codebase. With a maximum coin supply of 84 million, Litecoin\u2019s cap is four times larger than that of Bitcoin. Notably, it targets a block time of 2.5 minutes, making it four times faster than Bitcoin\u2019s block time.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, Litecoin employs Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus on its ledger state, but it distinguishes itself by utilizing the scrypt hash function instead of Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 hash function. In the preceding months, Litecoin has demonstrated robust performance, with traders strategically amassing LTC holdings in anticipation of new developments.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, LTC has witnessed a remarkable increase of 38% and presently holds the position of the 11th largest digital currency by market capitalization, emerging as one of the best crypto to buy now. In addition, there\u2019s a notable surge in the institutional investor narrative within the crypto sphere.\n\nIn recent weeks, prominent firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, among others, have submitted applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs, indicating a recognition of cryptocurrencies as integral to their long-term strategies. Amid this growing institutional interest, LTC has gained further visibility by being listed on the EDX Markets exchange, one of four cryptocurrencies featured on the platform.\n\n9. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu, a meme cryptocurrency introduced in 2020 by an individual using the pseudonym \u201cRyoshi,\u201d draws significant inspiration from the Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency and incorporates the Shiba Inu dog breed in its branding. Diverging from Dogecoin, which operates on its own blockchain, Shiba Inu is created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhere to Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nIn 2021, SHIB experienced a notable surge in popularity, securing the position of the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, surpassed only by Dogecoin. Furthermore, SHIB has gained prominence as one of the leading penny cryptocurrencies currently. The Shiba Inu project\u2019s team is actively pursuing the acquisition of the .shib Top-Level Domain (TLD).\n\nTLDs, like .com, .org, .net, and .io, play a crucial role in categorizing websites based on factors such as use case and geographical location. Collaborating with the Web3 domain project D3, the Shiba Inu team is actively working towards securing the .shib TLD. The significance of incorporating .shib into the global Domain Name System extends beyond aesthetic website appearances.\n\nSuccessfully acquiring the .shib domain could pave the way for websites, personalized usernames, and even email addresses culminating in .shib. In addition, the SHIB team has been consistently enhancing the Shiba Inu token burning mechanism. This development is expected to inject positive momentum into the SHIB price, making it one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\n10. Uniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, pioneered the AMM (automated market maker) model, revolutionizing the traditional exchange process. By eliminating the requirement for order books, this distinctive design offers a seamless method for directly swapping various tokens on the blockchain without dependence on intermediaries.\n\nUniswap Price Prediction\n\nThe governance of Uniswap lies in the hands of UNI token holders, enabling them to propose and vote on various matters. UNI tokens were distributed to previous users of the Uniswap protocol through an airdrop in 2020, and currently, the token is accessible for acquisition on numerous decentralized and centralized trading platforms.\n\nThe Uniswap protocol achieved a new milestone with a record daily trading volume of $11.84 billion, nearly doubling its previous highest daily volume. This surge occurred as users flocked to trade USDC, the prominent stablecoin that faced challenges following the weekend\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank failure. The significance of this failure to USDC lies in Circle, a major issuer of the stablecoin, revealing that approximately $3.3 billion of the total $40 billion supporting USDC is held at Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nThe substantial increase in trading volume highlights the Uniswap protocol as a vital component of the crypto market infrastructure, demonstrating its capability to efficiently manage significant volumes even in times of market turbulence. All in all, UNI is expected to grow in terms of price and emerge as one of the best crypto to buy now.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we navigate through January 2024, the crypto market presents a dynamic landscape with various promising options. From established leaders like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to emerging players such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Solana (SOL), each cryptocurrency discussed in this article has its unique strengths and potential for growth.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that the crypto market is inherently volatile. In navigating this diverse crypto landscape, investors should conduct thorough research, stay abreast of market developments, and align their decisions with individual risk preferences. The volatility inherent in the crypto market underscores the importance of a cautious and informed approach as we explore the opportunities of 2024.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"

The upcoming SEC decision on Bitcoin ETF approval, anticipated this week, has the market eagerly awaiting. BTC has maintained an upward trend for the last five days, marking a 10 percent increase month-to-date and an impressive 173 percent rise year-to-date. If the current price level holds, the next hurdle lies at $49,000.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cThe crypto market experienced a rise of 5.8 percent in the last 24 hours, resulting in a total market capitalization of $1.8 Trillion. The crypto fear and greed index is highly positive and has jumped by 6 points as compared to yesterday. With just one day to go for SEC\u2019s decision on ARK/21 Share\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, SEC Chief Gary Gensler posted a series of posts on Twitter mentioning the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. If history is to be repeated this might be considered a positive sign as in Oct 2021 a similar post was made by SEC\u2019s investor education account, a day before the first Bitcoin futures ETF became effective.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin has surged up to $47,000, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors. This rally has sparked anticipation about the digital currency potentially reaching $48,000 soon. A key catalyst propelling this momentum is the fervent speculation surrounding the potential introduction of a Bitcoin ETF, which has garnered considerable attention and excitement.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's surge past $47,000 is attributed to expectations that the US SEC will approve a spot bitcoin ETF this week. With a 7 percent daily gain and an 87 percent increase since September 2023, the market is expecting a historic moment after the ETF's approval. Applicants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which are updating their filings and disclosure fees, have fueled FOMO as analysts predict spot bitcoin ETFs will attract significant demand and legitimacy, easing investor scepticism. Standard Chartered predicts an inflow of $50-100 billion in 2024 and a potential BTC price of $200,000 by 2025. Traders are trying to stop this rise, looking for short-term profits towards $48,500 and the psychological level of $50,000. However, caution prevails with expectations of choppy conditions and potential profit-taking, while the long-term outlook appears bullish, driven by factors such as the Fed tapering cycle, Bitcoin rate halving and growing institutional adoption via new ETFs.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market witnessed a mini rally as the deadline for SEC approval for Bitcoin ETF nears. The total crypto market cap touched the $1.72 trillion mark with Bitcoin and Ethereum jumping by almost 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. Any confirmation of ETF approval by the SEC will push the market higher and it may lead to a market-wide rally. It is important to note that Bitcoin has surged by 10 percent since the beginning of 2024.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Core Dao Vs Bitcoin Comparison, Which is Better? - Indodax",
        "content": "With rapid developments in blockchain technology, one project attracting attention is CORE DAO. CORE DAO has become an innovation pioneer with a strong vision and use of advanced technology.\n\nThrough the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, CORE DAO offers guaranteed privacy, scalability, and an unprecedented level of security.\n\nCore DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) active in developing the Satoshi Plus ecosystem. This ecosystem, a Layer-1 blockchain, combines the decentralization and security advantages of Bitcoin with the scalability and utility offered by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSo, to understand what CORE DAO is, its history and inventor, how it works, its main role in the ecosystem, and how it compares to other blockchains, check out the following review!\n\nWhat is Core DAO?\n\nCORE or Core DAO is a Layer-1 blockchain project that integrates systems from Bitcoin and Ethereum through a consensus mechanism known as Satoshi Plus.\n\nThis approach is an optimal combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) features. CORE aims to introduce the growth of Satoshi Plus consensus as well as harness the power of blockchain technology.\n\nBased on the Core DAO white paper, the main vision is to provide a blockchain that is scalable, secure, decentralized, and transparent for all users.\n\nIn other words, Core DAO is here to overcome the limitations of scale and decentralization support that PoW and PoS have. These experiments reflect principles such as sharding, sidechain, and state channel mechanisms.\n\nWith this approach, Core DAO aims to create a new blockchain independently, allowing it to operate within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the identity of the creator of Core DAO is not revealed. Even though an event poster named BlockSplit listed Schwarze Katze as the figure behind Core DAO, his identity remains unclear.\n\nAdditionally, one of the leading figures at Core DAO is Brendan Sedo, a Portuguese developer who previously served as CEO at Joist, a financial invoicing app for contractors.\n\nHistory and Inventors of Core Dao\n\nRich Rines, one of the early contributors to Core DAO, provides an in-depth perspective on the unique approach taken by Core DAO in solving the blockchain trilemma through the Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism.\n\nBy combining Bitcoin\u2019s computational advantages to achieve decentralization and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) advantages that enable scalability, Rines noted that Core DAO succeeded in creating a layer-1 solution that unites the three core elements of blockchain technology.\n\nHow Core Dao Works\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, Core DAO created an innovative consensus mechanism called \u201cSatoshi Plus,\u201d a complex combination of Bitcoin proof-of-work and Ethereum proof-of-stake. The following illustration explains the complex network of relationships of Satoshi Plus:\n\n\n\nCore Dao\u2019s Primary Role in the Ecosystem\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, there are several main roles in the Core ecosystem that you need to know. The following are the main roles of Core Dao in the ecosystem, including:\n\nValidator: Responsible for block production and checking transactions. Validators register and deposit CORE to qualify for validator selection.\n\nResponsible for block production and checking transactions. Validators register and deposit CORE to qualify for validator selection. Relayer: Tasked with sharing information from Bitcoin to the Core network. Relayers also need to register and deposit CORE.\n\nTasked with sharing information from Bitcoin to the Core network. Relayers also need to register and deposit CORE. BTC Miner: Helps secure the Bitcoin network. BTC diggers can join the Core blockchain by handing over their mining power to a validator.\n\nHelps secure the Bitcoin network. BTC diggers can join the Core blockchain by handing over their mining power to a validator. CORE Holders: Own CORE and can participate in staking by handing over their holdings to a validator.\n\nOwn CORE and can participate in staking by handing over their holdings to a validator. Verifier: Checks for any bad behavior on the network and can report it. Bad behavior by validators may result in deductions from their deposits.\n\nValidator Selection Process\n\nValidator Selection: A mechanism to select the top 21 validators using a score based on how much BTC hash power and CORE assets the validator owns. Updated every 200 blocks.\n\nA mechanism to select the top 21 validators using a score based on how much BTC hash power and CORE assets the validator owns. Updated every 200 blocks. Round: A time period in which validators take turns creating blocks. At the end of each round, rewards are distributed, and new validators are selected.\n\nA time period in which validators take turns creating blocks. At the end of each round, rewards are distributed, and new validators are selected. Slot: A small part of a round where a validator can create a block.\n\nA small part of a round where a validator can create a block. Epoch: A period during which the system checks that all validators behave correctly. Incorrect behavior may result in removal from the validator group.\n\nSatoshi Plus Consensus\n\nThe Satoshi Plus mechanism uses the hash power delegated by BTC miners to Core validators to synchronize blocks mined by BTC miners with the Core network.\n\nAdditionally, DPoS consensus allows token holders to vote and select a set of validators. This allows small token holders to participate in network governance.\n\nThe validator selection process follows a complicated formula, which selects validators from PoW and DPoS consensus mechanisms.\n\nA total of 21 validators with the highest scores in the formula were selected for the 200-block period. Validator misbehavior results in withholding and holding mechanisms. Blocks are mined every 10 minutes, like in the Bitcoin network.\n\nRewards are distributed among validators and the System Reward Contract. Currently, 90% of the rewards are paid to validators. Reward Contract The system pays rewards to relayers and verifiers.\n\nCore DAO Tokenomics\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, CORE is the original utility token of the blockchain. Used for staking and paying gas fees. Core follows the Bitcoin token model, with a total CORE supply of 2.1 billion.\n\nCore also promises to burn a percentage of block rewards and gas fees, similar to the Ethereum model.\n\nThe token emission schedule will be paid for over 81 years. The network hopes to encourage Bitcoin miners to hand over their hash power to the network once significant mining rewards in Bitcoin cease around 2040.\n\nToken supply is allocated as follows:\n\nMining Nodes (839.9 million CORE tokens; 39.995% of total supply): distributed over 81 years.\n\nUsers (525.6 million CORE tokens; 25.029%): Core launched its first airdrop in February 2023.\n\nContributors (Current and Future) (315 million CORE tokens; 15%)\n\nReserve (210 million CORE tokens; 10%)\n\nWealth (199.5 million CORE tokens; 9.5%)\n\nRelayer Rewards (10 million CORE tokens; 0.476%)\n\nWhen Did Core Dao Become Popular?\n\nCore DAO has adopted zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology into its blockchain structure, increasing privacy, scalability, and security.\n\nZKP allows users to prove the truth of a statement without having to reveal additional information, thereby maintaining confidentiality and protecting sensitive data.\n\nBy incorporating ZKP technology, Core DAO opens the door to innovations in smart contract functionality and expands the scope of applications that can be implemented on the Core DAO platform.\n\nWith a strong vision, advanced technology, and support from the community, Core DAO promises a bright future in the blockchain world. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, zero-knowledge-proof technology is expected to play an important role in shaping the future of decentralized applications (dApps) and the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nComparison of Core Dao with Blockchain, Which is Better?\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, Core DAO emphasized that this platform significantly leverages the advantages of other blockchains and combines the strengths of each while reducing their weaknesses. The results can be seen from the comparison of Core with other blockchains, including:\n\n1. Core vs Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first popular blockchain and the first blockchain to introduce proof-of-work. It has become the most decentralized chain but can only process seven transactions per second. According to Core, the Core blockchain improves Bitcoin with higher throughput.\n\n2. Core vs Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the most popular smart contract blockchain and created the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum can also process more TPS than Bitcoin but is still limited to 15 TPS.\n\nCore aims to improve Ethereum with better scalability and less centralization, which he says is still a risk even with Ethereum\u2019s scalability plans.\n\n3. Core vs Solana\n\nSolana is a chain with high TPS and short block times. However, the requirements for validators go far beyond those of other blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s network availability lags behind other chains. Core aims to excel in both aspects.\n\n4. Core Dao vs BNB Chain\n\nBNB Chain was initially forked from the Ethereum chain and uses a Proof of Stake Authority consensus mechanism. It has faster transaction times and higher throughput, although this comes at the cost of decentralization.\n\nPi Network and Core DAO, Which One is Superior?\n\nEveryone has a personal view on which is better between Pi Network and Core DAO. However, if asked to determine which is better, the answer depends on the needs and preferences of each user.\n\nFor example, Pi Network can be ideal for beginners new to blockchain technology. This project is also suitable for those looking for a blockchain platform with the convenience of free coin mining.\n\nMeanwhile, Core DAO may be better suited to those interested in a community-based governance model, including recognizing new blockchains as a way to interact. It is important to note that both of these blockchain projects are still in the development stage.\n\nJudging the merits of either of the two can be quite difficult. Although theoretically, Core DAO has an advantage with projects already active on mainnet.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pi Network hackathon stands out in terms of utility with various unique protocols in its ecosystem. Core DAO also has the advantage of building a complex user ecosystem after operating on the mainnet.\n\nPi Network\u2019s testnet ecosystem also provides an overview of how the mainnet ecosystem will function when released.\n\nWith more than 360 hackathon submissions in the first quarter of 2023, despite superior comparisons, both offer such exciting prospects that they have become a topic of discussion on social media.\n\nCrypto asset projects, with their uniqueness, have an appeal to various individuals. Considering the many interesting crypto projects available, the choice can be tailored to individual wishes and preferences.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, CORE DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, is important in depicting innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nBy understanding the essence of CORE DAO, we see how the platform incorporates the latest technologies, such as zero-knowledge proof, to increase privacy, scalability, and security within its blockchain.\n\nCORE DAO in the blockchain ecosystem is important because of its major contribution to solving the blockchain trilemma, namely providing a balanced solution between decentralization, scalability, and security.\n\nCORE DAO has also pioneered new consensus mechanisms, such as Satoshi Plus, which combines the power of Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake. Therefore, CORE DAO plays an important role in shaping the future of blockchain technology by introducing its innovative approach.\n\nAs an evolving platform, CORE DAO has the potential to significantly impact the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s evolution towards a higher level of maturity.\n\nInvest in Crypto Assets on INDODAX\n\nSo, now you understand what CORE DAO is, its history and inventor, how it works, its main role in the ecosystem, and how it compares to other blockchains.\n\nNext, if you are interested in investing in crypto, you should check the crypto market on INDODAX Market.

This should mean that you will be using servers that have very strong security. On the other hand, Wineth is not completely free. Yes, it is free to download, but you pay the developers by giving 1% of your mining time for them. In other words, the way it seems to work is that if you were to mine for 100 hours, 1 hour will mine Ethereum exclusively for the team behind Wineth. It\u2019s debatable whether or not this deal is good or not. If you don\u2019t mind lending your computer\u2019s processing power to mine Ethereum every now and then, then Wineth is a great application to use, especially for beginners. \u21d2 Get Wineth\n\nThe application is promoted to be immune to fraud, censorship, downtime, and third-party interference. You can use the application as a standalone client or as part of a library. The standalone project named Geth works on all major operating systems, including Windows 10. Go Ethereum can also be embedded in your Android, iOS, or Go projects for greater convenience. Thus you can install this client in various ways, choosing the standalone pre-built bundle or other package managers you want. You can also run this program as a Docker container if you prefer. We recommend this application because it is one of the safest clients to use and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any fees like Wineth. It might take some time to learn how to use Geth, but it will be worth it in the end. \u21d2 Get Official Go Ethereum"
