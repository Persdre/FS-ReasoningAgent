        "title": "Ethereum: Long Term Bullish Pattern Ironically Has To Retrace In Order To Be Super Bullish - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements present a paradox that might confuse the average investor. As Ethereum\u2019s price dips, it could, counterintuitively, signal a highly bullish future.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic requires a deep dive into the technical patterns that are currently forming on Ethereum\u2019s long-term charts. Chart analysis is one of our forecasting methods with which we try to predict ETH prices in 2024 & 2025.\n\nThe Current State of Ethereum\n\nLately, Ethereum has experienced a downward trend that has left many investors feeling uncertain. This decline is not just a reflection of market sentiment but also a pivotal development in the broader technical narrative of Ethereum\u2019s chart.\n\nThe price action, which can seem disheartening at first glance, might actually be setting the stage for a major bullish pattern: the cup and handle.\n\nETH \u2013 Why a Move Lower is Bullish\n\nThe concept might seem contradictory at first \u2014 how can a decrease in price be a good thing for investors? The answer lies in the pattern itself. A cup and handle formation is recognized in technical analysis as a bullish continuation pattern that often leads to a breakout.\n\nFor Ethereum, this pattern begins with a \u201ccup\u201d formation, which the cryptocurrency has been crafting through its recent highs and lows.\n\nThe \u201chandle\u201d part of the pattern, which Ethereum is potentially beginning to form now, typically involves a slight downward or sideways movement in price following the cup. This movement is crucial as it consolidates earlier gains and builds a base for the next upward surge. For the pattern to be validated and for the bullish implications to be activated, Ethereum must not fall below a critical support level \u2014 in this case, $2,250.\n\nETH \u2013 The Importance of the $2,250 Support Level\n\nThis support level is more than just a number. It represents a key psychological and technical threshold that must hold for the cup and handle pattern to complete correctly. If Ethereum\u2019s price respects this support level during its current retrace, it will likely solidify the handle portion of the pattern and set the stage for a significant bullish breakout.\n\nStrategic Considerations for Ethereum Investors\n\nFor those looking to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s potential, here are some conditions and strategies to consider:\n\nMonitor the $2,250 Support Level: This is the line in the sand for the bullish scenario to remain intact. A sustained movement below this price could invalidate the bullish setup and necessitate a reassessment of your investment approach. Understand the Pattern\u2019s Timeframe: The cup and handle formation is a longer-term pattern. Patience is required, as the development and completion of this pattern can span several months. Prepare for Volatility: The path to higher prices is rarely smooth. Prepare for potential volatility as Ethereum tests these crucial levels. Consider the Broader Market Context: While Ethereum\u2019s individual price movements are crucial, the broader market context, including regulatory news and macroeconomic factors, can also significantly impact price action. Set Clear Investment Goals: Whether you\u2019re looking for short-term gains or long-term growth, understanding your own investment goals and risk tolerance is crucial. This clarity will guide your decisions amidst market uncertainty.\n\nConclusion\n\nIronically, Ethereum\u2019s recent price retracement might be exactly what is needed to propel its price to new heights. By respecting the critical support level and forming a complete cup and handle pattern, Ethereum is not just performing a technical maneuver but is also setting the stage for a potential major bullish trend in the future. For savvy investors, this period is not just about weathering the storm but recognizing the opportunities that such patterns may present."

        "title": "SEC will classify ETH as security and reject spot Ethereum ETFs, says Michael Saylor - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Bitcoin stands alone in institutional acceptance, with Ethereum and others facing SEC scrutiny.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Saylor believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will label Ethereum as a security this summer and consequently deny all spot Ethereum ETF applications. He also claimed that other major cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) will likely face similar security classifications from the SEC.\n\n\u201cEthereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you\u2019re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered,\u201d said Saylor during today\u2019s presentation at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference.\n\n\u201cNone of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF. None of them will be accepted by Wall Street. None of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,\u201d he added.\n\nIn contrast, Saylor highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s unique position as the only crypto asset with full institutional acceptance, describing it as the \u201cone universal\u201d institutional-grade crypto asset without any contenders.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s founder is known as a vocal Bitcoin proponent; he exclusively focuses on Bitcoin investment and building Bitcoin infrastructure.\n\nSaylor\u2019s comments come a day after MicroStrategy unveiled MicroStrategy Orange, a Bitcoin-based decentralized identity solution. Earlier this week, the company also announced last month\u2019s acquisition of 122 BTC.\n\nMounting skepticism\n\nSaylor is not the only person who is skeptical about the near-term approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON Foundation, previously voiced concerns about Ethereum ETF\u2019s regulatory hurdles. He believes the SEC will not approve spot Ethereum ETFs this month.\n\nThe SEC is set to make decisions on filings by VanEck and ARK on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Recent discussions surrounding the SEC\u2019s approval process for spot Bitcoin funds have been notably shallow compared to prior discussions preceding the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin funds, with SEC staff reportedly not engaging in detailed conversations about the proposed Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThis lack of interaction heightens frustration and raises the chances of either a rejection or a postponement of decisions.\n\nA definitive classification for Ethereum could clarify how companies interact with the asset. It could also influence the SEC\u2019s approval of products like spot ETFs and the willingness of companies to engage with Ethereum.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares this doubt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on the Fox Business show \u201cThe Claman Countdown\u201d that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if the SEC classifies ETH as a security."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Make a Massive Recovery on Friday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A bad jobs report was good for crypto today.\n\nAfter a week of lower trends, Bitcoin (BTC -3.41%), Ethereum (ETH -2.30%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -7.20%) jumped in trading on Friday morning.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Bitcoin was up 4.1% versus yesterday's stock market close, Ethereum had risen 2.6%, and Dogecoin was up 5.6%. And they all moved based on the same piece of information.\n\nUnemployment data and crypto\n\nCrypto values jumped the moment the U.S. Labor Department released April 2024 jobs data. The U.S. added 175,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9%.\n\nEconomists were expecting 235,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.\n\nThere can be revisions to initial data, but the market will often react solely to the headline report. And that's exactly what happened with the crypto market's reaction only seconds after the report was released.\n\nDoes unemployment really impact crypto?\n\nThe question is really about what this news has to do with cryptocurrencies. Many market participants think a worsening economy means the Federal Reserve will lower rates more quickly. Current expectations are for a September rate cut, but there may be no rate cuts this year if inflation remains high.\n\nIt's a balance to keep rates higher if the economy weakens because lower rates can be a catalyst for more economic activity.\n\nI also question whether or not rates really have much of an impact on cryptocurrencies at all. Outside of more speculation, lower rates don't have any fundamental impact on the crypto market in most instances.\n\nHigher rates are bad for the crypto meme\n\nWhile Bitcoin has solidified its position as a form of digital gold and Ethereum is commonly known as a more utility blockchain with many scaling solutions, Dogecoin could be the most sharply impacted if rates stay where they are and the economy gets worse.\n\nDogecoin is a meme coin with no real utility and that meme position will be tough to hold if people have fewer funds to spend on speculative assets. I think that explains the reaction today.\n\nThis is part of the normal volatility of the crypto market, but it also highlights that eventually, the meme that started in 2020 may not hold much water.\n\nCaution in crypto today\n\nThe crypto market has been on a tear in 2024 despite higher interest rates and signs the economy is getting weaker. And there was also the tailwind from the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nBut some of the market's tailwinds may be subsiding and that won't be good for valuations long term unless there's a significant increase in the utility of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is getting more expensive after the most recent halving and Ethereum hasn't proven to be very cost-effective either.\n\nDogecoin has very little utility and has been focused on its meme status, which can come and go.\n\nI think a day like this is a time to take some chips off the table in crypto as the market telegraphs there are weaker fundamentals for the economy ahead. Like it or not, the economy and the Fed are still the biggest drivers of crypto long term."

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nEthereum is now on the path to recovery after a retracement on the weekly timeframe. ETH touched the $3,000 price level today, indicating buyers\u2019 return.\n\nWhale activity has increased again amid the price recovery, with more than 36,000 ETH tokens moved. Will this affect Ether prices?\n\nEthereum Whale Movement Influencing Ether\u2019s Price\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics platform Whale Alert, 36,763 ETH has been moved in the past day.\n\nA whale address transferred 25,772 ETH to Coinbase Institutional, a major crypto exchange, and another whale acquired 10,990 ETH from Coinbase within the same period.\n\nThese transactions coincide with Ethereum\u2019s fluctuating prices, which has sparked mixed sentiments among market participants.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased slightly today, trading at $2,980 as of 5:37 AM EST, with a 1.4% 24-hour increase. The monthly charts suggest the token has entered a consolidation phase, marked by high fluctuation around the $3,000 price level.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Decision Likely to Affect its Price\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the spot Ethereum ETF approval by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a major factor affecting Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nWhile enthusiasts are keen on approval, MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO, Michael Saylor, is critical of an Ethereum ETF. According to Saylor, Ethereum is a security. Hence, the SEC would never approve an ETF for the altcoin.\n\nThis assertion by Saylor comes just 20 days away from the final ETH ETF deadline of May 23. The SEC will either approve or reject a request for an Ethereum ETF on that date.\n\nAlso, Saylor believes that other altcoins such as BNB, SOL, Cardano, and XRP will be classified as unregistered securities. He noted that Bitcoin stands alone in attracting institutional acceptance, and there is no second-best token.\n\nWhile opinions are divided on an Ethereum ETF approval, a positive response will likely attract more investors. If the ETFs are approved, Ethereum will likely record a massive rally.\n\nHowever, nothing is certain yet, and a decline is imminent for Ether should the SEC decline the spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nWhat Next for Ethereum?\n\nETH has formed a red candle on the daily chart after rallying to $3,000 earlier today. The sellers have continued to mount pressure, forcing a decline at the $3032.8 resistance level.\n\nHowever, ETH has found support at the $2938.2 price level, which is critical to preventing further decline.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR indicator has moved above the candles, a bearish signal of further decline. This confirms the bearish signal displayed by the RSI, which sits at 39.08, approaching the oversold region.\n\nGiven the upcoming spot ETF decision and the current mixed market sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s price is at a critical conjecture. It could remain consolidatory in the coming days until a decision is reached, which will either propel it upwards or trigger a downturn.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBut the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.\n\nEconomist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve.\"\n\nAnalysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee\u2014which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates\u2014would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.\n\nSome thoughts on the current crypto cycle #1 The crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF. #2 ETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers. #3 Solana established itself as the chain of choice for\u2026 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) May 1, 2024\n\nDuring a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said, but warned that it was \u201clikely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.\u201d\n\nBut even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. \"I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut,\" he said during a press conference in Japan last month. \"This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that.\"\n\nHe was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time."

Currently priced at $2,950 per ETH, Tuesday saw the bulk of this decline, culminating in a weekly low of $2,817.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAmid this turbulence, attention has been drawn to a suspected Ethereum Foundation address, \"0xd7,\" which reportedly sold 100 ETH for 291,267 DAI via the Cow Protocol today.\n\nThis transaction was followed by a transfer of the acquired DAI to another Ethereum Foundation address, \"0x9e.\" Notably, this suspected Ethereum Foundation address has been consistently exchanging ETH for DAI through the Cow Protocol in recent times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow solid is that foundation?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of Ethereum and related technologies. According to reports from Arkham, the known accounts of the Foundation currently boast 310,867 ETH, valued at $915.15 million.\n\nExcluding exchanges and select projects, the foundation stands as one of the largest altcoin holders, with assets estimated to exceed $1 billion, encompassing holdings in WETH.E worth $91.87 million, along with 329,239 DAI \u2014 some of which arrived in foundation addresses today.\n\nThe revelation of one of the foundation's key holders offloading a portion of their ETH holdings has sparked speculation regarding its potential impact on Ethereum's future trajectory. The implications of such actions on the price of main altcoin remain uncertain, leaving investors and enthusiasts with unanswered questions."

This wallet contains millions worth of Ethereum.\n\nThis premined whale had spent almost nine years in dormancy \u2013 this means since 2015, the year that followed the end of the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nThe reactivated wallet contains almost 2,000 ETH worth $5,876,786.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 1,969 #ETH (5,876,786 USD) has just been activated after 8.8 years!https://t.co/MzyVVkMhIc \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 2, 2024\n\nEthereum Foundation dumps ICO ETH\n\nPrior to this awakening, an ancient wallet that belongs to the Ethereum Foundation was reactivated after nine years. The wallet transferred a massive 2,000 ETH evaluated at approximately $6.5 million. This money put into it during the period of the Ethereum ICO was moved to a new blockchain address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, the market has reacted negatively when the Ethereum Foundation has released large amounts of Ethereum. This is not the only sale made by this prominent entity observed by market participants this week. Earlier today, it was reported that another wallet linked to the foundation sold 100 ETH for 291,267 DAI via the Cow Protocol.\n\nEthereum whale activity soars high\n\nThis awakening of an ancient whale took place after the overall activity of Ethereum whales demonstrated the largest growth in addresses over the past year. Approximately 139,560 new ETH wallets were created on a single day \u2013 April 29, according to cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nEarlier this week, the second-largest cryptocurrency saw a tremendous decline of 12.16%, falling from $3,243 to the $2,960 zone. It was followed by a small rebound of 3.87%. This discount provided a great opportunity to buy the dip, and traders immediately took advantage of this, setting up almost 140,000 new wallets, expanding the network.\n\nProminent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has just tweeted that he expects Ethereum may go down to the $2,500 zone \u201cfor the most optimal play.\u201d However, he does not believe that crypto markets are likely to be in for such a heavy correction. \u201cMost of the downside is already in,\u201d he added."

        "content": "Despite a weekly pullback in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto by global market cap has once again sparked substantial investor attention. Today, on May 3, Ethereum\u2019s price not only regained an upward momentum but also surpassed the significant $3K mark, a positive development that has reinvigorated the market, instilling a sense of optimism among investors.\n\nThis upward trend, coupled with a considerable spike in whale activity, has ignited a flurry of interest surrounding the token\u2019s future price movements. Nearly 36,000 ETH was shifted over the past day, with whales dumping and buying and buying the so-called \u2018eternal Solana rival\u2019 token in hand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Whale Activity: A Closer Look\n\nInsights from on-chain analysis platforms reveal that a total of 36,762 ETH was moved in the past day. Notably, whale 0xf83c\u2026 made a significant move by transferring 25,772 ETH to Coinbase Institutional, a prominent player in the crypto industry. In contrast, whale 0x0b4\u2026 acquired 10,990 ETH from Coinbase during the same period, showcasing contrasting strategies.\n\nThese transactions, coming in tandem with Ethereum\u2019s recent turbulent price action, have ignited mixed sentiments within the broader crypto market. While one whale continued to buy the token amid a broader market dip, the other whale dumped colossal amounts of the same token, underscoring a bearish sentiment amid ETH\u2019s status as a security saga.\n\nNonetheless, the price trajectory\u2019s upward movement at press time skewed the scale more toward the optimistic side.\n\nAlso Read: Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block Boosts Its Bitcoin Bet With 10% Gain Reinvestment\n\nETH Price Jumps\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price jumped 3.08% in the past 24 hours and currently sits at $3.001. The token witnesses a high price flux movement at the $3K mark, with its monthly charts illustrating a consolidatory phase.\n\nCrypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token for further price action shifts as the security lawsuit and a post-BTC halving rally remain poised to impact the token\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that XRP, a Ripple Labs-backed token, has been on a sluggish price trajectory ever since it entered a legal tussle with the U.S. SEC. On the other hand, a post-halving rally usually pushes a parabolic uptrend in altcoins as well, historical data suggests, although it\u2019s not always a guarantee of future price movements.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Saylor Attacks Ethereum Calling It A Security, Disapproves spot ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Bitcoin price reclaiming above $59,200 would hint that BTC has already bottomed out, setting the tone for a run north.\n\nEthereum price holding above $2,900 keeps a bullish reversal pattern viable despite falling momentum.\n\nRipple price coils up for a move north as XRP bulls defend $0.5000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price slipped below $60,000 on Wednesday as markets tried to front-run the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n\nIn the mid-April meeting, the Fed alleged new uncertainty concerning whether it could cut rates later this year because of inflation data from the previous quarter. This had markets anticipate a rate hike, causing Bitcoin price to dump, going as low as the $56K range.\n\nIn a surprising twist on Wednesday, however, the Fed decided to keep rates unchanged, with the improved sentiment sending BTC back into the $58,000 range.\n\nThe sentiment has extended to Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices as they continue to hold above key support levels.\n\nAlso Read: Relief wave on altcoins likely as Bitcoin price shows a $5,000 range\n\nKey level to watch as Bitcoin price slowly grinds up\n\nBitcoin price drop on Wednesday saw it draw close to testing the Bull Market Support Band at $55,831. However, dovish news from the FOMC may have turned around fortunes as the BTC price is slowly grinding up. If the bulls can manage to haul BTC back above the $59,200 level, it could solidify the recovery, effectively meaning that BTC has bottomed out at $56,552.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin price remains in the woods amid falling momentum and growing bearish sentiment, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators.\n\nIf the Bull Market Support band fails to hold as support, Bitcoin price could extend the fall toward the $52,000 threshold, or in a dire case, test the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, with the RSI holding well above the mean level of 50, and the AO still in positive territory, all hope is not lost for BTC bulls. And while a flip of $59,200 into support would solidify a recovery rally, the bearish thesis will only be invalidated once BTC breaks and closes above $72,000.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price reclaims $59K as Fed leaves rates unchanged\n\nEthereum price still flirts with 25% upside potential\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern. This bullish pattern will be executed after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline in the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the height of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point. The descending wedge pattern remains viable, given that the Ethereum price continues to hold above $2,900 in the 12-hour timeframe.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, with the lower highs of the RSI, the bears could have their way, sending Ethereum price below the $2,900 buyer congestion level. Such a move would not only negate the bullish reversal pattern but also encourage more sell orders.\n\nTraders looking to open long positions for ETH should wait for the RSI to reclaim above 50 mean level, a move that could be accompanied by a bounce of Ethereum price above the lower boundary of the pattern. A 12-hour candlestick close above $3,212 would provide a good entry.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum attempts recovery from dip amid unchanged interest rates and accusations leveled at SEC Chair\n\nRipple price defends against further downside\n\nRipple price could pivot around $0.4952, marked by the 50% Fibonacci placeholder, as XRP bulls show commitment to defend the $0.5000 threshold. The RSI has managed to record higher lows in the one-day timeframe, which points to growing bullish momentum.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see the XRP price bounce with the prospect of reclaiming the $0.5715 peak of the range. In a highly bullish case, the gains could be seen in the rippling price foray above $0.6000, which is almost 17% above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the 50% Fibonacci placeholder fails to hold as a support, the Ripple price could drop. A candlestick close below $0.4782 would produce a lower low, hinting at a possible trend reversal.\n\nSpooked holders would then pull the trigger, sending Ripple price below the $0.4500, or in a dire case, roll over to $0.4188. This would mean a fall of nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP sustains above $0.50 as traders digest news of Ripple XRP Ledger entry in the Japanese market."

        "content": "Market picture\n\nCrypto market capitalisation rose 3.3% in 24 hours to $2.22 trillion. Local capitalisation bottomed near $2.10 trillion, confirming a sequence of declining local lows (2.3 in March, 2.25 in April) and highs (2.76 in mid-March, 2.67 in early April and 2.46 in late April).\n\n\n\nEthereum and Solana are adding from the area of the April lows and forming a double bottom. This is a positive but not too reliable signal, as Bitcoin has been in a downtrend throughout April.\n\n\n\nAfter the halving, it is logical to expect miners to increase sales from inventory, to invest in new capacity or to lock in profits. Also, the hype around spot Bitcoin ETFs is going away, which reinforces selling by speculators.\n\n\n\nAssuming Bitcoin stays within the global growth cycle starting in 2023, we should expect further price declines in the coming weeks. The nearest likely target looks to be the $51-52K area, where growth was paused in February and where the 200-day MA will be pulled up by the end of the month.\n\nNews background\n\nSoSoValue notes that outflows for $563.8 million from spot bitcoin-ETFs on 1st May reached their highest since product approval. Bloomberg noted the formation of IBIT and FBTC price discounts relative to net asset value (NAV).\n\n\n\nBlackRock believes that financial institutions, including pension, endowment, and sovereign wealth funds, will enter the ETF market in the coming months.\n\n\n\nVanEck calculated that the aggregate value of Bitcoin in the wallets of governments and companies is $175bn. That\u2019s about 15% of the total BTC capitalisation.\n\n\n\nBitfinex said that Bitcoin options traders are preparing for a summer lull in the market. Summer is usually a period of low volatility in the crypto market. Cube.Exchange, on the other hand, pointed to the likelihood of increased price fluctuations in the summer against a background of low liquidity.\n\n\n\nToncoin (TON) resumed growth after a correction amid an investment from venture capital firm Pantera Capital with over $5bn in assets under management. \u2018We believe TON has the potential to bring crypto to the masses as it is widely used in the Telegram ecosystem\u2019, Pantera noted.\n\n\n\nOn 2nd May, TON developers announced the platform\u2019s integration with the on-chain analytics service Arkham Intelligence. On 1st May, integration with the cross-chain platform Layerswap was implemented, which, according to its representative, will make it possible \u2018to send USDC from any network and receive USDT on the TON blockchain\u2019."

        "content": "Analysts predict peak cycle for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid regulatory uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory debates and SEC allegations intensify negative sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAs Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, dips below the $60,000 threshold, analysts suggest that BTC may have reached its peak for this cycle.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seems to be mirroring the movements of Bitcoin, as both cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing a downward trend.\n\nCommenting on the uniqueness of this crypto cycle, crypto veteran Alex Kr\u00fcger said,\n\n\u201cThe crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers.\u201d\n\nWhy is Ethereum losing its limelight?\n\nUndoubtedly, Bitcoin achieved remarkable performance by reaching new record highs in this cycle. However, Ethereum\u2019s position has declined, falling below Solana in terms of product-market fit and retail trader popularity.\n\nThis raises a question: Can Ethereum\u2019s price plummet to $2500 within the next 7 days?\n\nWell, to answer this, AMBcrytpo analyzed the liquidation levels for ETH.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the Ethereum market has a cluster of liquidation levels between $2640 and $2750, attracting traders due to high liquidity. Additionally, this price range aligns with a bullish order block observed at the range highs, further reinforcing its significance.\n\nThis underlines that Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to decline to this liquidity pocket before a potential reversal.\n\nThe concerns surround ETH\u2019s classification as a security\n\nMoreover, the ongoing debate surrounding whether ETH is a security has intensified negative investor sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAmidst these metrics, a new development also took place wherein Rep. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee noted,\n\n\u201cNew court filings indicate that @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of #ETH at a @FinancialCmte hearing to conduct oversight of his agency.\u201d\n\nThis highlights the increasing uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status and its impact on investor sentiment.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, @TheDustyBC, a content creator, took to X (Formerly Twitter) and said,\n\n\u201cEthereum not being kind on the feelings today.\u201d\n\nWay forward\n\nHowever, now with the hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on the 1st of May. And, the Hong Kong ETFs being a major disappointment, the execs are still waiting for the tables to turn. Needless to say, Kr\u00fcger claims,"

        "title": "Michael Saylor Attacks Ethereum Calling It A Security, Disapproves spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has made a bold statement against Ethereum stating that the world\u2019s largest altcoin is a crypto asset security and not a commodity. His comments regarding ETH came on Thursday, May 2, while speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference.\n\nMichael Saylor Attacks ETH\n\nIn addition to attacking Ethereum and calling it a security, Michael Saylor added that there\u2019s a very high likelihood that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would never approve a spot Ethereum ETF. His comments come just 20 days ahead of the final deadline of May 23, for the SEC to either approve/deny the spot Ethereum ETf applications.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe went on to forecast that other cryptocurrencies further down the hierarchy would also be classified as unregistered securities, including BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA).\n\nSaylor emphasized:\n\n\u201cNone of them will be included in a spot ETF, none of them will ever gain acceptance on Wall Street\u2026\u201d\n\nHe firmly asserted that Bitcoin (BTC) stands alone in achieving full institutional acceptance. He labeled BTC as the \u201csingular universal\u201d crypto asset suitable for institutional-grade investments, stating that \u201cthere won\u2019t be another one.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s founder is renowned for his unwavering focus on Bitcoin. Saylor\u2019s remarks come shortly after MicroStrategy announced the addition of $1.65 billion worth of BTC to its corporate reserves in the first quarter.\n\nTwo days before, MicroStrategy also unveiled its Bitcoin-based decentralized identity (DID) product MicroStrategy Orange. Along with holding a large stash of BTc on its balance sheet, the company has also been making strong efforts in order to boost the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFuture of Ethereum ETFs in the United States\n\nWhile some of the top financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity have been pushing for a spot Ethereum ETF, market analysts have toned down their expectations of approval recently. One of the major concerns has been the recent comments from the SEC that seek to treat it as a security.\n\nHowever, some of the top crypto industry firms are willing to defend Ethereum at all costs. Last week, ConsenSys slapped a lawsuit on U.S. SEC, and wants to declare it as a non-security.\n\nAs the SEC\u2019s investigations into Ethereum unfold, it\u2019s evident that spot Ethereum ETFs may face obstacles in the near future, potentially leading to further legal battles.\n\nSpot market Ethereum ETFs would offer Wall Street firms and investors a means to gain indirect exposure to ETH, bypassing the need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage digital wallets. Earlier this week, Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction to approve a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.
