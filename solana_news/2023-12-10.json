        "title": "Ethereum faces a moment of truth with latest crypto rally - Fortune",
        "content": "In early December, the sudden popularity of a new species of NFT called Buterin Cards led Ethereum gas fees\u2014the cost to carry out a transaction on the blockchain\u2014to briefly soar to around $10. Even though the fees soon fell back to around $1, the episode was an unpleasant reminder of earlier crypto booms when Ethereum became practically unusable just as it was soaring in popularity. This famously occurred with the arrival of an early NFT package known as Crypto Kitties in 2017, and with the massive speculative frenzy of the 2021 crypto bubble.\n\nDuring those earlier episodes, Ethereum boosters begged for understanding since the blockchain, which was the first to popularize smart contracts, was still a new technology. The crypto world was largely understanding since growing pains for a project of this scale are inevitable, and due to the specific challenge of the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d\u2014an axiom that says it is easy to build for two of the three qualities of speed, security, and decentralization but not all three. As we appear to be entering a new crypto bull market, though, it\u2019s not clear if people will be as patient.\n\nThe frustration around gas fees is partly a financial one\u2014no one likes to pay more than they expect. But it\u2019s also rooted in a philosophical disconnect: The promise of Ethereum is that it\u2019s supposed to be a cheaper and safer technology than the conventional financial system. The reality for many people who first try Ethereum, however, is that the proposed gas cost exceeds the cost of the underlying transaction.\n\nI asked Paul Brody, an Ernst & Young executive who has written a well-reviewed book titled Ethereum for Business, to see if he is concerned that the blockchain\u2019s ongoing gas headaches might mean it is running out of time to prove it is ready for primetime. He told me he is not, pointing to the flourishing layer-2 ecosystem, which lets users carry out the bulk of transactions on auxiliary blockchains like Optimism at a fraction of the cost. Those transactions are then bundled up and stamped on the main Ethereum blockchain, providing the same immutable record.\n\nLayer-2 technology has indeed grown by leaps and bounds since 2021, spurred in part by Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to a proof-of-stake model for its blockchain, and costs on the side chains are far lower. But as I pointed to Brody, the experience of using a layer-2 chain is still clumsy and complicated, and off-putting to nontechnical people.\n\nBrody acknowledged that the L2 experience remains \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d but says this is only a temporary situation, and that it won\u2019t be long until it becomes abstracted away with better designs. Meanwhile, he added that Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract for companies by an order of magnitude, and that this growth will only continue\u2014a refutation of claims by Solana and other rivals that tout their lower gas costs as proof they can replace Ethereum.\n\nFor now, Brody appears right that Ethereum remains in the pole position when it comes to being the world\u2019s go-to smart contract platform. That said, if the next crypto boom is once again defined by eye-popping Ethereum fees, patience will begin to run out.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC asked a Washington, D.C., court to incorporate admissions included in Binance's recent settlement with the DOJ, claiming they strengthen its ongoing case.

        "title": "Web3 Watch: Solana and Bitcoin top Ethereum in NFT sales - Blockworks",
        "content": "This week\u2019s Web3 watch begins with a significant shift in the NFT marketplace. Ethereum, traditionally the frontrunner in NFT trading, has seen a downturn in sales volume, facing competition from two emerging players.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnessed a surge in digital art collectible trading, primarily driven by ongoing interest in ordinal inscriptions. Ordinals allow users to mint NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The past month has seen a 500% increase in sales volume for this asset class, eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s figures over the same timeframe.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin\u2019s cheap-to-mint ordinal inscriptions has led to a significant increase in demand on the network. This trend reflects a broader shift in the digital collectibles market, where novel and cost-effective methods of NFT creation and trading are gaining traction.\n\nRead more: Sotheby\u2019s announces its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale\n\nThe Solana blockchain has also stepped into the spotlight, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum on Friday. This increase in Solana\u2019s trading volume is the culmination of a banner week for the network.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s obviously interesting and different in the ordinals space versus every other popular blockchain is that your NFTs are actually stored on-chain versus in smart contracts-enabled ecosystems, [where] they\u2019re stored on some decentralized server like IPFS,\u201d Sarah Satoshi, the head of business development at ordinals marketplace Gamma.io, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the factors that attracts a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito executed an airdrop on Thursday, distributing $165 million worth of its native token to users. The following day, Solana saw a spike in its NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThere was a marked increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT market, which may have been fueled by speculations of another potential airdrop.\n\nOn Friday, \u201cTensorians,\u201d a Solana-based NFT collection, topped the sales volume charts according to CryptoSlam. The collection\u2019s sales volume rose over 100% in the past week.\n\nPudgy Penguins takes up the Webkinz model\n\nThe NFT collection Pudgy Penguins debuted an online open-world game called Pudgy World Alpha at Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe game lets players control avatar lookalikes of the penguins, but users don\u2019t need to own an NFT to play.\n\nPudgy World builds on the NFT collection\u2019s partnership bringing toy versions of Pudgy Penguins to Walmart stores. Each toy comes with a QR code that claims a Pudgy Penguin character inside of Pudgy World.\n\nEvery toy corresponds to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, and holders receive licensing royalties on their corresponding toys, the project said in a press statement.\n\nOne interesting stat:\n\nInterest in Bitcoin ordinals dramatically increased the blockchain\u2019s mempool to an all-time high. Mempools collect all unconfirmed transactions waiting to be validated and added to a blockchain. When too many transactions are added, it becomes congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees for prioritizing transactions.\n\nAlso of note:\n\nRecordpool released the Jackson 5\u2019s first ever studio recording as a digital collectible on Web3 music marketplace anotherblock.\n\nThe digital art arm of Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning off its first set of ordinal inscriptions.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) faces possible sell pressure, one crypto analyst says, citing how it surpassed the $2,300 mark. Whales have been actively taking profit, and this could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto.\n\nEthereum price volatility\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been positively impacted by the recent bullish momentum in the global crypto markets, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above the $43,000 price region.\n\nETH maintains a distinctive market position attributed to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption, and pivotal role in decentralized finance (defi) and various blockchain applications.\n\nDespite the current positive momentum, there are apprehensions regarding the potential influence of selling pressure from whales on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales immediately took profits after Ethereum hit $2,300.\n\nThe impact of significant holders selling could potentially drive down the price of ETH in the coming weeks. In a bearish scenario, the cryptocurrency might retest the $1,555 support level, and sustained selling pressure could push ETH as low as $1,460 within the next two months, the analyst predicts.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAs #Ethereum surpassed $2,300, $ETH whales began to book profits. This surge in selling pressure might soon start to impact the #ETH price. pic.twitter.com/sdrvT2vcCe \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAlthough Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $282 billion lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s $857 billion, both networks generate comparable protocol revenues.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Bitcoin network accrued $61 million in fees, while Ethereum accumulated $61.5 million.\n\nIn addition to institutional interest, the price surge is fueled by expectations of an ETF approval from the SEC. Despite the optimistic momentum, there are apprehensions, that the upswing in selling pressure might have repercussions on the ETH price in the coming days.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scaling startup Versace Labs secured another $2.3m in seed round\n\nEthereum\u2019s surging network fees\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is intricately tied to the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIncreased defi and NFT activities have driven up network fees, with more individuals engaging in intricate transactions, leading to prolonged periods of elevated fees.\n\nThe creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the associated costs can fluctuate based on network congestion and gas prices. While Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees pose challenges for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions like Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization provide optimism for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe surge in DeFi and NFT activity on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in extensive transaction activity, contributing to the persistently high gas fees.\n\nCurrently, the average gas fee for minting an NFT on Ethereum is around $100, subject to variations based on network congestion, gas prices, and smart contract complexity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,348.23, according to Data from CoinGecko."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin fell below $41,000 and Ethereum below $2,200 on Monday as crypto markets took a dive after having rallied for the better part of two months.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $40,758, down 7% in the past day. This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating. ORDI (ORDI), which last week saw explosive growth and set an all-time high of $68.37, has slumped 14% in the past day. The token, easily the most popular BRC-20 token built on Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, is now trading for $45.11.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE), which last week jumped 26% during a spike in meme coin activity, has also cooled off. As of this writing, it has fallen 13% in the last day and is trading for $0.00000138.\n\nEven as the some of the largest digital assets by market cap take a hit, there's been good news for some alts.\n\nA new report from digital asset manager CoinShares finds that institutional investors have been especially keen on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Exchange-traded products meant to track the two coins saw $5 million worth of deposits last week. And while most of the gaming token category went red on Monday, Immutable (IMX) saw a 10% gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD)\u2014a dollar-pegged stablecoin\u2014lost its peg for a while on Monday. As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Bitcoin price could lose critical support at $40,000 as RSI confirms BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nEthereum price clings firm to the uptrend and records a healthy pullback as $2,147 support continues to hold.\n\nRipple price risks an extended 7% fall to the $0.5773 support level as XRP bulls show weakness.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bullish despite the catastrophic setback recorded during the early trading hours of the Asian session. While several other narratives support the big-picture bullish outlook, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a role to play in it.\n\nAs traders and investors continue to anticipate the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) giving approvals for the product launches between January 5 and 10, even Google has taken a hint. An official announcement reveals that \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States [will be allowed] to advertise those products and services\" beginning January 29, 2024. Notably, this is the same month that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to gain approval in the US.\n\nBitcoin price delivers a healthy retest\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price folding back to record an intra-day low of $40,400 was a healthy retest as the $40,000 psychological level continues to hold as support. If the level holds, then it could precipitate the idea that new all-time highs are in the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside potential remains strong for Bitcoin price as BTC is still not ripe for selling until the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below the 70 level. With the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showing large volumes of green histogram bars, the bulls still maintain a strong presence in the market though. The RSI could simply hold above 70.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price overcome the weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A weekly candlestick close above the $43,860 mean threshold would confirm the continuation of the primary trend.\n\nSuch a move would set the tone for Bitcoin price to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker, confirmed by a move above the $48,725 resistance level.In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend to tag the $66,098 resistance level into a support floor.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if the weekly supply zone defends as a resistance order block, Bitcoin price could pull south, losing the support at $40,000. A decisive weekly candlestick close below this level would put BTC on the cliff, potentially rolling over to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin braces for volatility-filled week with November CPI data release, Fed decision\n\nEthereum price sell-off threatens upside potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) price also crashed alongside Bitcoin, losing almost 9% in market value. However, the move remains a healthy pullback as the $2,147 support level did not break. As long as ETH remains above the $2,000 psychological level, the upside potential remains alive.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price clear the $2,403 range high even as it continues to consolidate within the confines of an ascending parallel channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, increased seller momentum could plunge Ethereum price out of the bullish chart pattern, confirmed by a break and close below critical $2,147 support. ETH might then confirm the continuation of the fall by breaking and closing below the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker at $2,075. The move could clear the path for the largest altcoin by market capitalization to spiral to the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nEthereum (ETH) could reach a new all-time high of $5,000 however analysts project that this can only happen in 2025. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, has retraced in value following its recent upswing and now trades at $59. For the time being, another crypto that\u2019s gained significant attention is Pullix (PLX), which can completely change the TradFi space with an innovative approach.\n\nSolana (SOL) Experiences Price Correction Despite 333.5% Growth\n\nSolana (SOL) recently saw a major price correction as it moved down in value to $59. The cryptocurrency began the year strong, where Solana grew from $8 to a peak value of $61.29 before correcting. The recent retrace from the October high is not too significant.\n\nWith its impressive market cap of $25,296,290,926 and a trading volume of $1,675,035,225, the Solana network has showcased no signs of slowing down, and the total price increase this year is still at 333.5%. According to the latest Solana price prediction, it can reach as high as $65.18 by the time the year ends.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Spike As High as $5,000 by 2025\n\nEthereum (ETH) has broken past the $2,000 price barrier and is now heading towards even more gains. This cryptocurrency has showcased impressive resilience following the market crash that occurred in 2022, and it has made a 70% price increase during 2023 so far, making Ethereum one of the highest-growing altcoins.\n\nAnalysts are now bullish on the future of Ethereum, with some of them pointing towards a price increase between $4,800 and $5,000. One such analyst is using the TradingView handle FieryTrading.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 will become a reality by 2025. Based on the data, the crypto is showcasing a very decent long-term trade.\n\nPullix (PLX) to Introduce a Token-Burning Mechanism\n\nWhile Solana is down, and Ethereum\u2019s growth is still far out into 2025, Pullix (PLX) has picked up the most significant attention.\n\nThis will be the world\u2019s first community-backed exchange that will provide users with seamless access to all assets, not just cryptocurrency, 24/7. Alongside this, any holder of the PLX crypto will get access to the platform\u2019s daily profits.\n\nWith PLX, users can gain access to cashback, distribution of rewards and additional promotional offers. The ecosystem will also include a token-burning mechanism at the end of each month in order to maintain the stability of the value of the cryptocurrency as much as possible. By implementing its blockchain infrastructure, all of the transactions, trades, and interactions are also completely encrypted. Anyone can stake the crypto or stake other cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, or DOGE, in order to engage in the multi-currency staking process completely.\n\nCrypto can also be used as collateral and trade OTC derivatives without KYC. This opens up the market to far more people who would otherwise not be able to access it, solving a key issue in the industry. Now, the project is undergoing its initial presale period, where it trades at just $0.04. According to analysts, the PLX cryptocurrency has the potential to climb 100x following its listing on major exchanges at launch.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "title": "What Are Blockchain Confirmations and Why Do They Matter? - CoinCentral",
        "content": "A blockchain confirmation is a representation of a new block being accepted by a blockchain network. When any transaction is first broadcast to the blockchain it starts with zero confirmations. This number then increases as the information is added to the first block, confirmed, given a permanent place, and followed by more blocks.\n\nA confirmation is considered to have occurred once a miner has verified a block of transactions and added the new block to the blockchain. On average, cryptocurrency exchanges require a minimum of three confirmations until a transaction is accepted. Coinbase, for example, does not consider a Bitcoin transaction as final until it has received at least three confirmations.\n\nAll public blockchains make use of blockchain confirmations. These are important since they can help you understand how confident you can be when making a transaction.\n\nBlockchain confirmations are vital since they are a way of verifying and legitimizing information that will then become immutable. If a transaction is deemed fraudulent, it will be rejected from the blockchain: zero blockchain confirmations means zero transactions.\n\nTthe larger the transaction, the more blockchain confirmations are required. This is because the more confirmations there are, the harder the transaction is to reverse. For a transaction of $1 million, it\u2019s not uncommon to wait for at least 60 confirmations. The amount of blockchain confirmations required to verify a transaction varies by blockchain. Let\u2019s take a look at Bitcoin and Ethereum here.\n\nBitcoin Confirmations\n\nYou probably already know that Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain creates a new block about every 10 minutes through the mining process. This block then verifies and records new transactions and appends them to the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that a transaction is unconfirmed until the new block is generated. Therefore, if you\u2019re sending or receiving Bitcoin, it\u2019s essential to wait until you see that the transaction has been confirmed.\n\nOne confirmation usually takes up to 10 minutes. However, since one confirmation is not enough to be confident about the validity of the transaction, users have to wait for each new block to be created and verify the information. Depending on the amount being sent, this may take anywhere between 30 to 600 minutes. Ten hours is a long time to wait for a transaction confirmation!\n\nSome Bitcoin services are instant and require only the first confirmation, however, the majority ask for more, with some companies requiring at least six Bitcoin blockchain confirmations before accepting the transaction.\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Mempool?\n\nThe Bitcoin mempool is the sea of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. As explained above, once a transaction is uploaded to the blockchain, it is not confirmed immediately but is released into the mempool of transactions, which are considered in-motion.\n\nAll nodes on the Bitcoin network are connected to the mempool, and that includes the miners who collate transactions from the mempool into a block. The miner who first solves the mathematical equation and adds the block to the blockchain is the first to confirm the block. Therefore, the first to receive the miner reward of 12.5 BTC.\n\nThis is fairly straightforward, however, some transactions are picked out of the mempool faster than others. Why? Because miners also earn a bonus percentage of transaction fees (called the Bitcoin mining fee).\n\nMiners will pick out the transactions with the higher fees first to earn a higher bonus. It also explains why not paying transaction fees can lead to your transaction getting stuck. In fact, as more people join the Bitcoin network, this bottleneck is one of the greatest challenges to the Bitcoin community.\n\nHow to Speed Up Blockchain Confirmation Times\n\nThe higher the fee you pay, the more likely your transaction will be confirmed in a timely manner (there is a 60 percent chance that it will take 10 minutes or less). However, if your transaction remains unconfirmed, the recommended wait time is 72 hours before sending it again.\n\nIf you want to avoid paying fees, however, you can check to see how many unconfirmed transactions there are at a given moment and calculate how long it will take.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Confirmations\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum blockchain confirmations, the agreed-upon number seems to be undecided. According to the Ethereum white paper, 7 confirmations should be enough to confirm the transaction (about 2 minutes).\n\nHowever, Ethereum miners must check the parameters of the last 250 blocks. So, if you want to err on the side of caution like the miners, you should wait for 250 confirmations. This sounds like a lot, but in practice is only about an hour.\n\nCoinbase requires 50 ethereum confirmations before considering a transaction complete. It should also be noted that the Ethereum blockchain faces significant scalability issues as well. Ethereum is working to scale quickly to take on more users, and through Proof of Stake, confirmations should be even quicker.\n\nEtherscan and Ether Gas\n\nEthereum doesn\u2019t have a mempool for pending transactions; it\u2019s simply called the transaction pool. The pool contains all the transactions submitted that haven\u2019t yet been assigned to a block.\n\nThere are multiple methods for speeding up your transaction and deciding on the best gas price when sending your Ethereum transaction. You can try ETH Gas Station to see an overview of gas usage, and you can see how many transactions are pending by using Etherscan.\n\nEtherscan is particularly popular since you can order transactions by gas price (simply click on the GasPrice column). You\u2019ll then see more or less the same list that miners see and, if you select a gas price that is within the first couple of pages, you should enjoy short confirmation times.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Wrapping up Bitcoin Confirmations\n\nBlockchain confirmations are essential for securing your transactions. The best way of ensuring a faster confirmation is by paying a higher fee. As all blockchains begin scaling up to prepare for even more users, it will be interesting to see how that affects the prices we pay and the times we wait."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nAfter a euphoric week, leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ended Sunday in the red, and selling continued to this week\u2019s open. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $42.1K, down 4.07% today, while Ethereum is at $2.23K, down 4.87%.\n\nHowever, traders continue to rally behind Bitcoin ETF Token as its presale surges toward $3.5 million.\n\nMarket overconfidence corrected, but analysts fear another flush\n\nWarning signs of a steep correction have been everywhere over the past few days. Many analysts urged market participants to proceed cautiously, but some believe another flush is imminent even after the recent correction.\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s Crypto Fear and Greed Index entered the \u201cextreme greed\u201d zone, indicating that the market may be overbought. This represents a high-risk time for new buyers to enter the market, as a selloff is necessary to restore balance.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto funding rates recently reached a local high. This indicates significantly more long orders than short orders in the market, causing bulls to pay a premium to rebalance.\n\nHigh funding rates are often followed by a \u201cflush,\u201d where futures positions are forcibly closed, causing prices to cascade in the opposite direction.\n\nYou might also like: Will Bitcoin ETFs follow gold ETFs\u2019 path to success?\n\nThis was highlighted by the analyst Mister Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s high funding rates were \u201csignaling a top.\u201d\n\nIn the analysis, Mister Crypto noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price retraced by 20% each time its funding rates reached their recent levels.\n\nGiven Bitcoin has pulled back less than 5% so far, this could indicate a much deeper correction is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent X commentator MrChief predicts that the market will \u201cpullback enough to stop out early buyers & get bears super excited then reverse back up.\u201d\n\nHowever, other analysts believe the crypto market may be poised for a longer-term pullback. One is RektCapital, who referenced earlier market cycles\u2019 price action to suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin Pre-Halving top may be very close.\u201d\n\nThat said, the Bitcoin halving is just 137 days away and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the cusp of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, the market looks poised for a solid mid-term trajectory.\n\nEven so, market participants seeking growth appear to be considering Bitcoin ETF Token whose presale is in progress.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token presale raises $3.4 million in 1 month\n\nBitcoin ETF Token has raised almost $3.5 million in one month. The project features multiple use cases, rewarding holders as the SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe project features a deflationary mechanism. 25% of its supply is reserved to be burned across five Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each target.\n\nThese scarcity-focused features, combined with the anticipated $1 trillion in liquidity entering the crypto market from the Bitcoin ETFs, could support Bitcoin ETF Token.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin breaks above $40k, Bitcoin ETF Token raises nearly $2.5m\n\nFurther supporting this is the project\u2019s current early stage and low market cap at launch of just $12.39 million.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token also has a staking mechanism, offering a 79% APY. Even so, this will decrease as more tokens are staked, incentivizing buyers to get in early to maximize their gains.\n\nThe project also offers a Bitcoin ETF Alerts service. This is a news feed that pulls latest Bitcoin updates from around the web into one place. The feature aims to foster a more active and engaged community.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale"
