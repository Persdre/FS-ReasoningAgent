        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months as investors move their capital within the crypto markets to generate more gains.\n\nPal tells the 21,300 subscribers of his YouTube channel that Ethereum will \u201cmassively outperform\u201d Bitcoin just like how lower-rated junk bonds tend to surpass the higher-rated treasuries when investors rotate their capital.\n\nAccording to Pal, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will positively impact Ethereum as he expects market participants to reinvest their BTC gains in ETH.\n\n\u201cSo ETH is just doing what it\u2019s supposed to be doing. But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF. And it\u2019ll bring the ETH ecosystem alive.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s been a story of Solana which I\u2019ve been long all year, and Bitcoin. That barbell has been the best trade in the world. Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021. [In] 2019, [Bitcoin] came out of the gates really, really fast then corrected, then we had Covid-19, which we\u2019re not going to repeat.\n\nI know many people are expecting \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to get a 50% collapse and you buy that one.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll get corrections. I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently made a bold assertion about the future of blockchain interoperability and the role of Solana in the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, Yakovenko described Solana as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution through the Wormhole EigenLayer.\n\nThis would be possible because of advancements in \"danksharding,\" a scaling solution for Ethereum, suggesting a future where Solana blocks could be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum.\n\nExploring interoperability\n\nYakovenko's comments sparked a discussion about the technicalities and implications of such an integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe clarified that Solana would only mint the wrapped version in its state after Ethereum achieves full finality, addressing concerns about potential reorganizations (reorgs) of the blockchain.\n\nThe concept of \"social consensus\" was emphasized, which suggests flexibility in how Solana and Ethereum might interact.\n\nThis flexibility could allow users to fork off into their own layer-1 1 (L1) blockchain, using a snapshot root. Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

        "content": "Crypto traders\u2019 interest in Solana remains very high as the trading volume for the digital asset surpassed that of Bitcoin and Ethereum on major centralized exchanges during the weekend.\n\nConor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, first pointed out this milestone on Dec. 24, saying SOL saw more trading than the combination of the top two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nRiyad Carey, an analyst with Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko, further corroborated this finding, saying the same trend was observed on Kraken and Gemini, two of the largest U.S.-based crypto trading platforms.\n\nSOL\u2019s trading volume also beat BTC and ETH on UPbit and MEXC for the past 2 and 3 days, respectively.\n\nCarey further shared a chart showing that SOL\u2019s trading activities, compared to ETH and BTC, were experiencing an uptrend. According to the chart, SOL trading is approaching 40% of trading activities on centralized crypto platforms, while ETH and BTC were declining.\n\nAccording to Carey, these metrics are \u201cunprecedented\u201d and show the sustained interest SOL is currently generating in the market.\n\nWhy SOL volume is rising\n\nOver the past year, Solana has experienced remarkable growth, defying earlier associations with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Despite this, the network has flourished, attracting an expanding user base.\n\nDuring this period, Solana forged strategic alliances with renowned global financial players like Visa and Shopify. These partnerships harness blockchain technology to streamline payment procedures, showcasing SOL\u2019s network\u2019s potential to a broader global audience.\n\nMoreover, the recent surge in interest surrounding the Solana-based BONK memecoin and the resurgence of decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the smart contract-enabled blockchain have contributed significantly to its recent upward trajectory.\n\nThese developments have helped push the price of SOL to new highs, up more than 800% on the year-to-date metric to nearly $120 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

        "content": "What is the Polygon Bridge?\n\nThe Polygon Bridge is a powerful tool that allows for the transfer of assets from the Ethereum network to the ex-Matic network, now called Polygon. It promises speed, coupled with low transaction fees, as remedies to some of the scalability issues facing Ethereum.\n\nThe idea of deploying the Polygon Bridge rests on the ability it gives users to take full advantage of the much cheaper fees and faster speeds on Polygon, all while still having the security of Ethereum. Learn more about the Polygon Bridge and its benefits.\n\nBridging Polygon for Frictionless Transfers\n\nGenerally speaking, for the utilization of the Polygon Bridge, you need to connect an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, with the bridge platform. Transferring Ether and other ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon is relatively easy and intuitive while using the Polygon Bridge, as it supports both ways.\n\nHence, it would be quite easy to move your assets between these two chains. For detailed steps on how to bridge Ether to Polygon, visit our guide.\n\nSteps to Bridge Ether to Polygon\n\nHow To Bridge Tokens From Ethereum to Polygon PoS Via the PoS Bridge?\n\nThe PoS Bridge is a smart contract that helps users transfer their ETH or ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa. To access the PoS Bridge, follow the steps below:\n\nGo to the Polygon web wallet, and click on the native bridge.\n\nGA pop-up will appear requesting that you connect your wallet to the Polygon web wallet.\n\nYou can choose between 4 different wallets. For example, you can choose your MetaMask wallet.\n\nApprove the Polygon web wallet smart contract.\n\nIf you have never bridged before, a message will appear asking you to sign a transaction. If you have bridged with the web wallet previously, you won\u2019t see this message.\n\nIf you have never bridged before, a message will appear asking you to sign a transaction. If you have bridged with the web wallet previously, you won\u2019t see this message. Choose the asset/amount to bridge. Select the asset that you want to bridge from Ethereum to Polygon, and choose Transfer.\n\nConfirm the transaction and pay the gas fee.\n\nYou confirm this transaction by going through some confirmation windows. Then, you click \u201cContinue\u201d on each window.\n\nYou confirm this transaction by going through some confirmation windows. Then, you click \u201cContinue\u201d on each window. Finally, sign the transaction in your MetaMask interface\n\nA MetaMask pop-up will appear and will ask you to confirm and sign the transaction. Upon doing that, the assets will bridge, and you will have to wait some minutes for them to arrive on Polygon.\n\nHow to Bridge MATIC Using the Polygon Bridge\n\nThe Polygon Bridge allows the transfer of MATIC; thus, users can bridge their native tokens from Ethereum to Polygon. Since it is the native token of the Polygon network, bridging it brings huge advantages: drastically reduced transaction fees and a great increase in speed.\n\nThe process is just about transferring ETH, with the added advantage that, on the Polygon network, MATIC can be used to pay transaction fees. Explore more about the Polygon Bridge MATIC transfer process.\n\nBridging Polygon with MetaMask\n\nPolygon Bridge with MetaMask is the most used when it comes to transferring assets. It has a very friendly user interface for connecting to the Polygon Bridge. Just log in to your MetaMask account, connect to the bridge, and initiate your transfer.\n\nThat ease of integration with MetaMask has made it one of the most used wallets when working with Polygon. For further information, check out our guide on Polygon Bridge MetaMask.\n\nArbitrum Polygon Bridge: Layer-2 Solution Connector\n\nThe Arbitrum Polygon Bridge is designed to enable users operating on both chains to move their assets seamlessly across both Arbitrum and Polygon. The need for an interplay of assets between both chains is increasing, with Arbitrum and Polygon growing in appeal.\n\nIt is a cross-chain bridge that allows tokens to move seamlessly between Arbitrum and Polygon and gives the flexibility of cross-network operability. Learn more about the Arbitrum Polygon Bridge.\n\nAvalanche to Polygon Bridge: Cross-Chain Operability\n\nThe Avalanche to Polygon Bridge finally connects two of the fastest-rising blockchain networks. As users and developers look for scalability and efficiency, a bridge that will connect Avalanche to Polygon in terms of the transfer of assets becomes important.\n\nThrough this bridge, users will be able to transfer tokens from Avalanche to Polygon and leverage the unique value proposition that each has. For additional details, see our article on the Avalanche to Polygon Bridge.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Polygon Bridge changes the game for users who aim to maximize the use of multiple blockchains simultaneously. Be it ETH, MATIC, or any other tokens transferred between Arbitrum and Avalanche, among others, this tool creates a seamless and cost-effective experience. By integrating with MetaMask, users can bridge their assets easily by leveraging the speed and scalability of the Polygon network."

        "content": "Mon 25 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe Solana blockchain has been in full euphoria for the past few days, with SOL surpassing $100 this weekend for the first time since April 2022. Driven by a record trading volume, Solana vastly outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSolana and the crypto comeback of the year\n\nThe Solana network continues to attract new users and investors. Over the last 24 hours, the spot trading volume of SOL/USDT reached an impressive $1.037 billion on Binance, surpassing that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSimultaneously, the volume of SOL futures contracts exploded to $4.7 billion on the platform, well beyond BTC and ETH. Solana thus confirms its position as the most traded crypto of the moment on Binance.\n\nThis frenzied enthusiasm for the decentralized network mechanically boosts the price of SOL, which has increased by over 25% in 24 hours to reach $115. The market capitalization is now flirting with $45 billion, which propels Solana to the 4th rank of cryptos, ahead of BNB.\n\nRegained Trust\n\nThis spectacular rise attests to the renewed investor confidence in this ambitious project after a disastrous year in 2022. Let\u2019s remember that SOL\u2019s price had plummeted by more than 96% between its historical high of $260 in November 2021 and its June 2022 low.\n\nThe FTX debacle and the legal troubles of its former head Sam Bankman-Fried, an avid supporter of Solana, had then cast doubt on its viability. But since then, the resilience and vitality of Solana\u2019s decentralized applications have burnished its reputation.\n\nThe resilience shown by Solana in recent months has proven the solidity of its fundamentals. Moreover, the enthusiasm for decentralized applications built on Solana continues to grow, as seen in the success of Play-to-Earn games like Star Atlas.\n\nSolana also owes its success to the dynamism of its native token ecosystem. Viral coins like BONK and Dogewifhat (WIF) have been lighting up the network for the past few weeks. Last week, the weekly volume of DEX on Solana even eclipsed that of Ethereum for the first time!\n\nThus, despite still being highly volatile, the future seems brighter than ever for the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d and its SOL token, now firmly anchored in the top 5 cryptos. It remains to be seen whether this spectacular rebound marks a true resurgence or is just another flash in the pan as the crypto-sphere has too often seen in the past.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Meme coins are still making the rounds across various blockchains and have managed to become an integral part of crypto investing. With each chain and its supporters, there have been different meme coins that have made the rounds, giving outstanding performances, and making investors a lot of money. So here are the top meme coins across various blockchains on Christmas Day.\n\nMeme Coins On Ethereum\n\nEthereum has been known as the king of meme coins with the most prominent meme coins having come out of here. Naturally, the chain has continued to see a lot of support from investors who continue to support the likes of Shiba Inu which remains the largest meme coin on the blockchain.\n\nShiba Inu is still holding up at a market cap of $6.3 billion, making it the second-largest meme coin in the market, and the largest meme coin on Solana. So even with thousands of meme coins making their way to Ethereum, SHIB remains a prominent player.\n\nSHIB price maintains a hold on $0.00001 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSolana Welcomes New Found Volume\n\nThe Solana ecosystem has only recently become a hub for meme coins but investors have already taken to it like fish to water. In the last few months, there have been insane outperformance from some of these tokens but the most prominent remains the Dog With Hat (WIF) meme coin.\n\nThe meme coin went from trading under a $100,000 market cap to running to more than $300 million in the space of a month. It has also been listed on centralized exchanges such as MEXC and Crypto.com, showing the support that the altcoin is getting.\n\nArbitrum Welcomes New Meme Coins\n\nOn the Arbitrum blockchain, NOLA has emerged as one of the most prominent meme coins. Receiving support from the Arbitrum team, the coin quickly rallied, reaching almost a $20 million cap before eventually falling back downward.\n\nNOLA\u2019s price has since fallen more than 50% since reaching its all-time high. It is now sitting at a $5.8 million market cap and averaging around $500 in daily volume, at the time of writing.\n\nAVAX Rally Breathes New Life Into Avalanche\n\nThe Avalanche network has had one of the worst go of it this year, with the AXAX price dropping to as low as $9. However, the network has been able to shake off this underperformance and is back on the radar of investors. In the same vein, meme coins have also become a prominent feature on Avalanche.\n\nCOQ Inu is currently the leading meme coin on the blockchain which went as high as a $200 million market cap. Despite a retrace, its market cap is still high at around $180 million and averaging $4 million in volume daily.\n\nOptimism Meme Coins Are In\n\nAs investors seek other chains to try their luck out on, Optimism has naturally been in the picture. The top-performing meme coin on the blockchain currently is the TUX meme coin which has struggled to put on a rally like those on other chains.\n\nNevertheless, the TUX meme coin was able to go from under $1 million to around a $4 million market cap before retracing. At the time of writing, TUX is sitting at a $1.7 million market cap, with almost $300,000 in daily volume.\n\nFeatured image from BSC News, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have made their presence almost worldwide, prompting investors and traders worldwide to invest in them and gain substantial ROI. However, it is crucial to note that these fascinating cryptocurrencies are highly risky due to unprecedented price volatility, causing investors to incur many losses. Ethereum, a prominent cryptocurrency and decentralized blockchain, continues gaining traction and prominence in the sector despite the various potential challenges.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Ethereum is recognized as a cutting-edge smart contract, the up-to-date innovation on which our article is based, and resonates with all Ethereum investors and fanatics. Apart from delving into this innovation, it is crucial to understand existing security issues on the Ethereum network. So, let\u2019s comprehensively unravel Ethereum\u2019s innovations and security issues below.\n\nSecurity Challenges on Ethereum\n\nBeosin\u2019s discoveries, such as the substantial losses in quarter three. Blockchain security firm Beosin\u2019s recent findings, outlined in the \u201cGlobal Web3 Security Report,\u201d highlight the precarious state of security on the Ethereum network. These revelations shed light on the prevalent vulnerabilities affecting the blockchain.\n\nKey statistics on losses due to rug pulls and phishing schemes. Beosin\u2019s report exposes the financial toll inflicted on crypto investors during quarter three, with a staggering $282.96 million lost to rug pulls. This alarming figure emphasizes the urgent need for heightened security measures within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPointing out Ethereum\u2019s susceptibility to security incidents. Quarter three also witnessed the proliferation of phishing schemes, resulting in losses amounting to $66.15 million. Ethereum\u2019s susceptibility to such schemes highlights the growing menace of fraudulent activities plaguing the network.\n\nBeosin\u2019s comprehensive report concludes that Ethereum faced the highest losses and incidents overall. This designation accentuates the critical need for proactive security measures to safeguard users against the persistent security threats looming over the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIssues with the Solidity Compiler\n\nChaals Nevile, who is a technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), has reportedly highlighted specific issues about the Ethereum network\u2019s security, specifically in the Solidity compiler. Simply put, according to Nevile, the emergence of new bugs while dealing with old bugs as the compiler evolves is a critical issue.\n\nThe European Economic Area, or the EEA, set up the \u201cEth Trust Security Levels Working Group\u2019 in November 2020 in light of the issues to be addressed. This group played a pivotal role in releasing the \u201cEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1\u201d in August 2022, offering a comprehensive framework for developers and organizations navigating the intricacies of Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s primary programming language.\n\nEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelease of the v1 Specification: The EEA released the EthTrust Security Levels v1 Specification in November 2020. This release did not take time to resonate with developers, organizations, and customers due to the structured framework it provided. It paved the way for them to deal with the challenges using Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s key programming language.\n\nFramework purpose: How it serves as a framework for reviewing smart contracts. The v1 Specification serves as a key framework for users evaluating smart contract programmed code set down in Solidity. Simply put, the framework helps users evaluate the code prudently and utilize smart contracts more effectively.\n\nOngoing security focus: Recognition that the framework is designed to accommodate ongoing security developments. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the Ethereum network, Chaals Nevile emphasizes the adaptability of the EthTrust Security Levels Specification. While v1 covers bugs up to 2022, it remains designed to accommodate ongoing and emerging security developments, reflecting the commitment to maintaining the highest security standards.\n\nRelease of EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2\n\nAs reported by Nevile, the EEA, which is not fully satisfied with the release and effectiveness of Eth Trust Security Levels Specification v1, announced the release of v2 for enhanced performance. Hopefully, EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 works like a charm to get on top of various issues, for example, addressing newly detected bugs in the Solidity compiler, ironing out rounding errors, read-only reentrancy attacks, etc.\n\nCase Study: The DAO Hack\n\nThe DAO Hack of 2016 is recognized as a notable event in Ethereum\u2019s history, catalyzed by the notorious reentrancy vulnerability. This classic case, outlined by Lewellen, highlighted the exploitable nature of reentrancy, resulting in a staggering loss of $3.64 million in ETH. The incident spurred heightened awareness and a paradigm shift in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s security approach.\n\nIndustry Adoption of EthTrust Standards\n\nOpenZeppelin\u2019s use: How OpenZeppelin utilizes EthTrust Security Levels v1 for pre-audit assessments. OpenZeppelin, aware of the critical importance of security, actively employs the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to fortify its defenses against vulnerabilities. Acting as a pre-audit assessment tool, this framework ensures meticulous checks during the audit process, offering clients invaluable insights into potential security lapses.\n\nClient feedback: Positive feedback from a client who found value in implementing EthTrust requirements. An anonymous OpenZeppelin client disclosed to Crypto News the transformative impact of EthTrust. The client shared how previous security audits faltered due to unclear guidance, emphasizing newfound confidence after implementing EthTrust requirements. This endorsement underscores EthTrust\u2019s efficacy in fortifying Ethereum projects.\n\nAwareness challenges: Chaals Nevile acknowledges the uphill battle of gaining recognition for the EthTrust standard despite positive feedback. Overcoming these challenges is crucial, especially in introducing the framework to developers and organizations. Notably, EthTrust\u2019s applicability to newer Ethereum projects emphasizes its potential impact in enhancing security protocols, particularly in the context of Ethereum casino sites. Raising awareness about the EthTrust standard becomes imperative for its broader adoption and ensuring a secure environment, especially within the dynamic sphere of Ethereum casino gambling.\n\nConcerns and Future Developments\n\nJohn Wingate\u2019s concerns about the dynamic nature of industry standards. John Wingate, CEO of BankSocial, expresses concerns about the ever-evolving landscape of industry standards. He highlights the perpetual changes in languages, including the depreciation of methods, variables, data types, and object types. The dynamic nature challenges consistency and adherence to the best practices within the blockchain space.\n\nConfirmation that version 3 is already in progress. In response to industry dynamics, Chaals Nevile reveals that EthTrust is actively evolving, with version 3 of the specification already underway. Recognizing the need for regular updates, Nevile aims to ensure EthTrust remains relevant and effective in addressing emerging security challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportance of testing: Emphasizing the need for repeatable, automated testing for decentralized applications. John Wingate emphasizes the significance of repeatable, automated testing as the paramount method to guarantee decentralized applications adhere to best practices. Automated testing is a crucial tool in fortifying the resilience of decentralized systems against potential security exploits.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering the complexity of Ethereum\u2019s security, the discourse around EthTrust emerges as a beacon for fortification. From exposing vulnerabilities like reentrancy to deploying the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework, the Ethereum community is actively fortifying its defenses. While positive feedback underscores EthTrust\u2019s efficacy, challenges in industry adoption persist. Chaals Nevile\u2019s assurance of version 3\u2019s progress signals a commitment to staying ahead in the security paradigm. John Wingate\u2019s advocacy for automated testing reinforces the imperative of proactive measures.

        "content": "The crypto market is known for its volatility and altcoins play a crucial role in this dynamic ecosystem. As we look ahead to 2024, predicting the price movements of altcoins becomes a speculative exercise based on various factors such as technological advancements, market sentiment, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends.\n\nIn this article, we will explore some key altcoins and offer predictions for their potential performance in 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum has a very robust legacy in the crypto industry, ranking next only to Bitcoin, and boasts of a market capitalization of $275,825,443,724.\n\nWhile Ethereum has faced enormous criticism from top market analysts this month, its legacy as the first and biggest smart contract network can fuel a major increment in its adoption and ultimately price shortly.\n\nWith its thriving ecosystem, Ethereum maintains a price target of $3,500 by the end of 2024.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nIf Polkadot, currently trading at $7.97 successfully positions itself as a hub for cross-chain communication, analysts predict its value may climb to $8.37 next year. The plans to sunset parachain auctions on the Polkadot network could be a key driver for DOT\u2019s price in 2024.\n\nOn the weekly time frame, Polkadot is currently trending bullish with the 50-day moving average currently sloping up and below the current Polkadot price, which could act as a support the next time it interacts with it.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana has gained prominence for its high output and low transaction costs. Notably, Solana is back on the rise after flipping the resistance at $70 and turning it into its medium-term support. The protocol\u2019s growth came despite exposure to the bankrupt exchange FTX and the accompanying selloffs.\n\nThe well-acclaimed Ethereum killer has steadily climbed in value this year, reaching a yearly high of $96.69 after plummeting to $8 following the crash of FTX.\n\nSolana has seen 17/30 (57%) green days and 12.15% price volatility in the past 30 days and if the Solana ecosystem continues to attract developers and projects, analysts project that SOL\u2019s price could climb to $150 in 2024.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP, which is closely associated with Ripple Labs Inc has increased 68% in the last year and is currently trading at $0.622 as of the time of writing.\n\nXRP\u2019s bullish resurgence started with Ripple\u2019s landmark win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July. Although the case is likely to be resolved in 2024, the historical victories Ripple has had against the SEC show that the coin has a bright future.\n\nBased on past XRP price movements and BTC halving cycles, the yearly low XRP price prediction for 2024 is $ 0.423835. Meanwhile, the price of XRP is expected to reach $ 1.707555 next year if the expected market boom truly emerge\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nChainlink, with a market cap of $8.76 billion, has performed remarkably well in the 2023 market rebound. It presently ranks 13th in terms of market capitalization in the crypto industry. However, LINK prices are 70% lower than their all-time high of $54.40.\n\nThe token, native to one of crypto\u2019s most sought-after Oracle protocols, is trading at $15.42 at the time of writing. The recent increase in LINK price suggests a bullish breakout of a rounding bottom pattern in the daily chart, with a target of $16.56.\n\nAs projected, if LINK price rises above $20, the released trapped momentum will enhance the altcoin\u2019s value. The breakout rally, combined with the highly anticipated altcoin season of 2024, will drive LINK prices to a new all-time high of $60. However, if there is a decline in mid-2024, a retest to $20 is also possible.\n\nChainlink has the right fundamentals and adoption spree to record the projected $60 price target.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche has had a stunning reversal after rising to new heights with a promising start in 2023. The coin\u2019s price, currently trading at $44.97 is a major showcase of resilience seeing AVAX drop as low as $9.11 for the year\n\nWhile the current scenario for AVAX shows anything is possible, a more shiny silver lining is ahead. If the market starts a bullish cycle, the AVAX coin price might rise. In this case, AVAX can swing high to $80 by the end of 2024. This would be a big comeback and a source of hope for investors.\n\nIn contrast, if the market remains dominated by sellers and bearish sentiment persists, AVAX may experience additional downward pressure. If that were to happen, the coin\u2019s price might plummet to a dangerous low of $22.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.
