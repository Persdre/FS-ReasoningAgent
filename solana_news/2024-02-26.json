        "title": "4 Crypto Stocks to Watch in the 2024 Ethereum Institutional Rally - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum (ETH), has started 2024 on a great note. While Bitcoin (BTC), too, has been fast off the blocks, rising 20% year to date, ETH has risen 33%. Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nThe network has, over the past year, completed the Shanghai Upgrade. The upgrade has ensured that it shifts its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Under the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nThis has led to far stricter trading, and ETH supply has remained stagnant as a result. Also, the amount of Ether locked up has risen significantly, with ETH held on exchanges at an all-time low of 11%.\n\nHowever, per Bybit Research, the biggest boost has come from the new institutional investments. Institutions are over-allocating their portfolio to ETH compared to BTC. This is in contrast to the retail crypto market, where investors lean on Bitcoin.\n\nMajor players like Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, which already had Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are among firms that have submitted applications for an ether ETF. In fact, demand has gone up over the past few weeks, with market participants expecting a probable ether spot ETF approval by May of this year. ETH is currently trading above $3200, and the next earmarked resistance level is $3500.\n\nSo, with Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform. Here is a selection. These currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).

        "title": "The flippening debate: can Ethereum surpass Bitcoin? - crypto.news",
        "content": "Are we witnessing a seismic shift in the crypto market as Ethereum inches closer to Bitcoin in market cap?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) represent the twin pillars of the crypto market, collectively commanding nearly 70% of its total market cap.\n\nOver time, Bitcoin evolved from a novel concept to a global financial asset, gaining traction among institutions. As of Feb. 26, BTC\u2019s market cap is valued at over $1 trillion.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have amassed significant Bitcoin holdings, solidifying its popularity. Moreover, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) signals growing institutional acceptance.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum emerges as the second-largest player, with a market cap nearing $370 billion. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology underpins a diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nMoreover, the platform\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism through \u201cThe Merge\u201d in 2022 marked a crucial technological advancement aimed at addressing scalability, energy consumption, and security concerns.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community has long speculated about a potential event known as \u201cthe flippening,\u201d where Ethereum\u2019s market cap could surpass Bitcoin\u2019s. Can Ethereum overtake Bitcoin in the long run?\n\nBTC vs ETH: market cap and dominance\n\nSince its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has held its position as the leading crypto, dominating the market with a staggering market cap that has outstripped its competitors to date.\n\nBTC lifetime market cap chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAt the outset, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap was a mere $1 million in early 2011, but by early 2013, it had surged to $1 billion, marking an unprecedented 1000x increase. By the close of 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap had surpassed $9 billion.\n\n2017 proved crucial for Bitcoin, witnessing its market cap soar to over $300 billion for the first time. This surge was propelled by a retail and institutional investment frenzy and a rising interest in cryptocurrencies as a novel asset class.\n\nHowever, this meteoric rise was not without its setbacks. By Nov. 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap had breached the $1 trillion mark, only to plummet to around $320 billion by Dec. 2022.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum embarked on a more gradual trajectory. Despite its modest beginnings upon its launch in 2015, Ethereum quickly asserted itself among the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nETH lifetime market cap chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nIn Dec. 2015, while Bitcoin\u2019s market cap stood at over $6 billion, Ethereum\u2019s was a modest $60 million, marking a stark difference of 100-fold.\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, followed by the subsequent defi and NFT booms, catalyzed Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth.\n\nBy Dec. 2017, Ethereum\u2019s market cap had surged to $73 billion from $60 million in Dec. 2015, representing an astounding 1210x increase. This growth significantly narrowed the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s market caps to 3.25:1.\n\nBTC vs. ETH market cap dominance | Source: Glassnode\n\nConcurrently, the concept of \u201cBitcoin dominance\u201d \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s market cap as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market \u2013 emerged as a crucial metric for assessing the dynamics within the crypto space.\n\nInitially exceeding 90%, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance dwindled to below 45% by Dec. 2017 as altcoins, spearheaded by Ethereum, gained traction. As a result, this ratio further narrowed to approximately 2:1 in Dec. 2021, with Bitcoin\u2019s market cap at around $960 billion and Ethereum\u2019s at $483 billion.\n\nAs of Feb. 25, the ratio stood at approximately 2.75:1, with several bullish scenarios for Bitcoin, including the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving in Apr. 2024 and the SEC\u2019s approval of spot BTC ETFs in Jan. 2024, potentially tipping the scales in Bitcoin\u2019s favor in the short term.\n\nReal-world contributions of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe contributions of Bitcoin and Ethereum to the crypto space have become increasingly distinct, each carving out unique use cases and driving innovation in different directions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s expanding ecosystem\n\nBitcoin has witnessed strong growth in its ecosystem, particularly with the advent of new technologies and platforms.\n\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Jan. 2024 is expected to have a substantial impact, not only in enhancing Bitcoin\u2019s accessibility and appeal but also in fostering its position in global finance\u200b\u200b.\n\nTrust Machines reported an \u201cexplosive growth in Bitcoin use cases\u201d in the first quarter of 2023, highlighting the increasing developer interest in building atop Bitcoin.\n\nThis growth is attributed to the Stacks (STX) blockchain, which enables smart contracts, defi applications, NFTs, and apps directly on Bitcoin, thus broadening its utility beyond just a store of value\u200b\u200b.\n\nAmid this, Ordinals, introduced in Jan. 2023, have added a new dimension to Bitcoin\u2019s use cases by allowing information to be attached directly to individual satoshis through a process called \u201cinscribing.\u201d\n\nThis innovation has enabled the creation of Bitcoin-native NFTs, marking a crucial evolution in Bitcoin\u2019s functionality beyond its original scope as a digital currency.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB\u2019s working paper highlights Bitcoin\u2019s significant adoption in Emerging and Developing Economies (EMDEs), where it serves not only as an investment but also as a hedge against currency depreciation and a means to facilitate cross-border transactions.\n\nNew ECB paper provides empirical evidence that bitcoin is appreciated as a store of value & means of exchange in high-inflationary countries\n\n\n\nIs the ECB language on #Bitcoin shifting?\n\n\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, when the #btc price was $20k, the ecb blog featured an article\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1kJYrRLXqz \u2014 Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) December 5, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s diverse utility\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has been a frontrunner in facilitating a wide range of dapps, defi platforms, NFTs, and so on, thanks to its inherent smart contract capabilities.\n\nWhile the introduction of Ordinals and the ability to mint NFTs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain has been a significant development, Ethereum continues to hold a competitive edge in the NFT domain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s established standards, like ERC-721 and now with Ethscriptions, have made it the go-to platform for NFT creation and trading, offering a more straightforward process compared to Bitcoin\u2019s more recent entry into the space\u200b\u200b.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is the backbone of the defi sector, facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading through permissionless financial services. According to DefiLIama, as of Feb. 26, Ethereum has a total value locked (TVL) of around $48 billion, the largest amongst all other chains.\n\nEthereum has also emerged as the most used blockchain for the tokenization of real-world assets so far. This process involves converting rights to an asset into a digital token on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of various asset classes. Citi has predicted that tokenization could become a $4 trillion market by 2030.\n\nCan Ethereum overtake Bitcoin in the long run?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often regarded as digital gold, serving as a secure store of value, Ethereum is likened to digital oil, powering an expansive range of applications beyond mere financial transactions.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in a 2021 analysis, highlighted Ethereum\u2019s substantial \u201creal use potential\u201d due to its foundational role in running applications like defi protocols.\n\nThis utility, according to Goldman, positions Ethereum to potentially eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s value in the future. However, it\u2019s worth noting Goldman\u2019s predictions come with their fair share of misses, adding a layer of skepticism to such forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Cramer of \u201cMad Money\u201d has also thrown his weight behind Ethereum, citing its prevalent use in purchasing NFTs and other digital assets as a reason for its potential dominance over Bitcoin.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest projects a future where Ethereum reaches a staggering market cap of $20 trillion by 2030 while also predicting Bitcoin price to reach $1 million.\n\nSuch forecasts paint a picture where Ethereum\u2019s broad utility could redefine its position relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhile speculations about \u201cthe flippening\u201d persist, the reality is that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to coexist and thrive, each serving unique purposes within the broader crypto market.\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin in market cap speaks to its expansive utility and the growing demand for its technology.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s entrenched status as digital gold and its broadening use cases ensure its continued relevance and resilience.\n\nAs we move forward, it will be essential to keep an eye on how these platforms adapt to emerging challenges and opportunities in the quest to redefine money and commerce in the digital age."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Ether (ETH) is a popular cryptocurrency used on the decentralized Ethereum platform, which provides financial services like smart contracts and dApps. ETH transactions facilitate these services and require gas fees, paid in Ether\u2019s smallest unit, gwei, to process payments on the Ethereum blockchain. ETH transfer times average around 5 minutes, but this can vary due to factors like blockchain fee and network congestion. Higher fees can expedite transactions, while increased network traffic can cause delays. Transferring ETH between wallets typically takes about 10 minutes, but users can pay more in gas fees to speed up the process. Solana and Tether (USDT) transfers usually take about 1 and 2 minutes respectively, but times may vary based on network conditions. A hot wallet is an online storage for cryptocurrencies, which is convenient but less secure compared to cold storage. Etherscan is a tool for tracking Ethereum transactions, providing real-time data including transaction details and gas prices. Overall, the time it takes to transfer cryptocurrencies like ETH depends on the network\u2019s current load and the transaction fee paid. Users have the option to pay higher fees for faster processing, and tools like Etherscan allow for tracking the progress of transactions.\n\nEther (ETH), the Ethereum network-based cryptocurrency, is one of the most popular digital assets today, alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP).\n\nEthereum works as a fully decentralized software platform, with the aim of providing users around the world with a diverse choice of financial products and services such as smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). In doing this, the network uses the Ether crypto token to facilitate transactions and cover the so-called gas price, i.e. the transaction fee for these decentralized services on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow long does it take for Ethereum to transfer? ETH transfer time is approximately 5 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how transferring cryptocurrencies works for this type of transaction and how long it takes to process transactions with ETH and Ethereum-based assets like ERC20 tokens.\n\nThe Process of Transferring Cryptocurrency\n\nIf you want to store your ETH and use them for trading on exchange platforms such as Binance or Coinbase, you need to have an Ethereum wallet. After you have chosen one, like MetaMask, for example, you are ready to start transferring assets.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain consists of nodes, a term used for the software on the computers of Ethereum miners. Each miner is called a client in the Ethereum network, and every client operates a node of the blockchain.\n\nIn order for a cryptocurrency transaction to take place, the nodes are required to verify the validity of the transfer and to broadcast the currency to its destination.\n\nAlso, miners are responsible for grouping the transactions into blocks of data on the blockchain.\n\nThis is why the transfer of your digital assets isn\u2019t instantaneous. Each cryptocurrency blockchain has fluctuations of traffic and it\u2019s rather difficult to say exactly how much time it will take for a transaction to be confirmed as finished.\n\nFactors That Influence Cryptocurrency Transfer Time\n\nThe two main factors that influence asset transfer time are the blockchain fee and the blockchain busyness or network congestion for the currency you\u2019re transferring.\n\nFor instance, if there\u2019s a large number of transactions being carried out at the same time, or if there\u2019s a lot of pending transactions waiting to be processed, then the transaction will take longer. This also depends on the transaction fee you are willing to pay.\n\nIf you\u2019re prepared to pay a higher transaction fee, you won\u2019t need to wait for that many blocks to get mined. If you don\u2019t want to pay a higher fee, then you simply have to let the blockchain process your transaction at the standard pace, depending on the current network load.\n\nBlockchain transfer fees are small portions of your transferred assets, necessary to pay miners in order to confirm your transaction. When it comes to Ethereum, this fee is called a gas fee.\n\nEssentially, gas is the fuel of ETH transfers and the price of the fee is listed in gwei, which is the smallest base unit of Ether. The gas fee fluctuates on a daily basis, depending on network busyness and the number of active Ethereum miners, so it\u2019s best to use a calculator in order to get the numbers right.\n\nIf miners see that your transaction comes with a below-average gas fee, then they might choose to ignore it and prioritize other transactions with average or even higher fees.\n\nWhen exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat currency like USD, transferring the assets to a bank account can take up to several days, since you first have to transfer the funds to a crypto exchange site and then to your bank account. Some banks take up to five business days to process such a transaction.\n\nAlso, the transaction time depends on the type of exchange or payment provider you\u2019re using. If you transfer your funds via a service such as Wirex or Kraken, your transfer will be faster as these services optimize the transaction fee in order to achieve greater speed.\n\nHow Long Does Ethereum Take To Transfer vs Bitcoin Transactions\n\nLet\u2019s see the differences in the average estimated time for Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions. Both currencies require a specific number of confirmations before the final approval.\n\nBitcoin Transactions\n\nA BTC transfer needs at least 3 confirmations on the Bitcoin network for the transaction to go through. If you pay a higher fee, your transaction can be finished with the use of fever blocks on the blockchain, which means less time.\n\nOn average, based on the usual activity of Bitcoin miners on the network, confirmation time for one transaction takes about 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum Transactions\n\nWhen transferring Ethereum-based assets, the transaction will be processed after it gets 12 confirmations on the Ethereum blockchain. This can take approximately 5 minutes.\n\nWith ETH, it\u2019s good to know that when you send multiple transactions, they can only be completed in the order in which you sent them. If you pay a higher transaction fee for the second batch of assets, it still can\u2019t be transferred before the first one.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow long does it take to send ETH to a crypto wallet?\n\nWallet transfer to another wallet address takes about 10 minutes. The process depends on how much gas you use when sending the transaction. If you want to speed up the process, you can increase the gas fees or try other wallets like Metamask.\n\nHow long will Solana transfer take?\n\nThe average transaction takes about 1 minute. However, some transactions may take longer depending on the number of confirmations needed for each block.\n\nHow long does USDT take to transfer?\n\nThe average transaction of Tether takes about 2 minutes. However, some transactions may take up to 10 minutes due to high demand.\n\nWhat is a hot wallet?\n\nA hot wallet is a digital wallet where users store their cryptocurrency. However, these wallets are also vulnerable to hacking attacks since they hold all of your private keys.\n\nWhat is Etherscan used for?\n\nEtherscan is a decentralized application which allows anyone to track transactions made through smart contracts. The platform provides real-time data about all Ethereum transactions. This information includes transaction amounts, gas prices, block numbers, contract addresses, and other details. You can check the status of your ETH transfer using Etherscan.\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nAs you can see, transferring any digital currency is a complex process with many factors that determine the time needed to carry out a transaction.\n\nWe hope that this information will help you plan your transactions and use the right tools when transferring assets.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "content": "Several tailwinds for Ethereum could positively impact price, Grayscale wrote Friday.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, a strong layer 2 ecosystem, and a possible ETF nod point to network maturation, Grayscale said.\n\nDencun signals a way to surmount scalability issues and \u201cwelcome outsiders.\u201d\n\nEthereum stands ready to move beyond its \u201cadolescent phase\u201d into one of maturation, Grayscale Research wrote in a blog post on Friday.\n\nSeveral tailwinds could positively impact price further, including the network\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, potential approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds in May, and a \u201cflourishing\u201d layer 2 ecosystem, the Bitcoin ETF issuer wrote.\n\nIt comes as the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency crossed its $3,000 threshold on February 20, tagging prices it hasn\u2019t seen since April 2022.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,100, up 7.5% over the last seven days, TradingView data shows.\n\n\u201cWith Ethereum\u2019s planned Dencun upgrade in March, Ethereum is on the cusp of growing up through a pivotal transformation aimed at addressing its scalability challenges,\u201d Grayscale wrote.\n\nMajor upgrade\n\nExpected to occur on March 13, Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade promises to bolster scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 platforms.\n\n\u201cEthereum is entering a new era,\u201d Grayscale wrote. \u201cWith its \u2018modular\u2019 design decision, Ethereum turns outward rather than inward as it welcomes outsiders with new product ideas and specialities.\u201d\n\nWhereas monolithic blockchains, like Bitcoin, use a single layer for all their functionalities, modular blockchains like Celestia distribute core functions across multiple layers.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe launch of layer 2 platforms marked a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s quest for scalability.\n\nLayer 2 platforms aggregate transactions, bundle them and then relay a condensed version back to the Ethereum network for final settlement.\n\nIn other words, they allow Ethereum transactions to be conducted on separate blockchains, away from the Ethereum mainnet, for much lower fees.\n\nEthereum generated a little over $2 billion in network fees in 2023, Grayscale noted.\n\nAnd its layer 2 platforms, Arbitrum and Optimism, brought in $16 million and $8 million, respectively.\n\nBy contrast, competing smart contract network Solana garnered $13 million in revenue over the same period.\n\nETF approval\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission also has a good chance of approving spot Ethereum ETFs in May, DL News reported.\n\nGrayscale said a spot Ethereum ETF could bring the asset \u201cfurther into the awareness of both institutions and the broader public.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a net benefit for Grayscale.\n\nAfter converting its flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into a spot Bitcoin ETF on January 10, the issuer is now seeking approval for a similar Ethereum-based product alongside rivals, including VanEck.\n\nThe approval deadline for VanEck\u2019s application is May 23.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe reasoning behind the mass regulatory nod, at least when it came to Bitcoin ETFs: The agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving any one fund ahead of others, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts said last year.\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied on Tuesday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies jumped amid speculation for another extended rally ahead of the first Ether ETFs.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday amid news of growing crypto adoption and speculation surrounding the timing of the first spot Ethereum-centric exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals.\n\nWhen all was said and done during today's regular trading session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -0.09%) was up 4.5%, Ethereum (ETH -0.78%) had gained 1.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.96%) climbed 12.2%.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs approved, are Ether ETFs next?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin climbed above $57,000 today for the first time since December 2021, apparently bolstered by record inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Around $2.5 billion flowed into digital asset investment products last week, according to data from crypto research firm CoinShares, with Bitcoin funds responsible for 99% of those inflows. That influx of capital followed a historic decision last month by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to simultaneously approve the first 13 applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThose approvals, of course, were the culmination of months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August that prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. That inaction put the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its Bitcoin ETF approval process.\n\nFor several weeks leading up to the SEC's multiple thumbs up, many opportunistic traders capitalized on a broad crypto rally while noting that ETFs are a much more accessible medium for investors hoping to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage, in contrast to the previous need for investors to set up separate crypto accounts or wallets with a crypto-specific broker. The approvals also stand tall as a de facto vote of confidence from a government agency in crypto ETFs as a legitimate investment medium.\n\nStill, it's worth noting that after a multi-month rally that began in October, major cryptocurrencies initially pulled back following the official launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs six weeks ago.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm CryptoQuant, however, the capital influx stemming from spot crypto ETFs -- including a potential Ether ETF next -- has the potential to increase the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization by a total of more than $1 trillion over the long term.\n\nTo that end, crypto traders have now turned their eyes toward the date of May 23, 2024 -- which is the final deadline for the SEC to approve (or deny) spot Ether ETF applications from multiple investment management companies including VanEck and Ark's 21Shares.\n\nWhat's next for crypto investors?\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that spot Ether ETFs will be approved in May. But given the similarity of the assets and the precedent set by the dozens of now-live Bitcoin ETFs, the likelihood of an SEC denial seems extraordinarily low with the proverbial crypto ETF floodgates already opened.\n\nBut with the May 23 deadline now less than three months away, analysts at both Bloomberg and Standard Chartered have mused in recent weeks that anticipation of the first Ether ETFs could spark a similar extended rally to what we saw leading up to the first Bitcoin ETF approvals. Considering the Bitcoin ETF hype cycle appeared to spark its own rally around three months prior to those approvals, it's no surprise we're now seeing increased speculation surrounding the potential Ether ETF approval timeline.\n\n\"The Ether spot [ETF] is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot for sure,\" mused Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas last month. \"It's gonna go wherever it goes -- it's basically like on a 15-foot rope following it.\"\n\nIn the end, keep in mind these hype-based gains could be fickle over the short term. But there's obviously multiple billions of very real dollars each week flowing into crypto assets as the world steadily appears to be accepting it as a valid place to park capital. If that keeps happening, it will be no surprise to see the prices of major cryptocurrencies continue to rise accordingly."

        "title": "How Many Confirmations for Ethereum? - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: There are over 7,000 cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum being the second most popular after Bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies which function mainly as a store of value or medium of exchange, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Transactions on the Ethereum network are confirmed by miners who prioritize transactions with higher gas fees. The number of confirmations for a transaction can vary depending on the crypto exchange used, with different exchanges requiring different numbers of confirmations. Coinbase, for example, requires 35 confirmations for Ethereum, which typically takes around ten minutes. Binance requires 12 confirmations, also processed in under ten minutes, while Kraken needs 20 confirmations, which can take about five minutes. The number of confirmations for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also varies by exchange. Generally, Bitcoin transactions are considered final after at least three confirmations, which can take about 30 minutes depending on the network congestion and transaction volume. Overall, the confirmation time for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is influenced by the chosen exchange, the transaction fee (gas), and the current network load. Users should select platforms with high transaction throughput for faster confirmation times.\n\nOn the cryptocurrency market, there are over 7,000 digital currencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Zcash (ZEC), and many others.\n\nNext to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second most popular digital currency. However, unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins, Ethereum has been designed as more than just a store of value or a medium of exchange.\n\nThe Ethereum network is a decentralized and open-source computing network and operating system used for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Now, the question: how many confirmations does ETH need? Generally, ETH confirmations depend on the crypto exchange you are using.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain to you how Ethereum works and how the confirmation is done. After we finish explaining this, we\u2019ll be able to give you the number of confirmations you need for Ethereum for the three most popular exchanges.\n\nHow Many Block Confirmations Ethereum\n\nSame as Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Ethereum works on a blockchain network basis. A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized public ledger on which all the cryptocurrency transactions are recorded and confirmed.\n\nThe term distributed means that anyone who participates in the Ethereum network has an equivalent copy of the public ledger, which allows the participants to have an insight into all previous transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum network is decentralized due to the fact that it\u2019s maintained and operated by all the holders of the distributed ledger and not by any centralized authority.\n\nMoreover, this network is secure because its participants use complex cryptography to verify and confirm the transactions. Ethereum is unique because its users can develop apps that run on the Ethereum blockchain, just like software runs on our computers. These applications allow users to deal with complex financial transactions or transfer and store personal data.\n\nHow Many Confirmations Does Ethereum Need\n\nEvery Ethereum transaction contains the wallet address of the receiver, the amount of Ethereum that will be transferred, the private key to authenticate the transaction, and the transaction fee that the sender will pay (called a gas fee).\n\nSimilar to how the Bitcoin network works, the Ethereum network also consists of miners or validators who confirm the transactions and select the one with the highest fee first.\n\nThis means that if the amount of gas is larger, the miners will put this transaction on the blockchain as a priority, and the confirmation time will be shorter. On the other hand, lower gas leads to more time for transaction confirmation. The number of transactions that are pending is available on Etherscan.\n\nOnce you send the transaction, the coins won\u2019t be added to the block right away. Instead, they\u2019ll be redirected to the transaction pool, a place where all unconfirmed transactions end up.\n\nThe Ethereum miners pick up a transaction from this pool, authenticate the particular transaction, and create a block. Afterwards, in order to add the new block to the blockchain, the miners have to solve complex math equations. When the miners resolve these math equations, the new block gets confirmed and attached to the blockchain.\n\nThe number of transactions that the miners can incorporate into the blockchain is limited due to the blockchain gas limit. Therefore, the Ethereum network can process limited blockchain transactions.\n\nAfter the miners attach a new block on the blockchain, they can collect their reward in cryptocurrency tokens. The tokens that are used on the Ethereum network are known as Ether. With these tokens, you can sell and buy goods and services.\n\nHow Many Confirmations for Ethereum\n\nThe number of Ethereum block confirmations appears to be undecided. The Ethereum white paper suggests that seven confirmations can be sufficient in order for one transaction to be confirmed, which should take about two minutes.\n\nHowever, Ethereum transactions are usually made through cryptocurrency exchanges, and the number of block confirmations that are needed depends on the cryptocurrency exchange that you are using.\n\nIn other words, each cryptocurrency exchange decides the number of Ethereum confirmations needed. This isn\u2019t the case only with Ethereum, it\u2019s the same for Bitcoin, Litecoin, ZEC, Monero, BCH, EOS, ADA, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges and the number of confirmations they require.\n\nHow many confirmations does Coinbase need?\n\nCoinbase supports over 50 cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. For every one of these cryptocurrencies, Coinbase has a required number of confirmations:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Coinbase requires 35 confirmations, which takes around ten minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Coinbase requires 3 confirmations, completed in 30 minutes;\n\nLitecoin \u2013 12 confirmations in 30 minutes;\n\nEOS \u2013 It requires only one confirmation which takes only one minute.\n\nBinance ETH Confirmations\n\nBinance also supports over 50 cryptocurrencies, and it\u2019s well known for having some of the lowest transaction fees. Here are the number of confirmations that Binance requires:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Binance requires 12 network confirmations processed in under 10 minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 It requires only one confirmation, which takes approximately 10 minutes.\n\nKraken how many confirmations?\n\nKraken is another reliable cryptocurrency exchange on the market. Same as Coinbase and Binance, Kraken supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s see what the numbers look like here:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Kraken needs 20 confirmations and manages to process them in five minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 It needs 4 confirmations that take 40 minutes;\n\nLitecoin \u2013 It needs 12 confirmations, and it takes 30 minutes;\n\nEOS \u2013 It doesn\u2019t need any confirmation, meaning it\u2019s nearly instant.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many confirmations does a Bitcoin transaction need?\n\nA Bitcoin transaction needs at least three confirmations before it can be considered final. The number of confirmations needed depends on the network congestion and the amount being transacted.\n\nHow long is 12 network confirmations?\n\nThe length of 12 network confirmations depends on the blockchain protocol used. For example, Bitcoin uses 10 minutes for each block confirmation, whereas Ethereum takes around 15 seconds per block.\n\nHow long is 35 network confirmations?\n\nThe average number of blocks needed for a transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain is currently around 10 minutes. This means that if you send 1 BTC from one wallet to another, it will take about 30 minutes before it appears in both wallets.\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nOur team hopes that we\u2019ve managed to introduce you to the Ethereum cryptocurrency and how its decentralized network works.\n\nYou\u2019ve also learned that the number of Ethereum confirmations largely depends on the cryptocurrency exchange you\u2019re using, and even the gas fees can affect Ethereum confirmation time, which is why you should always opt for a platform with high transaction throughput like the ones suggested here.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "title": "How to Store Ethereum Offline - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized platform known for its smart contracts and dApps, using Ether as its native cryptocurrency. For secure offline storage of ETH, popular options include hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger Nano X, and paper wallets. Trezor provides strong security with a PIN and a 24-word seed phrase backup. Exodus is a user-friendly hot wallet that integrates with Trezor for added security. Ledger Nano X offers Bluetooth connectivity and security features like a secure chip and a PIN code. My Ether Wallet (MEW) is Ethereum\u2019s native web wallet with easy Ledger Nano X integration. Metamask is another good wallet for Ether, offering browser-based access to ERC20 tokens. Using a combination of these wallets can ensure both security and accessibility for your ETH holdings.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second most popular cryptocurrency today, right after Bitcoin (BTC). Its market capitalization is also second only to BTC, enabling people worldwide to use Ether for all sorts of transactions \u2013 from buying different products and trading the currency for fiat currency on exchange platforms to investing in different business ventures.\n\nEthereum is a fully decentralized software platform, with the aim of providing users with a diverse choice of defi products and services, such as smart contracts and decentralized applications or dApps for short.\n\nIn order to enable these and many more services, the Ethereum blockchain uses the Ether crypto token to carry out all sorts of transactions and to cover the transaction fees that are measured in gwei, the smallest denomination of ETH. There are also many altcoins based on the Ethereum network such as ERC20 tokens.\n\nSince Ethereum is such a popular cryptocurrency and is constantly traded in high volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, people need trusted and secure methods of storing their ETH.\n\nHow do you store Ethereum offline? There are different ways to keep your crypto safe and ready for use at all times, though the different types of wallets come with varying degrees of security. However, the most popular of them are Trezor, Exodus, Ledger Nano S, and My Ether Wallet. We will take a look at these methods and list some of the popular options for Ethereum cold storage.\n\nCryptocurrency Blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBefore we get to the storage options, let\u2019s take a quick look at how the Ethereum ecosystem works. In order to see the specific characteristics of the Ethereum blockchain, we will compare it to the most popular crypto network, the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin was the first crypto asset, with its famous peer-to-peer blockchain technology that enables miners to earn Bitcoin rewards while expanding the blockchain by verifying BTC transactions and preventing fraud in the form of double-spending. When enough transactions have been verified by miners whose computers are actually solving mathematical tasks that contribute to the verification of these transactions, a new BTC block is added to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the problem gets the BTC reward.\n\nThe ETH blockchain is also an open-source network but instead of solving mathematical problems, the network consists of developers and clients that use ETH to launch different smart contracts and dApps and pay for them.\n\nThe system nodes also verify transactions, using the proof-of-work algorithm which is based on having one network participant act as the prover and other participants as the verifiers who confirm the validity of the transaction by using a minimal amount of computational power. This sort of verification system enables the smooth functioning of smart contracts which are really the moving power behind the ETH blockchain, since they enable users to conduct business quickly, safely, and on their own terms.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts\n\nSo, what are smart contracts, and what is their role in the ETH network?\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain enables users to initiate and run smart contracts in order to carry out different computational tasks. The concept of smart contracts itself was a fresh innovation introduced by Ethereum back in 2015, when the network first appeared. These contracts were made to provide users with far more opportunities than just financial transactions, such as exchanges or cashouts of digital assets.\n\nThey are essentially really simple and their goal is to allow two interested parties to enter a business agreement that is solely based on the conditions they agree upon.\n\nThis eliminates the need for a broker who defines the contract conditions, since all the terms and conditions of a smart contract are directly negotiated between participants. There is no central authority (government institutions, banks) or digital middleman that defines the agreement apart from the two interested parties.\n\nSmart contracts essentially democratize the process of doing business by giving the opportunity and means to individuals, startups, and other companies to do business on whatever terms they agree upon with their partners.\n\nHot Storage vs. Cold Storage Ethereum\n\nNow that we have briefly introduced you to how the Ethereum blockchain works and what it\u2019s used for, we can move to the methods of storing your ETH. The first thing you need to decide when it comes to storing any type of crypto assets is what you want to use them for.\n\nDo you want to have small amounts of ETH available in just a few clicks, so you can carry out day-to-day payments? Maybe you\u2019re planning on serious investment using ETH to develop decentralized apps and conduct smart contracts on a daily basis, or you just want to store large amounts of Ethereum securely, so you can cash out bigger sums when needed.\n\nDepending on how you plan to use your ETH, you should decide what kind of cryptocurrency wallet you want to use, whether to go with hot storage (or so-called hot wallets), desktop wallets that are constantly connected to the internet, or with different types of cold storage (or cold wallets) that store your crypto data offline.\n\nYou can always choose one method for storing your crypto, but if you plan to use your assets in various ways, it\u2019s a good idea to diversify the wallets you use and combine both hot and cold storage.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nSince this guide is focused on storing Ethereum offline, we are going to take a closer look at cold wallets. Cold wallets are divided into two categories: hardware wallets and paper wallets.\n\nSince the cold wallets are offline, with no connection to the web, there is no chance of someone compromising your ETH and stealing your funds with your private key and public key. The only way someone could possibly get to your funds is if they physically find your wallet and steal it (if you have a paper wallet), but if you\u2019re using a state-of-the-art hardware wallet, you\u2019ll have an extra layer of protection in the form of a PIN code.\n\nCold wallets are a bit slower to use because they require additional steps when you want to check or exchange your funds, because the wallets aren\u2019t located on your PC, laptop, or smartphone.\n\nHowever, an additional minute or two to access your funds is really worth it in exchange for the top security of your funds. Storing ETH in cold wallets is especially recommended when you need to keep large amounts of assets. The possible risks associated with hot wallets, such as hackers or compromising transfers, are thus avoided.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are wallets in the form of specialized USB devices made by hardware wallet manufacturers. These devices store all the necessary data you need in order to access your crypto assets without exposing them to potential external breaches because they aren\u2019t connected to the internet. These wallets often come with special locks with PIN codes and encryption to add another level of security to your digital assets.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nPaper wallets are another form of highly secure cold wallets. Basically, a paper wallet is a piece of paper with the printed public and private keys to your funds, along with QR codes of the keys to enable quick access using a smartphone.\n\nSome people regard paper wallets as a secure way to store ETH offline, but keep in mind that with a paper wallet, you have to be careful where you keep it, so that it doesn\u2019t get physically damaged, like the print fading away and becoming useless.\n\nPopular ETH Cold Storage Wallets and Hot Wallets\n\nThese are some of the most popular Ethereum wallets. We picked two hardware wallets for safe offline storage of your ETH and two hot wallets that are compatible with hardware wallets as well for maximum protection.\n\nTrezor Hardware Wallet\n\nTrezor is one of the most trusted cold storage options available on the crypto market today. It is a key-sized device that stores your private keys securely and you can sign transactions with it, too. The hardware is so secure that you can even connect it with a USB cable to a computer infected with malware and your data still won\u2019t get compromised.\n\nYou have total control over the private keys stored on the device and you have the option to back up the content of the wallet with a 24-word seed phrase generated while setting up the device.\n\nYour seed phrase isn\u2019t generated while connected to the internet. It\u2019s generated offline and the words will appear on your Trezor device\u2019s screen. There is even a possibility to add an extra passphrase to the 24-word seed phrase, which means you have an additional layer of security just in case.\n\nExodus Crypto Wallet\n\nExodus is a multi-currency, multiplatform hot wallet that offers easy-to-use, fast services, and it\u2019s a popular tool for storing ETH. Users of Exodus have a superb online support team at their disposal that really excels in answering all questions related to the platform.\n\nWhen it comes to storing Ethereum offline, the main perk of Exodus is its partnership with Trezor, which enables a seamless connection between your hardware wallet and the Exodus wallet in just a few steps. All you need to do is pair your Trezor device with your Exodus account and you can transfer funds instantly between the two wallets or from Trezor to a bank account, debit or credit card.\n\nLedger Nano X\n\nLedger Nano X is a next-level hardware wallet that comes with increased capacity for storing crypto, along with Bluetooth connection capability. A USB cable connection is not necessary and you can control the wallet with your iOS or Android-based mobile device directly.\n\nAs far as security goes, your private keys remain perfectly safe in the Ledger Nano X security chip.\n\nYou also have the standard 24-word passphrase set up and an additional PIN code to ensure that even in the event of losing the device, no one can hack it and get access to your ETH. Ledger is a great choice for storing large amounts of Ethereum without worries.\n\nMy Ether Wallet\n\nMy Ether Wallet or MEW is the Ethereum network\u2019s native web wallet for storing ETH. It\u2019s easy to use, practical, and provides good security.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s even more important is the featured possibility of this hot wallet for a smooth connection to Ledger Nano X, giving you a very secure option for storing the bulk of your ETH offline, with easy access in combination with MEW.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Metamask a good wallet to store Ether?\n\nYes, Metamask is a great Ethereum wallet for storing Ether. The best thing about Metamask is that it allows users to access all ERC20 tokens from any browser. This means that you don\u2019t need to download anything to use Metamask.\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nThe popularity of Ethereum is ever growing, alongside Bitcoin and other popular altcoins like Litecoin and Ripple.\n\nWith the market cap increasing by the day, users need secure and trusted solutions for storing their ETH offline.\n\nWe\u2019ve presented you with the most practical methods to keep your ETH safe and easily accessible at the same time by offering combinations of the best hardware and software wallets on the market.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "title": "How Much Ether Does Vitalik Have? - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is a decentralized computing network that uses blockchain technology. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is designed to support decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, allowing complex transactions and data storage without intermediaries. Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, was one of the youngest crypto billionaires in 2021. After transferring most of his ETH, he had around $10,000 worth of Ether in his main wallet. He also made a significant donation to the India Covid Relief Fund. Buterin owns various ERC-20 tokens and has disclosed holdings in Bitcoin, Zcash, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. His salary from the Ethereum Foundation is estimated to be between $140,000 and $250,000 per year. The Ethereum Foundation holds approximately $1 billion in ETH. Ethereum, being at the forefront of the DeFi movement, could inspire individuals to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nNowadays, the crypto market offers lots of different cryptocurrencies you can invest in, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum or Ether (ETH).\n\nYou probably know Bitcoin already since it\u2019s the world\u2019s first and most popular cryptocurrency, but how much do you know about Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency and most popular platform for decentralized blockchain-based solutions?\n\nAnd exactly how many ETH does Vitalik have? In 2021, after transferring most of his ETH, Vitalik is left with 10,000 USD worth of Ether in his main wallet. Read more about what Ether is and more about Vitalik Buterin below.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum and How Does It Work?\n\nAs we already said, Ethereum is the second most popular digital currency, right after Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is in no way a direct competitor to BTC. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH isn\u2019t designed to be just a store of value or a medium of exchange. Rather, it\u2019s meant to be a decentralized computing network that is based on blockchain technology.\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, public ledger on which transactions are recorded and authenticated.\n\nThe Ethereum network is decentralized because it\u2019s not maintained or operated by a central authority, such as a central bank. Instead, the network is maintained by Ether miners. The distribution part means that every user of the network has an identical copy of the ledger.\n\nBlockchain technology uses cryptography in order to secure the network and confirm transactions. The users solve complex math problems in order to verify every transaction on the network and by doing that, they add new blocks on the blockchain, which is the foundation of the Ethereum ecosystem. For every new block that gets added to the blockchain, the users are rewarded with digital assets, known as tokens.\n\nEthereum\u2019s coin is called Ether, although you\u2019ll find that most people use the name Ethereum interchangeably for both the platform and the coin.\n\nYou can use Ether to sell and buy goods and services, just like you\u2019d use Bitcoin. You can buy and sell Ethereum itself through cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThere are two things that are unique for the Ethereum DeFi system, however. The first one is that you can use the network to develop decentralized applications (DApps) that run on the blockchain. These apps can make complex financial transactions and transfer and store personal data. The second unique feature is smart contracts that allow two parties to set up the rules of their own transaction without the need for an intermediary.\n\nWho Is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nWe\u2019ve gone over a brief overview of the Ethereum network and coin, but we\u2019re yet to cover who the Ethereum founder is. In fact, there are eight of them: Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, Antony Di Iorio, Amir Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke, Mihai Alisie, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nVitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, is a Russian-Canadian software developer and programmer born in 1994 in Moscow, Russia.\n\nHe is also known as the co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine in 2011. Buterin studied at a private high school in Toronto and attended the University of Waterloo, but he dropped out (it\u2019s a trend in the tech industry) and devoted himself to the crypto world.\n\nVitalik Buterin presented the design for the Ethereum network for the first time in 2013, when he was only 19 years old, with a whitepaper intending to develop a general scripting language for developing apps that will be based on blockchain technology. In 2014, he was finally able to develop his project with the help of crowdfunding. The first version was presented to the public in 2015, and the Ether supply was hard-capped at 72 million ETH.\n\nHow Much Eth Does Vitalik Have?\n\nEthereum has seen huge surges in its value in the past two years because the mainstream economic world is increasingly embracing digital assets as a legitimate currency. As it\u2019s the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, you are probably assuming that a lot of people own ETH, but we\u2019re interested in learning how much ETH its founder owns.\n\nIn October 2018, Vitalik Buterin disclosed his public Ether wallet, i.e. the main cryptocurrency wallet where he stores his Ether. This wallet held over 355,000 ETH, and as the volatility of Ethers\u2019 price constantly fluctuates, you can check Ethers\u2019 current value to see what that adds up to today.\n\nIn August of 2021, for instance, that meant a little over one billion USD. This makes Buterin one of the youngest crypto billionaire.\n\nIn May of 2021, the Ethereum inventor transferred exactly 325,001 Ether to a separate crypto wallet, leaving only 10,000 USD worth of Ether in his main cryptocurrency wallet. On May 21st of the same year, Vitalik donated over 1 billion USD worth of crypto to India Covid Relief Funds.\n\nHow Much Bitcoin and What Coins Does Vitalik Own?\n\nVitalik doesn\u2019t only own Ether but a variety of ERC-20 tokens in the Ethereum blockchain as well.

        "title": "Why Ethereum (ETH) Surges Over 38% to $3,160 in 2 Months? - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has broken above the $3,100 mark, marking a significant surge of over 38% in less than two months. From opening the year at $2,282.87 on January 1, 2024, ETH today reached to an impressive $3,160.\n\nRyan Lee, the Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, provided valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) remarkable ascent above the $3,100 threshold. Lee highlighted the significant achievement of ETH\u2019s price surpassing $3,100, pointing out an important benchmark where Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization reached 36% of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market cap. This comparison underscores Ethereum\u2019s growing prominence and investor confidence in its market position relative to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite Bitcoin not reaching new highs recently, Lee\u2019s analysis suggests a robust outlook for Ethereum. He predicts a stable trajectory for ETH, with no significant downturns expected before May.\n\nLee projects that Ethereum could potentially outpace its current achievements and break through the $3,500 mark, following market trends influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance. He also provides a crucial safety net for investors, identifying $2,600 as a solid support level for Ethereum\u2019s price. This level represents a critical threshold below which the cryptocurrency is expected to maintain strong buying interest, preventing further declines.\n\nLee\u2019s analysis paints a bullish picture for Ethereum in the near term, emphasizing its independent market movements and the potential for further gains. With Ethereum\u2019s market value gaining significantly on Bitcoin\u2019s and its price movements showing strong support, the outlook for Ethereum is optimistic, suggesting continued growth and stability in the lead-up to May.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) has surged in the past 2 months?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen a remarkable surge of over 38% in less than two months. The digital currency, which is second only to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, climbed from $2,282.87 on January 1, 2024, to $3,160 by February 16, 2024. This significant increase has sparked a flurry of speculation and analysis as to the driving forces behind the surge and what the future holds for Ethereum.\n\nThe Catalysts Behind the ETH Price Surge\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to Ethereum\u2019s recent price rally. Firstly, the broader cryptocurrency market has been on an upward trajectory, buoyed by institutional adoption and an increasing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate component of diversified investment portfolios. However, Ethereum\u2019s performance has outpaced many of its peers, suggesting specific catalysts at play.\n\nOne of the primary catalyst contributing to Ethereum\u2019s recent surge is the significant increase in Ethereum staking activity. Data from Dune reveals that the supply of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain has soared to 31,061,518 ETH, representing approximately 25.86% of the total current ETH supply. At present valuation, this amounts to over $97.91 billion, with 31.52% of these ETH staked through Lido.\n\nEthereum staking data \u2013 26 Feb 2024. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nBetween February 15 and February 26 alone, investors have deposited more than 630,000 ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract, underscoring growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential and the transition towards Ethereum 2.0. This uptick in staking activity indicates a willingness among investors to lock up their ETH holdings, potentially reducing circulating supply and contributing to upward price pressure.\n\nAnother drivers behind Ethereum\u2019s surge is the continued development and anticipation of Ethereum 2.0, which promises to address many of the scalability and transaction cost issues that have plagued the network. The shift from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is expected to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase transaction speed, making Ethereum more attractive for developers and users alike.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing use of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), most of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain, has led to a higher demand for ETH. As these sectors continue to grow, the demand for Ethereum is expected to rise correspondingly, further driving up its price.\n\nETH Future Price Forecast and Driving Factors\n\nLooking ahead, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether Ethereum will continue its upward trajectory. While predicting the volatile cryptocurrency market is always challenging, several analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s prospects. The continued rollout of Ethereum 2.0, coupled with the growing adoption of DeFi and NFTs, is expected to remain a significant growth driver.\n\nMoreover, as more institutional investors begin to view cryptocurrencies as a viable investment, Ethereum is likely to benefit from increased liquidity and investment. The network\u2019s move towards greater scalability and efficiency with Ethereum 2.0 is also anticipated to attract more developers to build on Ethereum, potentially leading to innovative applications that could drive further demand for ETH.\n\nHowever, investors should remain cautious and aware of the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments, including market volatility and regulatory changes that could impact the market dynamics.\n\nRead Also: Internet Computer (ICP): Exploring Its Meteoric 200% Surge And Future Trajectory"

        "title": "BNB Chain vs. Ethereum: who is winning the dapp race? - crypto.news",
        "content": "The competition heats up in the dapp arena as developers weigh Binance Smart Chain against Ethereum. How do factors like scalability and transaction costs affect their decisions?\n\nThe blockchain space is fiercely competitive, particularly when it comes to decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nAs of Feb. 2, according to data from DappRadar, a prominent analytics platform, Binance Chain (BNB) is at the forefront with 5,215 dapps and a user base exceeding 5.3 million unique active wallets (UAW) over the last 30 days.\n\nEthereum (ETH), on the other hand, holds the second position with 4,497 dApps, although its user base of approximately 1.36 million UAWs pales in comparison to Binance Chain.\n\nLeading blockchain platforms for dapp development | Source: Dapp Radar\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s dapps volume stands at an impressive $115 billion, more than six times Binance Chain\u2019s $17.5 billion, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s substantial developer engagement.\n\nAmid this, Xin Jiang, a former Vice President at Binance, proposed that the market might not require further infrastructure enhancements, as dapps could emerge as the next catalysts for the crypto space.\n\nWhat is happening? Let\u2019s dive deeper into how the dapp market is performing, which chains are leading the development frontier, and which sectors are propelling the dapp market to new heights.\n\nThe current state of dapp market\n\nAccording to a report from DappRadar, the dapp industry witnessed an impressive 124% year-over-year increase in its UAW, culminating in a daily count of 4.2 million UAW by the close of 2023.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of 2024, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. As of Feb. 1, the dapp industry notched up a new milestone with 5.3 million daily UAW. This represents an 18% surge from the previous month and the highest since 2022.\n\nBreaking down the numbers by industry segments provides insights into the diversification of dapp usage.\n\nSource: Dapp Industry Report 2023\n\nBlockchain gaming continues to lead the pack with a steady 1.5 million dUAW, maintaining its dominance from the previous month. This translates to a 28% dominance over the entire dapp ecosystem,\n\nSimilarly, the decentralized finance (defi) sector remains strong, holding steady at 1 million dUAW.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not just gaming and finance that are driving growth. The non-fungible token (NFT) space has experienced a notable expansion, with a 4% uptick this month, reaching 697,959 dUAW.\n\nAmid this, the social dapp sector has gained headlines, boasting an impressive 868,091 dUAW. This surge, a 262% increase over the previous month, is largely attributed to platforms like CARV and Dmail Network, indicating a surge of interest in social networking on decentralized platforms.\n\nRise of social dapps\n\nThe growing popularity of social dapps comes in response to increasing worries about data privacy breaches and online scams on traditional platforms.\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by tech magnate Elon Musk in 2022 triggered a wave of discontent among its user base. Subsequent changes, like considering a paywall, led to a drop in monthly active users, expected to continue into 2024.\n\nAmid this, social dapps like Friend.tech gained traction. Launched in Aug. 2023, Friend.tech quickly became a major player in the social crypto scene, with over 100,000 users and $25 million in revenue.\n\nBut the shift to decentralized apps isn\u2019t just about dissatisfaction with centralized platforms. Analysts highlight that regulatory scrutiny and privacy concerns, particularly in the EU, also drive this trend.\n\nDapps differ from traditional platforms by avoiding centralized data collection for ads, with some being non-profit and prioritizing user privacy.\n\nHowever, while decentralized platforms offer more freedom and anonymity, they also attract communities with extreme views, raising concerns about the spread of extremist content.\n\nAs of Feb. 26, based on data from DappRadar, CARV, Galxe, and Dmail Network have emerged as the foremost social dapps, gauged by total UAWs in the past 30 days.\n\nCARV and Dmail Network have seen significant growth, with volumes up by 330% and 120%, respectively. However, Galxe has experienced a substantial decline of up to 100%.\n\nWhy is Binance Chain leading the dapp race?\n\nWhen comparing Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum in dApps performance, scalability, transaction fees, and consensus mechanisms, we gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBSC stands out for its low transaction fees and high scalability, enabling swift transaction processing at a fraction of the cost compared to Ethereum.\n\nAs of Feb. 26, BSC can handle up to 45.3 transactions per second (TPS), a significant improvement over Ethereum\u2019s current throughput, which remains under 15 TPS but aims for a substantial increase with Ethereum 2.0.\n\nTransaction fees on Ethereum have been a persistent concern, averaging at $0.89 as of Feb. 25. During periods of network congestion, these fees can skyrocket even further, posing challenges for users and developers.\n\nIn contrast, BSC offers notably lower transaction fees, averaging at $0.15 as of this writing, presenting a compelling advantage for those seeking more cost-effective blockchain interactions.\n\nChoosing between BSC and Ethereum depends on the specific needs and priorities of dapp developers and users. Each platform has its trade-offs in decentralization, security, transaction speed, and cost.\n\nBSC excels in providing an efficient and economical solution for high-frequency trading and applications requiring swift transaction speeds and low fees.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s strength lies in its robust decentralization and security measures, along with a diverse array of dapps and a vast ecosystem.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe success of decentralized applications relies on improving user experience to make blockchain-based solutions more accessible. Simplifying interactions, refining interfaces, and incorporating familiar features are crucial to attracting a wider audience.\n\nIn today\u2019s security-conscious digital world, dapps must also prioritize robust privacy and security measures. Innovations in cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation will be essential for enhancing security.\n\nWhile finance and gaming have dominated the dapp scene, there are opportunities for expansion into new areas such as social media, education, and healthcare.\n\nUltimately, the goal for dapps is mainstream adoption. Achieving this requires not just technological advancements but also educational initiatives to showcase the practical benefits of dapps in everyday life."

        "content": "The Ethereum network is growing fast. In this article, discover the top expectations surrounding Ethereum and the key developments expected to impact the ecosystem in 2024.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara / Unsplash\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is the second largest in terms of market capitalization, and 2024 appears to be the most significant year in its history.\n\nInvestors often see ETH as much more than a digital token because of its high intrinsic value and unique use cases that make it popular among creators of decentralized projects.\n\nWith even more updates and developments scheduled to take place in 2024, ETH is among the best crypto to hold in 2024.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSpeed, security, interoperability, and stability are key features of the Ethereum ecosystem that attract developers and projects. Since going live in 2015, the Ethereum blockchain has enhanced the blockchain and related services, especially for users who trade crypto and build products on the blockchain. Key developments in the ecosystem ensure that Ethereum maintains its relevance in the crypto industry, maintains scalability, and improves interaction between nodes on the network.\n\nFrom decentralized applications (DApps) to games and other ideas, developers are increasingly focusing on Ethereum for various purposes. These real-world applications of Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens are key factors influencing the market value of ETH. There are essential expectations surrounding the potential of ETH to hit new price levels in 2024.\n\nDevelopments in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nThe top developments in the Ethereum blockchain address critical issues such as security, power efficiency, and speed. Before 2023, the network had congestion challenges, leading to high gas and network fees. To address these, the Ethereum team announced several vital developments.\n\nEthereum Upgrade (Ethereum 2.0)\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, popularly called \u201cThe Merge,\u201d ended in September 2022, transitioning Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake mining protocol. The Merge effectively reduced Ethereum\u2019s power consumption by 99%, making it one of the most energy-efficient blockchains in the industry. This vital network upgrade improved the security and stability of Ethereum, ensuring developers can build and deploy scalable products.\n\nThe Merge also improved crypto trading on the Ethereum blockchain and associated tokens by increasing speed and reducing trading fees. Regarding its value, ETH appreciated shortly after the news of The Merge\u2019s completion.\n\nBut ETH gained over 35% of its value despite remaining unchanged year-on-year. Ethereum\u2019s value is also expected to increase significantly this year since the Merge has reduced Ether supply by 0.2% via burning, and this number will increase further in the coming months with rising network usage.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara / Unsplash\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade also went live in 2023, allowing the stakers on Ethereum pools to withdraw staked tokens and enhance network stability. There are upcoming upgrades for the Ethereum network.\n\nThese include the Dencun Upgrade, slated for Q1 2024, which will bring scalability and efficiency to the network through \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d 5-EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), and is expected further to reduce the gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nChain Development Kits (CDKs)\n\nEthereum enables developers to build layer 2 blockchains and solutions using the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-powered chain development kits (CDKs). CDKs, first published in 2023, are open-source development frameworks that bring scalability, interoperability, and customization to layer 2 blockchains. They allow developers to explore Ethereum\u2019s rich features to develop various products within the ecosystem.\n\nThe new update, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, is slated for this year. It intends to make the whole ecosystem of layer 2 (L2s) blockchains based on Ethereum up to ten times cheaper.\n\nThis will be the cycle's turning point, propelling Ethereum and layer 2s into their breakout year.\n\nThere has already been an increase in the number of tokens deployed on Ethereum and cross-chain operations with other blockchains like Polygon. This is obvious from the increase in on-chain activities, total value locked (TVL), and other growth indices on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPredictions for ETH Price in 2024\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara / Unsplash\n\nEthereum currently leads the DeFi space with 56% of the TVL in DeFi. This is important to price predictions for 2024 . There are varying expectations for ETH\u2019s price, from $3,500 by May 2024 and $5,000 (ATH price) by December 2024 to $10,000 by 2030. A spot ETF approval for Ethereum may provide enough impetus for ETH to break the $3,500 mark.\n\nCrypto traders are also taking bullish positions on ETH in readiness for the much-talked-about bullish season. Bitcoin (BTC) is rallying the crypto market, having moved from below $40,000 to $51,000 .\n\nWith crypto bulls stacking up millions worth of ETH recently (the top 150 self-custody wallets hold 56.25 million ETH), the predictions for ETH may seem modest but are significantly possible when adoption increases.\n\nWill Ethereum Fulfill Its Potentials in 2024 and Beyond?\n\nThe increase in DeFi applications, web3 gaming projects, and potential enterprise adoption of Ethereum are important factors pointing to Ethereum\u2019s potential in 2024.\n\nWith an increased focus on developer tools, resources, and experiences, Ethereum attracts top talents and accelerates the discovery and development of new projects within the ecosystem. It is safe to say Ethereum has the proper support to fulfill its potential and crush new price levels in 2024.\n\nThere are challenges, such as regulatory compliance and technical issues, but the pointers are there that Ethereum could play more critical roles in the crypto industry."

        "content": "Magic Eden ETH Marketplace Goes Live Today \u2013 Get the Full Scope\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of NFTs, today marks a pivotal moment as the highly anticipated Magic Eden marketplace finally goes live, springing to life on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn partnership with Yuga Labs, this platform marks a pivotal advancement in advocating for creators\u2019 rights within the Web3 domain. It emphasizes ethical practices, bolsters artists\u2019 independence, and excludes marketplaces that fail to uphold royalty commitments, as recently announced on X.\n\nCelebrating its introduction, Magic Eden has announced a temporary reduction in royalty rates. For the first 69 days, royalties will be adjusted downward to 2.5% for newly enforced collection rates and 1% for pre-existing legacy collections.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the marketplace is shortly launching a Mint-to-Earn (M2E) program with a 50% Diamond Bonus on Yuga Labs collections. Users will also be able to get their hands on Diamonds when minting other, specific Ethereum projects.\n\nRoyalty Protection Measures\n\nMagic Eden has been fervently working with the Yuga team to redefine the dynamic between NFT creators and enthusiasts. Their concerted efforts have led to bespoke pages for collectors, schemes to reward loyalty, and, most crucially, strict royalty protection measures that aim to secure regular income streams for creative talents.\n\nAhead of this new marketplace launch, it was announced that support is being withdrawn from platforms not enforcing universal royalty payments, highlighting its initiative to ensure creators receive due compensation.\n\nThe stance on supporting only platforms that uphold royalty payments aims to benefit the entire NFT ecosystem, allowing creators to focus on innovation without worrying about monetization.\n\nY00ts recently declared its participation in this trend, committing to the platform with a strategy that ensures all royalties are funneled back into acquiring its virtual collectibles.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s M2E Initiative\n\nStarting today, Magic Eden will launch its 50% Diamond Bonus on purchases across Yuga Labs\u2019 collections. Eligible collections include BAYC, MAYC, BAKC, Meebits, Moonbirds, Mythics, 10KTF, G Tags, Stockroom, Gucci Grails, Combat Gear & Crates, Kagami, Otherside Expanded, Vessels, Maras, Koda, Loot, Ship Parts, and others.\n\nMoreover, Magic Eden\u2019s M2E program is set to revolutionize the way creators and collectors engage with digital assets, starting with its inaugural \u2018Season 1\u2019 at the end of February. Throughout this initiative, Diamonds will be accumulated and later distributed to those who mint selected projects via the marketplace\u2019s Launchpad, rewarding users for their participation and support.\n\nAlready boasting an impressive lineup of participants, Season 1 includes: Planet Mojo, OSF, ThankYouX, CryptoNinja, SK8PES, Okay Dogs, RENGA, Chimpers, traf, Quirkies, Ironbelly Studios, and SanFran Tokyo, among others.\n\nAs this prized initiative unfolds, Magic Eden eyes Season 2\u2019s shift to the Solana blockchain, signaling a commitment to explore new opportunities and expand its ecosystem across diverse blockchain environments, promising broader horizons for users and partners.\n\nNevertheless, today signifies a significant milestone in the realm of NFTs as the Magic Eden Ethereum marketplace officially debuts, advocating for creator rights, equitable compensation, and strategic collaborations \u2014 all while rewarding its users with cherished Diamonds and more.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe pre-market trading price of cross-chain gaming token Portal (PORTAL) has steadily grown in recent days ahead of Thursday\u2019s announced listing on Binance, further validating the substantial demand for the long-awaited launch.\n\nPre-market PORTAL trading on Whales Market has tallied over $5.3 million since last week, with a current price of $2.85 per token. It has gradually climbed since Friday, when the price sat around $2.00 per token.\n\nThe estimated price would put the market cap of PORTAL at about $476 million, based on the initial circulating supply of 167.1 million tokens. If so, it would land in the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap, above the newly launched PIXEL token for Ronin farming game Pixels, which has a nearly $426 million market cap as of this writing.\n\nAhead of the token listing, Binance is currently holding a Launchpool campaign that lets customers stake Binance Coin (BNB) or the FDUSD stablecoin into pools that pay out a share of PORTAL staking rewards. A total of 50 million PORTAL tokens are up for grabs through the promotion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of Friday, the Launchpool campaign for Portal had already amassed more than $8.6 billion worth of staked cryptocurrency, setting a new record for Binance\u2019s rewards program. Rising crypto prices in recent days have helped push that tally to $8.8 billion as of this writing.\n\nPortal is a cross-chain gaming platform that aims to connect crypto games across various chains on a single platform with a shared token, single sign-in, and uniform asset management tools. It will be integrated with networks such as Solana and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe Portal team includes leadership and advisors to SuperDuper, the crypto startup behind the Creepz NFT project on Ethereum. Rockstar Games co-founder Jamie King is among the prominent advisors.\n\nPortal held an airdrop farming campaign in November and December that rewarded crypto users for tweeting about Portal and interacting with other users\u2019 tweets about it. While the campaign irritated some Crypto Twitter users, it also drove substantial hype around the token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company told Decrypt\u2019s GG last week that it will share airdrop distribution details ahead of the Binance token listing.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "What is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Net Worth? - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and co-founder of Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. He has been involved in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry for many years and is also a co-founder of companies like Aragon, Golem, and Status. Buterin\u2019s net worth is estimated to be around $150 million, although this figure could fluctuate due to the volatility of digital currencies. He attended Sir Robert Borden High School and later the University of Waterloo, where he studied computer science and became deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space. He co-founded Ethereum in 2014, which launched in 2015 as a decentralized platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Buterin\u2019s personal Ethereum holdings have been substantial, and at one point, he reportedly held 405,000 Ether. However, cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, and his net worth has fluctuated accordingly. Buterin has made significant contributions to the crypto community, including donations to various causes and projects. He is on the board of directors for Dogecoin and has expressed interest in the coin\u2019s development. Despite his wealth, the exact figures of Buterin\u2019s assets and financial status are not publicly disclosed, making it challenging to confirm whether he is a crypto billionaire.\n\nVitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian computer programmer and entrepreneur who is the co-founder and CEO of Ethereum, the 2nd largest Cryptocurrency (after bitcoin). He has also served as the chief architect at Ethereum since 2014. He is considered one of the founders of Ethereum, along with Joseph Lubin and Charles Hoskinson.\n\nIn addition to his role at Ethereum, he serves as the co-founder of several other companies, such as Aragon, Golem, and Status. With that said, how much is Vitalik Buterin net worth?\n\nApart from the Ethereum creator, he earns a salary of $100K per year from his company, Consensys. Vitalik\u2019s net worth could be $150 million, but considering the volatility of the digital currency, it may be higher or lower than estimated.\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nVitalik Buterin grew up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He attended Sir Robert Borden High School, where his classmates included fellow Bitcoin creator Gavin Andresen.\n\nWhile attending high school, Buterin worked part-time jobs such as pizza delivery and working at a video game store.\n\nButerin began programming at age 12 and became interested in cryptography while playing online games. At age 15, he wrote his first program, a text editor called BBEdit. He continued developing software throughout high school, including a chess AI named Deep Blue. In 2007, he cofounded Ethereum, a decentralized computing platform based on blockchain technology.\n\nEarly Life\n\nVitalik Buterin graduated from high school in 2007. After graduating, he enrolled at the University of Waterloo, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. While there, he became involved in the cryptocurrency scene.\n\nAt age 17, he met Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum and ConsenSys. Lubin told Buterin about Bitcoin and how it could improve society.\n\nButerin spent most of his time studying mathematics and physics. His interest in cryptography led him to work for the Tor Project, an organization that develops privacy software. During his studies, he began working on a decentralized version of Twitter called StatusNet. This project caught the attention of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\n\nIn 2011, Buterin joined the team behind Ethereum, a blockchain-based digital currency. The project raised $12 million in funding during its initial coin offering and went live in July 2015.\n\nThe following year, Buterin published a paper titled \u201cBitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies,\u201d which laid out the fundamentals of digital assets.\n\nEthereum Blockchain\n\nIn 2012, Buterin launched Bitcoin Magazine, a publication focused on covering cryptocurrency news. While writing for the magazine, he met Joseph Lubin, another early adopter of cryptocurrency. Together, they founded Consensys, a startup that aimed to build tools for developers to use in building decentralized applications.\n\nAfter working on Consensys, Buterin joined Ethereum in 2013. His goal was to develop a system that could run smart contracts without relying on intermediaries such as banks. In 2014, he officially announced the launch of the Ethereum blockchain, a public blockchain network designed to support decentralized apps.\n\nButerin published a white paper where he proposed a vision for a decentralized and open-sourced blockchain platform called Ethereum. The white paper circulated widely among developers and entrepreneurs and drew considerable attention.\n\nThe platform was officially launched in July 2015, with Buterin credited as one of three founding members, along with Gavin Wood and Anthony DiIorio.\n\nAs a smart contract platform, Ethereum allows anyone to write code that runs exactly as programmed without the possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. This makes it possible to build anything from decentralized apps to digital currencies to autonomous organizations.\n\nHow many ETH does Vitalik Buterin own?\n\nBeing the creator of Ethereum, you might be wondering, how much Ether does Vitalik have? Vitalik bought his first batch of Ether in 2013, when it cost about $0.40 per coin. Today, Ethereum trades for about $8,500 per coin.\n\nButerin began mining Ether in July 2016, when it was selling for just $9.50. After buying out the rest of the supply, he held onto nearly 400,000 Ether. Over the course of 2017, he sold off some of his holdings, making a profit of about $270 million.\n\nIn January 2018, Buterin purchased another 300,000 Ether, bringing his total up to 405,000 Ether. On Feb. 4, 2018, Ether reached $1,400. In mid-February, Buterin\u2019s Ether holdings climbed to $360 million, or roughly $300 million before taxes.\n\nBy early April, however, the price of Ether fell to $300, meaning Buterin lost about $90 million on his investment. He still owned about 360,000 Ether, though, which put him at about $267 million before taxes.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Ether hit $2,200. By late June, the price of Ether had fallen to $700. Buterin sold off about half of his remaining Ether holdings, leaving him with about 275,000 Ether \u2014 or $225 million before taxes.\n\nAt this point, Buterin\u2018s Ether holdings are valued at about $150 million. And while the price of Ether is rising again, Buterin is planning to sell off his remaining Ether holdings.\n\nIs Vitalik Buterin A Crypto Billionaire?\n\nVitalik Buterin is one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency today. His Twitter account boasts over 2 million followers. In fact, he\u2019s even been called the \u201ccrypto messiah.\u201d And even made the Fortune 40 under 40 list in 2016 and the Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 list in 2018. So, how rich is Vitalik Buterin exactly?\n\nButerin\u2019s net worth is largely tied up in cryptocurrencies like Ether and XRP. And depending on where you look, his net worth ranges anywhere from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. If we take into consideration his ownership stake in mining companies like Hashflare, it could push him above the $1.5 billion mark.\n\nButerin\u2018s net worth fluctuates based on what happens with the price of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor example, during the 2018 bear market, Buterin lost a significant amount of money because his investments dropped in value. On the flip side, when the market rebounds, Buterin makes a lot of money.\n\nThe problem is that there are no reliable sources of information about Buterin\u2019s personal finances. There\u2019s no public record of his income and expenses, nor is there anything publicly available about his assets and liabilities. This makes it difficult to determine whether or not he\u2019s actually a billionaire.\n\nShiba Inu Tokens\n\nIn April, the anonymous creators of the coin known as SHIB, announced that it had been gifted half of all the coins in existence to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are roughly 505 billion SHIB tokens in circulation. Depending on when you\u2019re looking, one SHIB token can value at around $0.0010.\n\nOn May 10, those 505 billion SHIB were worth $7 billion, giving Vitalik Buterin a net worth of $15.3 billion when combined with his other digital assets.\n\nButerin\u2019s Donations\n\nThe founder of Ethereum has been quite generous with his crypto wealth. He has donated 5% of the total circulating supply to support the covid relief fund in India. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has also donated $1 million of ETH to the Dogecoin foundation. He has done it because he believes that the cryptocurrency industry needs to unite against the current challenges.\n\nRecently, he has also sent $1 million of Ether to the Dogecoin project.\n\nIn addition to that, Buterin is on Dogecoin\u2019s board of directors. He tweeted that he hopes someday DOGE will switch to the PoW/PoS consensus mechanism that Ethereum is about to implement in August this year, and he wants to see DOGE become the main coin used in the ecosystem.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow rich is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nHe is one of the richest people in the crypto space, with an estimated net worth of $1 billion.\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nVitalik Buterin is one of the world\u2019s richest people thanks to his work developing Ethereum \u2014 the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He holds around $1 billion worth of Ether, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in crypto.\n\nButerin isn\u2019t just rich because he\u2019s the creator of Ethereum; he\u2019s also been able to amass massive wealth outside of blockchain technology. However, the majority of Buterins\u2019 wealth is stored in Ether, though he owns shares in multiple companies, including the crypto exchange, Coinbase and Ripple.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is likely much larger than it appears here.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for a massive breakout against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPal says on the social media platform X that the Ethereum versus Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) is on the verge of breaking above the diagonal resistance of a massive wedge on the weekly chart.\n\n\u201cThe ETH/BTC chart is an absolute stunner and ready for the next big move: the break of the mega wedge. Let\u2019s see how it pans out.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that ETH/BTC has already broken out of a descending channel, indicating an imminent bullish trend reversal. His chart also suggests that ETH/BTC may break out of a years-long falling wedge pattern.\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0573 BTC ($3,241) at time of writing, down 1.58% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOther analysts are also turning bullish on Ethereum.\n\nThe founders of analytics platform Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, recently said that ETH/BTC made a sudden move to the upside, indicating that ETH itself and other altcoins are about to soar.\n\n\u201cWhen ETH/BTC rallies, altcoins rally. And we have just broken higher after a long consolidation since late 2021.\u201d\n\nCEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Ethereum could reach the $15,000 level if Bitcoin hits $150,000.\n\nSaid Yusko,\n\n\u201cI probably have no reason to go against what has existed for a long time which is the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It used to be almost exactly 10-to-1\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say Bitcoin gets to $150,000\u2026 let\u2019s say it gets all the way back to 10-to-1. Then that would be [an Ethereum price of] $15,000.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Up 5% As Layer-2 DeFi TVL Hits $30 Billion - CoinGape",
        "content": "With Bitcoin leading the broader market rally, Ethereum (ETH) too joined the party with an additional 5% gain on Monday. As of press time, the Ethereum price is up 4.34% trading at $3,230 and a market cap of $387 billion.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 TVL Nears $30 Billion Milestone\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem is experiencing a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), nearing the significant milestone of $30 billion as cryptocurrency prices climb.\n\nadvertisement\n\nData from L2Beat reveals a notable uptick in Ethereum L2 TVL, which has surged by over 9% in the past week, reaching a new high of $29.42 billion. Of this total, Arbitrum constitutes the largest share at 45%, with a TVL of $13.26 billion. Other notable contributors include OP Mainnet with $7.57 billion, Manta Pacific with $1.89 billion, and StarkNet with $1.36 billion.\n\nThe substantial growth in Ethereum L2 TVL underscores the increasing adoption and utilization of Layer 2 solutions, highlighting their importance in scaling Ethereum\u2019s network and mitigating congestion and high gas fees. The recent rally in L2 DeFi tokens is due to the optimism surrounding the upcoming Dencun upgrade with the EIP-4844 proposal to help significantly reduce the gas fee.\n\nEther Exchange Supply At Just 11%\n\nDespite the spot Bitcoin ETFs continuing to see massive inflows, some market researchers continue to lean towards Ether due to the anticipated advancements in the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nBernstein researchers Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra highlighted the growth of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem and layer-2 networks as crucial factors strengthening ETH\u2019s market resilience compared to Bitcoin.\n\nBernstein also underscores the significance of the amount of ether being locked up, highlighting that ETH held on exchanges has reached a record low of 11%. This trend indicates a growing tendency to lock up more of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, Ether (ETH), ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, has exhibited a noteworthy 33% increase year-to-date, surpassing its larger counterpart, Bitcoin (BTC). This surge is attributed to various catalysts beyond the anticipated approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nETH Price Action\n\nETH maintained its position comfortably above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating bullish signals for its price trajectory.\n\nShould ETH surpass the Tuesday morning high of $3,276, it could pave the way for further upward momentum toward the $3,500 mark. Conversely, a drop in ETH below the critical support level of $3,200 could bring the $3,000 mark into focus.\n\nThe 14-period Daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) registering at 81.79 signals ETH\u2019s entry into overbought territory. Consequently, heightened selling pressure might emerge around the Tuesday morning high of $3,276.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum whales are accumulating large volumes of ETH after supply on exchanges hit a six-month peak.\n\nETH price sustained its uptrend even as Ether holders consistently realized gains since February 15.\n\n$20.48 million in short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as ETH price climbed to a new 2024 high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s large wallet investors, including a wallet address that allegedly belongs to Justin Sun of TRON, have been spotted accumulating the altcoin, according to on-chain data. The accumulation by whales could offset the altcoin\u2019s Supply on Exchanges, thereby reducing the selling pressure on ETH.\n\nTypically, Ethereum price rallies post a Bitcoin halving event, the upcoming halving in April 2024 could catalyze gains in ETH if the trend repeats itself.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price teases with a breakout, eyes $3,200 milestone as ETH bulls show resolve\n\nEthereum price could sustain uptrend with whales\u2019 massive ETH accumulation\n\nData from on-chain intelligence tracker Lookonchain revealed that wallet that allegedly belongs to TRON co-founder Justin Sun scooped up 12,702 ETH worth $36.9 million on February 21. Between February 11 and 21, the address bought 104,055 Ether worth $296 million at an average price of $2,846 from Binance and decentralized exchanges.\n\nWallet that allegedly belongs to Justin Sun, Ethereum accumulation. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe tracker identified addresses that are accumulating Ether in the past week. A whale wallet withdrew 14,632 ETH tokens from Binance, worth $45.5 million and staked it in the past week. Two other large wallet addresses withdrew 6,000 Ether from Kraken, worth $18.7 million, in the past two days.\n\nWhile Santiment shows that ETH Supply on Exchanges has hit its highest level in six months, the recent activities of whale wallets could reduce the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nEthereum Supply on Exchanges. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum wallet addresses holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH tokens have accumulated more Ether since the beginning of February. Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ETH have shed their Ether, reducing their Ethereum holdings in the same timeframe.\n\nKey catalysts\n\nThe accumulation of ETH wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million Ether coincides with Ethereum price rise, as observed in the chart below, in the past six months. This suggests it could be a key catalyst to the token\u2019s gains. If this trend continues, Ethereum price could continue rallying past the $3,000 mark.\n\nEthereum holdings of different whale cohorts. Source: Santiment\n\nAnother key catalyst is the upcoming Bitcoin halving. As seen in previous halving events, Ethereum price rallies in response to the mining reward halving of the largest asset. This is a trend that has repeated in the previous three halvings. If it continues, Ethereum price could rally towards its $4,000 target, ahead of the SEC\u2019s decision on Spot Ethereum ETF approval in May 2024.\n\nIt's important to note that in the past 24 hours, $20.48 million in short positions were liquidated as Ethereum price surged to a new peak in 2024, according to CoinGlass data. ETH price climbed to a high of $3,135.65 on Monday."

        "content": "Ethereum Price: ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced significant volatility this week, reflecting the consolidation of Bitcoin prices below $38,000. This sideways movement led to a decrease in bullish momentum across the crypto market, hindering the progress of most major cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this, with the Bitcoin price stabilizing above $30,600, ETH witnessed a resurgence in buying interest. This surge pushed ETH\u2019s price beyond the psychological barrier of $3,000. Is this breakout a signal to enter the market?\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Grayscale Sees Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Parabolic Run Post Dencun Upgrade\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Gain $3500?\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) coin initiated its current recovery trendline in late January when the price showcased sustainability above $2166. This upswing recorded 41% over the past five weeks and reached the current trading price of $3062.\n\nThe recovery was spared in response to the Bitcoin price rally, following the massive inflow of funds into the spot BTC ETG. The bull run gained further momentum as the Ethereum network steadily progressed to its much-awaited Dencun upgrade scheduled for implementation at slot 8626176 around mid-March.\n\nThis week, the Ethereum price traded majorly sideways resonating between the two horizontal levels of $3030 and $2875. Following an aggressive rally, the recent consolidation must have asserted the ETH price to recuperate strength.\n\nWith an intraday gain of 3%, the altcoin gave a decisive breakout from the range\u2019s resistance and reclaimed the psychological level of $3000.

        "content": "Lido Finance, the most famous Ethereum dapp and undisputed leader in the liquid staking sector, yesterday surpassed the $30 billion threshold in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nThis metric indicates the overall value of assets locked within a dapp or a chain, and studying its trend can be useful to see where capital is moving within the web3 world.\n\nThe growth of Lido scares Ethereum supporters, who see a potential risk of centralization of the network consensus: however, the new trend of restaking could limit Lido\u2019s absolute dominance by creating a broader and more decentralized market.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nEthereum dApp: Lido surpasses $30 billion in TVL and expands the liquid staking sector\n\nThe liquid staking sector seems to continue unabated growth, with Ethereum\u2019s flagship dapp, Lido Finance, setting another record and surpassing 30 billion dollars in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nAccording to the on-chain research company The Block, on February 26th Lido reached a locked capital value never achieved before by any existing dapp, closing the day at 30.66 billion dollars.\n\nToday, thanks to the latest rally in the price of ETH, the protocol records a TVL of 31.7 billion dollars.\n\nFrom July 2022 onwards, following the great depression created by the collapse of the stablecoin UST and the Terra Luna project, Lido has recorded a steady growth in the adoption of liquid staking, gradually expanding its presence in the crypto market\n\nHowever, after the Shapella update of the Ethereum blockchain, which enabled withdrawals of ether previously staked on the Beacon Chain, the upward trend in Lido\u2019s TVL has seen a substantial acceleration\n\nFrom May 2023 to today, in about 10 months, approximately $19.3 billion in value has been added\n\nLido has become so popular among Ethereum dapps, representing alone 63% of all funds locked on it, ahead of the historic MakerDAO protocol that controls 17.8% of the market share. MakerDAO\n\nEven within the niche of liquid staking, Lido holds a position of relevance, as it is well above the second decentralized application in this ranking, Rocket Pool, which currently has a TVL of 3.8 billion dollars.\n\nBy now this protocol, celebrated as an institution in the context of decentralized finance, has become the largest validator on the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain, controlling 32% of the ether in staking.\n\nAnyway, although it represents a single entity, Lido in turn controls 36 different operators that run nodes and manage the delicate phase of block production within the world\u2019s most famous smart contract blockchain.\n\nRestaking as a new solution to counter the risks of centralization of Lido\n\nAs Lido becomes increasingly important as a reference dapp in the liquid staking sector of Ethereum, concerns within the community are also growing in the face of evident risks of centralization of the consensus market.\n\nAlready in August 2023 among the main providers of liquid staking solutions, such as Rocket Pool, Stader Lads, Diva Staking and Puffer Finance, there was talk of joining forces and making a pact that unequivocally established that none of them could ever control more than 22% of the market.\n\nAlthough this coalition has gone down in history as one of the first occasions in which a group of dapps set a hard cap for their TVL, Lido has continued to grow without paying too much attention to its competitors.\n\nIn June of the same year, at Lido\u2019s house, this \u201cissue\u201d was discussed, leading to the polls among participants in the governance of the project to establish whether to introduce threshold limits to the protocol\u2019s power: the result is that 99.81% of LDO token holders (those with voting power) voted against imposing any limits.\n\nIt will certainly not be collective common sense that can change the cards on the table, now that the protocol is reaching giant dimensions and there are several billion dollars at stake.\n\nAnyway, there is a new trend that could limit the uncontrolled expansion of Lido: we are talking about restaking, which is the practice of reusing the consent offered by Ethereum with previously locked ether.\n\nPlatforms like Eigenlayer, a top-tier dapp for the restaking sector, are attracting a significant amount of capital, contributing to the decentralization of network sequencers and therefore also to the overall decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nAs of today Eigenlayer controls a TVL of 8.81 billion dollars, ranking as the 3rd dapp by locked value behind Maker and Lido, and actually represents the only piece of the web3 world capable of creating the conditions for a real slowdown of Lido\u2019s power.\n\nWith several options on the table to restake with this protocol, and the need to find the highest yield or farm airdrops as much as possible, Lido no longer serves as the only solution on the market but integrates with the rest of the emerging protocols, which are gradually diversifying and decentralizing the various network operators."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and NFTs, a groundbreaking development has emerged that promises to redefine the norms of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Enter Blast, an innovative L2 network that stands out as the first of its kind to offer native yield for both ETH and stablecoins directly on the platform. This feature is a game-changer in the realm of digital finance, setting a new standard for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA Leap into the Future with Native Yields\n\nBlast differentiates itself by harnessing the power of ETH staking and Real-World Asset (RWA) protocols to generate yield. This yield, unlike the default 0% interest rate on other L2s, is a robust 4% for ETH and an even more impressive 5% for stablecoins. This mechanism ensures that Blast users automatically receive the benefits of these yields, marking a significant advancement in the way L2 solutions operate.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. We\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more. Details on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nRationale Behind Blast: Bridging the Yield Gap\n\nThe inception of Blast is a direct response to a critical observation post-Ethereum merge: the necessity for L2 solutions to integrate native yield for ETH and stablecoins. Traditional L2s lack this feature, creating a gap where users potentially lose out to inflation. Blast, designed from the ground up as an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup, not only fills this gap but also elevates the baseline yield for both users and developers, without compromising the cryptonative experience.\n\nInnovations Powering Blast\n\nBlast introduces several groundbreaking features that distinguish it from other L2 networks:\n\nAuto Rebasing : Blast features native rebasing for ETH and its own stablecoin, USDB, ensuring that balances automatically adjust to reflect accrued yield.\n\n: Blast features native rebasing for ETH and its own stablecoin, USDB, ensuring that balances automatically adjust to reflect accrued yield.

Gas Revenue Sharing: In a move away from the norm, Blast returns net gas revenue to Dapps, allowing developers to either retain this revenue or subsidize user fees.\n\nBlast and Blur: A Synergistic NFT Ecosystem\n\nThe narrative of Blast is intertwined with Blur, an NFT marketplace, through their shared founder, Tieshun Roquerre (aka Pacman). The recent $20 million funding round led by Paradigm, alongside significant contributions from other investors, underscores the ambition behind Blast: to address high transaction costs and introduce innovative trading instruments in the NFT space. This support is further bolstered by an impressive $81 million in assets already deposited on Blast, signifying strong market confidence.\n\nThe collaboration between Blast and Blur exemplifies a strategic alliance aimed at enhancing the NFT ecosystem. With plans to deploy L2 apps, including NFT perps on Blast, Blur is set to leverage Blast\u2019s technological advancements to foster a more vibrant and efficient market.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBlast emerges as a pioneering Ethereum L2 network offering native yield for ETH and stablecoins, revolutionizing the digital finance landscape. With features like auto rebasing, L1 staking integration, and gas revenue sharing, Blast sets a new benchmark for L2 solutions. The synergy between Blast and Blur heralds a promising era for the NFT market, underscored by significant funding and market confidence."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto, has grabbed the spotlight after it soared past $3,200 yesterday. However, the rally has led to an increased selling pressure since long investors are trying to realize their profits. Amid the price jump and sell-offs, an Ethereum ICO participant, dormant for 8.6 years, resurfaced.\n\nEthereum ICO Investor Dumps ETH Reserve\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, an onchain data tracking platform, the dormant Ethereum ICO investor deposited 238.75 ETH, worth $770,000 to Coinbase, a popular crypto exchange. The investor acquired the ETH reserves at Ethereum Genesis for $0.31 per ETH, marking a whopping 10,980,000% profit. The dump of Ethereum reserves on Coinbase could be a significant catalyst in impacting the prices if the whale decides to sell the entire reserve.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSuch dormant Ethereum whales generally resurface whenever the ETH price surges, hence, the update doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. Last week, an early investor in Ethereum, who had been inactive for nearly a decade, transferred 1,732 ETH, equivalent to $5.15 million at the time, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. This move coincided with the Ethereum price surpassing the $3,000 mark.\n\nThe investor had originally purchased their ETH during the ICO period at a price of $0.31, similar to that of the dormant whale who became active today. Moreover, the Ethereum ICO investor got his hands on a potential return of 10,000 times their initial investment if sold above $3,000.\n\nCurrently, there is still 1,733 ETH remaining in their wallet, valued at over $5 million. While it remains uncertain whether they sold the reserves or not, transferring funds to Kraken suggests they were considering the possibility.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Up 5% As Layer-2 DeFi TVL Hits $30 Billion\n\nETH Price Today\n\nThe Ethereum price soared 6.11% to $3,246.33 at the time of writing on Tuesday, February 27. The crypto held a market cap of $389.80 million. Moreover, the 24-hour trading volume for Ethereum spiked by 60.94% to $22.14 billion. The recent rally could have been spurred by the overall optimism in the market owing to the rise in Bitcoin funding.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, the ETH open interest gained by 1.50% to $11.33 billion. While long investors increased the sell pressure, short traders braced for a short squeeze. Ethereum witnessed $66.87 million total liquidations of which $45.66 million accounted for short liquidations. Since the ETH price shot up unprecedentedly, these traders would liquidate and buy their positions back to minimize losses.\n\nThe increased purchasing pressure could propel the ETH price even higher. However, in case of a bearish turn, these short traders would start dumping their holdings, further catalyzing the downfall. Hence, extreme volatility could ensue in the coming days.\n\nAlso Read: KyberSwap Attack Update: $2.5M in Ether Transferred to Ethereum Network\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn an unprecedented surge of adoption, Ethereum's layer-2 solutions are witnessing a significant uptick, pushing the total value locked (TVL) close to the $30 billion threshold. Recent data from L2Beat indicates substantial growth in Ethereum L2 TVL, now standing at $29.60 billion, marking an increase of over 12.08% in the past week alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis remarkable growth trajectory underscores the accelerating usage of layer-2 platforms, with Arbitrum and Optimism leading the charge in scaling Ethereum's capacity for decentralized applications (dApps). Arbitrum, a prominent player in the layer-2 space, now accounts for a staggering 45.18% of the total L2 TVL, amounting to $13.37 billion.\n\nFollowing closely is OP Mainnet, with a TVL of $7.56 billion, demonstrating the growing confidence and reliance of the crypto community on these scaling solutions. Other notable platforms contributing to the surge include Manta Pacific and Starknet, with TVLs of $1.89 billion and $1.39 billion, respectively.\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade\n\nThe momentum behind this surge is partly attributed to the heightened anticipation surrounding Ethereum's forthcoming Dencun upgrade . This significant update is expected to introduce major gas fee reductions, alongside greater storage efficiency and an enhanced experience for developers. By addressing the long-standing issue of high transaction fees on Ethereum, the Dencun upgrade is set to make rollups even more cost efficient, thereby incentivizing greater adoption.\n\nAs layer-2 solutions continue to evolve, they offer a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum's network, allowing for higher transaction throughput and lower fees. This not only benefits developers by providing a more efficient environment for building and deploying dApps but also enhances the user experience by making transactions faster and more affordable.\n\nThe adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions is a critical step toward resolving the network's scalability challenges. As the ecosystem continues to mature, the integration of these solutions is expected to drive further innovation and growth within the DeFi sector. With the TVL nearing the $30 billion mark, the Ethereum community remains optimistic about the potential of layer-2 platforms to revolutionize the blockchain space."

        "content": "Starknet\u2019s TVL surpasses $1 billion, becoming the 4th largest Ethereum L2 solution.\n\nSTRK token faces volatility but shows promise with a market cap of $1.39 billion.\n\nIn an electrifying development this week, Starknet, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution, has taken the crypto world by storm with its historic launch. This new entrant in the blockchain domain has quickly ascended to become the 4th L2 solution on Ethereum, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing the remarkable $1 billion milestone, marking a significant achievement in its nascent journey.\n\nThe Surge of Starknet\n\nFollowing the strategic launch of its STRK airdrop, Starknet catapulted into the limelight of the crypto ecosystem. The protocol generously rewarded its early adopters, distributing over 700 million tokens from the allocated 1.8 billion for the airdrop, a move that significantly contributed to its rapid ascendancy.\n\nDespite a few hitches, such as inconsistencies where some users received millions of STRK tokens leading to an immediate sell-off and a subsequent price drop post-launch, the airdrop was largely deemed a success. This event mirrors the tumultuous debuts typical of Ethereum L2 solutions but hasn\u2019t deterred Starknet\u2019s momentum.\n\nStarknet\u2019s growth trajectory has been nothing short of phenomenal. With data from L2Beat showcasing a staggering TVL of $1.31 billion, up by over 620% since its inception, Starknet now only trails behind giants such as Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and Manta Pacific in the L2 space.\n\nThe adoption by leading trading platforms like Binance Exchange, which listed STRK for trading, further bolstered Starknet\u2019s position in the market. This support from top exchanges underscores the confidence in Starknet\u2019s potential and technology. Dive deeper into this development in the YouTube video below.\n\nUnique Approach to Scalability\n\nStarknet sets itself apart with its innovative use of zk Rollup technology, addressing the Ethereum scalability challenge in a novel way. This distinctive approach has attracted significant new capital inflows, with major smart contracts like Orbiter Finance and Rango Exchange now leveraging the platform, drawing a diverse user base. To explore how Ethereum is revolutionizing the digital industry, check out the following YouTube video.\n\nSTRK Token Dynamics\n\nThe journey of the STRK token has been marked by volatility, a common trait in the digital currency landscape. Currently trading at $1.92, the token has seen a slight decline of 1.53% in the last 24 hours. Despite the selling pressure from early recipients and a more than 30% decrease in trading volume, the launch of Starknet and its native token STRK is perceived as relatively successful, with a current market capitalization of $1.39 billion.\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "title": "How to Transfer Tokens From MetaMask - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Cryptocurrency transactions are increasingly common, with Ethereum-based tokens like Tether, Chainlink, and Binance coin being popular choices. Digital wallets are essential for storing these assets, and MetaMask stands out as a reliable, user-friendly option available as a browser extension and compatible with hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. MetaMask is a web3-based decentralized application that allows interaction with smart contracts and secure storage of cryptocurrencies. It keeps user data private while transactions are publicly visible on Etherscan. To send Ethereum (ETH) or ERC20 tokens from MetaMask, users need the recipient\u2019s public address and to pay a gas fee. Custom tokens can also be transferred using MetaMask in conjunction with MyEtherWallet (MEW). Transferring funds from MetaMask to a bank account can be done through exchanges like Coinbase. MetaMask supports storing NFTs and is celebrated for its accessibility, being a free browser extension that\u2019s easy to use.\n\nUsing cryptocurrencies for financial transactions has become increasingly popular in recent years. Some of the most popular assets today are Ethereum-based tokens such as Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), and Binance coin (BNB).\n\nFor crypto-beginners, one of the first challenges is to find a solution as to where to store their assets, since cryptocurrencies need a special digital wallet. The market offers countless digital wallets, so it can be difficult to find one that is reliable, easy to use, and secure.\n\nWhen it comes to sending and receiving Ethereum and ERC20 tokens, MetaMask is a great choice. How to send token from Metamask? In most cases, you only need the recipient\u2019s public address and other details like the amount and gas fees you need to pay. For custom tokens, you need to use MyEtherWallet (MEW) to transfer them.\n\nWhat Is a MetaMask Wallet?\n\nMetaMask.io is an online cryptocurrency wallet. It comes in the form of a web browser extension available for Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, and Firefox, and it\u2019s also compatible with the Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets.\n\nMetaMask is based on open-source code and has a dedicated developer community that constantly works on updating the platform so as to provide its users with the best quality of service.\n\nIt is a web3-based decentralized application which allows users to interact with smart contracts using ERC20 tokens. The main purpose of these wallets is to store ethers and other cryptocurrencies safely. They allow users to send funds from one account to another, and also keep track of all transactions made through them.\n\nMeta Mask also provides access to various DApp features such as sending Ethers, viewing transaction details, etc.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is always a major concern when it comes to cryptocurrencies. MetaMask performs great in this field since they offer several layers of protection. To start off, the only way to access the users\u2019 assets is through a user password.\n\nThe second layer of user authentication is a unique 12-word seed phrase, known as a private key.\n\nThis means that the user\u2019s main concern is to keep the password and seed phrase safe and not to worry about the security of their funds. Still, using MetaMask combined with a secure hardware wallet is an even more secure option.\n\nBecause MetaMask deals with Ethereum-based transactions, all of them are publicly visible on Etherscan, as they are registered on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the MetaMask wallet account data is always kept private.\n\nFeatures and Interface\n\nThere are lots of reasons why MetaMask is ranked as the best for desktop use among numerous Ethereum wallets. Its user-friendly interface and versatile features give it an edge over the competition. For instance, apart from storing Ethereum blockchain-based assets, you can also transfer tokens to cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and other third-party websites through MetaMask.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll take a look at a step-by-step tutorial on how to transfer tokens using MetaMask. For now, keep in mind that MetaMask supports only ETH, ERC20, and several custom tokens.\n\nHow to Send Tokens From Metamask\n\nHow to Transfer from Metamask Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAll transactions from MetaMask require a small gas fee, which is standard for all transfers.\n\nWe will start with the ETH transfer process.\n\nSo, let\u2019s say that you have some ETH in your MetaMask wallet and you want to transfer them to a third-party website.\n\nOpen the MetaMask extension in your browser and make sure you\u2019re logged into your account. Then, select the send option. This will open a window with a field that says recipient address, where you should paste the recipient\u2019s wallet address. Be sure to double-check the address, since there\u2019s no way to recover your assets if they get sent to the wrong address or a destination that is incompatible with the currency you sent. In the field amount, you can enter the exact amount of ETH you wish to transfer, using as much as 18 decimals. Clicking on the next button will prompt MetaMask to create a transaction window, with all the details. In the top section of this window, you can see your account details on the left and the recipient\u2019s account details on the right. Underneath, you will see the exact amount of ETH you selected for the transfer. The Gas Limit and Gas Price fields can be changed, but it\u2019s fine to leave them at their default values. (Note: If you\u2019re not sure about how much your ETH transaction from MetaMask will cost, you can use the ETH Gas station to calculate the price) When everything is in order, you just have to press the send transaction button to start the transaction. Just select Yes in the pop-up window and that\u2019s it. Depending on the busyness of the network, it could take up to a few minutes to receive confirmation that the transaction is complete.\n\nTransferring ERC20 Tokens\n\nThe process is relatively the same for ERC20 tokens, with a few differences.\n\nWhen initiating an ERC20 transaction, you fill in the amount section with the number of tokens that you want to transfer. Next to the amount field, you can select the ERC20 token from the dropdown list. (Note: If you\u2019re using MyEtherWallet or MEW with MetaMask, it will automatically calculate the transaction gas limit based on average market activity and Ethereum network busyness) It\u2019s that simple. After the transfer is complete, you will see the transfer hash and details at the bottom of the page.\n\nTransferring Custom Tokens\n\nMetaMask also supports the transfer of custom tokens.\n\nAt first, it can seem a bit complicated, since there is no send button next to the custom tokens. Instead, you have to use MEW, and connect it with your MetaMask account. After connecting MEW with MetaMask, all you have to do is add your custom token contract address in MetaMask. The custom tokens will then appear in the dropdown menu ready for sending. The rest of the procedure is identical to transferring ERC20 tokens.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I transfer tokens from Metamask?\n\nTo transfer tokens from Metamasks, click on \u201cSettings\u201d then select \u201cExchange\u201d. Enter the amount of ETH/ERC20 token you want to send. Click on \u201cSend\u201d, enter the address where you would like to receive the tokens, and confirm the transaction. The other option is to use MyEtherWallet.com to create a new wallet, add your Ethereum address, and then send the tokens directly to yourself.\n\nHow do I transfer money from Metamask to my bank account?\n\nThe easiest way to transfer funds from Metamask to your bank account is through Coinbase. To use Coinbase, you need to create an account for yourself first. Then, you would go to the \u201cSend\u201d tab at the top right corner of the pageand click on \u201cFunds Transfer\u201d. Enter the amount you want to send, select the wallet address you want to receive the funds into, and then confirm the transaction. This should be done immediately after sending the funds.\n\nHow do I send tokens to Metamask?\n\nTo use Metamask, simply click on \u201cSend\u201d under the \u201cTokens\u201d tab. Then select Ethereum from the dropdown menu. Next, enter the amount of ETH you want to transfer into Metamask, then press \u201cTransfer.\u201d Once the transaction has been confirmed, Metamask should show the new balance for your account.\n\nCan Metamask store NFTs?\n\nMetamask supports multiple types of ERC20 tokens, including NFTs. To add any token, click \u201cAdd Token\u201d at the top right corner of the page, then select the token from the drop down list. Once selected, enter the address for the token into the field provided. Click \u201cSave.\u201d\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nAs you can see, using MetaMask to transfer your tokens to third-party token addresses is relatively simple, and even more importantly, it\u2019s secure.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that MetaMask is so popular among users because it\u2019s easy to use, free, and available as a browser extension.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum meme coin Pepe and its Shiba Inu-themed Solana competitors Dogwifhat and BONK have posted some huge gains while riding the wave of Bitcoin's 11% gain past $56,000.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE) has leapt 36% in the past 24 hours and is trading for $0.00000215 at the time of writing. That's an 80% gain from just a week ago and the highest PEPE has been since May 2023, according to CoinGecko data. At the time, PEPE had just entered the top 100 digital assets with a market capitalization of $540 million.\n\nTo put in perspective just how much the crypto market has grown since then, PEPE has seen its market cap almost double to $900 million and ranks as only the 102nd largest coin.\n\nAs the price has skyrocketed, a number of PEPE holders have cashed in. Six different wallets account for roughly $4 million worth of PEPE tokens sold today on Binance today, netting the holders about $2 million worth of profit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu-themed meme coins on Solana have seen big gains as well.\n\nDogwifhat (WIF) has gained 46% in the past day and is currently trading for $0.5634. The meme coin has been in new all-time high territory since yesterday, when it surpassed $0.45 yesterday afternoon.\n\nAnd BONK, which was originally airdropped to Solana developers in 2022 and then saw a massive surge in December that culminated in the token setting an all-time high of $0.000025, has increased 16% since this time yesterday. At the time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.00001445, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), two of the original meme coins, have seen their own\u2014albeit, much smaller\u2014price rallies over the past day. DOGE, the first ever meme coin, is currently trading for $0.09652 after having gained 12% since Monday morning. And SHIB has gained 8% since yesterday, and is currently trading at $0.00001051, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the past couple weeks, Dogecoin has been struggling to remain in the top 10 ranking of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on price aggregators, like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. Today it's still solidly outside the top 10, with a $13.8 billion market cap compared to the next largest coin, Avalanche (AVAX), which is sitting at $14.8 billion market cap.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

By that measure, NodeMonkes is now worth $208 million.\n\nBy comparison, Bored Apes, the most valuable NFT collection by floor price, is worth $773 million.\n\nPuppets, the other high-performing Bitcoin NFT collection, had an even greater increase in floor price in the last week, rising 130%.\n\nBoth of the NFT collections are made possible on Bitcoin by a method called \u201cinscriptions\u201d \u2014 a way to embed images and audio files on the Bitcoin blockchain by placing them onto a Satoshi, the smallest Bitcoin denomination.\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have native smart contract support.\n\nBut with inscriptions, developers can mimic Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality on Bitcoin to create applications like NFTs and memecoins.\n\nWhile inscriptions have opened a new vista for Bitcoin functionality, the market segment has its detractors. Bitcoin purists cast a jaundiced glance at inscriptions, often dismissing them as spam clogging up the blockchain.\n\nVeteran Bitcoin developer and vocal Inscriptions critic Luke Dashjr has even tried to push for filtering mechanisms that target these so-called spam transactions.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum Pre-Mine Address Dormant For 8.6 Years Awakens As ETH Hits $3,200 | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "A dormant Ethereum address has roared to life to take advantage of the price surge that has rocked the digital asset in the last day. The wallet, which had not seen any activity in almost a decade, made its first transaction after the price of ETH moved above $3,200. Given that this investor has managed to hold all through these years, are they ready to sell?\n\nDormant Pre-Mine Ethereum Address Wakes Up\n\nOn-chain data tracking platform Whale Alert reported in the early hours of Tuesday that a dormant Ethereum address had awakened. The address in question is a pre-mine address, which means that it has been in existence before the official launch of Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the address on-chain, we can see that the address had received 238.75 ETH at Block 0, which is the Genesis block. Now, given that at that time, there was basically no value for ETH, it is possible that this could\u2019ve been a test transaction at the time, only worth a couple of dollars at launch.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 238 #ETH (771,893 USD) has just been activated after 8.6 years!https://t.co/Py2J5EO1T8 \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) February 27, 2024\n\nHowever, as the years have passed, the value of the ETH has ballooned. With the Ethereum price currently above $3,200, the value of the wallet\u2019s holding has risen to more than $770,000 at the time of writing. This increase in price could\u2019ve been the prompt for the wallet owner to re-enter the market.\n\nAn initial transaction of 1 ETH was first carried out from this wallet to another \u201c0x785c8E\u20263e77ED7c\u201d and once that transaction was confirmed, the entirety of the wallet balance was then transferred out to the same wallet. In total, the wallet was dormant for 8.6 years before being reactivated today.\n\nWhere Did The ETH End Up?\n\nFor the investor behind this dormant address, it seems that the end game is indeed to sell, given where the ETH ended up. After transferring the balance to \u201c0x785c8E\u20263e77ED7c\u201d, which is a brand new wallet, another test transaction of 1 ETH was carried out with the destination being Coinbase. Subsequently, the entirety of the balance was sent to Coinbase as well, leaving the new wallet empty.\n\nGiven that the major reason why investors send coins to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase is to sell, it is possible that this investor is looking to sell their coins. In such a case, the coins may have been long sold at the time of this publication.\n\nHowever, given that the balance of this address was worth less than $1 million, it is unlikely to have any negative effect on the Ethereum price even if the investor is selling their coins. Even now, Ethereum continues to hold strongly above $3,200 as bulls dominate the market.\n\nETH price bounces above $3,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Forkast News, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum: Shaping the Future of Finance Together - Kenyan Wallstreet",
        "content": "Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have gone from an obscure technology embraced by innovators and early adopters to reshaping the landscape of global finance. The two most influential and widely-used cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have spearheaded this financial revolution. Together, they are driving financial inclusion, decentralizing services through blockchain technology, creating investment opportunities, and spurring technological innovation across countless industries. However, they also face challenges around volatility, security, regulations, and more on the road to mainstream adoption.\n\n\n\nFor a deeper insight into Bitcoin\u2019s market trends and price predictions, explore this comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin price prediction. Understanding the future trajectory of Bitcoin is essential for individuals navigating the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency investments.\n\n\n\nFinancial Inclusion for the Unbanked\n\nCryptocurrencies have brought financial services to hundreds of millions of unbanked and underbanked individuals across the world. According to the World Bank, around 1.7 billion adults globally lack access to formal financial services. This prevents them from saving, obtaining credit, making payments securely, building credit history, managing financial risks, and more.\n\nBitcoin, with its permissionless and pseudonymous nature, finally enabled these unbanked populations to participate in the global financial system. Using Bitcoin, anyone with an internet connection can send or receive money across borders trustlessly without requiring documentation, identification, or approval from any gatekeeper. Platforms like Paxful allow trading Bitcoin for hundreds of payment methods, including gift cards, online wallets, and cash payments.\n\nThe decentralization of finance through cryptocurrencies has been revolutionary for financial inclusion. Remittances, which many underbanked populations rely heavily on, can now be sent faster and cheaper through crypto compared to traditional wire transfers. DeFi lending markets allow users to permission lessly access loans using cryptocurrency as collateral, with no credit checks.\n\nDecentralized Finance \u2013 The Future of Banking\n\nDecentralized finance, popularly known as DeFi, refers to blockchain-based financial services that do not rely on traditional banks or financial intermediaries. The majority of DeFi applications are currently built on the Ethereum network, taking advantage of the platform\u2019s programmability, smart contracts functionality, and active ecosystem of developers. To start using Ethereum\u2019s DeFi protocols, users first need to obtain some ETH. A convenient option is to directly buy eth with debit card on mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges that support debit card purchases.\n\nDeFi applications aim to decentralize financial use cases such as lending, trading, derivatives, asset management and more by using smart contracts instead of centralized institutions. For example, lending protocols like Aave and Compound allow users to seamlessly lend and borrow assets through permissionless liquidity pools funded by lenders in the network. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap enable trading crypto tokens through automated liquidity pools instead of order books.\n\nBy decentralizing the control and governance of these financial applications using the underlying blockchain networks, DeFi aims to make finance more transparent, accessible, efficient and composable. Although still early, DeFi has grown exponentially, with over $100 billion locked into Ethereum DeFi applications alone promising a more open and connected financial future for all.\n\nAutomating Finance Using Smart Contracts\n\nAt the core of Ethereum\u2019s groundbreaking capabilities lie smart contracts \u2013 programmatic agreements on the blockchain which self-execute based on predefined conditions. These enable automation and remove intermediaries using code rather than relying on all parties to manually execute their obligations.\n\nSmart contracts open up an array of new possibilities. Many DeFi lending protocols on Ethereum use smart contract collateral to secure loans trustlessly. NFT marketplaces like OpenSea gain efficiency by automating transactions and royalty payments to creators using smart contracts instead of lawyers and accountants. Decentralized insurance offerings pay out verified claims automatically when pre-agreed conditions configured in a smart contract are triggered. Prediction markets, derivative contracts, transparent supply chains and more all gain programmability using Ethereum\u2019s smart contract infrastructure.\n\nWhile the applications are abundant, smart contract execution remains deterministic, immutable and highly composable, allowing money, digital assets and financial services built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain to combine seamlessly in previously unimaginable ways. This composability unlocks new opportunities for innovation combining decentralized applications using existing building blocks.\n\nInvestment Opportunities with Cryptocurrencies\n\nBeyond enabling new models for finance, cryptocurrencies themselves have evolved into a high-growth alternative asset class, providing early investors tremendous opportunities. In fact, an investment of just $1,000 into Bitcoin in 2010 would be worth over $50 million today! Of course, the extreme volatility makes timing notoriously difficult. Still, institutional and retail adoption has been rising steadily over recent years as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream.\n\nIn 2021, Tesla allocated $1.5 billion into Bitcoin, while MicroStrategy invested billions into digital assets instead of traditional corporate treasury reserves. Major banks like Goldman Sachs have also enabled trading of Bitcoin futures. These big institutional players helped legitimize cryptoassets as an emergent institutional investment vertical similar to commodities, hedge funds, venture capital and more. Retail traders have also flooded into the scene, using exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken to gain exposure.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains the most popular and stable cryptocurrency dominating investor interest, Ethereum provides unique investment opportunities given its position as the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Investing in the native token Ether allows speculation on the growing activity of DeFi, NFTs, games, DAOs, stablecoins and other use cases atop the network. As adoption of applications on Ethereum increases, it stands to boost the underlying network use and its token value.\n\nTechnological Innovation and Impact\n\nThe technology powering Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 as well as the wider landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchains \u2013 promises profound innovations across industries. They allow valuable digital assets like money, identity, credentials, property deeds, licenses and artwork to be controlled, transacted and verified without requiring trusted third parties. This has the potential to transform legacy models across healthcare, supply chain, music, manufacturing, voting, credentials and countless other industries.\n\nAlready NFTs are reinventing digital art ownership and royalties for creators. Sensor-equipped hardware like the GrainChain system uses the Bitcoin network to establish transparent provenance tracking from farms to facilities to stores in supply chains. Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain identities to enable control over sensitive records to patients without intermediaries. Musicians get paid directly by integrating systems like Audius with social media apps instead of centralized music studios.\n\nDespite their youth, blockchains have inspired incredible amounts of innovation in both finance as well as technology. Bitcoin gave birth to cryptocurrencies \u2013 Ethereum expanded that into decentralized applications. Yet much of their transformative capacity still remains untapped. And with the next generation of shards, layer 2 solutions, sidechains and cross-chain bridges aim to scale throughput and lower latencies even further to support internet-scale adoption.\n\nRegulatory Challenges on the Path to Maturity\n\nOf course, no major new emergent technology comes without obstacles on the road to maturity and mainstream adoption. Cryptocurrencies have been saddled with several key challenges around volatility, security, and lack of regulatory clarity that have slowed institutional and governmental buy-in.\n\nFirstly, cryptocurrency markets themselves remain notoriously volatile, causing panic selling just as severe euphoric booms which witness coins multiplying rapidly in price over short periods. Government policies banning crypto trading often spark dramatic price movements as well. Until stability in pricing and valuation models for crypto assets emerge, most retail participants and corporates may remain apprehensive to embrace digital currencies.\n\nSecondly, security of keys and accounts remains a glaring issue given the irreversible and pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. Investors losing access to their private keys remain permanently locked out of their funds. Hacks targeting vulnerable exchange and wallet providers have cost users billions over the years. Solutions usingThreshold signatures, biometrics, hardware security modules and multi-party computation provide sophisticated key management targeted at enterprises. Yet better backup, storage and encryption standards for end users are critical for consumer and regulator confidence.\n\nFinally, the lack of consistent governmental policies, guidelines or legal frameworks across jurisdictions hampers institutions leaning into crypto adoption at scale. While crypto-friendly regions like Miami and Wyoming attract talent \u2013 other major economies like India and China have flip-flopped between conflicting stances. Achieving better international consensus or collaboration to address concerns around illicit financial flows while supporting innovation could be instrumental to unleash the full potential of crypto.\n\nThe Inevitability of Mass Adoption\n\nDespite facing regulatory uncertainty and experimenting with technical and economic tradeoffs, the mass adoption of blockchain-based digital assets seems inevitable in the years to come. Much like the commercial internet saw rapid early growth amongst consumers in the 90s beyond clunky interfaces and weak infrastructure, potential use cases for cryptocurrency abound across the mainstream today in ways that barely scratch the surface of what these networks can achieve in the future.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin and Ethereum represent two sides of the same pioneering coin \u2013 one fulfilling digital gold and a stable store-of-value, while the other serves as the most fertile launchpad for decentralized applications. Together, they have kickstarted a movement towards open access, transparency and equal opportunity for finance and technology using the power of cryptography and blockchain. In the process, they have opened new worlds of innovation combining code, community and capital in ways that will shape and impact global finance for generations to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n."

BTC seems to be going through a cool-off period currently. With investor sentiment still strong, many are expecting a positive price action. ETH (+2.3%) reclaimed the $3k level for the second time in February. The recent upward movements have also elevated ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) while growing its Total Supply in Profit; around 1 million ETH in profit over the weekend.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is consolidating around the $52,000 mark after a substantial two-week surge, supported by a resilient stock market, the upcoming halving event, and consistent investments in spot. Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin's stability above $50,000 is noteworthy, with alternative cryptos attracting short-term investors. The current price action indicates support at $50,500 and resistance at $53,000, suggesting a consolidation phase. With the RSI approaching overbought levels and rising moving averages, bullish momentum is evident. A breach above the $53,000 resistance could trigger a significant rally, possibly reaching the $60,000 milestone.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's price resilience, bolstered by legal victories such as the recent Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms' success against US energy regulators, underscores its stability amid regulatory uncertainty around the world, particularly in Nigeria. While calls for regulatory clarity persist, institutional interest is growing, exemplified by Carlson Group's inclusion of bitcoin ETFs. With Bitcoin trading around $51,600, holding support at $51,000 is key for a potential upside trajectory with resistance at $53,943, $55,214 and $56,497. The RSI at 55 suggests balance, while the 50-day EMA at $51,079 suggests bullish sentiment. As a result, a cautiously optimistic outlook prevails, dependent on sustained levels of support and regulatory developments.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is experiencing consolidation over the last few weeks by trading under the $50,000-$53000 range. After rallying by around 36% since the start of 2024, Bitcoin has failed to breach the $53,000 resistance. A breakout above this level would push the price of the biggest cryptocurrency up to $60,000 in the near future.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the crypto market showed a slightly bearish sentiment with the first net outflow from BTC ETF since January 25, 2024, signalling bearishness.

        "title": "Getting to Know ERC-777: History, Benefits, & Features - Indodax",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain protocol that specifies the types of tokens that can operate compatibly with ETH is ERC-777. The ERC-777 is a more advanced token standard on the Ethereum network that was designed as a development of the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nThe addition of new security features and functionality characterizes ERC 777. As a token standard on the Ethereum network, ERC-777 is of particular interest due to its full compatibility with decentralized exchanges and its focused development goals.\n\nTo understand what ERC 777 is, its history and purpose, its benefits and advantages, and its main features, check out the full review below!\n\nWhat is ERC 777?\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, ERC-777 is a token standard for creating token equivalents on the Ethereum network. This standard can fully integrate with existing decentralized exchanges.\n\nIn simpler terms, ERC-777 is the Ethereum blockchain protocol that governs the types of tokens that can operate compatibly with ETH.\n\nHistory and Purpose of ERC-777\n\nJordi Baylina, Jacques Dafflon, and Thomas Shababi proposed ERC-777 in November 2017 as a new token standard on the Ethereum platform.\n\nThey aimed to improve the ERC-20 standard by introducing more features while ensuring backward compatibility with existing ERC-20 applications.\n\nBenefits and Advantages of ERC-777\n\nERC 777 simplifies interactions in complex token trades and helps resolve ambiguities around decimals, minting, and burning. ERC-777 uses a highly efficient feature known as a hook.\n\nWhen tokens are delivered to a computer-based analytics contract, the hook mechanism is activated, thus simplifying the interaction between the account and the contract when receiving tokens. Additionally, tokens are less likely to get trapped in the contract with ERC-777 tokens, which is an improvement over the problems commonly associated with ERC-20 tokens.\n\nMain Features of ERC-777\n\nThe following are some of the advantages or benefits provided by the ERC-777 standard, among others:\n\nERC-777 implements a new standard, ERC-820, which enables the registration of metadata for contracts to provide basic introspection capabilities. This approach enables backward compatibility as well as the extension of additional functionality. Contracts in the ERC-777 standard interact similarly to contracts in the ERC-20 standard.\n\nWhen tokens are sent to a computer-based analytics contract, activation of the hook mechanism eases the interaction between the account and the contract during the token acceptance process.\n\nGet to Know ERC 777 Improvements Over ERC 20\n\nQuoting ethereum.org, ERC-777 brings further improvements compared to ERC-20, among others:\n\nHooks are functions described in the smart contract code. Hooks are called when tokens are sent or received through the contract, allowing the smart contract to respond to incoming or outgoing token events.\n\nHooks are registered and identified using the ERC-1820 standard. The following are some of the benefits of hooks, namely:\n\nHooks allow sending tokens to a contract and notifying the contract in a single transaction, unlike ERC-20, which requires multiple calls (approve/transferFrom) to achieve this.\n\nContracts that have not registered hooks cannot communicate properly with ERC-777. If the sending contract uses a hook and the receiving contract has not registered a hook, the transaction will be aborted, thus preventing accidental transfers to non-ERC-777 smart contracts.\n\nHooks can also reject transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ERC-777 exhibits some important advantages as a more advanced token standard on Ethereum. Among these are enhanced security features and functionality compared to previous token standards such as ERC-20.\n\nFurthermore, to fully understand the future development potential of tokens, it is important to delve further into the innovative features introduced by ERC-777. That way, we can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the evolution of this token standard within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFor additional information, you can also read other interesting articles about the difference between ERC 721 vs ERC 1155 and ERC 404 in the best article collection from INDODAX Academy, and you can also read crypto terms in the Academy glossary.\n\nTo increase your knowledge of blockchain technology, you are strongly encouraged to read the latest articles available on INDODAX Academy.\n\nINDODAX Academy presents a variety of materials covering basic concepts and more in-depth aspects of blockchain technology.\n\nBy reading various articles on INDODAX Academy, you can gain a deeper understanding of this technology, including its applications, and get the latest information about the crypto world.\n\nInvest in Ethereum on INDODAX\n\nWell, now you understand what ERC 777 is, its history and purpose, its benefits and advantages, to its main features.\n\nFurthermore, to invest crypto assets in Ethereum at INDODAX, you should check the Ethereum price today on the INDODAX Market.\n\nThe following are the steps to buy Ethereum on INDODAX:\n\nLogin to your INDODAX account.\n\nMake a deposit if your balance is still empty.\n\nOpen the marketplace and find Ethereum.\n\nAfter that, find the sales column and enter the desired Ethereum price and the available balance.
