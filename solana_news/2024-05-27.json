        "title": "How Green Is Ethereum? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum's update in September 2022 was called the Merge. Developers integrated the long-anticipated transition to proof-of-stake in this update (among other issues) significantly reducing the blockchain's energy requirement. The new Ethereum chain, which was called Ethereum 2.0 until the Ethereum Foundation requested that it not be, reduced energy use and promised faster transactions and lower gas fees. Read on to discover how green Ethereum is and learn about its plans that may be even more environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum blockchain upgrade was called the Merge.\n\nThe upgrade enhanced the network and reduced energy consumption.\n\nIts proof-of-stake validation mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work mechanisms.\n\nGas fees fell after the Merge (not because of it), but they aren't as low as from 2017 to 2020.\n\nThe Merge set the stage for further scalability enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nEthereum and Energy Use\n\nEthereum is a software platform that is open to anyone. It is commonly associated with ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency that is bought and sold by investors. Ethereum can be used by anyone for different reasons, including banking and finance, network and application building, and peer-to-peer financial networking without the need for middlemen.\n\nEthereum was created in 2013 and launched two years later by Vitalik Buterin. It is among the most well-known names in the cryptocurrency markets, coming in as the second-largest by market capitalization after Bitcoin. As of May 27, 2024, Ethereum's market cap was $466.67 billion. But, Ethereum mining is no longer possible after the move from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-stake reduced the blockchain's energy use by more than 99%.\n\nPoS differs from PoW in that it is not a network-wide competitive process of encrypting information through a hashing algorithm. PoS still uses a hashing algorithm and verifies transactions through a consensus layer, but the validators are randomly chosen by the network based on the amount of ether they have staked. Staking means offering ether as collateral to become a network validator so the participant can earn ether rewards.\n\nSelecting one semi-trusted validator to hash the information in a block and verify it uses far less energy than a competition. So, Ethereum is much more green in terms of energy consumption than it used to be.\n\nWere Ethereum Gas Fees Reduced?\n\nTransaction fees rose on the Ethereum network in 2020 because of increased network activity. At the time, the transactions of originators who offered the most in fees were placed in front of those who paid less. This created a fee war of sorts, with users trying to get their transactions validated quicker and miners charging more for prime validation spots.\n\nAn earlier attempt to fix rising costs tried to remove the transaction auction mentality from the network by imposing a base fee and a priority fee. The priority fee is similar to a tip to validators for them to choose to process one transaction instead of another. This was ineffective at lowering transaction fees because users still increased their tips to get transactions approved faster.\n\nEthereum is on its way to becoming a greener blockchain and network. Future upgrades are expected to make it more efficient, scalable, and less costly.\n\n\n\nEthereum Transaction Speeds\n\nThe Merge, which was an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain to a different version set the stage for future upgrades. Many people called the upgrade Ethereum 2.0, It was the most significant update to the system. Although it didn't improve transaction speeds at the time or even a few years later, future upgrades will introduce improvements in network speed and scalability.\n\nIs Ethereum Green?\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the blockchain and network consume 0.0026 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr). This translates to the equivalent of 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Compare this to Bitcoin's 149 TWh/yr and global data centers' 190 TWh/yr. Ethereum also consumes less energy than video gaming in the U.S. (34 TWh/yr) and less than Google (19 TWh/yr).\n\nThe University of Cambridge's Judge Business School researched the energy sources for the Ethereum network after the Merge. According to its findings, 48% of Ethereum's energy comes from sustainable sources like wind power, nuclear power, and other renewables. The remaining 52% is powered by natural gas (30%), coal (19%), and oil (3%).\n\nAccording to similar reports, Ethereum is greener than it was before switching to PoS. However, there are many more upgrades planned that have the potential to make it even more efficient and eco-friendly.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight new spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May 2024. Trading will take place on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX. There is no initial trading date as of yet, as the SEC is still working on final approvals. The move follows the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January 2024\u2014three years after Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched.\n\nThe Green Future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum has plans for upgrades to bring a new concept to the blockchain, which is expected to allow it to scale and increase transaction processing speeds. In March 2024, the Dencun Upgrade was released.\n\nThis upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, a process where second-layer rollup providers can send Binary Objects (also known as blobs) to the Ethereum main chain. Blobs are much cheaper to send than rollups, so transaction fees are expected to drop when full danksharding is released.\n\nThe full upgrade to danksharding is expected to allow Ethereum to scale up to more than 100,000 transactions per second and be cheaper, both of which will contribute to its greenness.\n\nFuture upgrades will address issues regarding:\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nDecentralization\n\nProtocol risks from Maximal Extractable Value\n\nBlock verification\n\nComputational costs\n\nMaximal Extractable Value is the maximum amount of value a validator or miner can get from a block in excess of the block reward and usual fees.\n\nThe lesser the blockchain costs, the more decentralized it becomes and the more efficient it will be. However, there are concerns whether decentralized applications built on Ethereum will consume more energy. Ethereum has positioned itself as the platform of choice for Web3 development.\n\nWeb3 is a concept of restructuring the backend of the internet, where control of people's information, data, and digital creations are returned to them. Many steps must be taken and hurdles overcome before blockchain technology can be used to create the new internet infrastructure conceived by developers.\n\nIf Ethereum is the platform used to create applications for this emerging and in-development restructuring, its eco-friendlier network might not be as environmentally friendly. However, it could be even more so\u2014there is no way to tell.\n\n\n\nDoes Ethereum Use Energy? Yes, Ethereum uses energy. It is a blockchain, a distributed ledger secured by cryptography, which requires energy to run and use.\n\nIs Ethereum Environmentally Friendly? Ethereum's carbon footprint is much less than it was before September 2022 but it still uses energy. Nearly half of its network is located in developed areas that use sustainable energy sources. About 30% of the remaining half is powered by natural gas, 10% by coal, and 3% by oil.\n\nHow Much Energy Did Ethereum Use Before the Merge? According to data from the University of Cambridge's Sustainability Index, Ethereum used about 21.41 THh of electricity per year and released 10.26 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor Ethereum, the evolution to a better-performing, more accessible network has begun. Continued updates promise to cut back on emissions and make the network more energy-efficient while improving speeds and cutting transaction costs. However, Ethereum has much ground to cover to get to the levels of efficiency it wants, both in speed and environmental friendliness."

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin are holding us back - Blockworks",
        "content": "The year is 2024, and the fast-paced realm of crypto shows no signs of slowing. Innovation is the name of the game, and monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin still reign supreme.\n\nBut as someone who\u2019s been knee-deep in the trenches of blockchain development, I can\u2019t help but wonder if these behemoths are really cutting it anymore. Herein lies my thesis:\n\nModular blockchains are the disruptors poised to revolutionize scalability and creativity towards the next Cambrian explosion of Web3 products as we know them.\n\nAs engineers and product developers, it\u2019s time to embrace specialized tools for specialized tasks and leave the one-size-fits-all approach behind. This isn\u2019t to say that prior layer-1s haven\u2019t paved the way for some incredible innovations, but attempting to scale legacy layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin has proven inefficient and counterproductive. They\u2019re dragging us down, like trying to sprint through quicksand.\n\nBlockchain researchers have grappled with the challenge of creating the optimal system for years. Many architectures attempted to accommodate all users on a single chain or a tightly coupled group of chains. Yet, scaling such systems for billions of users is complex and limited. We\u2019ve thrown everything and the kitchen sink at it with solutions like sharding and layer-2 blockchains to provide additional scaling methods.\n\nDespite this, most efforts still fall somewhat short in addressing all fundamental scalability issues. As a result of these failings, and perhaps in response to them, modular blockchains are strutting onto the scene as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Prime yourself and think, \u201cmore legos.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of modular blockchains\n\nThink of modular blockchains like the Swiss Army Knife of blockchain development.\n\nThese chains break down the blockchain into modular components, specializing in specific tasks at the core of a blockchain\u2019s architecture: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability. By distributing tasks across multiple specialized layers, modular blockchains can, in theory, achieve greater scalability, customizability and security at a faster pace. When you distribute the workload like that, magic happens \u2014 so why waddle about in intellectual exercises of scaling bloated layer-1s?\n\nAt the core of modular blockchain architecture lies a layered approach that\u2019s as elegant as it is efficient. The old heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the foundational layer of the crypto economy and hold down the fort with their robust security and stability. Meanwhile, layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains provide scalability without compromising the security of the base layer. Lastly, layer-3 protocols offer specialized environments tailored to specific development needs.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ethereum is too hard to use\n\nOne of the first projects to propose modular blockchain development is the Celestia network. Celestia currently functions by separating execution from consensus and implementing data availability sampling (DAS) as a core feature.\n\nModular blockchains\u2019 adroit-like qualities for specific engineering challenges translate into a targeted effectiveness to service specific industry niches.\n\nTo illustrate, GameSwift, a modular blockchain project, is currently working to facilitate the development of games hosted on-chain. Their goal is to create a network of applications that will help avoid gamers\u2019 in-game purchases or earned assets being stored in a central server and consequently hacked. To highlight the relevance of this innovation, global gaming audiences spent approximately $54 billion on additional in-game content in 2020.\n\nThe shape of things to come\n\nModular projects are already pushing boundaries and redefining what\u2019s possible in the blockchain space. Hybrid optimistic and zero-knowledge solutions are on the horizon, promising even greater scalability and security, as is the application of sharding, incentivized verification and parallelized VMs (virtual machines) on the execution layer of a chain.\n\nWith layer-1s feeling the heat, Ethereum devs released plans for a unified settlement and data availability layer: danksharding, a promising development, and a term I can\u2019t say aloud without curling my lips. But development and on-time delivery for these monolithic chains\u2019 upgrades have been historically slow and unmet.\n\nBy accepting monolithic chains as what might be holding us back, modular architectures offer a glimmer of hope. We are transitioning from monolithic blockchains and siloed consensus layers to modular, application-specific chains with shared consensus layers.\n\nWhile challenges remain in standardizing cross-chain communication and ensuring decentralization at each level, the potential benefits of modular blockchains are too compelling to ignore. These blockchains have the potential, and are already being applied, to impact industries like supply chain management, real estate (property transactions), digital identity verification, energy grid management and even healthcare data management.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a die-hard Bitcoin maximalist or an Ethereum enthusiast, one thing\u2019s for sure: In a modular future, users emerge as the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\nNiko Hosn, CTO of ZTX and founder of RareMint, is an expert in Web3 gaming and blockchain development.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Future Outlook - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The analysis of the price of Ethereum (ETH) is a recent and central topic in the world of cryptocurrencies, with experts actively discussing the future market dynamics.\n\nRecent developments have captured the attention of investors: the possibility that the price of Ethereum reaches 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs and the future implications of the approvals of spot Ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum: short-term price outlook and the analysis of the impact of the ETF\n\nArthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, has suggested that the price of Ethereum could reach 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs. This prediction is based on a combination of technical and fundamental factors. In particular, Cheong highlights the growing adoption of Ethereum in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, which are driving the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous improvement of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, such as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d upgrade, promises to solve scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. These developments could further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nL\u2019approvazione degli ETF spot Ether da parte della SEC statunitense rappresenta una svolta significativa per il mercato delle criptovalute. Secondo esperti come Bill Hughes di Consensys, questa mossa \u00e8 un\u2019ammissione implicita che Ethereum \u00e8 considerato un bene commodity.\n\nThe adoption of ETF on Ethereum could make the cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors, increasing liquidity and stabilizing prices.\n\nEric Balchunas, analista di Bloomberg, prevede che il lancio degli ETF su Ethereum seguir\u00e0 uno schema simile a quello degli ETF su Bitcoin, con una competizione intensa tra gli emittenti. Tuttavia, Balchunas nota che gli ETF su Ethereum potrebbero generare un volume inferiore rispetto a quelli su Bitcoin, stimando una raccolta totale di circa 1-2 miliardi di dollari nelle prime settimane.\n\nMatthew Sigel di VanEck, uno degli emittenti di ETF, highlights the importance of presenting Ethereum as an asset with intrinsic value, especially to tech and equity investors.\n\nSigel believes that many of these investors are not yet aware of the potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nGlobal competition and regulatory outlook\n\nYat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, observes that the approval of ETFs on Ethereum in the United States could stimulate other jurisdictions to follow suit.\n\nCountries like the Regno Unito, Singapore, Giappone, and Emirati Arabi Uniti might be incentivized to introduce their own crypto-based ETFs to avoid falling behind in the global competition.\n\nSiu emphasizes that this competition could lead to interesting developments and a change in sentiment in the United States towards greater acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTuttavia, la trasparenza delle normative rimane una preoccupazione, come evidenziato da Hughes, che critica la SEC per la mancanza di chiarezza sulle implicazioni delle sue decisioni.\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price and its future prospects are influenced by a series of interconnected factors. The forecast of a short-term price increase up to 4,500 dollars reflects the optimism about the growing adoption and technological improvements of Ethereum.\n\nAt the same time, the approval of Ethereum ETFs could represent a breakthrough for traditional investors\u2019 accessibility to the cryptocurrency market, further stabilizing the price.\n\nThe global competition for the introduction of cryptocurrency ETFs and regulatory developments will continue to play a crucial role in determining the future of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and market observers will need to closely monitor these developments to adapt their investment strategies in a rapidly changing environment."

        "content": "So-called memecoins have been rallying over the past week\u2014and among the five cryptocurrencies to gain the most are four Solana-based tokens. Floki leads the way (up 35%), followed by dogwifhat (32%), Pepe (27%), and Bonk (22%), according to CoinGecko data as of Tuesday morning. Bonk reached highs of $0.00004387, missing its all-time high of $0.00004547 in March by a razor-thin edge.\n\nThe price surges overlap with the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lighting eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds, with firms such as BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity among the filers. Memecoins, considered to be the highest risk and highest reward part of the crypto industry, often witness notable price swings during a pro-crypto news cycle. By contrast, Ether has climbed a modest 2% since Thursday\u2019s approvals, trading at $3,847 on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ETF approvals have \u201cpeople bullish on the far fringes of the coin space,\u201d Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University, told Fortune.\n\nIndeed, Google Trends data shows that search interest for \u201cEthereum\u201d over the past 12 months is near all-time highs, and memecoins are \u201cheavily driven\u201d by this kind of market attention, says Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that as money flows into the ecosystem through ETFs, it often trickles down to these smaller projects,\u201d Jonathan Bixby, chairman of Phoenix Digital Assets, told Fortune. Memecoins have surged recently because of their \u201csmall caps\u201d compared with those of other cryptocurrencies, he says.\n\nMemecoins occupy just a fraction of the market capitalization of major currencies: Floki boasts a market cap of just $2.9 billion, compared with Ethereum\u2019s $460 billion, according to CoinGecko data. In other words, Bixby suggests that investors of fringe coins could be anticipating a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats effect once the ETFs begin trading.\n\nHowever, Matt Ballensweig, managing director at BitGo, told Fortune that he doesn\u2019t attribute the recent growth for some memecoins to the ETF approvals or a single event, but it is \u201ca sign that momentum across other layer 1s (such as Solana) continues to remain strong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSolana has basically solidified itself as the chain with the most \u2018speculative fun\u2019 as traders continue to gamble on memecoins on decentralized exchanges.\u201d\n\nOne reason why Ether has shown minimal price movements since Thursday is likely because, so far, the SEC has approved only the 19b-4 forms. These initial filings submitted by soon-to-be issuers allow the securities to be listed on exchanges. But for trading of the financial instruments to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, previously told Fortune. He estimated the forms would take about two weeks to be approved."

        "title": "Crypto Highlights: Bitcoin Price Volatility, Ethereum ETF Hopes, and Furrever Token's $1.2M Presale Finale - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with significant developments influencing investor sentiment and market dynamics. Recently, Bitcoin has faced potential price risks, Ethereum has generated buzz with ETF speculations, and Furrever Token is nearing the end of its successful $1.2 million presale. Here's an in-depth look at these key events and their potential impacts on the market.\n\nBitcoin Faces Price Drop Risks\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing potential price risks that have raised concerns among investors. A significant factor contributing to these fears is the activity of long-term holders. According to a recent analysis by analysts, these holders, who have amassed significant quantities of Bitcoin over time, are showing signs of profit-taking. This behavior often precedes a price drop, as large sell-offs can create downward pressure on Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe data suggests that long-term holders have been moving their BTC to exchanges, indicating a potential intent to sell. This trend, if it continues, could lead to increased volatility and a further decline in Bitcoin's price. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as regulatory developments and changes in investor sentiment, are also playing a role in the current market dynamics.\n\nDespite these concerns, Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption is growing, with major companies and financial institutions recognizing Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. The integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class provides a solid foundation for its future growth.\n\nEthereum ETF Hopes Stir Optimism\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has generated significant buzz with the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. A recent report by a trusted source highlights that industry experts, including Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, believe that a spot Ethereum ETF could be beneficial for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Ethereum. This could lead to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of ETH. Furthermore, an Ethereum ETF would signify a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial markets, paving the way for further innovation and adoption.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cautious in its approach to approving cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the growing interest from institutional investors and the increasing pressure from the crypto industry could eventually lead to a favorable decision.\n\nThe anticipation of an Ethereum ETF has already had a positive impact on market sentiment. Investors are hopeful that this development will bring more legitimacy to Ethereum and attract a new wave of capital into the market. As the industry awaits the SEC's decision, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF remains a key factor to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token\u2019s $1.2 Million Presale Nears to an End\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum navigate their respective challenges and opportunities, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves with its unique approach to the crypto market. Furrever Token aims to create a heartwarming ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery, offering a refreshing contrast to the often serious and technical world of blockchain projects.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a resounding success, raising over $1.2 million as it nears its end. This achievement highlights the strong interest and support from the crypto community. Built on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token has a total supply of around 9 billion tokens. Of these, 65% are available during the presale, 25% are allocated for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and 10% are reserved for the team, with a one-year lock on these tokens.\n\nFurrever Token's appeal lies in its blend of fun and innovation. The project integrates cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals, transforming everyday interactions into delightful experiences. Community engagement is a cornerstone of the Furrever ecosystem, with regular challenges and events that encourage users to share their love for cuteness. Future surprises, featuring exclusive cat content, are also planned to keep the community engaged and entertained.\n\nSecurity and compliance are paramount for Furrever Token. The project\u2019s smart contract has been audited by Securi Lab, ensuring a secure and reliable platform for users. The team, while not doxxed, has shown commitment to the project's longevity by locking their tokens for a year. The organic growth of the Furrever Token community, with nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram, further underscores its legitimacy and potential.\n\nAs the presale nears its end, now is the ideal time to invest in Furrever Token.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Taking a Breather Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three megacap tokens are seeing significant selling pressure to kick off the short week.\n\nAs we kick off a short week, investors in a range of speculative assets are seeing selling pressure build. Of course, there are plenty of macro reasons for this trepidation. Some rather important inflation readings are due later this week, which could impact everything from growth stocks to commodities to cryptocurrencies. Everything is tied to interest rates these days.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC -0.95%), Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.81%) are among the megacap tokens seeing declines today. Over the past 24 hours, these three top tokens have slumped 3.8%, 3.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving today's price action in these top tokens.\n\nEnthusiasm over key catalysts wears off\n\nInvestors in these three megacap tokens have certainly had quite the run over the past few weeks, and really since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin started the party off with the approval of a dozen spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, which conjured up some significant demand for its token. In combination with a halving event, which saw the amount of newly minted Bitcoin slashed in half, this created a supply-and-demand dynamic investors liked.\n\nEthereum recently saw similar catalysts take hold, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs last week as well. Additionally, previous upgrades have resulted in Ethereum becoming less inflationary, and depending on the day, deflationary based on token burn metrics relative to transaction volumes.\n\nAs a more speculative asset, Dogecoin has ridden market momentum higher. But with these catalysts now seemingly in the rearview mirror (it's really amazing how quickly the market adjusts to news, particularly in this space), some investors may be looking to sell into this news and wait patiently for another catalyst to take hold. A similar \"sell the news\" effect took place immediately following the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nUntil the next catalyst takes hold, investors appear to be on pause for the next reason to bet big on this sector (and these three tokens by default).\n\nA pause in the rally, or a reversal?\n\nNow, the question is whether this recent dip is a sign of more downside to come, or if it's simply a consolidation period before the next move higher. Earlier this month, a speculative wave hit the crypto sector, driving everything from meme tokens like Dogecoin to large-cap cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum higher. But since then, it appears the broader crypto market is awaiting the next catalyst on the horizon.\n\nThere is certainly a tremendous amount of innovation and technological movement happening underneath the surface in the crypto realm. I wouldn't be surprised to see headlines pop up for any of these three tokens that have the ability to move the market higher, with all three benefiting from positive news. I just don't know what the catalyst will be, or when positive momentum can be expected to build again. For now, I'm happily watching this price action from the sidelines."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing strong signs of an imminent rally, potentially reaching new all-time highs. This optimistic outlook was highlighted by prominent crypto analyst Jelle, who recently tweeted that ETH has broken out from the falling wedge and flipped its key areas into support. He mentioned that Ethereum is now pushing for $4,000 before potentially reaching a new all-time high.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum is priced at $3,904, reflecting a 2.66% increase in the past 24 hours. More impressively, the cryptocurrency has surged by 25.69% over the last 30 days. This robust performance has been accompanied by a significant rise in trading volume, which has jumped by 73.17% in the past day, reaching $18,148,744,905.\n\nFactors driving Ethereum's surge\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to Ethereum's recent price surge and the optimistic predictions for its future. Key among them is the recent regulatory development in the United States. On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications for the listing of eight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While further approvals are necessary before these ETFs can be traded, this move is seen as a positive step toward the broader adoption of ETH on the financial markets.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to attract significant institutional investment, providing a new avenue for both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. This development is likely to increase demand and liquidity on the market, supporting the upward price momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnical analysis supports bullish outlook\n\nMoreover, Jelle's analysis points to a strong technical foundation for Ethereum's current rally. The breakout from the falling wedge pattern is a bullish signal, indicating a reversal of the previous downtrend. The ability to flip key resistance areas into support further strengthens the case for continued upward movement .\n\nIn technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern that occurs when the price makes lower highs and lower lows within a converging downtrend. The breakout from this pattern suggests that the selling pressure is waning, and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, the flipping of resistance levels into support indicates strong buying interest at higher price levels, providing a solid base for further gains."

        "title": "Comparing smart contracts across different blockchains from Ethereum to Solana - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The crypto industry has several unique approaches to smart contract execution and decentralized applications (DApps). These innovations are driven by the need for scalability, security, and efficiency, allowing developers to build increasingly sophisticated applications. Yet, what is so different between the smart contracts on different blockchains? Which is the smartest smart contract platform?\n\nTuring completeness is a key aspect of smart contracts. Turing completeness is a concept from computational theory that refers to a system\u2019s ability to perform any computation given enough time and resources. It is named after the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who developed the concept in the context of the theoretical Turing machine.\n\nAmong the leading blockchain platforms, Ethereum, Internet Computer (ICP), Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana stand out for their distinct strategies in leveraging Turing completeness and smart contracts. This article explores how each platform addresses the challenges and opportunities in the blockchain space, highlighting their specific capabilities and contributions to the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stands as a cornerstone of the Ethereum network, a decentralized platform enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed specifically for Ethereum, facilitating the computation of state changes after each new block addition. Its Turing completeness allows for executing any computation given sufficient resources, making Ethereum capable of supporting complex smart contracts and DApps. This capability, however, necessitates a gas mechanism to measure and manage the computational effort required for each operation. Gas prevents infinite loops and ensures network stability by requiring users to specify a gas limit for their transactions, halting any that exceed this limit.\n\nSmart contract development on Ethereum primarily uses Solidity, a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level programming language influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. Solidity supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, enabling developers to write smart contracts that implement intricate business logic and generate a chain of transaction records on the blockchain. Compiled into EVM bytecode, Solidity code is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, where the EVM executes it to perform the specified operations.\n\nSecurity is paramount in Ethereum smart contracts, given their immutable nature and the significant value they often control. Common vulnerabilities include reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and improper use of delegatecall. High-profile incidents like the DAO hack and Parity wallet issues highlight the importance of secure coding practices.\n\nDespite its theoretical Turing completeness, the EVM faces practical limitations due to the gas mechanism. Gas limits curtail infinite loops and excessively complex computations, ensuring the network remains functional and efficient. This practical constraint is crucial for maintaining network stability, though it limits the complexity of operations that can be executed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Turing completeness has enabled a wide range of applications, including fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens, DeFi platforms, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These capabilities have fostered a thriving ecosystem of DApps and services. Additionally, EVM compatibility allows developers to port their DApps and tokens to other EVM-compatible chains like Polygon and Avalanche, enhancing interoperability and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s pioneering role in blockchain technology drives innovation and adoption in the decentralized application space. Its Turing completeness, coupled with the flexibility and security measures of the EVM, positions Ethereum as a leading platform for developing and deploying smart contracts and DApps.\n\nThe Internet Computer Protocol Smart Contracts & Canisters\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, introduces a novel approach to decentralized applications (DApps) and services through its unique architecture. At the core of ICP are canister smart contracts, which combine code and state, allowing for sophisticated computation and data storage. These canisters are Turing complete, enabling the execution of any computation given sufficient resources. This capability supports the development of complex DApps entirely on-chain, offering a scalable and efficient platform.\n\nOne of ICP\u2019s standout features is its reverse gas model. Unlike traditional blockchains, where users pay transaction fees, ICP developers pre-pay for computational resources by converting ICP tokens into cycles. These cycles, which are stable and pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), cover the costs of computation, storage, and bandwidth. This model eliminates the need for end users to hold tokens or pay gas fees, simplifying the user experience and enabling developers to implement their own tokenomics and monetization strategies.\n\nICP\u2019s interoperability extends to other blockchains, notably through its direct interaction with the Bitcoin network. Features like Threshold ECDSA and the Bitcoin adapter enable canisters to securely hold, receive, and send BTC. Furthermore, ICP has introduced an API that allows its smart contracts to communicate with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity and integration with other blockchain ecosystems.\n\nSecurity and scalability are paramount for ICP. Chain-key cryptography ensures the security and integrity of smart contracts through secure key management and digital signatures. ICP\u2019s architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding new subnets, allowing for the deployment of an unlimited number of canisters and storing vast amounts of data. This scalability is essential for large-scale applications, ensuring the platform can grow to meet increasing demands.\n\nPractical considerations for developers include managing the cycle balance of their canisters to ensure continuous operation. Tools like CycleOps automate this process, making it easier to maintain and top up canisters as needed. The stable cost of cycles also makes ICP an attractive platform for building cost-effective and scalable DApps, providing predictable and manageable expenses for developers.\n\nICP supports various applications, from simple, smart contracts to complex multi-canister projects. Decentralized social media platforms like DSCVR, decentralized email services like Dmail, and various DeFi applications exemplify the diversity of use cases on ICP. The platform\u2019s aim to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services emphasizes its potential to revolutionize how applications are built and operated, offering security, scalability, and user-friendly experiences.\n\nThe Internet Computer\u2019s approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, a reverse gas model, and robust interoperability features, positions it as a powerful platform for the next generation of decentralized applications and services. Its emphasis on security, scalability, and cost efficiency further enhances its appeal, making it a significant player in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nPolkadot Smart Contracts on Parachains\n\nPolkadot is designed to enable interoperability among various blockchains through its unique architecture. The network\u2019s core comprises the relay chain and parachains, each playing a distinct role in maintaining the system\u2019s functionality and scalability. The relay chain serves as the central hub, providing shared security, consensus, and interoperability, while the parachains are independent blockchains tailored for specific use cases, supporting a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nAs a layer 0 protocol, the relay chain does not natively support smart contracts but facilitates the coordination and security of connected parachains. These parachains can communicate with each other and external blockchains via bridges, enabling seamless asset and data transfers across different networks. This interoperability is a key feature of Polkadot, fostering a cohesive ecosystem where various blockchains can operate together.\n\nPolkadot supports smart contracts through several environments, notably ink! and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Ink! is a Rust-based language explicitly designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing developers to write efficient and secure WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts. Polkadot also supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via the EVM pallet, enabling developers to port their existing Ethereum DApps to Polkadot with minimal modifications.\n\nParachains like Moonbeam and Astar Network exemplify Polkadot\u2019s versatile smart contract capabilities. Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible parachain that supports Solidity smart contracts, allowing developers to utilize familiar Ethereum tools and libraries. Astar Network supports EVM and Wasm smart contracts, offering true interoperability with cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and cross-virtual machine (XVM) capabilities. Phala Network, another notable parachain, provides Turing-complete smart contracts with enhanced privacy and security through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Phat Contracts for off-chain computation.\n\nThe Substrate framework underpins Polkadot\u2019s development, providing a modular toolkit for building blockchains and parachains. Substrate supports multiple programming languages, including Rust, Go, and C++, offering developers flexibility. Polkadot\u2019s testnets, such as Kusama and Rococo, provide real-world environments for testing and optimizing smart contracts before deployment on the mainnet.\n\nSecurity in Polkadot is bolstered by its shared security model, where the relay chain ensures the collective security of all connected parachains. This shared security mechanism is critical for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the network. Comprehensive security audits, both manual and automated, are integral to Polkadot\u2019s approach, with tools and services from firms like ImmuneBytes and Hacken helping to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s use cases span various sectors, with DeFi being a prominent area. Projects like Acala Network offer DeFi products, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), staking, and stablecoins, leveraging EVM and Substrate-based smart contracts. Phala Network\u2019s privacy-preserving smart contracts enable secure DeFi applications, such as confidential trading and data management.\n\nCross-chain interoperability is a hallmark of Polkadot, supported by various bridge solutions that connect with external blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. These bridges facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, expanding the reach and utility of the Polkadot ecosystem. Additionally, Polkadot supports gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) applications through parachains like Astar Network, providing a versatile platform for innovative gaming experiences and digital asset management.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s architecture, combining the relay chain and parachains, creates a robust and scalable environment for developing Turing-complete smart contracts. Its support for multiple smart contract languages and environments and a strong emphasis on interoperability and security position Polkadot as a leading platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nCardano Smart Contracts\n\nCardano, a blockchain platform known for its research-driven approach, offers a unique environment for developing smart contracts. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on a single Turing-complete language, Cardano employs a dual-language approach to balance flexibility and security. This includes Plutus, a Turing-complete language, and Marlowe, a non-Turing-complete domain-specific language (DSL) tailored for financial contracts.\n\nBased on Haskell, Plutus allows developers to write complex and expressive smart contracts. Its features include higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, and immutable data structures, hallmarks of functional programming. Plutus contracts consist of on-chain code that runs on the Cardano blockchain and off-chain code that operates on the user\u2019s machine, helping to manage computational resources efficiently. Using Haskell\u2019s strong type system and formal verification capabilities ensures the correctness and security of smart contracts, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nMarlowe, in contrast, is designed specifically for financial agreements and is non-Turing-complete. This design choice guarantees termination, meaning contracts will always complete their execution, avoiding issues like infinite loops. Marlowe\u2019s simplicity and safety make it accessible to users without programming experience. It supports visual programming and traditional coding through the Marlowe Playground, a sandbox environment for developing, simulating, and testing contracts.\n\nSecurity is a critical focus for Cardano, with formal verification and thorough code audits emphasized to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment. The Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) model used by Cardano ensures that transactions are deterministic and predictable, enhancing security by simplifying transaction validation and reducing the risk of unexpected outcomes. Additionally, Cardano treats tokens as native assets, simplifying token transactions and minimizing the risk of smart contract exploits.\n\nDeveloping smart contracts on Cardano requires familiarity with Haskell for Plutus and an understanding of Marlowe for financial contracts. Educational resources like the IOG Academy provide learning paths for developers and financial professionals. Tools like the Marlowe Playground and the Plutus development environment aid in simulating and testing contracts before deployment, ensuring they function as intended.\n\nCardano\u2019s approach to scalability includes Hydra and Mithril, solutions designed to enhance throughput and reduce overhead. These technologies make the platform suitable for large-scale applications. Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, is energy-efficient and scalable, addressing the limitations of older blockchain networks.\n\nBy combining Turing-complete and non-Turing-complete languages, Cardano aims to offer a robust and secure environment for developing decentralized applications. Its emphasis on formal verification, security, and scalability positions it as a strong competitor in blockchain, capable of supporting a wide range of innovative and secure applications.\n\nSolana Smart Contracts\n\nSolana is engineered to support decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with a focus on speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) plays a central role in achieving these goals by providing the execution environment for Solana\u2019s smart contracts. Designed to handle high transaction throughput and low latency, the SVM ensures efficient processing, leveraging Turing completeness to enable any computation given sufficient resources.\n\nThe SVM\u2019s Turing completeness allows developers to create complex and versatile smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. Solana\u2019s unique architecture, including the Sealevel parallel execution engine, significantly enhances the network\u2019s throughput and efficiency by processing multiple transactions simultaneously. This parallel execution capability is crucial for maintaining the high performance that distinguishes Solana from other blockchain platforms.\n\nSmart contract development on Solana primarily uses Rust and C, chosen for their performance and safety features, which are critical for developing secure and efficient contracts. The Anchor framework further simplifies this process by providing tools and libraries that streamline development and ensure best practices. To set up the development environment, developers install the Solana Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Rust, essential for deploying and managing smart contracts on the network.\n\nSolana\u2019s Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism is a key innovation that timestamps transactions to create a verifiable order of events. This reduces the time required to reach consensus and enhances network speed and efficiency. Combined with other architectural innovations, PoH allows Solana to process over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain platforms.\n\nUnlike traditional EVM-based blockchains, Solana\u2019s smart contracts are stateless, meaning the contract logic is separated from the state, which is stored in external accounts. This separation enhances security and scalability by isolating the contract code from the data it interacts with. Solana\u2019s account model allows for program reusability, enabling developers to create new tokens or applications by interacting with existing programs, reducing the need to redeploy smart contracts, and lowering costs.\n\nSecurity remains a priority in Solana\u2019s ecosystem. Common vulnerabilities include account management errors, arithmetic errors, and potential reentrancy attacks. Comprehensive security audits, combining manual code reviews and automated testing tools, are employed to identify and mitigate these risks. The Solana community actively audits and secures smart contracts, fostering a collaborative environment focused on enhancing security.\n\nGaming applications on Solana benefit from its speed and scalability, allowing for fast and reliable transaction processing essential for immersive and interactive experiences. Additionally, Solana supports various Web3 projects, enabling decentralized social networks, content platforms, and other applications that leverage blockchain technology for enhanced security and user control.\n\nSolana\u2019s unique approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, stateless architecture, and innovative consensus mechanisms, positions it as a leading platform for decentralized applications. Its focus on speed, scalability, and low costs makes it an attractive choice for developers and users, driving its adoption and fostering a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nSmart Contract Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the diversity in approaches to Turing completeness and smart contract execution across platforms like Ethereum, ICP, Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana showcases the innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEach platform offers unique strengths\u2014whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s extensive DApp ecosystem, ICP\u2019s user-friendly model, Polkadot\u2019s interoperability, Cardano\u2019s focus on security, or Solana\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability. These differences provide developers with a rich selection of tools and environments to build the next generation of decentralized applications, driving the evolution and adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u2018best\u2019 blockchain for smart contracts \u2013 each has its benefits, and ultimately, network effects and adoption are what will showcase the strengths of each chain. A multichain future is now all but certain, with many blockchains serving different parts of the global economy.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is clearly amping up for a potential surge toward a new yearly high as the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency approaches $4,000. Previously, some analysts stated that ETH is going to reach $4,500 before ETF trading goes live.\n\nEthereum has also continued to rise above the $3,800 level, now trading at around $3,906. This bullish run is rather supported by a considerably high amount of volume, indicating good buying interest. Currently, the level has found strong support from the 50-Day EMA, lying around $3,225, and from the 100-Day EMA around $3,170, supporting ETH.\n\nAt the moment, the Ethereum RSI is at 72, indicating that ETH is overbought. Maybe it signals a pullback, but the general sentiment of the market remains in place. Recent price action noted a clear breakout from consolidation, with more targets on higher resistance levels for ETH.\n\nBut it has to hold momentum to continue the journey toward $4,500 and penetrate above the psychological $4,000 price level. If at all broken, the next crucial resistance we are looking at in the range of $4,200 could give power to the doors for ETH toward $4,500. The current levels to watch are $3,800 and $3,500 on the downside, which should hold to maintain the bullish bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin's path to $70,000\n\nBitcoin has failed to hold itself above or even close to the crucial price level of $70,000 and is currently consolidating around $69,000. Unfortunately, this is a signal of decreasing power and might hint at some bearishness ahead.\n\nThis implies that the digital asset is failing to sustain levels above $70,000, a level that signals the continuation of massive buying pressure. From looking at recent price action, Bitcoin has once again failed to sustain above the $70,000 level, where most significant resistance lies.\n\nThe consolidation can be visibly seen on the daily chart, where Bitcoin is exchanging levels just under $69,000. Besides that, the struggle to maintain gains above the psychological level continues to pick up momentum while consolidating at that level, with the 50-day moving average.\n\nFailure to breach the resistance at $70,000, along with consolidating price action, may also signal potential bearish trends. If Bitcoin loses the battle to hold above levels beyond the immediate support at $68,000, it might test the lower support levels around $65,000 and $62,000, as depicted by the moving averages. The selling pressure surge under these moving averages is likely to push for larger losses toward the $60,000 level.\n\nSolana hits support\n\nSolana is approaching a strong support level in the form of the 26 EMA. It is not the first time the price of SOL is going to test this resistance level as, in the past, SOL has hit it around $160 and successfully emerged upwards.\n\nSolana is testing such a strong support level in the form of the 26 EMA. It would not be the first time the price of SOL has touched this resistance level. This has been the case in the past, whereby SOL touched around $160 in price and sprang upward successfully. Solana is currently trading around $164, which is close to a major support zone expanded by the 26-day EMA.\n\nThis has acted strongly in the past, notably around the $160 zone, from which SOL managed to find strength and rise. One of the very important technical indicators monitored very closely by traders, therefore, is the 26 EMA, as it usually provides a cushion during a bullish run and resistance when in a downtrend.\n\nSolana has been quite volatile pricewise but has remained upwards over the last few trading weeks. Further, the price has retracted at the levels around $190, testing the 26 EMA support. Not far away, the 50-day EMA is located at $153, and in the case of a failure of the 26 EMA, that is the next line of defense."

        "content": "Ahead of the imminent launch of spot Ether ETFs within the next two months, Ethereum bulls are reasserting their dominance. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum (ETH) price has surged by 5%, reaching $3,957, accompanied by a market cap of $469 billion. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volumes have witnessed a remarkable increase, soaring by 68% to nearly $17 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Eyes Breakout Above $4,000\n\nRekt Capital, a prominent crypto analyst, stated that Ethereum (ETH) requires a weekly close above $3956 to move into the $4000+ range. Currently, ETH is forming a lower high, but it has spent significant time around the $2791 level, historically a precursor to an upside movement back to approximately $4000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the orange box level is inevitable and will confirm that the bulls have regained momentum. The analyst\u2019s observations highlight the critical thresholds ETH must surpass to continue its bullish trajectory.\n\nSoon after the news of the spot Ether ETF last week, the ETH price consolidated for a while before resuming the recent uptrend. On the weekly chart, Ethereum poses a healthy 27% gain suggesting a solid uptrend going ahead.\n\nETH Price to Reach $4,500 Before ETF Goes Live\n\nArthur, the founder of DeFiance Capital, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $4,500 before the commencement of spot ETH ETF trading. Supporting this optimistic outlook, a survey by WuBlockchain within the Chinese community reveals that 58% of respondents believe ETH can surge to $10,000 or more in the current market cycle.\n\n4.5k before spot ETF go live for trading imo. \u2014 Arthur (@Arthur_0x) May 26, 2024\n\nCrypto investors widely anticipate significant institutional demand for Ethereum (ETH) in the coming weeks.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paves the way for broader institutional adoption and increased exposure of digital assets to traditional investors. Since the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, eyes have been on Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Now that Ethereum ETFs have received the green light, the market is buzzing, anticipating a new wave of massive investments. This new investment opportunity could transform market dynamics and provide significant benefits not only to Ethereum but also to several other cryptos closely linked to its ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the three cryptos best positioned to benefit from this approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has already seen a dramatic rise since the beginning of the year and even in recent days. Currently, the price of ETH is around USD 3,801.94, with a market capitalization of nearly 456 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding 10 billion dollars. Despite this impressive growth, the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC opens the door to an even more significant increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nThe approval of ETFs means that institutional investors, who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market due to its complexity and perceived risks, can now invest in Ethereum through traditional and regulated financial channels. This will significantly increase the potential demand for ETH. The legitimacy brought by SEC approval will enhance investor confidence in Ethereum, thereby stimulating interest and purchase of ETH.\n\nThe influx of new capital into Ethereum through ETFs will also improve market liquidity. Better liquidity means that transactions can be executed more quickly and with less volatility, which is attractive to large investors. This increase in liquidity can stabilize Ethereum\u2019s price in the short term while creating a solid foundation for continued growth.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Currently, the price of the Polygon crypto is around USD 0.7225 with a market capitalization of 7.15 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 175 million dollars. Polygon has already demonstrated notable growth as a scaling platform, attracting the attention of blockchain developers and users.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC has the potential to catalyze a new wave of adoption and use of Ethereum. As demand for Ethereum increases, scaling solutions become crucial to manage the growing volume of transactions on the network. Polygon, as the main layer 2 solution for Ethereum, is particularly well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic.\n\nPolygon improves Ethereum\u2019s scalability by enabling faster and cheaper transactions, which is essential to maintaining the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency in the face of growing demand. With the expected influx of capital following ETF approval, Ethereum users will seek ways to reduce transaction costs and improve transaction speed, thereby increasing demand for Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Polygon benefits from its compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing developers to easily deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects on its platform. This compatibility already attracts a multitude of projects, and the increased interest in Ethereum due to ETFs could strengthen this trend, attracting even more developers and users to Polygon.\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap, the leading decentralized trading platform (DEX) on Ethereum, plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by allowing users to trade cryptos directly without going through a centralized exchange. Currently, the price of its crypto UNI is USD 11.40, with a market capitalization of 6.83 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 473 million dollars.\n\nWith the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, Uniswap is in an advantageous position to benefit from the influx of capital and increased interest in Ethereum. ETFs make buying Ethereum more accessible to institutional investors, which should increase demand for ETH. This increase in demand will also lead to an increase in transactions on Ethereum, which directly benefits decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap.\n\nAs the most popular decentralized trading platform, Uniswap is likely to see a significant increase in trading volumes. The higher the trading volumes, the better the liquidity on Uniswap, making trades more efficient and attractive to investors. This could lead to an increase in the value of the UNI crypto, used for governance and liquidity rewards on the platform.\n\nWith the approval of Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum, Polygon, and Uniswap are three cryptos particularly well-positioned to benefit from this influx of capital and increased interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the crypto market is extremely volatile, and prices can fluctuate unpredictably. Nothing is very certain!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\n\n\n\nMicroStrategy's Chair, Michael Saylor, views the SEC's approval of a spot Ethereum ETF as a positive development for Bitcoin. He anticipates this move will draw more institutional investors into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nIn early May, Saylor expressed concerns about the SEC potentially taking action against significant alternative crypto assets (altcoins). This raised worries within the crypto community that the SEC might classify Ethereum ETF and other altcoins as securities, leading to stricter regulations and potential limitations on trading these assets.\n\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the SEC's approval of all spot Ethereum ETFs differed from earlier expectations. Michael Saylor has adjusted his previous stance and now welcomes the SEC's decision.\n\n\n\nFollowing the SEC's approval of several spot Ethereum ETFs in late May, Saylor expressed his belief that this development could be even more beneficial for Bitcoin. He suggested that the broader recognition of crypto as an asset class, facilitated by the ETFs, would strengthen Bitcoin's position within the industry due to its established presence. He further indicated that these ETFs might act as a stabilising factor for Bitcoin in the regulatory landscape.\n\n\n\nSaylor further emphasised that the SEC's decision could accelerate institutional investors' adoption of crypto assets. This could lead to a potential allocation of 5-10% of their investment portfolios towards cryptocurrencies. Within this allocation, he projects Bitcoin to capture a significant share, potentially around 60-70 percent, due to its established position in the market. He explained this by suggesting that previously hesitant investors might now view crypto as a legitimate asset class due to the existence of ETFs. Saylor anticipated that these investors would likely diversify their crypto assets holdings. Still, Bitcoin, as the established leader in the space, would likely receive the largest share of their crypto assets allocations.\n\n\n\nSaylor elaborated that just two weeks prior to the SEC's decision, the expectation was that Bitcoin would be the sole cryptocurrency offered as a security through a spot ETF by Wall Street institutions, effectively solidifying its position as the only legitimate crypto asset class.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen a significant price surge over the past week, rising more than 27% and breaking out of a falling wedge chart pattern. This breakout suggests a potential reversal from the previous downtrend and hints at the possibility of Ether reaching new all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThe falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern when the price makes lower highs and lower lows within a converging downtrend. The breakout from this pattern indicates that selling pressure is waning, and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, Ether has flipped key resistance areas into support, providing a solid base for further gains.\n\n\n\nThe recent price surge in Ethereum has also been accompanied by a decline in Bitcoin's dominance, suggesting that traders' attention is shifting towards Ether. Bitcoin's dominance, which measures Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall cryptocurrency market, has fallen over 0.98% in the past five days, while Ethereum's dominance has risen 4.4%. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum's dominance has increased by 1.45%, while Bitcoin's dominance has decreased by 0.57%.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Ethereum's potential to continue its upward trajectory, with some predicting that the cryptocurrency could reach as high as $4,500 before the launch of the first spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\n\n\nArthur Cheong, the founder and CEO of crypto-focused investment firm DeFiance Capital, believes that Ether could rally to the $4,500 mark before the first spot Ether ETFs start trading. In a May 26 post, Cheong tweeted on X that \u201c4.5k before spot ETF go live for trading imo\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum's price outlook is primarily driven by the recent developments around the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. On May 20, Ether's price rose nearly 20% within a day, following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has U-turned on spot Ether ETFs, possibly due to political pressure.\n\n\n\nAs of May 28, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $3,800, with a market capitalisation of USD 463.51 billion.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Laetitia B.\n\nEach bull run in the past has gone through different phases stimulated by a capital rotation. In general, bitcoin is often the leader of the bull run and the favorite in the early phases. Following Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to bitcoin, we will look at the factors favorable to a capital rotation towards Ethereum.\n\nThe Principle of Asset Rotation\n\nIn traditional finance, there are several types of asset rotations. This can involve a sectoral rotation (technology, industrial, financial, health\u2026) or a rotation of asset types (bonds, stocks, commodities, forex\u2026). Capitals move according to the context and the economy. The rotation can come from profit-taking after a significant performance to move into another sector or a less valued type of asset while following the economic context. This is often the case between cyclical and defensive sectors, for example.\n\nLet\u2019s also take an example over a very long-term horizon, that is to say over several decades, we can see this cyclical rotation between commodities and the S&P500 index in the graph below:\n\nThis type of graph highlights that in the coming years, performances in commodities should be more advantageous than in the S&P500.\n\nThe Different Phases in Crypto\n\nWhen we look at the cryptocurrency market, there are several phases in terms of rotation, whether it is between bitcoin, Ethereum, large caps, and altcoins. And generally, this comes from a progressive rotation.\n\nPhase 1: Bitcoin is the leader, the store of value in the crypto market. It is the oldest and most democratized in the cryptocurrency sphere. It is on bitcoin that the first capital inflows arrive at the beginning of a bull market. Since 2024, bitcoin has been available in spot ETF form, which is an advantage to stimulate demand. And in parallel, when the demand is stimulated, it increases the capital inflows. During phase 1, bitcoin tends to outperform Ethereum. And it is only when Ethereum starts to approach bitcoin\u2019s performance that phase 2 is near. We can possibly see this rotation with the example below which highlights the ETC/BTC ratio:\n\nPhase 2: Ethereum, which is the number 2 cryptocurrency in the crypto sphere, outperforms bitcoin. This can be seen in the graph below with the 2021 bull run.\n\nPhase 3: It is the turn of large capitalizations (Doge, LTC, XRP\u2026) to outperform bitcoin.\n\nPhase 4: The altcoin season begins when there is a large capital rotation. That is to say, the money invested in bitcoin at the beginning of the bull run moves to other cryptocurrencies, small and mid-capitalizations, or even memes. During the altcoin season, we see a reduction in bitcoin dominance. Here is a graph that highlights this:\n\nTo better illustrate this in general terms, here is the chronology below:\n\nThe Economic Environment and Different Phases in Cryptocurrency Markets\n\nThe evolution of cryptocurrency is quite cyclical, just like the economy. That is to say, we find cycles of growth and cycles of decline. Like any riskier asset class, it evolves according to a favorable and accommodating context. A favorable context can be defined in several ways. For example, when growth rebounds, we have an acceleration of growth, which is a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. Consumer sentiment is positive and this encourages capital inflows. Conversely, when we face an economic slowdown, it is often represented by a bear market in cryptocurrencies. Each cycle often averages one and a half to two years, just like economic cycles. Therefore, if we add up a bull market and a bear market, it represents 4 years, just like the halving process:\n\nAnother positive element for performance is also liquidity. When liquidity is abundant, cryptocurrencies thrive. For example, injections of liquidity during COVID led to more capital circulating in the markets. Financial conditions were highly relaxed. Therefore, more money in circulation to buy the same good implies a price increase.\n\nRegarding liquidity in the current situation, we can see the graph below highlighting the evolution of liquidity and bitcoin:\n\nRemaining in the same context, that is, liquidity, we can also see favorable seasons (summer and fall being the best):\n\nThe Delay of Ethereum Explained by Several Factors\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum is often delayed compared to bitcoin during the first months of a bull run. This is mainly because capital first flows into bitcoin, the store of value. As for Ethereum, it is no longer the only one well-positioned as it is closely followed by Solana. This also implies competition. That said, like bitcoin, Ethereum should benefit from more incoming flows since the approval of ETFs is official. Such products imply more potential to attract new investors, whether for tax reasons (introduction of the product into tax-advantaged accounts) or simply because an ETF is an easily accessible product (no need to open multiple brokerage accounts) and is inexpensive. This is why approval would be a good catalyst for catching up with bitcoin. Therefore, there are several arguments that align for Ethereum\u2019s outperformance, such as a favorable context, new available products, and the phase timeline (as indicated above).\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum, Which to Choose?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have different strengths that can help diversify a crypto portfolio. One of bitcoin\u2019s peculiarities is that it has a limited supply of 21 million, and its production is halved every 4 years. This can be seen as a safe haven, especially in countries suffering from hyperinflation. Ethereum also has certain peculiarities, such as the fact that it can be used to host other cryptos and decentralized applications.\n\nThe more adoption and democratization continue with the same dynamic, the more we will face new products as approvals will be increasingly easier. For example, we could have an ETF that brings together bitcoin and Ethereum to simplify the choice. This opens many possibilities in terms of capital.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can conclude that the capital rotation system is cyclical and that Ethereum has several reasons to take the lead and outperform bitcoin for the rest of the cycle. One of the major catalysts for this would be, like bitcoin, ETF approval. This will improve liquidity in the coming months.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "After approving spot ETFs for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, in January, and watching them rake in almost US$60 billion in assets, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the CBOE, Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges to trade in ETFs tracking Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s only real competitor\n\nNine issuers are looking to bring Ethereum ETFs to market, including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency, ETH, has gained 115.19 per cent year-over-year, and 1,552.35 per cent since 2019, last trading at C$5,363.76 per token\n\nAfter approving spot ETFs for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, in January, and watching them rake in almost US$60 billion in assets, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the CBOE, Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges to trade in ETFs tracking Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s only real competitor.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain network that enables parties to do business with one another through smart contracts, which are agreements that execute based on agreed-upon criteria without the need for a middleman. The network is host to some of the largest and most well-known projects in the cryptocurrency space, including UniSwap, Curve, Chainlink and Decentraland. Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ETH, has gained 115.19 per cent year-over-year and 1,552.35 per cent since 2019, last trading at C$5,363.76 per token, granting it a market capitalization of about C$650 billion, almost three times less than Bitcoin\u2019s C$1.9 trillion.\n\nWhile financial institutions still need to have individual fund registrations approved before trading in Ethereum ETFs can begin \u2013 nine applications are under consideration including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock \u2013 the SEC\u2019s open-mindedness towards crypto in 2024 is in stark contrast to its historical skepticism towards the speculative asset class, opening an increasing number of investors up to the idea of holding an allocation. Canadians, for their part, have had access to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs since 2021, and benefit from products from reputable providers to gain exposure.\n\nWith eyes on catching short-term gains tied to individual fund approvals by the SEC, as well as aligning yourself with crypto\u2019s potential for outsized long-term returns, let\u2019s break down how Canada\u2019s Ethereum ETFs stack up against one another.\n\nThe 3iQ Ether Staking ETF\n\nTicker: ETHQ.\n\nNet asset value: C$72.6 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 1.56%.\n\nDifferentiator: Unitholders can earn yield through Ethereum staking, which involves locking up investments in ETH to help to run the network. The fund was also first to market with staking capabilities.\n\nCI Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nTicker: ETHX.B.\n\nAssets under management: C$654.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.4%.\n\nDifferentiator: Galaxy is one of the pre-eminent crypto players across capital markets, asset management and infrastructure solutions.\n\nEvolve Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHR.\n\nAssets under management: C$91.8 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.75%.\n\nDifferentiator: The fund is the first in the world to offer exposure to the Ethereum network in the form of an ETF.\n\nFidelity Advantage Ether ETF Fund\n\nTicker: FETH.\n\nAssets under management: C$19.2 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.95%.\n\nDifferentiator: Besides being one of the world\u2019s most well-respected financial institutions with more than 75 years of history and more than 50 million individual clients, Fidelity is also a crypto pioneer, having entered the industry all the way back in 2014.\n\nPurpose Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHH.\n\nAssets under management: C$478.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: Up to 1.5%.\n\nDifferentiator: Investors who open a position in ETHH have the option to complement this exposure with the Purpose Ether Yield ETF (TSX:ETHY), which writes covered calls and currently pays out an annual yield of more than 9 per cent. Unlike ETHQ, whose yield is reflected in unit price appreciation, ETHY pays its distributions in cash.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a novice or an enthusiast, cryptocurrencies remain a new and volatile asset class with a little more than 15 years of market history, hardly enough for investors to expect reliable capital appreciation, despite the multitude of crypto millionaires who attract many retail participants into the space. This is why it\u2019s essential to have a plan for any dollars you intend to allocate, ensuring that you minimize avoidable regret through awareness of the range of possible outcomes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out whether crypto suits your investment needs, check out last year\u2019s \u201cHow to invest in cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nJoin the discussion: Find out what everybody\u2019s saying about Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies on Stockhouse\u2019s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Bullboard, and check out the rest of Stockhouse\u2019s stock forums and message boards.\n\nThe material provided in this article is for information only and should not be treated as investment advice.

        "content": "ONDO Finance hits a new all-time high of $1.33, driven by Ethereum ETF hype.\n\nWith recent stability around $1.27, ONDO aims for $2 if it breaks the $1.32 resistance.\n\nThere is an unfamiliar entrant into the crypto market rally.\n\nTaking the markets and community by surprise, Pantera Capital\u2019s Ondo Finance [ONDO] has broken an all-time high of $1.33 as the Ethereum [ETH] ETF hype rages on, making it one of the best-performing cryptos.\n\nONDO: These are some key levels\n\nThe ONDO/USDT pair has shown some interesting movements over the last five days.\n\nStarting from a base of around $1.17, the token experienced a sharp increase in trading activity, pushing its price to a peak of $1.33 around three hours ago.\n\nThis upward movement was followed by typical volatility, with prices retracting slightly and then attempting to stabilize near the $1.30 mark before a subsequent pullback to the $1.27 level.\n\nONDO\u2019s trading volume has remained relatively steady, with a notable rise coinciding with the price surge, meaning there has been an increase in buyer interest during that period.\n\nAs the price hovers around $1.27 at press time, the market appears to be consolidating after the recent spike. Traders might be assessing the sustainability of the recent gains before committing to further positions.\n\nThe $1.27 level could also serve as a new support if ONDO maintains its foothold, or it might see further dips if the selling pressure increases.\n\nIf ONDO rebounds from its current level and breaks through the resistance at $1.32, it could set the stage for an upward trend towards $1.5 and even $2.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ONDO\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nThe potential for ONDO to achieve a $2 valuation is quite strong, but it\u2019s important to recognize that various factors beyond technical analysis influence crypto prices.\n\nThough we are right at the edge of what might be the greatest crypto bull run ever, the market remains incredibly volatile. Proceed with caution. Always DYOR!"
