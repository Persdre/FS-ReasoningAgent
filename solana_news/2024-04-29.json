        "title": "SEC considered Ethereum unregistered security for at least a year: FOX Business - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum's legal status is questioned amid SEC's intensifying scrutiny.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been operating under the belief that Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto, is an unregistered security. This perspective has been held for at least a year, FOX Business reported on Monday, citing recent court filings.\n\nThe filings emerged from a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys last week, which is challenging the SEC\u2019s attempt to classify Ethereum as a security. Consensys\u2019 legal action follows a Wells Notice from the SEC, which signaled the agency\u2019s intention to sue the firm for not complying with federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to FOX Business, the documents reveal that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, under the direction of Gurbir Grewal, initiated a formal investigation into Ethereum\u2019s status as a security in March 2023. This investigation, referred to as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation, aims to explore transactions and activities related to Ethereum dating back to at least 2018.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told FOX Business that the SEC sent multiple document requests and subpoenas to firms associated with Ethereum, including Consensys. MetaMask\u2019s parent company reportedly received four subpoenas from the SEC and a Wells Notice.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s current position appears to contradict previous guidance from 2018 when then-Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC Bill Hinman stated that Ethereum was not considered a security due to its decentralized nature. Comparatively, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission later classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nConsensys\u2019 legal action against the SEC aims for the court to resolve the dispute over Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, a case that could have wide-reaching implications for the crypto industry, akin to previous cases against major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are on the verge of a major market correction.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 800,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) may be making one final move to the upside before a market capitulation.\n\n\u201cIn order for confirmation of [bullishness], you would need to see ETH/Bitcoin get above its bull market support band and then start holding it as support. And if you don\u2019t see that, then I still think it\u2019s just going to be yet another lower high that everyone once again got excited about that ultimately resolved to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also says ETH and alts may be repeating a similar pattern from the last cycle when the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all altcoins minus Ethereum and stablecoins, suffered a severe correction against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, the ETH/Bitcoin capitulation occurred, it finalized after alt/Bitcoin pairs broke down.\n\nSo one thing about this bounce is that alt/Bitcoin pairs have not yet broken down. They haven\u2019t had a weekly close below their range low. So I think that you\u2019re seeing something very similar with alt/Bitcoin pairs that you saw over here [in June 2019], one final rally up to the bull market support band \u2013 it didn\u2019t even make it to the bull market support band back then \u2013 and then it came down. I think you\u2019re seeing something like that happen once again with alt/Bitcoin pairs, one final push before capitulation down to the range lows this summer\u2026\n\nI think this is the final push before the final capitulation into the summer, as we get into potential rate cuts.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Toobit\n\nNew York, NY, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the looming question on investors' minds is whether Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, can withstand the challenges presented by their upcoming halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rewards miners receive for validating transactions, has historically sparked intense speculation and debate within the crypto community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToobit, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, offers insights into the potential implications of the halving for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Toobit's analysis, both Bitcoin and Ethereum face unique challenges and opportunities as they approach their respective halving milestones.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin's halving event, which took place on 19 April 2024, represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency,\" states a spokesperson from Toobit. \"The halving has officially raised the stakes for the asset. Not only is it scarce, but BTC price has hit an all-time high. This shows that there is a viable future for cryptocurrency despite all the noise. Every move from now onwards will dictate cryptocurrency history.\"\n\nWith the issuance of new Bitcoin rewards being cut in half, the Bitcoin halving event underscores the asset's scarcity and reinforces its position as a store of value. However, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's mining ecosystem and the potential impact on transaction fees.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with its popular EIP-1559 upgrade, adds another layer of complexity to the halving equation. Despite these changes happening several years ago, the Ethereum halving is not as clean cut as the Bitcoin halving, which may make it confusing for unfamiliar users. Toobit emphasizes the importance of staying updated with these developments, as they are responsible for the shaping of Ethereum's future viability as a leading smart contract platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism promised scalability and sustainability benefits, but it also introduced uncertainties regarding its economic model and network security,\" explains Toobit's spokesperson. \"It's easy to get excited about the new ETH price with each halving event and forget about the bigger picture. Therefore, we must also reflect on Ethereum's ongoing efforts to address scalability challenges and enhance user experience with every halving event.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you believe that this is time to start investing in crypto, Toobit is the place to start. Pick your choice of cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL (SOL price), DOGE (DOGE price), ETC (ETC price), FTM (FTM price), Storj (STORJ price), FIL (FIL price) or the 100 other tokens that Toobit offers.

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Hit $10,000 If The SEC Changes Tune? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January this year broadened the outlook of the crypto market for most investors. Attention quickly shifted to Ethereum with companies swiftly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer spot ETH ETFs. For a short while, Ethereum price surged alongside Bitcoin price. Although the latter achieved a new all-time high of $73,837 according to data by CoinGape and CoinGecko, ETH topped out at $4,091.\n\nEthereum Price Market Update As Volatility Rages\n\nThe post-Bitcoin halving crypto environment remains in a precarious state. An initial climb in crypto prices waned, paving the way for the current correction. Bitcoin price changed at $60,715 on Tuesday during US hours, painting a 3.5% drop in the last 24 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto had been hammered the most, losing a modest 5.6% of its value to $2,984. A 6.6% fall in the market cap to $361 billion reflects the intense sell-off in April while the 8% spike in the 24-hour trading volume hints at the growing interest in Ether among traders.\n\nLosing support at $3,000 exposes Ethereum price to more selling pressure at the outset of May. The position of the smart contract token below two bull market indicators \u2014 the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA (blue and red lines on the chart) could further trigger more declines this week.\n\nA death cross pattern confirmed on April 17 when the 20-day EMA flipped beneath the 50-day EMA is another bearish signal that\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nSimilarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that sellers have more influence at the time of writing. Therefore, it would be imperative to anticipate continued losses to $2,800, and if push comes to shove $2,500.\n\nDespite the correction, the RSI is not oversold, suggesting that there\u2019s room for more downward movement.\n\nNevertheless, the same four-hour chart brings attention to a wedge pattern. If Ethereum price rebounds before breaking below the lower trendline support, chances of a targeted recovery will increase significantly.\n\nA falling wedge is considered a bullish pattern occurring after a substantial surge in the price of an asset followed by a drop, or consolidation. As the trendlines narrow, bulls fight to retake control.\n\nTraders will look for a breakout above the upper trend line, which often points to a breakout target equal to the distance between the widest points of the pattern. A 24% increase in price could drastically change Ethereum\u2019s outlook.\n\nIs Ethereum A Security?\n\nUS Regulators are undecided on Ethereum\u2019s status \u2014 whether a security or a cryptocurrency. With the expectations of a spot ETF gaining momentum, this determination is crucial and likely to set a precedent for many digital assets.\n\nA recent report by Fox Business producer Eleanor Terret revealed that Gary Gensler and the agency he heads, the SEC believed that Ethereum passed as security, but only for some time.\n\nThis revelation comes amid the ongoing Consensys lawsuit against the SEC. In the report, Terret said that Gensler and the SEC \u201cappear to have believed for at least a year\u201d that Ethereum was an \u201cunregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations.\u201d\n\nAn investigation dubbed \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d is being carried out by the SEC intending to unearth details of Ethereum being a security, especially on the sales of Ether from 2018.\n\nFormer executives of the SEC like Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman are on record stating that Ethereum was not a security. Hence, the ongoing investigation could throw this stance in the wind, further opening a can of worms for the SEC.\n\nOn the other hand, if the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation affirms Ether\u2019s status as a cryptocurrency, it could potentially bolster its position in the industry.\n\nAt the very least, it will increase the probability of spot Ethereum ETFs approval \u2014 a move that could blast ETH price above the previous all-time high. A clear path could also be opened for Ethereum to close the gap to $10,000 bolstered by increased adoption among retail and institutional investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum : Will Solana Take Over Ethereum By End of 2024 ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Amid crypto market crash following Bitcoin halving, Solana and Ethereum show different levels of performance. Solana\u2019s annual increase of 480.53% contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s decrease of 66.68%. During the previous week, Solana had a drop of 12.05%, whereas Ethereum had a smaller decrease of 1.06%. This article will analyze their most recent market performance, evaluating their potential paths in the current crypto environment and examining if Solana is positioned to surpass Ethereum.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Current Price Market Performance\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the continuous battle between Solana and Ethereum, the market performance illustrates two powerful entities maneuvering through the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Solana\u2019s native token SOL is currently at $135.08, showing a 4.50% decrease in value in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, taking a broader perspective reveals a more detailed story, with SOL undergoing a 12.05% decrease in the week and a significant 27.45% drop in the month.\n\nEven with some temporary obstacles, the token has seen a remarkable increase of 480.53% in the last year, showing its ability to bounce back and remain popular among investors.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum, along with its famous token ETH, holds a higher value of $3,164.16. However, similar to its opposite, it is dealing with recent changes, showing a 3.84% drop during the day. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s overall trend indicates a more stable path, with only a 1.06% drop in the week and a 10.75% decrease in the month.\n\nSignificantly, ETH has shown a 66.68% decline in value in the last year, highlighting the difficulties encountered in the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nDigging further, Solana\u2019s market capitalization of $6.4 billion places it in the 5th position among cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. On the flip side, Ethereum boasts a market cap of $386.2 billion, establishing itself as the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEven though they have different market capitalizations, both platforms show strong trading activity, with Solana seeing $1.98 billion in 24-hour volume and Ethereum reporting $13.5 billion.\n\nAnalyzing price movements, Solana\u2019s recent changes had it moving between $133.96 and $143.78 in a day, whereas Ethereum traded within the range of $3,152.95 to $3,351.18. Both tokens reflect their highest values in the past, with Solana reaching $260.06 two years ago, showing a decline of 48.24%, and Ethereum peaking at $4,891.70, currently experiencing a decrease of 35.54%.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, operating as an open-source blockchain system with its own digital currency called Ether (ETH). Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum allows for the execution of Decentralized Smart Contracts. The project was funded through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to the official launch of the blockchain in 2015.\n\nEthereum aims to be the global hub for decentralized applications (Dapps), enabling programmers to create and run software without censorship or downtime. The concept of \u201csmart contracts\u201d was pioneered by Ethereum, with co-founder Gavin Wood envisioning it as \u201cone computer for the entire planet.\u201d Recent upgrades like the London Hard Fork and the Dencun Upgrade have brought scaling efficiencies and lower transaction costs to the platform.\n\nWhat Is Solana?\n\nThe Solana project, initiated in 2017 and formally launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation, is an open-source platform leveraging blockchain technology for cost-effective DeFi solutions with a focus on speed. Its protocol supports DApp development through smart contract deployment on its blockchain, aiming to enhance scalability with a mix of PoH and PoS consensus mechanisms.\n\nWith SOL crypto priced at $104.69 on March 2, 2022, and reaching an ATH of $260.06 on November 6, 2021, Solana\u2019s efficient model enables swift payment verification at low costs, providing a USP in the crypto industry. The innovative hybrid consensus ensures accessibility for all traders, aligning with the Foundation\u2019s goal of broadening decentralized finance access.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Key Features\n\nSolana\u2019s unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, combined with Proof-of-Stake validation, allows it to process significantly more transactions per second than Ethereum. The platform provides each node with its clock and decision-making ability. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm protects the system from disruptions, ensuring overall functionality. Solana supports multiple smart contracts running simultaneously, enhancing platform efficiency and versatility within its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum features smart contracts encoded into code for self-execution, enabling the creation of decentralized applications on its blockchain. Its native crypto is used for transactions and rewarding miners. With a Turing-complete virtual machine, Ethereum executes smart contracts for various applications and allows for the formation of DAOs, governed by code and consensus.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Latest News\n\nA potential spot Ethereum ETF could be on the horizon now that spot Bitcoin ETFs are no longer the focus, expected in May. Nevertheless, the schedule for this has not been determined yet, as the SEC has remained silent about the matter.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade was successfully launched on the mainnet on March 13, 2024, following its deployment on all the Ethereum testnets. This is a significant advancement in the Ethereum network and a crucial step towards Ethereum 2.0.\n\nOn the other hand Solana received the Crypto of the Year award for its SOL token from CoinMarketCap, recognizing its growth and resilience. This milestone showcases its success among other notable projects in the industry.\n\nFurthermore, Solana-focused devshop Anza has released an update to fix the intermittent congestion issues and expects a sound recovery in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nConclusion: Will Solana Overtake Ethereum?\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum are significant players in the world of cryptocurrency. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, continues to advance with upgrades like the Dencun Upgrade. Meanwhile, Solana has quickly gained recognition, even winning the Crypto of the Year award. The question remains whether Solana will surpass Ethereum by 2024. Solana\u2019s scalability and capabilities make it a strong competitor, but Ethereum\u2019s established environment and continuous updates suggest it will maintain its dominance. The competition between Solana and Ethereum is expected to continue as new technologies, market factors, and regulations evolve."

        "title": "Analysis of the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum: perspectives in the context of a changing market - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, represented mainly by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is facing new challenges arising from global macroeconomic conditions, here is a price analysis.\n\nThe unexpected increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States in April and the decline in GDP in the first quarter reflect an evolving financial context that could negatively impact the price of major cryptocurrencies.\n\nImpact of Global Liquidity Tightening on the Analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices\n\nRyan Lee, analyst at Bitget, highlights that the global liquidity squeeze could have a significant impact on the performance of BTC and ETH in the month of May.\n\nWith the reduction of the FED\u2019s net liquidity, the market expects an average performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cLooking at the options market, the implied volatility of BTC and ETH has dropped from highs of 78% in April to around 58%, with a more significant reduction for options expiring at the end of May,\u201d\n\nobserve Lee.\n\nThis indicates that options market traders predict a low probability of a significant turnaround in the next month.\n\nWhile interest rates in the USA continue to rise, suppressing demand in the real estate sector and showing a direct influence on existing home sales, the cryptocurrency market is feeling this pressure.\n\nLee predicts a possible correction for BTC and ETH in May, followed by a volatile recovery.\n\nAccording to the analyst, BTC could fluctuate between $56,000 and $68,000, while ETH, influenced by events such as the launch of ETFs on Ethereum, could show greater volatility, fluctuating between $2,600 and $3,600.\n\nOther experts in the field share similar opinions, but with variations in short-term expectations. Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA, comments that \u201cthe strength of the US dollar and the increase in interest rates could continue to put pressure on cryptocurrencies, which traditionally benefit from a high liquidity environment.\u201d\n\nThe Influence of Macroeconomic Conditions on Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe behavior of cryptocurrencies in a climate of rising interest rates and a strong dollar raises significant questions about their role as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets. Traditionally, assets like gold have been preferred by investors during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nHowever, with the evolution of the global financial context, cryptocurrencies have also started to be perceived as possible alternatives. \u201cCryptocurrencies have shown remarkable resilience in times of economic turbulence, which could strengthen their appeal as an alternative investment in times of uncertainty,\u201d notes Jennifer Liu, market analyst at CoinDesk.\n\nThis point of view is supported by a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in various economic sectors, increasing their legitimacy and potential for stability.\n\nLooking to the future, technological innovation in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies continues to play a crucial role.\n\nWith the introduction of new features, such as improving the energy efficiency of mining operations and developing more user-friendly platforms, cryptocurrencies are trying to overcome some of the main critical issues that limit their adoption on a large scale. \u201cThe technological aspect cannot be underestimated,\u201d says Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro.\n\n\u201cInnovations such as Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake are indicators of the potential of these technologies not only as speculative assets, but as long-term sustainable solutions to various global problems.\u201d\n\nWith these ongoing developments, investors are encouraged to stay informed and proactive. Market conditions can change rapidly, and having a deep understanding of both economic dynamics and technological innovations can provide a significant advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, while macroeconomic challenges pose uncertainties, the adaptability and advancement of cryptocurrencies offer a window into a future where they can emerge as pillars of a new financial paradigm."

        "title": "Solana and Ethereum Smart Contract Audits Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Ethereum Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has been the go-to choice for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts for several years. However, its success has also made it a prime target for attackers. Here are some key points to consider regarding Ethereum smart contract security audits:\n\nSolidity Language: Ethereum smart contracts are typically written in Solidity, a specialized programming language. Solidity has a rich set of tools and libraries for developers, but it can be prone to vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflow.\n\nOpenZeppelin: OpenZeppelin, a popular open-source framework, provides standardized contracts and libraries to help developers build secure Ethereum smart contracts. These pre-audited components reduce the risk of coding errors.\n\nAuditing Firms: Ethereum smart contracts are often audited by specialized firms that focus on blockchain security. These audits help identify vulnerabilities and suggest fixes before deployment.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum is home to numerous DAOs, which are organizations governed by smart contracts. DAO security has been a major concern, as vulnerabilities in these contracts can lead to large-scale theft.\n\nEthereum 2.0: The transition to Ethereum 2.0, which includes a shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, is expected to enhance security and scalability.\n\nHow Does an Ethereum Smart Contract Audit Work?\n\nThe finest security companies will subject their code to stress tests to determine how it performs in a variety of situations. According to experts, it is essential for a project to provide a comprehensive and explicit technical specification and, ideally, documentation of the deployment process.\n\nThese audits aim not only to identify vulnerabilities that black hat hackers could exploit but also defects that could prevent an Ethereum smart contract from functioning properly. The attack vectors under investigation can become quite technical, but they include replay attacks, in which malignant actors repeatedly transmit valid data in order to conduct fraudulent activities. Other attacks include reentrancy, reordering, and brief address attacks.\n\nOnce an investigation has been completed, crypto projects receive a detailed report of the vulnerabilities within their code, along with recommendations on how to mitigate their impact or eradicate them altogether. Therefore, the resources conserved by an effective audit can significantly outweigh the cost. Moreover, it can prevent reputational injury.\n\nSolana Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nSolana, a newer entrant in the blockchain space, has gained popularity for its high-speed and low-cost transactions. When it comes to Solana smart contract security audits, here are some key considerations:\n\nRust Programming Language: Solana smart contracts are typically written in Rust, a programming language known for its safety features. Rust\u2019s memory safety and other design choices reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities.\n\nProgram Library: Solana provides a standard library for writing smart contracts, which includes built-in functions to ensure security. This library encourages best practices in contract development.\n\nProgram Analysis Tools: Solana offers various program analysis tools and a developer-friendly environment, making it easier for developers to identify and fix issues.\n\nCommunity Auditing: The Solana community actively participates in auditing smart contracts. While this approach may lack the formality of third-party audits, it fosters a collaborative environment focused on security.\n\nInteroperability: Solana\u2019s interoperability with other blockchains and its support for cross-chain communication introduce new security challenges that need careful consideration.\n\nAre Solana Smart Contract Audits Different?\n\nAudits of smart contracts will vary marginally based on the blockchain code they are based on. Common security flaws in Solana can include omitted ownership checks, allowing attackers to circumvent access controls using spoofed configurations.\n\nAnd while smart contracts can call functions from external smart contracts, validation failures may allow black hat hackers to inject malicious inputs that influence the operation of the code. Top auditing firms will evaluate a Solana smart contract based on the quality of its documentation, security, architecture, and code. Additionally, vulnerabilities are designated severity levels, allowing business-critical issues to be addressed first.\n\nHow Do Smart Contract Audits Benefit Crypto Projects?\n\nAudits are essential for ironing out any bugs in a crypto project and ensuring that the code is suitable for widespread use. In 78 incidents during the first quarter of 2022 alone, hackers stole $1.33 billion; two-thirds of these attacks were on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. But how could a smart contract audit have assisted them?\n\nWell, common causes include crypto initiatives that prioritize speed over a comprehensive audit from a reputable service provider. They may also rely on internal teams to conduct security reviews. While this appears fiscally prudent, there is a risk that internal personnel are not up to date on the most recent cyber techniques used by malicious actors. Unavoidably, some will also believe that they are invincible. But complacency is the greatest enemy in the crypto space, and even the best initiatives can be hacked.\n\nHow Much Do Smart Contract Audits Cost?\n\nThe cost depends on how complex the smart contract is. According to Hacken, this can increase to $500,000 for larger initiatives with more lines of code, not to mention the additional engineering hours required. The company contends that these expenses pale in contrast to the economic harm that a smart contract vulnerability can cause.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how smart contract audits can make a difference: an audit uncovered at least one critical bug in 80% of initiatives. However, according to Hacken, only 75% of organizations have completely acted on an audit report in the past, with the remainder ignoring the conclusions or considering only a small number of recommendations. As a consequence, their security score was lower.\n\nHow Long Do Smart Contract Audits Take?\n\nIt is a process that requires several weeks, depending on the speed at which a crypto project operates. Initial audits typically take between 2 and 14 days, depending on the complexity and scale of a smart contract. These investigations can be expedited if necessary. Again, larger protocols may take longer, up to 30 days in some instances.\n\nDo Smart Contract Audits Improve Crypto\u2019s Image?\n\nBlockchain technology is becoming a bigger part of all our lives \u2014 and auditors ensure that crypto initiatives put their best foot forward. Improving the quality of smart contracts reduces negative press coverage of significant hacks and enhances the reputation of crypto projects in the eyes of the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum offer unique approaches to smart contract security. Ethereum, with its longer history, has established formalized auditing processes and a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s emphasis on safety through the Rust programming language and community engagement is a promising step towards ensuring secure smart contracts.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, security remains a top priority. Developers and organizations must carefully consider the trade-offs and security features of each platform when choosing where to deploy their smart contracts. As both Solana and Ethereum continue to evolve, the blockchain community can look forward to even more robust security measures and best practices for smart contracts.\n\nIn conclusion, the security of smart contracts is an ongoing concern, and it\u2019s essential for blockchain developers and organizations to stay vigilant, adopt best practices, and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain security to protect valuable assets and ensure the trust of users and investors."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and $59,005 as it establishes $65,600 as weekly resistance.\n\nEthereum price could confirm a falling wedge pattern with a 25% run above $3,406 at breakout point.\n\nRipple price defends $0.5000 but overhanging bearish activity will keep XRP holders\u2019 vision for $0.6000 a hopium pipe dream.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has recorded lower highs over the past seven days, with a similar outlook witnessed among altcoins. Meanwhile, while altcoins display a rather disturbing outlook amid a broader market bleed, there could be some relief soon as fundamentals show:\n\nA massive cool off in euphoria and sentiment\n\nA cool-off phase allows the market to correct itself, stabilize, and establish a more sustainable growth trajectory.\n\nA healthy outlook in funding rates\n\nHealthy funding rates indicate a well-functioning and balanced market ecosystem, promoting stability, reducing the risk of manipulation, and fostering confidence among market participants.\n\nOverleveraged short positions are waiting to get liquidated\n\nWhile the initial liquidation of overleveraged short positions may lead to short-term volatility, the eventual impact can often be positive for the price of an asset.\n\nRead More: Week Ahead: Bitcoin could surprise investors this week\n\nBitcoin price forms a $5,000 range\n\nAfter successive weekly closes below $65,600, and with the bulls defending against a dip below $60,000, Bitcoin price has established a $5,000 macro market range. The odds hint at a further decline given the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is subdued below the mean level of 50 and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator continues to post red histograms in negative territory.\n\nIf seller momentum increases and Bitcoin price dips into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and the intra-day low of March 5 at $59,005, the downtrend could continue with bulls waiting to buy BTC just above the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if history repeats, Bitcoin price could move in the opposite direction as the DXY Compare indicator. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, however, the bulls must haul BTC above $72,000 because plenty of bearish activity awaits BTC price near the $70,000 threshold.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: Will BTC ignore major macro market developments this week?\n\nEthereum price could rally 25%, pending confirmation\n\nEthereum price is trading with a bearish bias, but not for long as the price action since March 12 has consolidated into a descending wedge pattern. The execution of this bullish reversal technical formation will happen after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline on the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the heath of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to wind around the mean level of 50, while the AO indicator shows growing bullish sentiment displayed by the green histograms that draw toward positive territory.\n\nThe higher highs seen on the RSI chart since mid-April relative to the lower highs in ETH price also support the bullish thesis, suggesting a bullish divergence. If the RSI flips above the mean level, it would tilt the odds further in favor of a bullish breakout.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bears have their way and book profits for the nearly 10% gains made since Ethereum price bounced from the $2,900 support, the market would see a correction. A candlestick close below $2,900 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum fees drops to lowest level since October, ETH sustains above $3,200\n\nRipple price suffers the weight of overhanging bearish pressure\n\nRipple downside potential remains very much alive with bearish activity waiting to descend on XRP price once it lifts. This is seen with the multiple spikes on the volume profile (grey) in the one-day chart below. The RSI is also declining steadily, showing falling momentum.\n\nThis, coupled with the red histogram bars that remain in negative territory reinforce the bearish outlook. If the $0.5000 psychological support is lost, Ripple price could drop all the way to the $0.4500 threshold, or in a dire case, extend the fall to the bottom of the market range at $0.4188, nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP bulls show up, Ripple price could recover. For the bearish thesis to be invalidated, however, the price must record a candlestick close above $0.6500. This is because massive bearish activity awaits the payments token in the area surrounding $0.6000 as XRP bears wait to cash in.\n\nAlso Read: XRP slides to $0.50 as ETHgate controversy resurfaces, Ripple CTO debates impact on litigation"

        "content": "Trading volumes in crypto have plummeted to January lows.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices have declined slightly, impacting market activity.\n\nThe crypto market is witnessing a significant lull, with trading volumes dropping to levels not seen since the start of the year.\n\nThis downturn accompanies a noticeable decrease in the prices of major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] shedding 4.6% and 0.3% respectively over the past week.\n\nAs of the latest data, Bitcoin hovered around $62,858 while Ethereum traded at approximately $3,141.\n\nOn the 30th of April, market intelligence platform Santiment, via an X (formerly Twitter) post, reported that this decline in trading activity aligned with a broader sentiment of uncertainty among traders.\n\nThe once-popular rallying cry to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d has quieted, and the bullish chatter that typically accompanies hopeful market cycles has notably diminished.\n\nMoreover, a significant portion of the market is holding onto their assets, driven by the \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on any potential recovery rallies.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Future possibilities\n\nThis market behavior has led to a stark consolidation period for Bitcoin, where neither significant upsides nor sharp declines are being observed.\n\nSantiment highlighted this period of indecision, noting that the current situation is characterized by a lack of selling, underpinned by traders\u2019 reluctance to miss out on potential gains.\n\nThe platform also suggested keeping an eye out for a surge in trading volume, which could signal a forthcoming market-wide rally as the calendar turns to May.\n\nThe recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume is a stark reminder of the diminished market enthusiasm. From highs of over $23 billion last week, trading volumes have plummeted to just under $20 billion.\n\nThis decrease is likely a cooling-off from the fervor generated by the recent Bitcoin halving and the inflow into ETFs, which are now showing signs of waning interest.\n\nData from Farside investors indicated that Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a modest inflow of $51.6 million on the 29th of April\u2014a sharp decline from previous months.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAs the hype surrounding major catalysts like Bitcoin\u2019s halving and ETFs dissipates, the market is left in a state of anticipation for the next big wave.\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum-based ETFs could be just the spark needed to reignite investor confidence and reinvigorate market activity.\n\nAs it stands, the cryptocurrency community is watching closely, waiting for signs of either a further decline or an unexpected rally that could redefine the current landscape."

        "title": "Ethereum to outshine Bitcoin this summer? Raoul Pal\u2019s bold prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Analyst claims ETH will eclipse BTC in crypto summer.\n\nThe US liquidity injection could boost the market in the second half 2024.\n\nEthereum [ETH] could outshine Bitcoin [BTC] as we inch closer to crypto summer. The bold projection was made by Raoul Pal, founder of Real Vision and key crypto market commentary figure.\n\nIn an X post, Pal underscored that crypto summer is an altcoin season that shifts attention from Bitcoin to others. Part of his post read,\n\n\u201cCrypto Summer is usually the start of Alts season, which goes full \u201cbubble-tastic\u201d in Fall. This is when ETH bases and begins to outperform BTC. This is when SOL accelerates its outperformance of BTC & ETH.\u201d\n\nAdding a timeline to his projection and how \u201ccrazy\u201d things can get, Pal highlighted that,\n\n\u201cOnce the markets are full refreshed, that is usually when The Banana Zone starts, picking up to full mania towards the latter part of the year\u2026and well into 2025\u201d\n\nThe US liquidity factor\n\nPal\u2019s projection is purely based on historical data. However, past performance doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate future outcomes. So, what could be the key catalyst for Pal\u2019s wild projection?\n\nAn easing macro front is one of the likely factors. The Singapore-based crypto trading firm, QCP, emphasized how US liquidity injection could drive markets.\n\nIn a weekend update over Telegram, the firm acknowledged that US inflation was still hot. However, it reiterated that the US treasury could inject more liquidity in the second half of the year. Part of the statement read,\n\n\u201cHowever, at this point, monetary policy might matter much less than fiscal policy, which will be the main driver of liquidity and asset performance.\u201d\n\nThe firm added that,\n\n\u201cThe upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on 1st May could also see higher issuances in short-term US bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity.\u201d\n\nLast week, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes made a similar projection. He highlighted that extra liquidity will be injected into the economy during the US elections.\n\nMore liquidity means an extra money supply within global or local markets, especially when central banks cut interest rates. This is a perfect condition for risk-on assets to rally.\n\nWhether Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin remains to be seen. However, much of the hyped \u201ccrypto summer\u201d could be fueled mainly by macro factors rather than historical cycles."

        "content": "Developers were in two minds about 3074 EIP in Ethereum\u2019s recent developers call.\n\nPrice of ETH plummeted, on-chain metrics remained positive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] latest Dencun upgrade was a success that helped many L2 solutions reduce fees to extremely low levels.\n\nAfter this upgrade, the Ethereum developers set their sights on their upcoming upgrade, Prague, on their recent call.\n\nNew developments\n\nEthereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, is expected to bring new features to crypto wallets, enhancing user experience.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074, enables regular crypto wallets to function like smart contracts.\n\nOne key aspect of EIP-3074 is its ability to give standard wallets, like MetaMask, smart contract capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, it allows a third party to cover the gas fees associated with a user\u2019s transaction, potentially making transactions more affordable for users.\n\nIt also includes features such as transaction bundling, reducing the need for multiple signatures, and sponsored transactions, allowing wallets to delegate funds for others\u2019 use, similar to ERC-4337\u2019s account abstraction.\n\nSome developers argue that the proposed changes to EIP 3074 to allow broader use cases and global message revocation significantly increase its complexity, making it harder to implement and potentially introducing security risks.\n\nBecause of these circumstances, developers have decided to conduct a separate breakout meeting to discuss the technical aspects of EIP 3074.\n\nTheir aim is to reach a consensus on its implementation in a way that satisfies everyone, given its controversial nature.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThe developments being made to the Ethereum network may heavily influence the price movement of ETH going forward.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,170.97 and its price had fallen by 4.48% in the last 24 hours. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at, had grown by 9.33% in the same period.\n\nThe speculation around Spot ETFs around ETH was one of the major drivers of price movement for ETH in the last few days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nDespite the recent decline in price, the onchain metrics provided a positive picture. The network growth for ETH had also grown during this period, indicating that the number of new addresses showing interest in ETH had surged.\n\nThis renewed interest may help ETH see further bullish momentum going forward. Along with that, the velocity had also risen, indicating a heightened trading frequency for ETH."
