        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana All Jumped Double-Digits This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin jumped again this week as investors flooded into the crypto industry.\n\nThe crypto market came to life this week as Bitcoin (BTC -0.33%) passed $52,000 and the $1 trillion market cap level. As of noon ET on Friday, Bitcoin is up 10.2% over the past seven days and is holding strong.\n\nBitcoin isn't the only winner in crypto. Ethereum (ETH -0.67%) is up 12.2% to $2,784 per token and high-throughput blockchain Solana (SOL -0.19%) is up 4.7%, although it was up over 10% for the week just a few hours ago.\n\nWhat's driving the crypto market\n\nThe simple driver of crypto right now is the flow of funds into the industry. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen hundreds of millions of dollars of inflows this week alone and now holds over 100,000 Bitcoins. That's enough to inflate the entire market.\n\nBitcoin's rise is particularly interesting given competing forces in the market. A strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates have typically correlated to Bitcoin declining, but that trend is being offset by tech and growth stocks rising, which Bitcoin is directly correlated with.\n\nTraders have speculated that Bitcoin has become a safe haven for international investors or there's an increased pool of buyers because of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but the reality is money is coming into Bitcoin at a much faster pace than it's going out and that's driving the price.\n\nEthereum and Solana keep up\n\nEthereum is up in part because traders are expecting it to be the next crypto ETF. That would be the natural next step, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn't said it will allow any ETFs beyond Bitcoin's.\n\nSolana could be another ETF candidate, but it's up in part because of airdrops in the ecosystem that has brought more liquidity and value, some of which is flowing back to the Solana token.\n\nIt's not unusual for tokens like Ethereum and Solana to climb alongside Bitcoin and that's at least one of the drivers of the tokens this week.\n\nWhat's ahead for crypto?\n\nOutside of just token values rising, Coinbase Global's earnings release this week showed optimism about crypto exchanges and also crypto use cases. Coinbase is seeing more adoption among institutions and developers and is also pushing for regulatory clarity about what's a security and what isn't in crypto.\n\nAs the industry leader in the U.S., Coinbase's position and activism are very important to the crypto industry and when it's reporting healthy financial results that bodes well for the industry.\n\nI think all of these factors working together are very bullish for cryptocurrencies in general and even exchanges and development companies like Coinbase. But it'll be a bumpy ride and the gains earned this week could evaporate next week. So, prepare for the volatility ahead -- any dips could be a buying opportunity for investors."

        "title": "Raoul Pal Predicts Massive Rally for Ethereum And Solana In Current Bull Cycle - TradingView",
        "content": "ZyCrypto\n\nRenowned macro-investor and Real Vision founder Raoul Pal has predicted a massive rally for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in the ongoing bull cycle.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast with Anthony Scaramucci, founder of global alternative investment firm SkyBridge Capital, Pal discussed the factors driving the growth of cryptocurrencies and their potential to save economies from a monetary meltdown.\n\nPal explained that the current debt cycle and the debasement of currency by central banks are driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies. He believes that people are looking for alternative investments due to the fear of a potential global economic meltdown caused by excessive debt and the devaluation of fiat currencies. He also mentioned that the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is creating new use cases and driving up the adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen asked about his confidence in the growth of Ethereum and Solana, Pal stated that he believes ETH will reach a price of between $15,000 and $20,000 in this bull cycle. The pundit further underscored that SOL will reach a price of $750 and $1,000 in the same period.\n\nHe emphasized that he is very aggressively positioned in crypto as he believes that the issues of printing of money and excess debt will be the feature of the next two years and crypto will be the best-performing asset class.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually 100% of my liquid net worth in [crypto] and I have been actually for since 2020. And I use the bear markets to add into because I think we are in a once in a lifetime wealth accumulation opportunity for everybody be rich or poor,\u201d said Pal.\n\nNotably, the pundit did not provide a specific timeline for when he expects the crypto market to reach its peak. However, many experts are closely monitoring the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin bull market has historically started around 12 to 18 months after a halving event. If this pattern were to repeat itself, the next bull market peak would likely be in the third or fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nPal also discussed the role of gold and silver in the current economic climate, stating that while they have always played a role as a global store of wealth, they do not work as well in a digital age. He emphasized he prefers crypto over the two assets, as it offers the same benefits and has the added advantage of a technology super-cycle behind it.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,790 after a 7.73% surge in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, SOL was exchanging hands at $110, reflecting a 3.51% gain over the same period."

        "content": "A DeFi trader's apparent $30,000 to $1.1 million gain from trading Pandora was largely due to receiving tokens via Sablier, not just market buys.\n\nSablier is a DeFi platform used by projects to distribute tokens on a payroll or as part of a token vesting schedule.\n\nThe apparent success of a DeFi trader turning nearly $30,000 into $1.1 million in five days has sparked widespread fascination.\n\nThe anonymous trader, who owns the Ethereum wallet 0x88, invested in Pandora, a buzzy Ethereum token and NFT hybrid. And DeFi users keen on monitoring onchain data \u2014 DeFi trading is transparent thanks to public blockchains \u2014 noted their purported $1 million earnings.\n\nThe tale of instant riches inspires hope in many punters of DeFi.\n\nBut a closer examination by DL News suggests the situation is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAnalysis of the trader\u2019s wallet history shows that they didn\u2019t market-buy all the Pandora tokens they eventually sold; rather, they received more than half of the tokens from Sablier.\n\nSablier is a DeFi platform used by projects to distribute tokens on a payroll or as part of a token vesting schedule. Generally, tokens are only vested if there was a token pre-sale or a similar arrangement.\n\nBut according to messages seen by DL News on a Telegram channel run by the Pandora team, a pre-sale was not conducted. Pandora did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPandora emerged last week as the first implementation of the new \u2014 untested and experimental \u2014 ERC404 token standard that exists as both a token and an NFT.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn order to hold the NFT a user must buy at least one whole fungible token. If they then sell that token, or a fraction of the token, the NFT is burned, or removed from the supply.\n\nOpening Pandora\u2019s box\n\nThe mysterious trader held a total of 78 Pandora tokens worth $2.5 million at the token\u2019s peak. Although the trader did purchase tokens in the project early, their gains did not all come from market purchases. Most of the gains came from the tokens received via Sablier.\n\nThe story began on February 4 when the Pandora project gave them what\u2019s called a Sablier Lockup NFT, which represents ownership of 45 Pandora tokens.\n\nAfter receiving 45 Pandora tokens via Sablier, the mysterious trader also made a series of token purchases. They bought 33.59 Pandora tokens at an average price of $889, before spreading their sales over 35 transactions as the token rallied some 3,500%.\n\nThe 0x88 wallet sold 77 Pandora tokens across 35 transactions. (Dexscreener)\n\nThe trader\u2019s wallet had direct interactions with a few other wallets, which indicates they may be connected in some way, either the same individual controls them all, or the wallets are part of a larger group of individuals.\n\nThe first, wallet 0x22, seems to be a transit wallet without any special features. Another wallet, 0x0d has a balance of $172,000 and is actively airdrop-farming on protocols like Manta, Blur, and Blast. Lastly, wallet 0x2c, which is only two days old, already holds almost $1 million \u2014 coming directly from the trader\u2019s Pandora wallet.\n\nPandora's price\n\nSince launching on February 2, the project has done over $550 million in trading volume on decentralised exchanges and over $3 million in volume on NFT marketplaces on Ethereum.\n\nThe success of Pandora has also led to dozens of other projects launching ERC404 collections, resulting in gas spikes on Ethereum mainnet and numerous suspected rug pulls.\n\nThe total market value for ERC404 projects sits at $151 million, with nearly $21 million in total trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "content": "According to the Uniswap Foundation, the long-awaited version 4 of the decentralized exchange Uniswap will arrive in the third quarter of 2024, following the implementation of the Dencun upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, scheduled for March 13th.\n\nUniswap v4 introduces the concept of \u201chooks\u201d that allows for efficient liquidity management within the protocol and enables a wider range of use cases for smart contracts.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nThe v2 version of the decentralized exchange Uniswap coming after the Ethereum Dencun update\n\nUniswap Foundation, the decentralized autonomous organization that supports the Uniswap cryptographic exchange protocol, has announced that it will release version v4 of the platform in the third quarter of the current year.\n\nFirst of all, the founder of the project Hayden Adams and all the developers working on the DEX want to wait for the Dencun update of the Ethereum blockchain to run its course and be successfully executed.\n\nIn particular, Dencun, whose implementation is expected on March 13th, will help make the network more scalable by compressing block data and storing part of it separately.\n\nAll of this will open the doors for Uniswap to explore new functionalities within its own platform, expanding connections with the Ethereum network and offering more efficient products.\n\nThe Uniswap team has revealed the roadmap for its upgrade to version 4, explaining that at this moment the work is in the \u201cCode Freeze\u201d phase, where they are completing the main code, conducting tests, optimizing gas, improving security, and finalizing the periphery.\n\nThe next phase will involve testing their own infrastructure with preliminary checks at specific auditing companies, along with a community audit contest.\n\nIn this moment, the v4 of Uniswap will be distributed in testnet, and eventually small modifications will be made to the code.\n\nFinally, the last phase concerns the actual launch, accompanied by the related promotion and marketing initiatives.\n\nNow that the launch of Dencun on Mainnet has been scheduled for March 2024, we're excited to provide an update to the community! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nUniswap v4's launch is tentatively set for Q3 2024.\n\n\n\nFrom community-built Hooks (https://t.co/WyaGr1Ti1t), to events, to Twitter Spaces, the\u2026 \u2014 Uniswap Foundation (@UniswapFND) February 15, 2024\n\nThe new version of the industry-leading DEX will leverage the recent Ethereum improvement proposals (EIP, specifically EIP-4788, EIP-1153, and EIP-4844) for a more efficient utilization of liquidity in the platform\u2019s pools.\n\nWith v4, the concept of \u201chook\u201d will be introduced for the first time in DeFi, which allows the injection of custom logic at specifically designated points for pools, swaps, fees, and other LP positions.\n\nThis amplifies the use cases of Uniswap and explores new solutions for smart contract engagement, with significant reductions in gas fees and always immediate interactions, combined with better resource management for end users.\n\nThe positive effects of Dencun on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nWhile Uniswap awaits the implementation of Dencun on the Ethereum blockchain, the community of the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform is buzzing with excitement for one of the most significant updates ever witnessed so far.\n\nDencun was previously launched on January 17th on the Goerli testnet (with some difficulties and a 4-hour delay) specifically to test some new features.\n\nOn January 31st, it was then the turn of the Sepolia testnet, and finally on February 11th, the Holesky testnet, completing the final preparations before the arrival in mainnet.\n\nNow the official launch to the general public, as highlighted by the blockchain research company \u201cNethermind\u201d, is scheduled for March 13th at 13:55:35 UTC, at block height \u201c8626176\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum developers have decided on the official launch date unanimously during the so-called consensus level call 127 after the success of Holesky.\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade is set for March 13.\n\n\n\nIt introduces several key changes, including EIP-4844, EIP-1153, and EIP-4788.\n\n\n\nHow will Dencun affect L2 valuations, and what does this have to do with Uniswap?\n\n\n\nSubscribe and read to find out.https://t.co/0fHx7Y3Zd7 \u2014 Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) February 15, 2024\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Dencun will enable a new type of transaction called \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d that will help reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s rollups, with obvious benefits also for DEXs like Uniswap.\n\nMore precisely, the \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d is a preliminary measure of the technical functionality of \u201cdanksharding\u201d, which opens the doors to future implementations on the L1 backbone infrastructure.\n\nFor now, Dencun will be responsible for compressing the transaction data contained in the rollups and storing part of it in an external storage, helping to reduce the weight of the blocks and thus reducing fees for the end user.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the same update will help reduce the cost of data available on Ethereum, creating advantageous conditions for projects such as Celestia, Avail, and EigenDA.\n\nWith the L2 market on Ethereum experiencing strong growth, as reported by the increase in the overall TVL of this sector, we expect Dencun to revolutionize the aspect of network scaling by bringing greater efficiency and a larger influx of new users."

        "content": "The XRP price is currently struggling to retain $0.52, with commentators dubbing the token undervalued, but what could this price be if XRP captured the $299 billion market cap of Ethereum?\n\nXRP retained the spot as the second-largest crypto asset at some point, only below Bitcoin (BTC), the firstborn cryptocurrency, in market capitalization. The crypto asset overtook Litecoin (LTC) in market cap in 2015 and held the second spot until 2016, when Ethereum (ETH) stole the show.\n\nXRP Battled Ethereum for Second Spot\n\nXRP battled Ethereum for the second spot from 2016 to 2018, eventually reclaiming it in December 2017 when its market cap soared to $95.8 billion while Ethereum remained at the $70 billion mark. ETH retook the spot after a brief period, but the supremacy battle lingered until late 2019.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum has continued to hold the second spot since then, with the SEC lawsuit, which came up in December 2020, exerting more bearish pressure on XRP. While Ethereum\u2019s market cap soared to a high of $575 billion in November 2021 during the bull run, XRP only had a valuation of $60 billion.\n\nOver the years, XRP has also relinquished the third and fourth spots to Binance Coin (BNB) and Tether (USDT). Most recently, it gave up the fifth spot to a rallying Solana (SOL), whose market cap has now skyrocketed past $47 billion amid the reclamation of a $100 price.\n\nXRP now sits sixth among the largest crypto assets by market cap, with a valuation of $28.5 billion at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin, boasts a market cap of $27.9 billion despite its woes last year.\n\nXRP Price at $299B Market Cap\n\nSeveral XRP proponents have bemoaned the asset\u2019s underperformance over the years, as it goes from a competitive stance against Ethereum to relegating itself to the sixth position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nWhile some market analysts predict an imminent comeback from XRP, these projections remain speculative at this time. However, if XRP had followed a similar growth trajectory to Ethereum\u2019s, what would its price be right now, considering its current circulating supply?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of $299 billion at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, XRP\u2019s circulating supply comes in at 54.5 billion coins, per CoinMarketCap (CMC) data. If XRP had imitated Ethereum\u2019s growth to reach the $299 billion valuation, its price right now would be $5.53.\n\nNotably, this price would represent a new all-time high for XRP, which currently trades for $0.5227. XRP would need to skyrocket by a massive 957% from its current value to clinch the $5.53 price.\n\nIf XRP achieves a market capitalization of $1 trillion like Bitcoin, XRP price would be approximately $18."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's recent price action suggests that the $3,000 mark is within reach. This level is not just a psychological barrier but also a significant milestone that reflects the growing confidence of investors in the asset's long-term value proposition.\n\nUpon reviewing the latest price chart, Ethereum has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The digital asset has persistently held above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, which are often looked at as indicators of bullish sentiment when the price is above them. The 50-day EMA, in particular, has provided strong support during the recent uptick, currently residing around the $2,500 mark.\n\nEthereum's surge past the $2,800 level has been met with increasing volume, indicating solid interest in sustaining higher price levels. Resistance is anticipated as ETH approaches the critical $3,000 threshold. This is due to the expected profit-taking by traders who view this round number as an opportune moment to realize gains. However, the strength of the current trend suggests that any pullback might be short-lived.\n\nIf Ethereum faces selling pressure at $3,000, the $2,800 level may serve as the first line of defense against a significant retracement. A further drop could see the $2,500 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, acting as a more substantial support level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum breaks the $3,000 resistance, we could see an extension of the bullish run, with potential targets moving into uncharted territory. Such a move would confirm Ethereum's bullish stance and could trigger a new wave of speculative interest in the asset.\n\nSolana loses momentum\n\nSolana has encountered an unexpected stall in its price momentum. The asset, which has been the main choice of bulls during this bull run, has struggled to breach the $120 resistance level, a barrier that has proven to be a significant challenge.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the price action reveals that SOL's movement has been constrained, with the $120 mark acting as a ceiling to its growth. This level is not just a technical resistance but has become a psychological one, with each approach being met with selling pressure that pushes the price back down. The inability to push past this point has led to a period of consolidation, with the price oscillating between this upper bound and support levels beneath.\n\nThe immediate support for Solana is observed around the $100 zone, a level that has been tested several times and has so far held firm. A break below this could open the door to further losses, with the next significant support level at around the $90 mark, where the 200-day Exponential Moving Average lies.\n\nThe lack of upward momentum in Solana's price can be partly attributed to broader market conditions, where increased transaction fees on the Ethereum network have led investors to explore alternative platforms. While this could potentially benefit Solana, the network itself has yet to showcase substantial growth factors that could catalyze a new wave of adoption and investment.\n\nSolana's recent outages and network instability have dampened the sentiment around the project, causing concern among potential users and investors about its reliability. These technical challenges need to be addressed for Solana to regain its footing and become a viable competitor to Ethereum once more.\n\nDogecoin faces fierce resistance\n\nDogecoin has encountered what may be considered its nemesis resistance at the $0.08 level. This price point has proven to be a formidable barrier and acted as a point of reversal during the previous run.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s price chart indicates that while the asset has encountered resistance at $0.08, it has shown a commendable ability to break through previous resistance levels. The resilience of Dogecoin\u2019s price can be seen in its recent approach to this threshold, as it edges closer to a potential breakout. The momentum behind Dogecoin, supported by an increase in volume, suggests that the asset may indeed possess the strength to push past this key resistance level.\n\nSupport for Dogecoin is currently established at the $0.075 level, where the cryptocurrency previously found buying interest. If a reversal were to occur, this support zone could be the first to be tested. A breach below this could see further support at lower levels, potentially around the $0.07 mark, where the 50-day moving average lies.\n\nThe Dogecoin network and community are experiencing a resurgence of activity, partly due to the celebration of Dogecoin's 14th birthday, which has historically been a catalyst for increased interest and speculative trading. Additionally, the potential implementation of Dogecoin on various payment platforms, including X payments (formerly known as Twitter) might become a strong growth factor."

        "content": "There\u2019s plenty of talk recently about crypto going mainstream, triggered especially by events around spot bitcoin ETFs in the US. These products were approved and launched in January, which is significant in itself, but what has followed is a hugely impressive start, which has seen net flows for all BTC ETFs cumulatively surpass $3 billion, while two of the funds (IBIT and FBTC) are already\u2013despite being only around a month old\u2013in the top ten funds for year-to-date flows.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Flows\n\nThe ETFs are center stage and demand has been relentless, but there are further indicators suggesting that crypto is coming in from the cold, with a series of recent announcements regarding tie-ups between crypto products and mainstream, well-known companies.\n\nEthereum Name Service and GoDaddy\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) has been around since May 2017, and is a domain name service operating on Ethereum Ethereum Ethereum is an open source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. Created in 2014, Ethereum now stands as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap at the time of writing.As a decentralized cryptocurrency network and software platform, Ethereum represents the most prominent altcoin.

What that means is that an Ethereum wallet address (which looks like a long, random string of numbers and letters) can be mapped to a readable, ownable domain name on the Ethereum blockchain Blockchain Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.

The ledger can be public or private (permissioned). In this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data, making it not only open but verifiable. Because a blockchain is stored across a network of computers, it is very difficult to tamp Read this Term. Up to now, though, ENS domain ownership has been relatively niche, with distinctive .eth domain names common in crypto circles (or among Ethereum devotees, at least), but still\u2013from a wider perspective\u2013limited in adoption.\n\nAs such, it looks significant that ENS has now partnered with GoDaddy, one of the biggest names in regular (non-crypto) internet naming services and web hosting. With over 20 million users, GoDaddy is highly recognizable, and so a shift towards crypto\u2013and Ethereum specifically\u2013is worth noting, keeping in mind also that applications for spot ETH ETFs are currently being processed by the SEC.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that ENS was never a direct competitor to GoDaddy and similar services, since the Ethereum-based product was not intended to supersede the standard Domain Naming Service (DNS). Rather, the intent was to work in parallel alongside regular mechanisms, and the ENS/GoDaddy collaboration underlines this ambition, providing easy inter-connection between Ethereum and established web architecture.\n\nDNS has been the internet's backbone for 40 years, but blockchain-based identifiers face limitations. Can supporting them with DNS create a more secure and integrated solution? Find out here:#DNS #Blockchain #InternetEvolution\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/QmjiUaKdE7 \u2014 GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) February 10, 2024\n\nThrough GoDaddy, users will be able to connect a standard DNS domain name with an Ethereum wallet address (just as ENS provides a connection between ENS domain name and wallet address). What\u2019s more, Ethereum gas fees (which vary and can at times be very expensive) are cut out of the equation through a mechanism called Gasless DNSSEC, which may be a critical factor, since excessive gas fees can be an obstacle to bringing on board new Ethereum users.\n\nMetaMask and Robinhood\n\nWhen it comes to crypto hot wallets, browser-based MetaMask\u2013with well over 22 million downloads since it launched in 2016\u2013is the dominant product, allowing users to hook up permissionlessly with DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and anything else web3-related.\n\nAnd when it comes to online stock trading aimed squarely at retail participants, Robinhood is among the most dominant platforms, with around 11 million monthly active users. Since 2018, Robinhood has also supported crypto trading, and so it now follows coherently that the trading platform has announced a partnership with MetaMask.\n\nWhat makes this connection stand out is that MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet option, meaning that users are holding their own assets without the need for a third party. By integrating with MetaMask, Robinhood is allowing users to buy crypto assets through Robinhood itself, but to custody them in their own wallets, creating a crossover between the centralized platforms of the regular web, and the more self-reliant ethos that is central to web3 and crypto.\n\nAnd again, as with the ENS/GoDaddy partnership, we\u2019re seeing crypto-native products seeking not to replace existing companies and ways of operating, but rather to work alongside them and establish connectivity.\n\nThe MetaMask/Robinhood partnership also establishes further on-ramps from traditional finance and fiat currency, to web3 products and crypto, potentially enabling broader crypto adoption. However, viewed alongside the new BTC ETFs, there\u2019s a key difference at play, as the ETFs enable exposure to bitcoin without needing on-ramps, while Robinhood and MetaMask are making it easier for users to actually hold their own crypto, which can then be put to use in decentralized applications.\n\nTransak and Visa\n\nIt was reported at the end of January that global payments giant Visa is entering into a partnership with crypto payments firm Transak. Again, this collaboration works to provide accessible connections between fiat and crypto, easing friction around off-ramps, and in the process solving a recurring concerns around crypto ownership: the need to be able to cash out easily when required.\n\nThe Transak/Visa partnership will enable real-time card withdrawals (from crypto to fiat), and remove complication around local crypto regulations, due to Transak\u2019s compliance with rules and regulations around the world, and its multiple licenses allowing operations in a variety of global regions.\n\nHere again, then, we have traditional finance and crypto (or, perhaps, web2 and web3) each playing to their respective strengths while moving towards integrated cooperation. This appears to be mutually beneficial for both sectors, and in that case, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are further partnerships still to come between traditional firms and crypto products."

        "title": "Ethereum: This is how this blockchain skyrocketed DeFi's TVL! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 16 Feb 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi) defines the total value of assets locked in DeFi protocols and smart contracts. In other words, it measures the total amount of cryptocurrencies locked and utilized in various decentralized financial services. These services include liquidity pools, borrowing and lending protocols, decentralized exchange platforms (DEXs), among others. TVL is often seen as an indicator of the popularity and adoption of different DeFi protocols. It acts as a barometer of this crypto ecosystem. Indeed, according to recent data, DeFi\u2019s TVL is at the peak of its form thanks to the dynamism of Ethereum. This article explains the ins and outs of this trend.\n\nDeFi at its Highest Level in 20 Months Thanks to Ethereum!\n\nDeFi is experiencing a robust resurgence, marked by a substantial increase in its total value locked (TVL). This is shown by recently published data by crypto platform DefiLlama. According to it, the DeFi\u2019s TVL has exceeded $69 billion, reaching its highest point in the last 20 months.\n\nThis resurgence is not limited to any specific blockchain, as various protocols from different networks contribute to the upward trend. Most notably is Ethereum. In just the past month, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has jumped an impressive 37 %, reaching about $41 billion at present.\n\nThis increase can be attributed to the influential role played by protocols such as EigenLayer, which have contributed to a significant influx on the Ethereum network. Concurrently, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto, Ether (ETH), has witnessed a remarkable rise, with bullish sentiments aiming for the $3,000 mark as the next target. A spike that coincides with the announcement by Franklin Templeton of its plans to launch an Ethereum Spot ETF, reinforcing the positive trend prevailing in the market. But then, what are the blockchains that are positively impacting DeFi\u2019s TVL, besides Ethereum?\n\nThe Key Role of Solana and Arbitrum in DeFi\u2019s TVL Rise\n\nAccording to data, Solana and Arbitrum have played a major role in increasing DeFi\u2019s TVL by attracting significant attention and substantial investment flows.\n\nIn February, for example, Solana experienced a remarkable increase in its TVL, which reached $1.90 billion. It\u2019s Solana\u2019s highest TVL since mid-2022. This increase follows a substantial upward trajectory. Solana\u2019s TVL soared by 47 % in the month of January alone and over 500 % since October 2023.\n\nThe dynamism can be credited to platforms like Jupiter, Kamino, and Jito. They are indeed the key catalysts that have attracted considerable capital into the Solana ecosystem. Not to mention, the phenomenon of airdrops has triggered fervor within the crypto community, further consolidating the inflow of funds into Solana-based projects.\n\nSimilarly, Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum, has seen a notable rise in its TVL. It reached a record level of $2.9 billion. This increase is attributed to the involvement of key protocols such as GMX, Hyperliquid, and Camelot, which have significantly contributed to Arbitrum\u2019s growth.\n\nThe simultaneous rise of Solana and Arbitrum underscores the increasing importance of level 1 and 2 solutions in the crypto landscape. Indeed, these platforms not only offer scalability solutions but also provide a fertile ground for the development of innovative projects and decentralized applications (dApps). Interestingly, even the Bitcoin network has played a role in the increase of DeFi\u2019s TVL.\n\nThe Unexpected Contribution of Bitcoin to the Surge in DeFi\u2019s TVL\n\nTraditionally, the Bitcoin network is not associated with decentralized finance. However, its influence on the recent dynamism of DeFi\u2019s TVL is noted by experts. Over the past month, the TVL of Bitcoin-based DeFi has experienced a remarkable increase, reaching $927.5 million. This represents an impressive rise of 182.9 %. An increase attributed to the emergence and adoption of protocols such as Merlins Seal, Lightning Network and Thorchain.\n\nThe expansion of DeFi\u2019s TVL across various blockchain networks highlights something significant. Namely, that this segment of crypto is experiencing sustained evolution, marked by a transition towards a multi-chain paradigm. This development underlines the growing importance of interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem and indicates the broader acceptance and integration of DeFi principles.\n\nFurthermore, the remarkable growth of DeFi\u2019s TVL across the Bitcoin network is revealing of the burgeoning relevance of BTC. This goes beyond its role as a store of value or means of exchange. While it is commonly regarded as an autonomous crypto, the integration of BTC into DeFi highlights its versatility and adaptability within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the success of Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols signals a paradigm shift in the perceived utility of the leading crypto. BTC is no longer just seen as a digital currency. It is now recognized as a viable platform for decentralized financial applications. This contributes to the diversification and expansion of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, analyzing the dynamism of Ethereum and its impact on DeFi\u2019s TVL reveals a positive evolution in the crypto ecosystem. The recent increase in TVL, marked by the essential contribution of Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum and even the Bitcoin network, demonstrates the emergence of a multi-chain paradigm in decentralized finance. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into DeFi also underlines its versatility and relevance beyond its traditional role. This phenomenon sheds new light on the perception of the Bitcoin blockchain as a viable platform for decentralized financial applications, which serves to contribute to the diversification and expansion of the DeFi ecosystem in its entirety.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Battle of the blockchains: Can SOL challenge ETH? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Rajagopal Menon\n\nWhen David Hoffman, an ETH maximalist, narrated his experience of being at a Solana conference on Bankless, he casually emphasised that \u201cSolana is not Ethereum, and it\u2019s tiny\u201d. Of course what he referred to was the market size of Solana vis a vis Ethereum, thus discounting the bullish narrative around SOL which according to him, is a community-built scenario on X(formerly Twitter). It sort of begs the response which was also a famous quote from the TV series Game of Thrones \u2013 \u201ca very small man can cast a very large shadow.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has minimalist functionality. It was designed for store of value and transfer of value. To overcome these limitations, a 19-year-old Russian developer Vitalik Buterin, wrote a new language and developed a new programmable blockchain called Ethereum. Blockchains become programmable when equipped with highly expressive programming languages that are nearly Turing-complete. Expressive languages facilitate the creation of code that is easily comprehensible. Turing completeness implies a system in which a program can be formulated to find solutions, allowing the program to execute a wide range of tasks using its codebase. Presently, Ethereum stands out as the most widely adopted programmable blockchain. With an early mover advantage, it was one of the first blockchains to facilitate and spread awareness of building applications and utility for crypto. It\u2019s no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $20B at the moment.\n\n\n\nAs soon as applications started being built on blockchain, the Twitter community backing Vitalik\u2019s visionary crypto project was present to remind anyone and everyone that Ethereum network was the place to be. Even today if a newbie considers building a product on blockchain, they would do their research on Ethereum before getting spooked by the high gas fees that have created hurdles for the network. This would then prompt them to look for more cheaper options, and the ever active messaging platform X, with Shib and Doge armies would make him/her consider Solana. It\u2019s like your elders advising you to put your money in the same retirement fund that they invested in versus your peers encouraging you to go for low ticket investments which could bring high returns without putting a dent in the pocket.\n\n\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL of $600M seems miniscule compared to Ethereum and might not look like an apple to apple comparison. However, we must remember that Ethereum started out like Solana when Bitcoin was the OG Crypto and eventually made its way up to the top of the charts, second only to BTC. As of now, Solana has secured its position in the top 5 tokens by market capitalization. This is a more constructive insight compared to TVL since it indicates a steady interest in capital inflows on Solana network in the last three years. While most have been attributed to the success of memecoins, frequent airdrops, robust community building and engagement, its price movements have also shown signs of promise. It pierced the 2% dominance mark on the charts in December 2023, an indicator of a bullish phase according to historic patterns.\n\n\n\nSolana seems to have cracked the code in terms of scalability and network efficiency with high TPS and low gas fees. This has largely contributed to building traction among developers who want Web3 to live up to its hype and produce dynamic results with exceptional capabilities, resulting in over 100 dApps being built on Solana. It could have been higher if the FTX fiasco didn\u2019t occur at all. Solana is now boasting around 2500 active devs monthly, with a retention rate of 50%.\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum\u2019s rollups saw success with the implementation of new frameworks by Layer 2 solutions like OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, and Polygon\u2019s CDK. These helped the launch of new chains, functioning as either Layer 2s or Layer 3s. While Ethereum has more than 500 dApps running on its network, with over 5000 devs, it could see a contender emerge in Solana because of the new age DeFi apps being built, lucrative for crypto enthusiasts and their need for an instantaneous avenue for products they choose to engage with. Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee of $1.149 is quite steep not just for developers but traders as well. Even though interest on the network continues to grow especially after the transition to Proof of Stake, it is slowly starting to look like a network for crypto veterans as compared to the new entrants.\n\nAlso Read Mumbai Local Train Update: Indian Railways working to increase frequency of trains, set to reduce wait time from 3 to 2.5 minutes Centre may sell part of residual stake in HZL in FY25; Move follows promoter Vedanta\u2019s recent OFS Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project: Over 175,000 noise barriers installed on 87.5 km viaduct Indian Army\u2019s Bold Mission: Using Veterinary Care to Defuse Ethnic Tensions in South Sudan\n\nThe fact that Solana has reached the top 5 token list on the chart and also presents a potential for catching up with Ethereum\u2019s market cap, indicates immense scope of its price increase in the next couple of years. But if Ethereum is too worried about Solana touching its tail, it has ETFs coming its way which could further boost its price and market cap, giving them some respite from all the buzz around SOL.\n\nVitalik has been the bigger person in blessing Solana with success in the past but it could also have been a gross underestimation of its potential which the industry couldn\u2019t have foreseen. The colossal growth of Solana in 2023 has drawn developers en masse. With transaction fees as low as $0.00025 per transaction, it\u2019s the go-to for launching fresh blockchain projects and DeFi apps. New devs with limited resources lean towards Solana for its enhanced transaction speed, lower gas fees, and superior scalability \u2013 the golden trio for any web3 dev. Solana is the \u2018new age\u2019 blockchain, offering amenities for NFTs, in-app transactions, and seamless payment settlements.\n\n\n\nEthereum, holding the second-largest market cap, often masks certain network drawbacks like gas fee and less scalability. Ethereum loyalists argue its matured ecosystem can weather volatility and security issues, making it the choice for stablecoins and real-world tokenized assets. Ethereum is quite omnipresent in the crypto ecosystem, especially for DeFi and metaverse stakeholders who somehow find themselves directly or indirectly in contact with ETH.\n\n\n\nIn the upcoming bull run, amid positive developments, both networks stand to gain. Solana could host new projects appealing to crypto newcomers, backed by solid sustainability plans and ample capital from improved VC funding sentiment. Institutional crypto investments, boosted by ETF launches, will see TradFi institutions building more use cases on blockchains. While Solana and Ripple have secured remarkable partnerships, Ethereum\u2019s trust and credibility positions it as a major contender for the new wave of products in collaboration with traditional institutions. Solana isn\u2019t poised to \u2018kill\u2019 Ethereum with the current state of events. But, never say never.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nIs XRP Really Undervalued? Deep Dive Into the Price and Market Cap Potential\n\nStory Highlights Many believe XRP is currently priced lower than its potential, with some predicting a 957% surge if it matched Ethereum's market cap.\n\nXRP once challenged Ethereum, but legal issues and competition pushed it down to 6th place among crypto assets.\n\nAnalysts offer potential price projections if XRP rebounds, but uncertainties remain.\n\nXRP, currently battling to maintain the $0.57 mark, is considered by many as an undervalued token in the cryptocurrency market. The big question circulating: What if XRP could match Ethereum\u2019s substantial $299 billion market cap?\n\nXRP\u2019s Rise and Fall\n\nXRP once stood as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and held its position until Ethereum surged in 2016. The battle for supremacy continued until December 2017, when XRP\u2019s market cap soared to $95.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $70 billion. Ethereum regained the second spot, and the battle continued until late 2019.\n\nThe SEC lawsuit in December 2020 cast a shadow, impacting XRP\u2019s standing. Despite Ethereum hitting $575 billion during the November 2021 bull run, XRP lagged at $60 billion. Now, it sits at the sixth spot among crypto assets, valued at $28.5 billion.\n\nLosing ground to Binance Coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL), XRP faces challenges. Formerly a rival to Ethereum, it now strives for relevance. Analysts speculate on a potential XRP comeback, but uncertainties persist.\n\nProjected XRP Prices\n\nIf XRP were to mirror Ethereum\u2019s market cap at $299 billion, each XRP coin could be valued at $5.53. A staggering 957% surge from its current $0.5727, this hypothetical price would rewrite the token\u2019s narrative, marking a new all-time high.\n\nDreaming big, if XRP reached a $1 trillion market cap like Bitcoin, its potential price could be around $18 per coin. A bold move, this scenario hints at substantial growth for the resilient token.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile these projections are speculative, they fuel discussions about XRP\u2019s potential and its ability to reclaim a more prominent position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCan XRP rise again, reclaiming its historical glory, and find a lasting place in the crypto realm? Keep an eye on this space."
