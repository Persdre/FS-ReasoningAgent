        "title": "Introducing Base: Coinbase\u2019s Solution to Scaling Ethereum - Global X",
        "content": "While Ethereum is the leading public smart contract blockchain, its widespread popularity, transaction limitations, and variable demand levels can lead to network congestion and increased costs. These high costs often render small transactions impractical and pose obstacles to developing new use cases. For Ethereum to become a globally adopted data settlement platform, there is a growing need for solutions that can enhance transaction speed and reduce costs without compromising the network\u2019s security.\n\nLayer 2 (L2) networks such as Base offer pathways to ease the computational burden on the Ethereum network. Developed by Coinbase, one of the largest offchain cryptoasset exchanges globally, Base is built for speed, affordability, and user-friendliness. In this blog post, we explore the successful early adoption of Base following its launch in July 2023 and how it is contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBase aims to scale Ethereum by expanding its reach and providing a more efficient, affordable, and user-friendly experience.\n\nFueled by Coinbase\u2019s strong brand, L2 technology adoption, and Base\u2019s considerably lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum, adoption has happened quickly as Base has onboarded 100,000 daily active users faster than any other L2 network. 1\n\nBase represents a strong show of commitment to Ethereum by Coinbase and positions the exchange to benefit from the growth of Ethereum\u2019s onchain ecosystem.\n\nBase Unveils New Avenues That Expand the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nImagine Ethereum as a bustling boulevard replete with businesses of all types. Potential patrons of these businesses visit the boulevard in their cars but find themselves stuck in traffic due to inadequate infrastructure to handle the influx of vehicles. Meanwhile, a new train system running parallel to, but seamlessly integrated with the main boulevard makes its debut, providing a swift and cost-effective means of transport for these travelers, and a means of alleviating some of the road traffic.\n\nNow, instead of travelers sitting in traffic and paying high tolls, the train works to spread the cost out among a larger group of people, with individuals paying only a minimal fee for the convenience of boarding and disembarking at a station of their choice. This system not only alleviates traffic congestion but also enhances affordability, thereby improving the overall ecosystem\u2019s efficiency and expanding the available navigation space.\n\nJust like trains help to alleviate traffic on the boulevard, L2s play a crucial role in alleviating network congestion on Ethereum. They work by shifting the execution of transactions away from the Ethereum chain and onto adjacent networks. Periodically, they consolidate these transactions into a single cryptographic proof and post the proof to Ethereum as a single transaction. This innovative approach not only ensures that activity on L2 networks inherit the security assurances of Ethereum, but also expands the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s transactional throughput while reducing average user costs.\n\nIn this context, Base is one of a growing number of L2 networks that extends the surface area of Ethereum and embraces ether (ETH) as the denominating currency within the ecosystem. What sets Base apart is its unique position as the first L2 network supported by a well-established public company committed to advancing crypto adoption.\n\nCoinbase unlocks access to a vast user base and over $130 billion in assets on its exchange platform.2 Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure for developers to harness. For example, application developers have access to a range of integrations, including fiat onramps, a bridge to its widely adopted mobile app, and a user-friendly self-custodial wallet. Similarly, for users, Base is expected to simplify the blockchain experience as Coinbase streamlines interactions with these applications through direct in-app integrations.\n\nBase Gains Strong Momentum as Transactions Migrate from Ethereum to L2 Networks\n\nEarly indications are that L2 networks like Base have found strong product-market fit. The clearest evidence of this is that over 2 million daily transactions are now facilitated by L2 networks. Much of this migration can be attributed to the much lower costs of using L2s. Base, for example, charges an average transaction fee of $0.31 for a ~$200 USDC stablecoin transfer, a ~94% reduction over Ethereum\u2019s current fee of $5.02.3,4\n\nFurther, in just three months as a live network, Base has grown its user base to more than 2.5 million addresses.5 Undoubtedly, Base\u2019s rapid growth has been driven by increasing awareness of and familiarity with L2 networks over the past two years, as well as by the significant technological advancements that have been made within scaling technology during this time. Coinbase has also made the marketing of Base a strategic priority.\n\nAs the ecosystem of available applications on Base expands and the user experience continues to improve, we expect Base\u2019s active user base to continue to grow.\n\nAt present, more than $565 million has been transferred onto Base by its active user base, making it the third-largest L2 network behind only Arbitrum and Optimism which have $6.5 billion and $3 billion in assets deposited on their network.6 The majority of this value periodically engages with a diverse range of applications, mostly consisting of onchain financial services and novel social platforms.\n\nBase Solidifies Coinbase\u2019s Commitment to Ethereum and Paves the Way for New Business Horizons\n\nBase symbolizes Coinbase\u2019s vote of confidence in Ethereum and a commitment to expand the network. Coinbase is well-positioned to make Ethereum more accessible, reducing the barriers for users to engage with the sea of available applications and providing developers with the tools to contribute to the ecosystem\u2019s growth more easily and effectively.\n\nThis commitment not only strengthens Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem but strategically positions Coinbase to explore novel business opportunities. As Base is used, cryptographic proofs summarizing network activity must be submitted and settled on the Ethereum network. Coinbase currently manages the data relay process, referred to as the sequencer, and can capitalize both by ordering transactions as well as on the margin between fees charged for offchain transaction execution and the costs associated with settling batches of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nTo date, Base has generated approximately $5.3 million in profit through these operations.7 As user activity on Base continues to grow, we expect the profits earned from these activities to grow in kind. Eventually, the task of operating the L2 sequencer and relaying transactions back to Ethereum is poised to become a collaborative effort involving multiple parties, thus, an eventual distribution of these profits beyond Coinbase is anticipated.\n\nOperating Base presents a fresh opportunity for Coinbase, but there may be additional avenues to explore. By having access to a user\u2019s first touch point into Base via its mobile app and wallet infrastructure, Coinbase can strategically implement design choices and processes to extract fees and generate value. For example, this could involve earning fees by providing a fiat onramp for applications deployed on Base and implementing backend fees for streamlining user experience processes that simplify user interactions with these applications. Looking ahead, Coinbase may even explore the development of its own fee-generating applications, further contributing to the growing ecosystem of the Ethereum network.\n\nConclusion: Base Is an Acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s Vision and We Believe a Key Player in Advancing Crypto Adoption\n\nEthereum needs alternative pathways to improve network efficiency and affordability, and Base is a prime example of such an alternative. Marking a significant milestone in the maturation of Ethereum, Base embodies the ongoing progress in open-source L2 software while benefiting from Coinbase\u2019s expertise and large user base. By positioning itself as an accessible gateway to the Ethereum ecosystem, Base is expected to provide users with a streamlined and user-friendly experience, making the Ethereum ecosystem more approachable for the masses.\n\nThe launch of Base also highlights how companies like Coinbase can contribute to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and unlock new business opportunities. With Base, Ethereum takes a step closer to becoming an integral part of our digital lives, while Coinbase solidifies its trailblazing role in the industry.\n\nRelated ETFs\n\nClick the fund name above to view current holdings.

        "title": "Transient Storage: Ethereum's Game-Changing Feature - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Imagine a blockchain that operates swiftly, with each transaction costing less yet doing more. That\u2019s the promise Transient Storage holds for Ethereum. This fresh feature is garnering attention for its potential to cut transaction costs while enabling more complex operations drastically.\n\nThat\u2019s the promise Transient Storage holds for Ethereum, introduced through EIP-1153.\n\nDive in as we unravel Transient Storage, its mechanism, and its significance in the blockchain community! \ud83c\udf10\n\nWhat is Transient Storage?\n\nTransient Storage is a temporary data storage area within Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine (EVM). Unlike permanent storage, which retains data indefinitely, Transient Storage preserves data only during the transaction\u2019s execution. It operates with two new opcodes, TLOAD (0x5c) and TSTORE (0x5d), facilitating temporary storage operations and making transactions cheaper and faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Existing Data Storage:\n\n\n\n\n\nStack: Holds temporary data during a transaction, operating on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Storage: A place for persistent data storage on the blockchain. Memory: A volatile storage area cleared after a transaction for temporary data storage. Calldata: Accompanies a function call, temporary and erased post-transaction.\n\nWhy Transient Storage Matters?\n\nTransient Storage brings a cost-effective solution. It substantially lowers transaction costs, making blockchain interactions more affordable. This novel concept reduces expenses and enables more intricate operations and better communication between smart contracts and external entities.\n\nTransient Storage offers a way to store data temporarily during a transaction, helping to cut down on gas costs significantly. This is especially useful in cases like contract deployments and rollups, where temporary data handling is needed. It is like having a cost-effective temporary workspace that gets cleared out once the work is done.\n\n\n\n\n\nClear Examples and Use Cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-entrancy Guards: Transient Storage can cut the cost of re-entrancy guards by over 90%, a significant reduction in gas fees. ERC20 Approvals: It enables single-transaction approvals, boosting security and user experience. Data Communication: Functions within smart contracts can securely and economically communicate data using Transient Storage. KYC verification: The user\u2019s document can be temporarily stored, verified, and then erased post-verification, all within a single, cost-effective transaction.\n\nState Change Costs with SSTORE Operation:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first diagram depicts Persistent Storage, with an \u201cSSTORE\u201d operation incurring a gas cost of 5000 for setting a variable and 2900 for resetting it, reflecting the expense of permanent state changes on the blockchain.\n\nState Change Efficiency with TSTORE Operation:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second diagram highlights Transient Storage, where \u201cTSTORE\u201d operations cost only 100 gas each for setting and resetting a variable, showcasing the gas efficiency of transient, non-permanent state modifications.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransient Storage is a big step forward for Ethereum, making transactions cheaper and easier. It lowers the cost, making it affordable to run more complex operations and interact securely.\n\nThis new feature saves gas and money and opens doors to new possibilities in how we use blockchain. Transient Storage is indeed a valuable addition to the Ethereum community, pushing us towards a more user-friendly and cost-effective blockchain experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of Ethereum looks promising, with innovations like Transient Storage paving the way! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more insights on Ethereum development, visit:\n\nConnect with me on:\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin price uptrend may be exhausted for the short term, as the $35,500 level pressures BTC.\n\nEthereum price at crossroads below $1,935 mean threshold represents a make-or-break moment for the largest altcoin by market capitalization.\n\nRipple price\u2019s bullish momentum continues to build, but the supply barrier ahead may pose a challenge with $0.800 likely to hold.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below $35,500 for almost two weeks now, being static, with analysts attributing the slow-down in pace to the absence of ETF-related news. With its Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also come to a halt, facing critical barriers that will determine the next move.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains\n\nBitcoin price marks time below $35,954\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is marking time below the $35,954 level after a steady 40% climb that began in mid-September. Exchanging hands for $35,091 as of press time, the rally seems exhausted, with the price showing reluctance around the $35,500 level. The bulls are likely to take a breather as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position shows BTC is massively overbought.\n\nWith this outlook, it is likely that Bitcoin price could correct soon, likely for the short term, before a continuation of the primary trend. Likely targets in a downward directional bias include the $32,000 psychological level, a critical juncture having capped the upside potential for the king of cryptocurrencies since May 2022 when the Terra (UST) ecosystem fell off a cliff.\n\nThe RSI deviated from the northbound move, flattening to show complacency as buying pressure continues to weaken. This observation favors the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined investors join the bull\u2019s camp, Bitcoin price could continue north, breaking past the $35,954 resistance level with a breakout objective above the $40,000 psychological level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate for BTC to test the supply zone extending from $44,321 to $47,122, with the $48,000 handle presenting the next logical target, a level last seen in March 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Holders of $600 billion worth of BTC are asking for Bitcoin price to rally not by 15% but by 96%\n\nEthereum price on collision with $1,035 mean threshold\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s 22% uptrend that started on October 13 has the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization confronting a crucial barrier \u2013 the $1,935 mean threshold of a supply zone extending from $1,861 to $2,004.\n\nIf Ethereum price records a daily candlestick close above the $1,935 midline, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend, setting the tone for a successful foray above the $2,000 psychological level, with $2,029 as the next logical target.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA rejection from the $1,935 level could send Ethereum price spiraling south, potentially slipping below the $1,800 psychological level and testing the $1,748 support. Such a move would denote an 8% drop below current prices.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum net exchange deposits hits five-month peak with almost 130,000 ETH flowing to exchanges\n\nRipple price eyes 10% more gains\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues northbound, with robust higher highs and higher lows surpassing key barricades. Despite XRP being massively overbought, the primary trajectory of the RSI is still northbound, showing that momentum is still rising.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ripple price test the supply zone extending from $0.7771 to $0.8199. For a confirmed uptrend, the price must break and close above the $0.8000 psychological level, with the move likely to catalyze an extension to the $0.9000 psychological level, 25% above the current price.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with XRP being massively overbought, it is likely that the supply zone will hold as a resistance order block. The ensuing rejection could see Ripple price pull south, slipping through the $0.6968 support level and testing the $0.6242 support with bulls seeking rejuvenation. Another evaluation will be required at this point to determine the next step for XRP, considering the prevailing bullish outlook in the broader market.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"

The last bounce from the lower boundary occurred on October 13th, sparking a 25% rally to the present price of $1911.\n\nThis upward movement was accompanied by a decisive break of the resistance trendline, signaling a potential conclusion to the correction trend. Currently, with a modest 1% daily gain, the ETH price is positioned favorably after the resistance breakout, poised to target the $2340 mark, which would represent a 24% upside.\n\nFurthermore, the projection from the flag\u2019s pole hints that the climb could extend toward the significant $3000 mark.\n\n1 ETH to USD = $2656.323 0.95% (24h) ETH btc\n\nbtc eth\n\neth xrp\n\nxrp bnb\n\nbnb sol\n\nsol ltc\n\nltc polygon\n\npolygon cardano\n\ncardano tron\n\ntron doge\n\ndoge WETH\n\nWETH LUNC\n\nLUNC XMR\n\nXMR LIRA\n\nLIRA BITS\n\nBITS IHINU\n\nIHINU SWEAT\n\nSWEAT PI\n\nPI SATS\n\nSATS ILV\n\nILV BDX\n\nBDX MCOIN USD USD\n\nUSD INR\n\nINR JPY\n\nJPY CNY\n\nCNY GBP\n\nGBP EUR\n\nETH vs SOL Performance\n\nSource: Coingape| Ethereum Vs Solana Price\n\nThe last three months\u2019 price period accentuates that Solana price recovery has outperformed the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum.

        "title": "Smart Contract Optimization: How to Use Less Gas in Ethereum - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "It is well known that most transactions on Ethereum require a fee to ensure that the network is spam-resistant and doesn\u2019t get stuck in an endless loop of calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gas fee is the amount of gas required to complete the transaction multiplied by the cost per unit of gas. The fee is paid whether the transaction succeeds or fails. As of November 2023, gas costs about 10 gwei. Although 1 gwei is now equivalent to about US$0.000002, we need to understand that this is just one unit, and you have to pay tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of gas to complete transactions, which will be a more tangible amount. That is why we need to keep optimization in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs developers, we cannot influence the price of gas, so we need to focus on the units of gas consumed by the code to reduce it as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the optimizations, developing on Ethereum is different from developing Web 2.0 applications because we have to give up familiar patterns, such as splitting into small functions, for ease of testing. In this article, I will provide several examples, for each of which I will give an optimized and unoptimized smart contract with the amount of gas consumed.\n\nOptimizations and operation codes\n\nThere are two main approaches to optimization:\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing the cost of deployment (minimizing the size of the smart contract and the cost of executing the constructor)\n\nOptimizing each function call\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to check is that the smart contract does not contain unnecessary and unused code, as deployment is compiled to bytecode, and the more of it there is, the more expensive deployment will be.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some expensive gas operation codes in EVM:\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE/CREATE2 \u2013 Deploys a smart contract (32,000 gas)\n\nSSTORE \u2013 Stores the value in memory (20,000 gas if the slot has not been accessed, 2,900 otherwise)\n\nBALANCE (address(this).balance) \u2013 (2,600 gas if not previously accessed)\n\n\n\n\n\nA complete list of all the codes for the different forks can be found here: https://www.evm.codes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing each function call is a better strategy because the smart contract is deployed once.\n\nTips\n\nDo not initialize variables with default values\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a variable is not initialized, the compiler assumes that it has a default value: 0 for uint , \u201c\u201d for string , false for bool , 0x(0) for address . So, initializing with default values is a waste of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize variables\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidity stores variables in cells of 32 bytes. If a variable is smaller than a cell, it is packed with another variable, but such variables must be declared side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not truncate variables\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen declaring a single variable, it makes sense to use uint256 , because otherwise, the variable has to be truncated, which takes a bit more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse static values\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases where there is an option to pre-calculate static values, it is better to use it, even if it is hardcoded. For instance, in the example below, you need to call two functions that increase the gas consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse constant variables\n\n\n\n\n\nFor variables that will be constants, just one immutable keyword will save a lot of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not declare temporary variables\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may seem harmless to introduce an extra variable that is stored in memory rather than on the blockchain, but adding an intermediate variable requires more gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse mappings instead of arrays\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not always possible, but where possible, arrays should be avoided as they are more expensive to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer a fixed-length array to a dynamic one\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you cannot avoid using arrays. Dynamic arrays are more expensive than fixed-length arrays because you have to change the array length when using the push and pop functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the data type you need in the array\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat applies to variables does not apply to arrays. If you specify the required type, the engine will pack the data in the correct way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not create many functions that call each other\n\n\n\n\n\nIn any other language, the smaller the function, the better it is for debugging and testing, but things are not the same in Solidity. It is also desirable to minimize function calls to third-party smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid multiple changes to state variables\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a variable in the blockchain whose value needs to be changed multiple times, it is better to create a temporary variable and write the final value to the blockchain after the loop is executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize gas by removing unnecessary variables\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum offers gas refunds for deleting variables. Using the delete keyword with a variable name will return 15,000 gas but no more than half of the transaction value.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse selfdestruct() to compensate for gas\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting a contract without the option to restore will return 24,000 gas but no more than half of the transaction value.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Solidity Gas Optimizer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in optimizer allows you to adjust the value of iterations depending on your optimization goals. A lower value should be set to minimize deployment costs, and a higher value should be set to optimize runtime costs. Below is the configuration file for the Solidity Optimizer with Hardhat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nAt compile time, contract code is converted to byte code for EVM, and transaction codes have a cost depending on the Ethereum fork. Despite initiatives to reduce the cost of gas (in particular, the introduction of variable size blocks in the London update, which changed the way fees are calculated), as developers, we need to optimize both the deployment and function calls in smart contracts to save money on deployment and execution."

        "content": "Decentralized Finance platform Aave shared on its website that it has halted V2 operations after receiving reports of vulnerabilities in certain features.\n\nCertain assets on Aave V2 on Avalanche, and some on Aave V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism have been frozen.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol Aave announced on November 4 that a report was received on the Aave bug bounty program concerning a vulnerability that affects the Aave v2 operations. Interestingly, the company has not yet disclosed much detail surrounding the vulnerability. For now, it is reported that the vulnerability was not exploited. It was simply a bug report and temporal actions were taken to seal the loophole.\n\nToday we received a report of an issue on a certain feature of the Aave Protocol. After validation by community developers, the guardian has taken the following temporary prevention measure (no funds are at risk).\n\nMore on the Report\n\nThe brief announcement discloses that there was coordination with the Aave Guardian, after which it was agreed that protection measures be taken to stop the attack vector. As a result of this, its V2 Ethereum Market has been halted. In addition, certain assets on its V2 on Avalanche have been paused. In addition, certain assets on Aave V3 on the likes of Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism have been frozen. It is also important to note that the unaffected markets include the Aave V3 markets on Ethereum, Base, and Metis, as well as the V2 markets on Polygon and Avalanche. This implies that no funds are currently at risk on any of the markets according to the announcement. For now, a governance proposal will be submitted shortly to ensure that the issue is resolved, and operations are back to normal.\n\nA governance proposal to restore the normal operation of the protocols will be submitted shortly. A detailed postmortem will be released once the issue is fully resolved.\n\nThe team has further clarified that users who are either supplying or borrowing from frozen assets can go on to withdraw or repay positions. However, until the issue is resolved, they cannot supply and borrow more.\n\nPrevious Attack on Aave and Yearn Finance\n\nIn April, PeckShield reported that hackers had attacked Aave and Yearn finance and stolen $10 million. On top of that, cryptos including BUSD, USDC, TUSD, USDT, and DAI were retrieved. Aave was strongly subjected to criticism as some users threatened to remove funds from the platform. Founder Marc Zeller quickly observed how the attack was concentrated on Version 1 of the protocol. It was reported that the attackers were more focused on breaking into old protocols. Yearn Finance appeared to be one of the victims.\n\nWe are aware of an issue that seems isolated to the iearn legacy protocol launched in 2020 and the liquidity pool. Yearn v2 vaults seem not to be impacted. Yearn contributors are investigating.\n\nIn a single weekend in July, a total of $70 million was reported to have been stolen from various DeFi platforms including Curve Finance. Platforms affected also included lending protocol Alchemix, yield platform Pendle, and synthetic asset tool Metronome.\n\nRegardless of the current development, the Aave token is up by 7 percent in the last seven days, and 0.63 percent in the last 24 hours. The asset is currently trading at $91.34.\n\nRecommended for you:"
