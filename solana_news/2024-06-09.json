        "content": "Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, recently made a surprising statement about transaction fees on the ETH network. Adams, who leads the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, declared that users should never have to worry about \"gas fees.\" This unexpected opinion has added a new dimension to the ongoing debate about Ethereum's high transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdams' statement comes amid a heated discussion about the expenses associated with Ethereum transactions. Recently, artist Iggy Azalea commented on the issue, questioning how gas fees are used and expressing skepticism about their impact. Although Azalea incorrectly assumed that all fees directly benefit Ethereum's founders, her comments have once again highlighted the issue of high transaction costs.\n\nNo user should ever have to hear the term \u201cgas fee\u201d Advertisement June 8, 2024\n\nThe debate over Ethereum's gas fees has become more intense with the rise of Solana, a blockchain known for its lower transaction costs. Solana's recent performance has led some to speculate about the blockchain's future and its ability to compete with more affordable alternatives.\n\nKey Ethereum developers, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have been addressing the gas fee problem for some time. Last month, Buterin introduced EIP-7706, a proposal aimed at optimizing transaction calldata and reducing gas usage. This proposal includes a new type of gas specifically for calldata transactions, with the goal of creating a separate fee market and making calldata more affordable.\n\nAmid Adams' words, Uniswap has continued to succeed, earning over $3.64 billion in total commissions to date. In the past 24 hours alone, Uniswap collected $1.62 million in fees, and over the last month, it amassed $65.95 million."

        "content": "Ethereum leaders faces criticism for trying to merge capitalist and social goals.\n\nShare this article\n\nEvgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, said if Ethereum fails in the future, it will not be because of technical shortcomings compared to competitors like Solana. Instead, the core issue is the contradiction in Ethereum\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cIf ETH fails in the future it [won\u2019t] be because \u2018Solana is faster\u2019, it will be because the [ETH] \u2018elite\u2019 is still stuck in a massive contradiction,\u201d Gaevoy stated in a recent post on X.\n\nHis remarks come as a response to the controversy that erupted following Vitalik Buterin\u2019s critique of celebrity memecoins. According to Buterin, projects should aim to deliver societal value and leave participants content, rather than focus on enriching celebrities and early investors.\n\nButerin\u2019s stance drew a sharp rebuke from hip-hop artist Iggy Azalea, who recently launched her own memecoin, MOTHER. She posted a meme showing her holding a baby that resembled Buterin.\n\nAzalea\u2019s photo prompted Uniswap Labs co-founder Hayden Adams to defend Buterin\u2019s role.\n\nHe criticized Azalea for downplaying Buterin\u2019s contributions to the crypto community, expressing disappointment that instead of reacting positively and using profits to support social causes, the singer chose to mock Buterin.\n\nNo issues with memecoins or celebcoins \u2013 I think there\u2019s value to memetic attention and it\u2019s cool to create markets for it That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social\u2026 https://t.co/FQhawNl7GP \u2014 Hayden Adams \ud83e\udd84 (@haydenzadams) June 6, 2024\n\nThat was when the Wintermute CEO jumped into the debate and criticized Ethereum\u2019s leadership. He argued that Ethereum leaders are attempting to create a capitalist blockchain system while simultaneously addressing social issues\u2014a stance he sees as inherently contradictory.\n\n\u201cYou are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I\u2019m sorry, you really [can\u2019t] have both,\u201d Gaevoy added.\n\nGaevoy\u2019s comments sparked controversy among crypto members. Many disagreed with his view, saying that being against celeb memecoins does not equate to building a socialist system.\n\nNot sure how Hayden and Vitalik saying how they don't like certain trends means they are against capitalism (or aren't involved in building capitalist systems anymore) They both have a certain vision of crypto, in terms of the types of things people will build and what people\u2026 \u2014 Mike van Rossum (@mikevanrossum) June 6, 2024\n\nExcuse me, but in what way Vitalik or Hayden are building socialism? Being against obvious rug pulls != building socialism \u2014 DeFi Made Here (@DeFi_Made_Here) June 6, 2024\n\nIn response to these disagreements, Gaevoy said it all came down to the underlying principle.\n\nAccording to him, if capitalism is the foundation, integrating features to mitigate its negative impacts is beneficial. However, if the primary goal is \u201csocial justice\u201d or creating \u201conly good things,\u201d capitalism should not be an afterthought.\n\nTo me its about the primary guiding principle. If you key guiding principle is capitalism and then you make extra steps to make it less damaging \u2013 I'm all for it. If your guiding principle is, idk, \"social justice\" or \"only good things should be built\" and then you attach\u2026 \u2014 wishful cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) June 6, 2024"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum user balances have dropped to levels not seen since 2020.\n\nGlassnode data revealed that user balances of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) on centralized exchanges reached a four-year low as investors held out for higher prices in a bull market.\n\nBTC balances dipped to below 2.3 million coins, valued at around $160 billion, while ETH balances have dropped below 16 million, amounting to less than $59 billion.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum exchange balance at 4-year low | Source: Glassnode\n\nWhy Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange levels dropped\n\nThe amount of BTC and ETH on exchanges has been in a downtrend since before July 2020, per Glassnode. Data confirmed that users continued to withdraw assets from these platforms following the pandemic, through the previous 2021 peak, during the 2022 Terra-FTX contagion, and even after spot BTC ETFs were approved.\n\nThe four-year pattern suggests that crypto users have adopted a bullish long-term outlook, expressing confidence in the future appreciation of these assets regardless of market cycles.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, inflation also rocked world economies and incentivized investors to station capital in technologically sound vehicles. Bitcoin\u2019s hard-capped supply and immutable design bolstered its status as an inflation hedge and sovereign nations like El Salvador have adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin ETFs see significant inflows despite market fluctuations\n\nThe bullish thesis is perhaps solidified even further as Wall Street behemoths like BlackRock and Fidelity drove institutional demand through spot BTC ETFs. Companies like MicroStrategy under BTC maxi Michael Saylor have also parked billions in the top digital asset.\n\nAs the second-largest crypto and top altcoin asset, ETH commands its own bullish thesis as the leading substitute for BTC. The token powers the biggest decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem worth nearly $70 billion per DefiLlama.\n\nIn 2020, developers launched the Beacon chain, which kicked off the eventual transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). The move unlocked Ether staking, a process of locking up ETH for network security and passive yield.\n\nAt press time, over 27% of Ethereum\u2019s supply was staked. In other words, users have deposited over $119 billion worth of ETH in staking providers like Coinbase, Lido, and EigenLayer.\n\nThe hype around spot ETH ETF approvals, defi growth, and staking surges has culminated in a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency and has further encouraged users to hold on for dear life, otherwise known in the crypto community as \u201chodl.\u201d"

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), recently published an in-depth analysis highlighting the rapid evolution and growing diversity in digital currencies, where it compared Bitcoin to gold and deemed Ethereum \u201cdigital oil.\u201d\n\nThe report emphasizes the human capacity for imaginative belief, as noted by historian Yuval Noah Harari, as a driving force behind the exponential growth in digital currency types and applications.\n\nVanEck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel noted:\n\n\u201cChinese SOE banks keep writing love letters to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe ICBC report outlines the divergent development paths of various digital currencies, each addressing unique needs within the financial ecosystem.\n\nThe love letter\n\nAccording to ICBC\u2019s report, market demand has fueled innovation in the digital currency sector, from the birth of Bitcoin (BTC) to advancements in Ethereum (ETH) and the exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nICBC said that Bitcoin has managed to retain a scarcity similar to gold through its mathematical consensus mechanism. The flagship crypto has resolved issues related to divisibility, authenticity verification, and portability. The report added that despite Bitcoin\u2019s waning monetary attributes, its status as an asset is solidifying.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum provides \u201ctechnical power for the digital future\u201d and is establishing itself as \u201cdigital oil\u201d capable of powering myriad applications across the web3 ecosystem.\n\nEthereum, distinct from Bitcoin, incorporates Turing completeness through its proprietary programming language, Solidity, and its virtual machine, EVM.\n\nThis feature allows developers to create and manage complex smart contracts and applications, positioning Ethereum as a critical platform for DeFi and NFTs. The report also acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s potential to extend its influence to decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin).\n\nDespite the potential, Ethereum faces several practical challenges, including security vulnerabilities, scalability issues due to high computational demands, and significant energy consumption.\n\nEthereum developers are exploring various solutions to address these challenges. The introduction of the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism and sharding technology in the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aims to enhance network throughput and sustainability. Additionally, developers are working on Layer 2 solutions such as state channels, side chains, and rollups to improve scalability.\n\nStablecoins and CBDCs\n\nThe report also highlighted the crucial role of stablecoins in bridging the gap between the digital currency market and the real world. Stablecoins, which peg their value to traditional assets like fiat currencies, offer stability in the volatile crypto market.\n\nICBC said that stablecoins facilitate seamless transactions and provide a reliable store of value, making them an essential tool for everyday financial activities and a bridge for integrating digital currencies into the global financial system.\n\nFurthermore, CBDCs represent a significant innovation in the modern monetary system. By digitizing fiat currencies, central banks can improve the efficiency of payment systems, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nAccording to the report, CBDCs can streamline cross-border transactions, reduce reliance on intermediaries, and offer greater financial inclusion by providing access to digital financial services for unbanked populations.\n\nThe report noted that the development and implementation of CBDC infrastructure requires careful consideration of privacy, security, and regulatory implications to ensure their success and widespread adoption.\n\nThe report concluded that while the development vision for each digital currency varies, all aim to enhance financial inclusion, security, and payment efficiency. As digital currencies continue to evolve, developers and policymakers need to focus on balancing sustainability, security, and efficiency.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum witnessed its strongest week in terms of capital inflow since March, with total inflows amounting to $69 million over the past week, as per the latest stats by CoinShares. The latest influx can be attributed to the surprise decision by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) to allow spot Ether ETFs.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum\u2019s YTD inflows surged to almost $81 million.\n\nThe improvement in investment products based on Ethereum had a significant impact on other digital asset products, attracting a staggering $2 billion. This subsequently resulted in the recent 5-week streak of inflows to $4.3 billion.\n\nBitcoin Still King with $1.97B Weekly Inflow\n\nEthereum products may have overshadowed Bitcoin for the past few weeks, but the latter remained the main attraction, with weekly inflows of $1.97 billion. On the other hand, short-Bitcoin investments experienced outflows for the third consecutive week, recording $5.3 million.\n\nAltcoins also saw a minor uptick in activity. Investment products based on Solana, Litecoin, and Chainlink witnessed $0.7 million in weekly inflows each. Meanwhile, XRP and Fantom stood out with inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million over the past week.\n\nTrading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) soared to almost $13 billion for the week, representing a 55% increase from the previous week. According to the latest edition of CoinShares\u2019 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, inflows were observed across almost all providers, coupled with a continued deceleration in outflows from established players.\n\nThis turnaround in sentiment is believed to be a direct response to weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data in the United States, which has brought forward expectations for monetary policy rate cuts. Positive price movements led to a rise in total assets under management (AuM), surpassing the $100 billion mark for the first time since March of this year.\n\nUS Leads $2B Global Crypto Inflow\n\nRegionally, the US experienced the highest inflows last week, registering $1.98 billion. In fact, CoinShares found that the first day of the week marked the third-largest daily inflow ever recorded. The iShares Bitcoin ETF now comfortably exceeds the incumbent Grayscale, with $21 billion in assets under management.\n\nHong Kong, Canada, and Switzerland followed suit with inflows of $26.1 million, $12.7 million, and $10.6 million, respectively, whereas Brazil, Germany, and Australia settled with $9.5 million, $2.5 million, and $1.7 million in inflows, respectively. Sweden, on the other hand, recorded a weekly outflow of $9.2 million."

        "content": "In recent days in the crypto markets, an interesting dynamic is occurring regarding the price of Ethereum in Bitcoin and in USD.\n\nThe thing is curious especially because by the end of the month, or at the latest by the first week of July, the final listing of spot ETH ETFs in the USA is expected, but despite this at the moment Ethereum appears clearly subordinate to Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in USD\n\nRegarding the price trend in USD in recent days, there is not much to say about either Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nAfter the sudden movement on Friday, when the price of BTC dropped almost abruptly from around $72,000 to around $69,000, over the weekend it did nothing but move sideways just above $69,000.\n\nAmong other things, the current level is perfectly in line with that of last Monday, so Friday did nothing but burn the gains accumulated during the week.\n\nIndeed, at the beginning of June it was below $68,000, so the current level should still be considered very good, being in fact only 6% lower than the historical maximum.\n\nA similar argument can also be made for Ethereum.\n\nThe current price is below $3,700, and it is in line with that of the last decade of May.\n\nCuriously, however, it is still at -25% from the absolute highs of 2021, but last week it had not risen much.\n\nAfter the boom of May 20, when the news of the possible imminent approval of the applications for the issuance of a spot ETH ETF in the USA came out, it rose only until the end of the month, then started June above $3,700 and in fact has been lateralizing until now.\n\nFriday had reached just above $3,800 before the drop that brought it back below $3,700.\n\nDuring the weekend, it did not move from this last level.\n\nThe dynamics of this morning\n\nThis morning, however, there was some small movement, although not significant.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has moved from $69,700 to $69,200, as if it wanted to start a small bear trend, but once it reached this last level, it recorded a rebound that seems to have averted further declines, at least for now.\n\nThe price of Ethereum went from $3,715 to $3,655, but only to bounce back and return above $3,670.\n\nThese are dynamics that only serve to liven up the markets a bit, but they are not decisive in any way, not even in the short term.\n\nHowever, it cannot be ruled out that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow this period of lateralization may end, even if it is not yet clear in which direction it might go.\n\nThe Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio and the relationship with the price in USD\n\nThe only truly interesting dynamic is that of the relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nFirst of all, you can analyze the price trend of ETH expressed in BTC.\n\nAt the beginning of June, one ETH was worth about 56 thousandths of BTC. However, already on June 2, this price started to drop.\n\nIn particular, on June 3rd it had dropped to 54 and on June 5th to 53.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s drop, it ended up falling below 53 thousandths of BTC, so now it is still below.\n\nIt is worth noting that at the end of May it had also risen above 57 thousandths, so this is a decline that has been going on for more than two weeks now.\n\nConsidering instead the ratio between the market capitalization of BTC and that of ETH, today it has risen to 3.1, after being below 2.9 at the end of May.\n\nHowever, these are not very high values, given that before the news of the probable approval of spot ETH ETFs it was almost 3.6.\n\nWhat matters most at this moment is that from Friday\u2019s drop this ratio has risen, albeit slightly, indicating that Bitcoin is holding up better than Ethereum in these days when financial markets seem a bit worried about the Fed\u2019s restrictive monetary policy.\n\nThe dominance of Bitcoin\n\nThe picture for altcoins becomes even bleaker if we analyze the dominance of Bitcoin.\n\nAt the end of May, according to Trading View data, it had dropped to 53.7%, and since then it has started an almost constant rise.\n\nJune started above 54%, and last week it had already risen above 54.7%.\n\nThe most interesting thing, however, was the reaction to Friday\u2019s drop, with Bitcoin\u2019s dominance suddenly jumping from 54.6% to 55.5%, although it then fell to 54.9% over the weekend.\n\nThis morning, however, it rose again, returning to 55.5%, before slightly correcting to 55.4%.\n\nIf we take as a reference the 51.9% at the beginning of the year, it is evident how in this 2024 it is precisely Bitcoin that dominates the crypto markets, although there are occasionally some small exceptions.\n\nAmong other things, the maximum peak of the dominance of the year was 56.3%, which is not much higher than the current levels. This gives a good idea of the fact that altcoins as a whole are not going through a good moment at all. Just think that the current levels are similar to those of the second half of April 2021, that is, in the midst of a great bull run.\n\nIn summary, despite the fact that in theory the attention at this moment should be focused on Ethereum, it is still Bitcoin that dominates the crypto markets, with the altcoins that for now are limited to suffering while waiting for better times,"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Loses Critical Support Level - U.Today",
        "content": "Ethereum fell below the $3,700 threshold, failing to break through the consolidation channel. With the price failing to surge upward, we might see another period of consolidation where the moving average could catch up with the massive volatility witnessed a few weeks ago and potentially provide some ground for a rally continuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince this level has been a crucial area of support for ETH, the recent decline below $3,700 is especially raising some concerns and questions. If it breaks below, it may indicate that bulls need to reorganize as bears are becoming more powerful.\n\nSharp swings in price action are characteristic of a volatile asset like Ethereum. Based on the current trend, it appears that ETH is having difficulty keeping up its upward momentum.\n\nEthereum went through a consolidation phase, fluctuating between support and resistance levels, as the chart illustrates following a significant rally. This type of activity typically occurs before a notable change in price either upward or downward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA deeper drop toward the 200-day MA, a more reliable measure of the direction of the long-term trend, could occur if it is unable to hold. In the near run, this might entail increased downside risk. An additional important consideration is volume.\n\nHigher-than-average trading volumes were seen along with the recent decline, suggesting that sellers are more active. This could indicate that more traders are cutting their positions, which would put more pressure on the price to decline. The RSI, on the other hand, is circling around neutral. This shows that Ethereum has room to recover if the mood of the market turns around, and it is neither overbought nor oversold."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s current decline signaled a cooling-off from its recent highs\n\nDerivative data pointed to continued market interest.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seems to have come off its ETF hype-induced rally as bulls have started to take a hike.\n\nAt press time, the largest altcoin in the world has seen a decrease of 3.7% over the past day and 2.5% over the past week as the market awaits the approval of the S-1 forms for the ETFs. So, is the rally over already?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of TradingView saw that Ethereum has been unable to maintain its highs and is now consolidating at lower levels.\n\nThe Moving Averages (MA50 in blue and MA200 in red) indicated a cooling-off period.\n\nInitially, the price surged above both moving averages in a strong bullish move but has since declined and is now trading below these key indicators, as we see a shift to bearish momentum in the short term.\n\nThe RSI, sitting around 45, also indicated a lack of strong buying momentum, with values leaning more toward the oversold territory, but not conclusively so.\n\nEthereum\u2019s social volume has also declined significantly, suggesting that public interest in and sentiment toward the altcoin are low.\n\nThis reduction in social engagement could be contributing to the decrease in Ethereum\u2019s price, as less discussion might correlate with reduced trading activity and demand.\n\nInterestingly, the trading volume of Ethereum\u2019s derivatives market has sharply increased by over 70%, meaning there is heightened market engagement.\n\nNotably, the long/short ratio across different platforms also shows more bullish sentiment on platforms like Binance [BNB] and OKX.\n\nWhat Ethereum\u2019s future holds\n\nThe on-chain data for Ethereum presented a predominantly bullish scenario. 89% of holders are currently making money at the present price, indicating a strong upward trend that has benefited the majority.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe significant concentration of the token by large holders (51%) suggested that while there was potential for high volatility due to possible large-scale sell-offs, the market was stable, with these major holders likely maintaining their positions.\n\nOverall, Ethereum bulls seem to be cooling off temporarily, likely due to the latest US jobs data. But the rally is not over yet."

        "content": "Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,720 resistance. ETH declined again and is now at risk of more losses below the $3,550 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline from the $3,720 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend losses if there is a close below the $3,550 support.\n\nEthereum Price Dips Again\n\nEthereum price attempted a decent increase above the $3,650 resistance zone. ETH even spiked above $3,700 but the bears were active. A high was formed at $3,710 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $3,660 and $3,650 levels.\n\nA low was formed near $3,565 and the price is now consolidating losses, like Bitcoin. Ethereum is now trading below $3,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase or a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,710 swing high to the $3,565 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,640 level.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The next key resistance sits at $3,720, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,750 level. If the bulls push Ether above the $3,750 level, the price might rise and test the $3,800 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,550. The next major support is near the $3,520 zone.\n\nThe main support sits at $3,500. A clear move below the $3,500 support might push the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,550\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,650"

        "title": "Should You Buy Solana Right Now While It's Below $200? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Solana can convince investors it's the next Ethereum, it could skyrocket in value.\n\nIn 2023, Solana (SOL 0.81%) was one of the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, up an eye-popping 900%. In 2024, Solana has continued to turn in a stellar performance. At its current price of $165, Solana is up more than 60% through the first five months of the year.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Solana appears to be running into a wall right now. It is down nearly 20% since it hit an intra-year high of just over $200 in March. Should you view this as a potential buying opportunity, or as a warning sign that Solana's impressive recent gains could be coming to an end? Let's take a closer look.\n\nIs Solana the next Ethereum?\n\nThe primary reason to invest in Solana right now is that it could eventually become the next Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Solana is a direct challenger to Ethereum in the Layer 1 blockchain space, and has been steadily gaining ground in every major niche, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For nearly four years, Solana has been tagged as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and now it finally seems to be delivering on its promise.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest raved about Solana last year, calling it a faster, cheaper, and more efficient version of Ethereum. That's backed up by real numbers. Solana, for example, says it can process 50,000 transactions per second. Ethereum, by way of comparison, can only process 15 to 20 transactions per second. To achieve faster transaction processing speeds, Ethereum relies on a confusing mix of Layer 2 scaling solutions that even developers say is becoming too hard to use.\n\nSolana's secret weapon\n\nMoreover, Solana has a secret weapon that Ethereum simply cannot match: A mobile crypto strategy that is finally gaining traction with customers. Solana officially launched its new \"crypto phone\" (the Saga) last year. Early sales were weak, but a clever marketing promotion based around Solana meme coins has led to sales taking off.\n\nFrom the outset, Solana's mobile strategy was designed as a way to onboard new crypto users. The goal was to get a mobile phone into people's hands, give them plenty of apps they couldn't find anywhere else, and design new mobile experiences to make crypto easier to use. That, in turn, could result in people beating down the door to become part of the Solana blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAdmittedly, this might be a very long-term strategy. But it might just work. According to investment firm VanEck, all Solana needs is a single \"killer app\" with at least 100 million users, along the lines of a ChatGPT. If Solana can find a \"killer app\" for its mobile phone, it could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nVanEck ran the numbers and determined that, in a bull-case scenario, Solana might be worth over $3,200 by 2030. So, yes, if you buy into this analysis, you should be buying Solana while it's still below $200. At today's prices, you might be able to make a 20-fold return on your investment.\n\nThe case against Solana\n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons to be concerned about Solana. For example, the current bout of meme coin popularity taking over the Solana blockchain seems to be leading to some unsustainable performance. All of the improvement that we've been seeing in Solana's metrics -- such as new users, new unique wallets, and spikes in transaction activity -- might just be a lot of smoke and mirrors.\n\nMoreover, Solana continues to stand in Ethereum's shadow when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the end of May, the SEC granted approval for new spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading soon. If they are anywhere near as successful as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could lead to a huge influx of investor money flowing into Ethereum. That's fantastic for Ethereum holders, but it could act as a negative drag on Solana's price over the short to medium term. Money that otherwise might have gone into Solana will now be going into Ethereum.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nThat being said, I'm taking a long-term approach when it comes to Solana. As Solana steadily gains market share at the expense of Ethereum, and as it continues to build out its mobile crypto strategy, I'm highly confident that it can continue to boost its valuation. Solana is still 36% below its all-time high of $260, which could be a reasonable near-term price target.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, of course, Solana will find the one \"killer app\" that it needs. If that happens, it could skyrocket in value and achieve what many have been predicting for several years now."
