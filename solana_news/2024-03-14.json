        "content": "What Is the Ethereum Roadmap: Upgrades in 2024 and Beyond\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 The Ethereum network ensures constant progress through its roadmap, allowing it to improve the protocol while addressing new challenges and developments in crypto.\n\n\n\n\u2014 After the Merge and Shanghai upgrade, the Ethereum roadmap has been updated to make the network scalable, resilient, and more secure.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The next upgrade Ethereum will undergo is the Prague/Electra upgrade, which is not yet scheduled.\n\nAs the pioneering network for smart contracts, Ethereum has enabled an entire ecosystem to come to life. It is home to the majority of today\u2019s decentralized applications (dApps) and powers an entire sector of decentralized financial services that host tens of billions of dollars.\n\nSince its founding in 2015, Ethereum price has grown tremendously, winning the support of individuals, communities, and businesses across the globe. Still, the network has some growing to do before it can gain the acceptance of a mainstream audience.\n\nIndeed, for Ethereum to become accessible, affordable, and resilient enough to be adopted by the masses, there are several challenges that it must still overcome. And mapping out those challenges, and how the network might solve them, is precisely why the Ethereum roadmap exists.\n\nBut what exactly are the challenges facing Ethereum? And how will its planned upgrades help to prepare it for mass adoption? Let\u2019s explore what the future holds for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Roadmap For?\n\nFor all of Ethereum\u2019s success as a global coordination platform, it has some shortcomings. Most notably, the network suffers from slow transaction speeds and high fees during times of high congestion.\n\nThis is arguably Ethereum\u2019s biggest roadblock when it comes to onboarding more users. After all, if Ethereum actually reached something close to mainstream adoption in its current state, it would likely be unreasonably slow and expensive. This is, generally speaking, what people mean when they talk about the scalability of a blockchain. It\u2019s the idea that the network needs to be able to scale up and accommodate many more users while still functioning well.\n\nOf course, tackling Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges brings about what is known as the blockchain trilemma. This phrase was coined by Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and refers to the concept that, while there are three key elements in a blockchain \u2013 decentralization, scalability, and security \u2013 you can only optimize for two of them. In other words, you can have a fully decentralized and highly secure blockchain, but it won\u2019t be scalable. And so on and so on.\n\nAs a result of this, Ethereum has to remain highly adaptable as it continues to address its challenges while pursuing an optimal balance of decentralization, scalability, and security. Not to mention that, with the hyper-innovative, constantly changing nature of crypto, Ethereum has to be able to integrate new features, assets, and applications as they appear.\n\nThere needs to be a way to keep track of all the upgrades that Ethereum needs, which is why the roadmap exists. It\u2019s essentially a list of all the specific changes necessary to make the network cheaper and easier to use, more secure, and futureproof.\n\nHow Are Ethereum Upgrades Decided On?\n\nAs a decentralized network and open-source network, Ethereum is not controlled by a single entity. The upgrades proposed in the roadmap generally come from Ethereum researchers and developers, but essentially anyone can offer suggestions to upgrade the protocol.\n\nBasically, any interested person can propose a change by creating an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), which outlines the technical specifications for the proposed changes. The community of Ethereum developers and researchers then reviews, debates, and potentially implements the EIP. It\u2019s important to note that EIPs generally grow out of discussions on major Ethereum forums or the EthR&D Discord that then mature into specific ideas for improvements.\n\nAnother key point about the roadmap is that it is subject to change. The points on the roadmap can evolve as new information, ideas, and technologies become available.\n\nFor example, the roadmap previously laid out plans to scale the network through sharding, a method that involves splitting up the blockchain so subsets of validators handle only a portion of the total data. This is no longer a part of the roadmap now as danksharding, which integrates \u2018blobs\u2019 of data into Ethereum blocks, has replaced the earlier proposed sharding approach.\n\nWhat Changes Are Coming to Ethereum?\n\nScalability\n\nAs previously mentioned, scalability is a major issue for Ethereum to address. Thus, the Ethereum roadmap features several planned upgrades to that end.\n\nDanksharding\n\nDanksharding is the current plan for making Ethereum transactions much cheaper and faster and it revolves around Layer 2 solutions, specifically blockchain rollups.\n\nTo sum up, Danksharding will enable the Ethereum network to process the bundled transactions that come from layer two roll ups without having to store all of their data permanently.\n\nSingle-Slot Finality\n\nCurrently, it takes about 15 minutes for an Ethereum block to finalize. The introduction of single-slot finality (SSF) aims to make the block validation process more efficient. Under the SSF mechanism, blocks can be proposed and finalized in the same slot, significantly decreasing the time it takes to finalize a block.\n\nVerkle Trees\n\nA blend of the two concepts \u201cVector commitment\u201d and \u201cMerkle Trees,\u201d Verkle trees serve as a data structure to upgrade nodes. Notably, Verkle Trees make it possible for Ethereum to use stateless clients. These stateless clients ultimately help scalability as they only need a tiny amount of storage space to be able to verify new blocks.\n\nUser Experience\n\nAs crypto gains mainstream adoption, blockchains must offer better UX design and customer experience to appeal to the non-technical masses. This is the key to bringing the technology to more users and advancing the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nThis need for an improved user experience is partly being addressed by a group of upgrades, collectively referred to as account abstraction. This class of upgrades will support smart contracts natively on Ethereum. Currently, smart contract interactions can only happen through externally owned accounts (EOAs).\n\nAccount abstraction will bring about many exciting features natively to Ethereum, such as the ability to batch transactions together, recover your account if you lose the keys, or have someone else pay for your gas.\n\nSecurity\n\nEvery day, attackers try to find new ways to exploit the Ethereum network and its users. Ethereum is exploring the following features to provide top-notch security and keep attackers at bay.\n\nProposer-Builder Separation (PBS)\n\nPBS splits the block-building and block-proposal tasks among different validators. For each slot, block builders create blocks and present them to the block proposer, who can then choose the most profitable block without seeing its contents. The proposer also has to pay a fee to the block builder before sending the block to its peers. This arrangement prevents transaction censorship, establishes a fairer consensus mechanism, and facilitates the Danksharding upgrade.\n\nClever Cryptography\n\nThe proof-of-stake (PoS) based consensus mechanism currently makes the list of upcoming block proposers public, making it possible to map their IP addresses. This makes them vulnerable to attacks such as a DOS attack. Clever cryptography here makes sure the identity of the current block proposer is not made public and protects them.\n\nWhere are we on the Ethereum Roadmap so far?\n\nOver the last nine years, Ethereum has gone through several upgrades to enhance its network, with the last two major upgrades being the Merge and Shanghai.\n\nWhat Was the Merge?\n\nActivated on Sept. 15, 2022, the Merge was a way to complete Ethereum\u2019s shift from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators are randomly selected based on the total amount and duration of their ETH staking.\n\nIn December 2020, developers launched the Beacon Chain as a basic PoS-based version running parallel to the regular Ethereum mainnet. They used it to test reconfigurations and new features safely.\n\nJust under two years later in September 2022, the integration of both the Beacon Chain and the mainnet marked Ethereum\u2019s official adoption of the PoS consensus mechanism across its ecosystem.\n\nWhat was the Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nAfter the Merge, the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade, was a major step in finalizing Ethereum\u2019s move from PoW to PoS. While this planned hard fork of the protocol opened the door to new developments, it also unlocked the ability to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nUp until the Shanghai upgrade, those who staked their ETH on the Beacon Chain were unable to withdraw their locked-up ETH and the rewards earned in the process. However, following the Shanghai upgrade on April 12, 2023, validators could finally access their ETH holdings and cash out their rewards.\n\nWhat was the Dencun Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade, one of the major upgrades, went live on March 13th. It\u2019s designed to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and enhance data availability on Ethereum. Notably, this upgrade introduces \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d, the first step to scaling the network through danksharding.\n\nProto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, introduced data \u201cblobs\u201d\u2014an acronym for \u2018Binary Large Objects.\u2019 These data blobs can be sent and attached to blocks, aiming to minimize the data stored permanently on Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, layer-2 scaling solution rollups post their transactions in CALLDATA, which is costly because their data remains on the chain indefinitely. In contrast, the data in blobs are automatically deleted after a fixed period, reducing data storage costs and thus lowering transaction fees for users.\n\nWhat\u2019s next on the Ethereum Roadmap?\n\nNow, the Ethereum network is preparing for more upgrades to advance its capabilities. Here\u2019s what\u2019s next in line for the blockchain:\n\nPrague/Electra Upgrade\n\nOnce implemented, the Dencun upgrade will allow developers to focus on the next update, the Prague/Electra upgrade (Pralectra). Interestingly, there is still a debate among core Ethereum devs about what Pralectra will entail.\n\nOn one hand, it could look like several smaller EIPs focused on adding new features to the network. For example, one of the major proposals for this upgrade is EIP-6110, which would improve Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nOtherwise, Pralectra could end up being a major protocol upgrade that would add Verkle Trees to the blockchain\u2019s execution layer. As previously mentioned, Verkle Trees are an important milestone in the overall Ethereum roadmap, important for increasing its scalability.\n\nWhile the specific items that Prague/Electra will center on are still being decided, this upgrade will undoubtedly make further improvements to the network\u2019s performance, security, and usability.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nOver the past decade, cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary answer to the traditional financial world by offering a decentralized, permissionless, and secure alternative to traditional banking systems. In the same spirit, Ethereum has brought forth a wave of innovation in global decentralization. With its advanced technology, growing ecosystem, and constant evolution, the future of the pioneering smart contract chain is bright indeed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a future that you can be a part of! By getting yourself a Ledger Ethereum wallet, you unlock all that the Ethereum ecosystem has to offer, all while enjoying the power and security of self-custody.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Take your place at the forefront of the Ethereum evolution and explore the bleeding edge of innovation in the decentralized world."

        "content": "Some Ethereum layer 2 networks have seen their median transaction fees decline by as much as 99% after the Dencun upgrade went live. These are some of the biggest winners.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade\n\nThe much anticipated Dencun upgrade has led to a significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum layer 2 networks, with the effects of the immediate scalability already taking shape across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live early on Wednesday after it activated on the Ethereum mainnet at epoch height 269568. The upgrade introduced the highly anticipated proto-danksharding functionality via EIP-4844, which integrates off-chain \u201cdata-blobs\u201d that decrease the costs associated with storing transaction data.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks, which are designed to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing transactions on the underlying blockchain, were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade. Data from a Dune dashboard created by \u201c@Marcov\u201d shows that popular layer 2 networks such as Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Zora and zksync have seen massive declines in their average transaction fees.\n\nAt the time of writing, median transaction fees had dropped to $0.05 on Optimism, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. So far, Optimism and chains based on Optimism\u2019s tech stack such as Base, have seen the biggest reductions in fees.\n\nWe love to see it. OP Chains have the most affordable decentralized L2 transaction fees after 4844, bringing us that much closer to the reality of seamless end-user experiences. \u2728In Blobs We Trust\u2728 pic.twitter.com/WOovhcZelk \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 14, 2024\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nStarknet, another Ethereum Layer 2 solution, posted a screenshot of the change in its transaction fees on X showing that a single gas transaction had declined 99% since the Dencun upgrade synchronized.\n\n\u201cDencun is both the most complex fork we\u2019ve shipped since the Merge, and tied for \u2018most total EIPs in a fork\u2019 with Byzantium.

        "content": "The internet turned 35 earlier this week, and it seems only fitting that Ethereum would undergo arguably its largest upgrade ever just one day later.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork went off mostly without a hitch on Wednesday. Its arrival delivered a bevy of nine improvement proposals, with the blob-centric EIP-4844 being by far the most memeable.\n\nFor more than a decade after Tim Bernes-Lee (himself a dabbler in NFTs) first conceived the World Wide Web, internet users languished inside a slow, cumbersome internet plagued by bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\nDial-up modems could only handle up to about 50 kilobytes per second. The platforms we now take for granted \u2014 YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and TikTok \u2014 were as unfeasible back then as high-frequency trading on many layer-1 DEXs are today.\n\nThe arrival of broadband in the early 2000s immediately 10x\u2019d consumer-grade internet to 512 kb/sec. Impossible ideas could now be realized into billion-dollar dot-com powerhouses, radically overhauling the dynamics of our culture and turning us all terminally online.\n\nNow, two decades later, TV is all but dead, replaced by a gamut of streaming services. AR headsets backed by hyper-fast wireless blend our physical worlds with the same digital space that Bernes-Lee laid out in his 1989 paper outlining the web.\n\nWhat broadband did for the internet, blobs are now doing for Ethereum.\n\nBlobs give the raft of layer-2s their own space through which to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet without clogging up the blockspace intended for other users.\n\nThey have their own fee market, which means regular folk and their protocols of choice won\u2019t have to compete with rollups and sidechains for blockspace \u2014 leading to lower fees for all involved.\n\nDencun and its blobs have already massively reduced fees for the layer-2s that have adopted the new rules. For example, Optimism and Base fees are down to a fraction of an American penny per transaction compared to nearly $1 before the fork.\n\nYouTube debuted in 2005, a half-decade after the rollout of the first consumer-grade broadband services. Justin.tv, the precursor to Twitch, came two years later.\n\nIt could be that layer-2 fees rise over time as more layer-2s compete for blobspace. The true impact of Ethereum\u2019s successful push toward a cohesive and holistic multi-chain ecosystem, powered by \u201cblobband,\u201d probably won\u2019t be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the groundwork has now been laid. Welcome to Ethereum\u2019s blobband era.\n\n\u2014 David Canellis\n\nData Digest\n\n\ud83d\ude43 Solana has flipped Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum for total value locked (TVL) to become the fourth largest DeFi ecosystem \u2014 a first since November 2021.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a A quarter of a billion dollars was liquidated on centralized exchanges over the past 24 hours, 60% longs.\n\n\ud83e\udd2a Memecoin mania puts Solana number-one for DEX volume over the past day \u2014 $1.45 billion to BSC\u2019s $1.14 billion\n\n\ud83d\ude34 All quiet on the crypto front as BTC hovers around $73,000 as ETH sits just below $4,000.\n\n\u270bNo budge in the benchmarks: S&P and the Dow were flat during the pre-market trade. That\u2019s no surprise, considering the VIX\u2019s drop to 14 from its long-term average of 20.\n\n\u2705 Good news: A bull market with a high VIX tends to spell \u201cbubble trouble\u201d \u2014 so lower volatility with higher prices may be a boon for traders.\n\nIs the SEC in the crypto market\u2019s rear-view mirror?\n\nThe crypto pump is upon us.\n\nSOL is up 18% this week and almost 50% over the month. Binance\u2019s BNB and Filecoin are each up more than 80% over the past 30 days. Wormhole\u2019s Portal Bridge has facilitated more than $113 million in transfers from Ethereum to alt chains like Solana, Sui, and Arbitrum over the past week.\n\nHas the market forgotten that in the eyes of the SEC, they are all securities? Probably. Or maybe traders are just confident that Coinbase and Binance will emerge victorious in their legal battles with the regulator.\n\nIn June 2023, the SEC filed back-to-back lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities, among other things. The regulator named 13 cryptocurrencies available on Coinbase and ten that trade on Binance securities \u2014 despite none of these issuers being named co-defendants in the cases.\n\nThe SEC has also not filed any individual lawsuits against these alleged security token issuers, opting to take a different approach than it did in 2020 when it sued Ripple over its XRP token \u2014 a suit that ultimately did not play out in the regulator\u2019s favor.\n\nBoth cases are still playing out in the legal system, and you might remember the SEC was notably absent from the Department of Justice\u2019s historic $4.3 billion settlement with Binance back in November.\n\nBut if you look at token prices, you\u2019d think the SEC had dropped the cases.\n\nCoinbase and Binance are both waiting for rulings in their motions to dismiss their respective cases. If the suits are not fully dismissed, the exchanges will move on to the discovery process.\n\n\u2014 Casey Wagner\n\nCan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop?\n\nAfter offering an oversubscribed round where MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised nearly $800 million in senior convertible notes \u2014 mind you, they initially sought to raise $600 million before upsizing to $700 million last week \u2014 the company has proposed another $500 million in convertible notes.\n\nMSTR could, all-in-all, raise around $1.3 billion from its convertible notes offerings to fund its bitcoin purchases.\n\nWhile this represents a new approach to the same tactic we\u2019ve seen from MSTR in the past, Michael Saylor\u2019s firm might have found a way to ensure that the stock remains more attractive than the bevy of bitcoin ETFs on the market today.\n\nBy the numbers: MSTR has about $48 million in cash on hand as of December, but it has roughly $15 billion worth of bitcoin at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to note that while the company may spend that cash on hand, MicroStrategy appears to largely plan to add to its BTC hoard. The stock was around before the bitcoin ETFs, and so far, it looks like it won\u2019t only stick around, but may even outperform.\n\nCompare IBIT and MSTR, for example.

        "content": "Validators are the fundamental building blocks of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocols like Ethereum. They maintain the history of the chain and run the consensus protocol that makes it possible to implement complex decentralized applications\u2014from decentralized finance applications to NFT collectibles. To join the protocol, validators provide assets as collateral, which ensures they behave correctly in driving consensus. Unfortunately, because the protocol doesn\u2019t distinguish between malicious validators and honest mistakes, operational mistakes and bugs in validator client software have and continue to put assets at risk. This results in small economic penalties in the best case scenario and total loss of funds in the worst case.\n\nIn this post, we describe the high-level architecture of a secure key management platform designed to protect Ethereum validator operators from insider threats, validator compromise, operational mistakes, and client bugs. We cover the following topics:\n\nThe challenges of running Ethereum validators and the associated security and slashing risks.\n\nThe idea of tackling these challenges using a remote key management solution and the underlying goals a key manager must be built around to meaningfully reduce risk.\n\nThe high-level design of Cubist\u2019s CubeSigner, a secure key management platform built on top of AWS Nitro Enclaves. CubeSigner supports staking and other applications, from end-user wallets to trading to key management for teams and operations.\n\nOperational traps and pitfalls when running Ethereum validators\n\nThe Ethereum PoS protocol is a consensus protocol run across hundreds of thousands of validators. Every few seconds, validators run Ethereum transactions and, if the results of running these transactions agree with state changes proposed by a randomly chosen validator, they add these transactions to the blockchain and attest to this by signing validation messages. To incentivize validators to honestly report the state of the chain, the protocol requires them to put 32 ETH at stake. If validators behave as expected, (for example, by not manipulating transactions or lying about the state of the chain), they earn a reward on their staked assets. If they don\u2019t, they lose some of this stake.\n\nIf validators are caught manipulating the state of the chain, they are penalized for putting the network\u2019s safety at risk through slashing. Getting slashed means losing a significant amount of stake and being ejected from the protocol. To a lesser degree, validators are also punished if they go offline or sign very slowly, because this puts the protocol\u2019s availability at risk.\n\nUnfortunately, validator mistakes are indistinguishable from malicious behavior. If a validator provides two conflicting reports on the state of the blockchain, it\u2019s impossible to tell if the conflict resulted from intentional misbehavior or a bug in the validator software. As a result, operators who make security, correctness, or performance mistakes can suffer direct financial loss due to slashing. There are serious challenges in preventing each kind of mistake:\n\nSecurity \u2013 A single validator staking key typically protects 32 ETH (at the time of writing, roughly $80,000 USD). However, these valuable validator staking keys can\u2019t be kept in cold storage because they must sign validation messages every few minutes. As a consequence, node operators have to protect hot keys from system breaches. This is especially hard considering the complex environment of open source validator clients, the operational requirements to keep nodes alive 24/7, and the potential of insider threat vectors like rogue operators and social engineering. Our goal \u2013 Create a key manager that prevents attackers or malicious insiders from stealing or misusing secret signing keys.\n\n\u2013 A single validator staking key typically protects 32 ETH (at the time of writing, roughly $80,000 USD).

Correctness \u2013 Validators that sign two different, conflicting messages are deemed dishonest and are slashed, even if the conflicting signatures were a genuine mistake. In the past, honest operators have been slashed because of buggy validator client software, errors migrating validators across machines, and mistakes updating validator software.

Availability \u2013 Validators that don\u2019t sign or sign too slowly (for example, don\u2019t respond with the 12-second slot time) get reduced financial rewards or don\u2019t get paid at all. As a result, node operators design their solutions to be highly available and reliable, and to respond with low latency (typically setting an upper bound of 500 milliseconds for signing). Our goal \u2013 Create a key manager that helps operators achieve these latency, reliability, and availability goals.\n\n\u2013 Validators that don\u2019t sign or sign too slowly (for example, don\u2019t respond with the 12-second slot time) get reduced financial rewards or don\u2019t get paid at all. As a result, node operators design their solutions to be highly available and reliable, and to respond with low latency (typically setting an upper bound of 500 milliseconds for signing).\n\nRemote signing reduces risk due to bugs and operational mistakes\n\nTo participate in the Ethereum PoS Beacon chain, node operators use a validator client like Lighthouse or Prysm. The validator client contains any number of validator key pairs. Each pair corresponds to a validator: the public key is the validator\u2019s identity, and the secret key is what the validator client uses to sign messages on behalf of the validator. The validator client then broadcasts these signed messages to the Beacon chain network, essentially asserting the validator\u2019s view of the state of the chain.\n\nValidator clients can store validator keys on their machines and sign locally, or they can use a remote signer. A remote signer stores keys remotely and exposes a signing API to the validator client. At each epoch, the validator client makes a signing request to the remote signer, and the signer sends back a signed validation message. Although network latency makes remote signing slower than local signing due to the additional network round trip, operators use remote signers for many reasons, including:\n\nSecurity \u2013 By using a remote signer, the validator keys can be isolated from: The validator client \u2013 This interfaces with the untrusted world\u2014other Beacon chain nodes\u2014and runs untrusted Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. Insider threats \u2013 These include the operators keeping the nodes up and running, who don\u2019t need access to the validator secret keys to do their jobs.\n\n\u2013 By using a remote signer, the validator keys can be isolated from: Correctness \u2013 Using a remote signer makes it possible to implement a reference monitor\u2014by coupling the signer with an anti-slashing database\u2014that ensures that a key never signs messages that could result in slashing\n\n\u2013 Using a remote signer makes it possible to implement a reference monitor\u2014by coupling the signer with an anti-slashing database\u2014that ensures that a key never signs messages that could result in slashing Availability \u2013 Using a remote signer that handles all validator keys makes it possible for node operators to automatically scale the validator clients and spin up new ones when they crash\n\nThe remote signer must be designed with these properties in mind\u2014simply using an off-the-shelf signer like Web3Signer doesn\u2019t give you these properties. For example, the remote signer must restrict who has access to keys\u2014this means restricting access to only authorized users (and validator clients) and sealing the keys to the signer itself\u2014and what they can do with the keys. Otherwise, a breach or insider threat can turn into key theft. The remote signer must itself be highly available and fault-tolerant, and it must use a global, highly available, anti-slashing database; otherwise, signer or OS updates, machine failures, or network interruptions could result in slashing events. Finally, although the remote signer doesn\u2019t need to be as fast as local (unsafe) signing, the latency of the remote signer does matter: if it\u2019s too slow (typically anything over a second), the validator will be late signing messages and lose the operator money.\n\nIn the following sections, we explain in detail how we achieved the goal of security, correctness, and availability by implementing our Nitro Enclaves-based CubeSigner remote signing solution.\n\nCubist CubeSigner \u2013 Architecture overview\n\nTo address the correctness, security, and performance and reliability challenges from the previous section, we built CubeSigner, a new remote signing service that builds on AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Amazon DynamoDB, and Nitro Enclaves.\n\nAt a high level, to process a validation message from a validator client, the signer completes the following steps:\n\nAccept the validation message via an HTTP interface based on Amazon API Gateway. Checks if that message is slashable using a signing history stored in DynamoDB. Signs the message\u2014as long as it\u2019s non-slashable\u2014using keys secured by AWS KMS and Nitro Enclaves.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nIn the following sections, we walk through these three steps in detail.\n\nAuthenticated, high-level signing API\n\nThe signer needs to expose an API that validator clients like Lighthouse and Prysm can use out of the box. Unlike the AWS KMS API, which exposes a simple but low-level signing endpoint, this API must handle high-level validator messages specific to the Ethereum Beacon chain. This high-level API is essential because it can enforce an anti-slashing policy on validator messages based on their contents. If the API instead ingested and signed raw hashes of messages, it would have no way to determine whether a given message was slashable.\n\nIn addition to preventing slashing, this high-level API also needs to ensure that validation requests are from authenticated validator clients\u2014otherwise, compromising a single client would mean compromising all validator clients and all keys. CubeSigner goes a step further, using authentication with fine-grained scopes. A scope restricts an authenticated session so that it can only perform certain actions (for example, validation). By only giving validator clients the validation scope, node operators can prevent those validators from, for example, signing exit messages and exiting the validation protocol. This stops operators from accidentally exiting their validators, and protects them from attackers trying to exit on their behalf (costing rewards).\n\nCubeSigner uses API Gateway with AWS Lambda authorizers to implement a custom authorization scheme that determines the caller\u2019s identity. Each authorized signing request is then sent to CubeSigner\u2019s Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, which first check that the authorized scopes allow the request. Then, the signer computes the message signing root hash, applies the anti-slashing policy to ensure that signing the message (hash) won\u2019t result in a slashable offense, and signs it, returning the signature back to the validator client. Next, we discuss anti-slashing and signing itself.\n\nAnti-slashing\n\nCubeSigner implements anti-slashing in the second tier\u2014the policy engine. After authorizing a signing request, CubeSigner applies several policies, including built-in anti-slashing for Ethereum. The anti-slashing policy follows EIP-3076 and ensures that a validator never signs messages that would disagree with the chain history that the validator has already committed to, which means that the policy requires a saving state. CubeSigner enforces this policy using DynamoDB as its database. It atomically and conditionally records the messages it signs for every validator key, ensuring, for example, that the signer only produces a single signature for any particular slot number.\n\nDynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools. Availability and consistent performance are particularly critical when running blockchain validators because downtime, latencies, or data inconsistencies can directly result in financial losses. Given these requirements, DynamoDB is well suited because of its consistent single-digit millisecond performance and up to 99.999% availability. For additional information on DynamoDB performance, costs, and scalability features, refer to Amazon DynamoDB features.\n\nSafe signing\n\nThe third tier is the low-level signer itself\u2014the CubeSigner virtual hardware security module (vHSM). This tier builds on AWS KMS to sign validation messages in HSMs, where keys are safe from attackers.\n\nHSMs and AWS KMS\n\nIn security-sensitive business areas such as banking or domain certificate management, it\u2019s common to outsource key management-related tasks (for example, key storage or signing) to HSMs. HSMs consist of purpose-built hardware that ties cryptographic secrets to physical hardware, which makes them very tough to steal. Key extractions attacks on standard HSMs, for example, require a laboratory with an electron microscope\u2014otherwise, the HSM self-destruct circuit triggers, because it detects someone trying to steal keying material.\n\nUsing HSMs on their own is relatively difficult, however. Accessing them from within applications written in high-level languages typically requires a vendor-specific SDK, and the application itself needs to adhere to the PKCS11 API standard. AWS provides an accessible, HSM-based key management service called AWS KMS. AWS KMS is a fully managed service that lets you create and control cryptographic keys protected by HSMs classified at the FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3. Furthermore, it is accessible via the standard AWS SDK (for example, aws-sdk-kms for Rust).\n\nWhy not use AWS KMS on its own\n\nUsing AWS KMS alone is not enough to build a secure key manager for validators. The first problem is mechanical: Ethereum validators must sign using the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme, but HSMs don\u2019t yet support BLS because of regulatory challenges aligning with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). HSMs primarily focus on providing cryptographic signature schemes that are more ubiquitous outside the blockchain industry, namely RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Extending support for newer signature schemes usually requires low-level firmware upgrades of the HSM itself.\n\nEven if HSMs could produce BLS signatures, we would encounter a second set of problems: latency and throughput. Ethereum node operators run hundreds to thousands of validators, all of which must sign in under roughly a second (accounting for the actual cryptographic operation and network round trip). Most HSMs aren\u2019t optimized for batching public key cryptography operations (for example, the compound latencies in KMS for sending 100s of ECDSA signing operations would exceed the one second limit). Furthermore, HSMs are typically throughput limited (per default, AWS KMS can process 300 elliptic curve asymmetric operations per second). By combining AWS KMS HSMs with Nitro Enclaves, you can implement a vHSM that overcomes these problems while preserving security guarantees.\n\nNitro Enclaves are separate, hardened, and highly constrained virtual machines. The AWS Nitro System, which is a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor, provides features such as strong isolation, hardware generated entropy via the Nitro Security Module, and cryptographic attestation\u2014allowing you to verify the enclave\u2019s identity and that only authorized code is running in the enclave.\n\nHow CubeSigner uses Nitro Enclaves with AWS KMS\n\nThe CubeSigner vHSM implements core signature schemes like BLS in software and runs this code in Nitro Enclaves. This lets it support arbitrary signature schemes and sign orders of magnitude faster than an HSM.\n\nThe vHSM encrypts all signing keys using an AWS KMS-based key wrapping key; whenever it gets a request to sign a transaction, it pulls the encrypted signing key and the key wrapping key into the enclave, decrypts the signing key, signs the transaction, and returns it to the user. Signing in the vHSM is fast enough for validating without penalty (for example, is well under the 500ms target even accounting for network latency). This is because:\n\nSigning a message requires a single signing key decryption, and HSMs are well-optimized for symmetric cryptographic operations. AWS KMS, for example, by default runs up to 50,000 combined symmetric encrypt/decrypt operations per second.\n\nNitro Enclaves can do asymmetric cryptographic operations (for example, produce the signature) at native speeds.\n\nCubeSigner stores all encrypted signing keys\u2014in our example, BLS validator keys, but in general keys for any signature scheme\u2014in DynamoDB. This allows us to replicate keys, back up keys, and use DynamoDB for scale and performance.\n\nThe key wrapping keys are stored and managed using AWS KMS, with one key wrapping key per node operator. This key is sealed to the vHSM in the enclave and made inaccessible to the AWS root user, which means that no one can use or extract the key wrapping key. Sealing a KMS key to an enclave is an extremely powerful primitive. It guarantees that the vHSM is the only component that can decrypt the operator\u2019s signing keys, which makes it possible for us to implement hardware abstractions like the HSM in software.\n\nBecause only the code in the enclave can access secret keys, keeping keys safe reduces to keeping enclave code safe. To this end, that code is has the following features:\n\nWritten in Rust \u2013 We wrote the singer in Rust because it gives us low-level control over how the code handles secrets, so we can avoid leaking secrets in memory or through side channels. Rust also makes it straightforward to use verification techniques for proving the safety of the code running in the enclave.\n\n\u2013 We wrote the singer in Rust because it gives us low-level control over how the code handles secrets, so we can avoid leaking secrets in memory or through side channels.

Confined \u2013 The only outbound channel from the vHSM is to AWS KMS, following a secure communication flow. For more information, refer to How AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS. Even here, however, the signer assumes that the channel may be compromised and uses the ephemeral private and public key associated with the particular enclave to encrypt the AWS KMS result with the public key stored in the attestation document. This way, the AWS KMS result can only be decrypted and read inside the enclave where the AWS KMS decrypt call originated in the first place.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we covered the operational traps and pitfalls of running Ethereum validator nodes and, in particular, the security, correctness, and availability challenges node operators have to balance daily. Remote signing, in contrast to managing keys locally on the node, can address these challenges\u2014but the design of the remote signer matters. To this end, we detailed the design of CubeSigner, a remote signing solution based on Nitro Enclaves, and showed how CubeSigner not only addresses the security and correctness (slashing) challenges operators face, but also how it makes it straightforward to eliminate operational costs and run highly available validator clusters.\n\nWe encourage you to sign up for a Cubist CubeSigner sandbox account, start up your Ethereum validator using an AWS Blockchain Node Runners template, and run your own Ethereum validator node.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nFraser Brown is a co-founder and the CTO of Cubist.

        "content": "While Ethereum developers inch closer to shipping Dencun, some experts are unconvinced the upgrade will deliver on its promises.\n\nDays before Dencun is scheduled to deploy on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, two industry veterans offered differing opinions regarding the impact of this much-anticipated upgrade amid skyrocketing Ether (ETH) prices.\n\nThe hype and crypto market euphoria pushed ETH to another two-year high, as the crypto crossed $4,000 for the first time since late 2021, at the peak of the previous bull cycle.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum hits $4k amid bullish surge, market awaits Dencun upgrade boost\n\nCore DAO, Wormhole experts on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade\n\nEthereum developers have said that Dencun will implement expanded data availability for layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, allowing for improved transaction capacity at lower gas fees.\n\nCore DAO initial contributor Rich Rines said in a statement received by crypto.news that the focus on Ethereum L2 may harbor unexpected issues around liquidity and on-chain fragmentation.\n\nWhile this should enable higher TPS on the network as a whole, questions remain whether this is a long-term fix. Over-reliance on Layer 2s could lead to fractured ecosystems and liquidity, as activity trends away from the base layer. Additionally, Layer 2s may involve more trust assumptions and can have sub-optimal influence on the base layer if transactions and fees are increasingly taken off the base chain. Rich Rines, Core DAO initial contributor\n\nRines noted that observers must closely monitor Dencun\u2019s progress after deployment, which is expected by March 13 barring unforeseen delays. The Core DAO contributor also said questions may arise about whether the upgrade\u2019s objective was the correct goal in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO Robinson Burkey views Dencun optimistically and expects the upgrade to herald a massive increase in cross-chain asset transfers.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is undeniably a positive development for the crypto space. This upgrade will really enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and security, which bodes well for defi and overall interoperability. This will result in cheaper and easier asset movement and more affordable transactions on Ethereum. Robinson Burkey, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO,\n\nBurkey opined that the Dencun upgrade will bolster defi usage, accessibility, and dynamism as cheaper fees should incentivize greater on-chain participation in crypto\u2019s largest decentralized ecosystem."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpland, a crypto game built around real-world locations, announced Friday that it has launched the first wave of its \"Share and Build\" airdrop series. It's aimed at rewarding community members and newcomers alike for engaging with the Upland platform before its Ethereum token goes live.\n\nThe first chapter will let users earn Sparklet tokens\u2014Upland's existing in-game utility token used to construct buildings and create content\u2014through social media activities and in-app missions over a three-week period.\n\nUsers can connect their Twitter (aka X) accounts and earn points by engaging with Upland and Sparklet content on the social media platform. Those points will then be converted to Sparklet tokens within the Upland game. The Twitter-centric airdrop farming campaign recalls similar pushes around the Portal and BlockGames tokens.\n\nLast November, the EOS-based Upland announced that it planned to launch an Ethereum token that\u2019s tied to its in-game Sparklet token. That whitepaper describing Upland\u2019s plans was put to a community vote, with 87% of users voting in approval of the proposal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe token tradability event (TTE) will follow the airdrop campaign, letting users convert their in-game Sparklet currency into a tradeable Ethereum token.\n\n\"We're excited to launch the 'Share and Build' airdrop series as we are getting ready for the Sparklet event. This initiative aligns perfectly with our vision of fostering a thriving Web3 ecosystem and rewarding passionate players,\" said Dirk Lueth, co-founder and co-CEO of Upland, in a release.\n\nThis first wave of the airdrop campaign offers 10 different reward levels, with users' engagement levels and social stats on Twitter determining their point multipliers. Users of select, as-yet-unrevealed Upland partners will also receive \"point boosts\" to help them earn more.\n\nAdditionally, by completing each forthcoming airdrop chapter, participants will be rewarded a distinct Block Explorer NFT that serves as a game piece within Upland. Collecting five such rewards unlocks an exclusive NFT for use within the Upland game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpland began life in 2019 as a property-trading game, with digital versions of real life properties tokenized and sold within the game. It has since expanded into a more robust metaverse experience with vehicles, events, and other gameplay opportunities. Upland raised $7 million in a Series A extension round last November.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI. Edited and fact-checked by Andrew Hayward."

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low ETH Can Go if $3.5K Fails to Hold Selling Pressure (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently breached a significant resistance level, crossing the psychological milestone of $4K and achieving a new high for the year.\n\nHowever, this breakthrough was met with resistance, leading to a noticeable correction. The question that arises now is whether this correction is merely a temporary setback or the beginning of a broader reversal in the bullish trend.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, evident in a strong and sudden upward surge that surpassed the critical resistance at $4K. This surge reflects heightened interest from market participants in Ethereum, resulting in increased volatility.\n\nHowever, after briefly surpassing the crucial $4K resistance level, the price encountered intensified selling pressure, likely due to profit-taking among participants, leading to a significant decline toward the substantial support zone of around $3.5K. It seems likely that the market will find support in this region and initiate a fresh rally.\n\nHowever, in the event of a continued corrective retracement, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to find support around key levels within the Fibonacci retracement, specifically between the 0.5 ($3,181) and 0.618 ($2,966) levels.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nFurther examination of the 4-hour chart confirms the presence of buyers in the Ethereum market, propelling the price to its highest level since April 2022. This surge, accompanied by increased market volatility, demonstrates significant buying interest aimed at surpassing the previous all-time high of $4.8K.\n\nHowever, following the breakthrough above the critical $4K resistance level, the price faced rejection, leading to a sharp decline aiming for the key support zones around $3.5K and $3.3K. Additionally, an expanding bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a notable market correction.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that healthy bullish markets often experience periods of consolidation correction, allowing the asset to rest and rebuild demand. Therefore, it seems likely that the price will find support in the medium term, continuing its overall upward trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has surged rapidly in recent weeks, briefly surpassing its previous all-time high of $4,000. This surge has attracted numerous speculators to the market, driving up buying pressure and instilling confidence among investors.\n\nThe accompanying chart illustrates the open interest, a valuable metric for assessing sentiment in the futures market. Open interest quantifies the number of outstanding perpetual futures contracts across various crypto exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the open interest has soared alongside the recent bullish trend, reaching unprecedented levels. This surge indicates the intensity of both long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, resulting in an overheated environment.\n\nWhile elevated open interest is typical in a robust bull market, it can also contribute to heightened volatility and unexpected market corrections. As such, it\u2019s prudent for investors to carefully manage their risk in the short term."

        "content": "Following the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has encountered significant selling pressure. As of the latest update, the Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 7.8%, trading at $3,669 with a market capitalization of nearly $450 billion. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has surged by 45% to $32.29 billion\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Levels to Watch Ahead\n\nThe Ethereum price faced resistance at the $4,000 level and initiated a downward correction, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s movement. ETH dipped below crucial support levels at $3,920 and $3,850, signaling a short-term bearish trend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt briefly dropped below the $3,680 support area, reaching a low of $3,625 before consolidating losses. Currently, a significant bearish trend line is forming with resistance around $3,850. The primary resistance levels are near $3,850 and the trend line, close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent swing high at $4,083 to the low of $3,625.\n\nIf the Ethereum (ETH) price surpasses the $3,880 resistance, it may regain bullish momentum, aiming for the $4,000 level. Conversely, failure to break above $3,850 could lead to further downside movement. Initial support is at $3,680, followed by a major support zone near $3,600, with a potential downside target at $3,500. A decisive break below $3,500 might trigger a decline toward $3,350.\n\nPopular crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto explained that the range of $3600-$3700 for Ethereum is likely to attract significant buying interest in the short term.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic uncovered a substantial transaction involving $12 million worth of Ether by the Lazarus Group. This transfer was facilitated through Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer. Despite being subject to sanctions, the North Korean hacker organization has resumed its use of this platform.\n\nThe funds are traced back to a cyber-attack on HTX and the Heco Bridge in November, orchestrated by the Lazarus group. This attack resulted in significant losses amounting to $100 million for the affected platforms.\n\nETH Gas Fee Drops Under $10\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain data provider, the current scenario of Ethereum surpassing a $4,000 market value differs from October and November 2021. Today, the network\u2019s transaction costs are significantly lower, standing at less than 1/6th of the previous levels. With gas fees averaging $9.35, this improvement can be attributed in part to the enhancements in network fees following the transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "The recently launched Dencun upgrade live up to expectations as Ethereum L2 networks, like Optimism and Base, record massive plunge in transaction fees.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Dencun upgrade, Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions on Ethereum have recorded a significant decrease in their average transaction fees.\n\nDencun Upgrade Rolls Out\n\nRecall that the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade went live on the Ethereum mainnet yesterday, March 13, at precisely 13:55 (UTC).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDencun, which represents the most significant upgrade on Ethereum since the \u201cMerge,\u201d introduced a mechanism to reduce transaction costs on L2 networks.\n\nWith Dencun implemented on the Ethereum mainnet, L2 networks found a new way to store data, dubbed Binary Large Objects (blobs).\n\nThe blob feature allows L2 networks to store data off-chain, which becomes inaccessible after three weeks, rather than the expensive \u201ccall data\u201d solution that stores data permanently.\n\nL2 Networks Transaction Fees Drop\n\nSince the Dencun upgrade went live yesterday, it has been living up to expectations as top L2 networks, like Base, Optimism, and zkSync, have seen a sharp drop in their transaction fees.\n\nRecent data from Marcov\u2019s Dune-based tracker highlight the significant drop in transaction fees across major Ethereum-based L2 networks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor instance, the average transaction fee on Optimism, which stood at around $2.44 an hour before Dencun launched, has plunged to $0.068 at press time. Similarly, the average cost of transaction on Coinbase\u2019s Layer-2 Base has also plummeted to $0.196 from $1.212 within the same timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, zkSync\u2019s average fee has dropped to $0.162 from a daily high of $0.546, while Zora network\u2019s transaction cost also fell from $0.752 to $0.003.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the reduced transaction fee trend is dominant across L2 networks that have implemented blobs.\n\nThe average transaction costs on L2 networks that are yet to implement the upgrade have remained the same. For instance, Arbitrum falls within this category, as its average transaction cost has fluctuated between $0.65 to $0.84 over the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the high fee on Arbitrum would soon be a thing of the past, as the team behind the network plans to integrate with Dencun improvements today.\n\nBlobs are finally on Ethereum, here's an update on Arbitrum support! 1\u20e3 Tomorrow, all Arbitrum rollup chains can start to see lower fees as a result of Dencun x ArbOS Atlas upgrade. 2\u20e3 March 18th there will be additional fee reductions for Arbitrum One, as per ArbOS Atlas. \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024"

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction threatens a major tailspin after the successful mainnet launch of the Dencun Upgrade. The second-largest cryptocurrency briefly climbed to $4,087, testing its recent highs ($4,087) on Wednesday before sliding below the previous day\u2019s open of $4,008.\n\nTrading at $3,955 on Wednesday, ETH price has sustained a 2.5% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is down 20% in the same period, hinting at declining interest among traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith a market cap of $477 billion, Ethereum comfortably sits in the second position below Bitcoin\u2019s $1.4 trillion cap.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What\u2019s Next After Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum finalized the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet following three successful testnet launches. The landmark upgrade goes beyond introducing new features, it stands out for reducing fees on layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum \u2014 and is expected to spur growth.\n\nAs reported, \u201cblobs\u201d another key feature of the upgrade, brings to life a new locale to store data on the blockchain. This special space is isolated from standard transactions, attracting lower costs.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, is the biggest protocol improvement in a year, with Ethereum expected to significantly change the scaling landscape where layer 2 protocols will benefit the most.\n\nLayer 2 networks are preparing to incorporate \u201cblobs\u201d in their operations \u2014 a move likely to spark a pricing war. Arbitrum announced on X that it was ready to jump on the new data storage space in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe blobs have arrived on Ethereum! \ud83d\udc21 The Dencun upgrade has successfully launched on Ethereum mainnet making it one of the biggest upgrades to support Layer 2\u2019s in scaling Ethereum. Now with the Ethereum mainnet upgrade complete, we expect the ArbOS Atlas upgrade to be\u2026 \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024\n\nContrary to expectations, the Dencun upgrade was not a significant market mover. If anything, sell-side pressure quickly erased the move to the recent highs around $4,093.\n\nBased on the four-hour chart, Ethereum price has flipped below the important $4,000 level as well as the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nA neutral and downward-slopping Relative Strength Index (RSI) backs the correction as ETH searches for fresh liquidity.\n\nSeveral four-hour candle closes below $4,000 might accelerate the pullback. With the next major support at the 50-day EMA, investors should prepare for instability below $3,900.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on the retracement to maximize returns in the bull market, there is no need to fret as Ethereum price will stay bullish as long as it holds above the Ichimoku cloud levels.\n\nThe black line on the chart backs the uptrend as long as it is respected as support. In that case, a carefully executed dollar-cost average strategy would give traders many opportunities to buy the dip thus eventually contributing to new momentum above $4,000.\n\nA good place to start buying ETH is the short-term support at $3,950. However, if the decline continues below $3,900, the 50-day EMA (the line in red on the chart) might ignite a new bullish fire toward all-time highs.\n\nEthereum might run into considerable congestion in the range between $3,963 and $4,083. About 1.64 million wallets bought ETH at an average cost of $4,027, implying that they may want to sell at their respective breakeven levels, damping the uptrend.\n\nThe IOMAP model developed by IntoTheBlock points to robust support between $3,605 and $3,725.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Announces Ethereum's Upcoming Milestones: Verkle Trees and History Expiry - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Announces Ethereum's Upcoming Milestones: Verkle Trees and History Expiry Rebeca Moen Ethereum's network takes a major leap in scalability with the completion of the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone, paving the way for verkle trees and history expiry.\n\nThe Ethereum network has reached a critical milestone in its scalability roadmap with the successful implementation of \"Basic rollup scaling,\" according to an post by Vitalik Buterin on Warpcast. This development is a key component in Ethereum's transition to a more scalable and efficient blockchain, which is essential for its long-term success and adoption.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nFollowing this milestone, the Ethereum development community is setting its sights on the integration of verkle trees and history expiry. Verkle trees are an evolution of Merkle trees that will enable more efficient and compact proofs, reducing the amount of data validators need to store. History expiry is a concept that will allow old transaction data to be removed, thereby reducing the \"state bloat\" and making it easier for users to run full nodes.\n\nIntroducing \"Basic Rollup Scaling\"\n\nRollups are solutions that execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and post transaction data back to it. This \"Basic rollup scaling\" is the foundation that allows for increased throughput on the network while maintaining security by leveraging the main chain for data availability and consensus.\n\nThe Promise of Verkle Trees\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum development team is focusing on the integration of verkle trees. Verkle trees are a proposed upgrade to the existing Merkle trees, which are data structures that enable the secure and efficient verification of content in a blockchain. Verkle trees will optimize storage and computational efficiency, significantly reducing the size of proofs and making it easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnderstanding History Expiry\n\nAnother forthcoming feature is history expiry, a mechanism that will allow the Ethereum network to shed older historical data, thus preventing excessive growth of blockchain data size. This will alleviate the burden on nodes, ensuring that the requirement for storage space does not become a barrier for validators and full node operators, which in turn contributes to the decentralization and robustness of the network.\n\nCommunity Reactions and Expectations\n\nThe announcement received a positive response from the Ethereum community, with many expressing excitement and support for the progress. Vitalik's update on Warpcast garnered 1728 reactions and various comments from key players in the Ethereum ecosystem. Brian, from @br1an.eth, extended an invitation to discuss the update on the @unlonely platform, indicating a strong interest in the implications of this development.\n\nThe Future of Layer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nQuestions about the timeline for Layer 2 solutions adopting new features like blobs, a form of data storage that could further reduce fees, were raised by community members such as Hugo Montenegro (@hmheck). The anticipation for more affordable transaction costs was palpable, with users like Pacheco (@pachec0) expressing concerns over the current fee structure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum network's latest accomplishment in achieving the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone has generated enthusiasm among stakeholders and users alike. As the community looks forward to the implementation of verkle trees and history expiry, the path towards a more scalable and user-friendly Ethereum continues to unfold.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price is declining from the $4,080 zone. ETH is now approaching a major support at $3,500 where the bulls might take a stand.\n\nEthereum started a downside correction from the $3,080 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,850 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its increase if it clears the $3,850 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dips\n\nEthereum price failed to stay above the $4,000 resistance zone and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $3,920 and $3,850 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone.\n\nIt even spiked below the $3,680 support zone. A low was formed at $3,625 and the price is now consolidating losses. It seems like there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,850 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum price is now trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,740 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,083 swing high to the $3,625 low.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,850 level and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,083 swing high to the $3,625 low.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is near $3,880, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $4,000 level. If there is a move above the $4,000 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,080 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,150.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,850 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,680 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,600 zone. The next key support could be the $3,500 zone. A clear move below the $3,500 support might send the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,850"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on the 13th of March.\n\nThere has since been a notable decline in transaction fees on L2 networks.\n\nLeading layer 2 networks (L2s) have witnessed a significant drop in transaction fees in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis is a result of the successful deployment of the Dencun upgrade and the activation of EIP-4844 on the Ethereum [ETH] mainnet.\n\nThe Dencun hard fork, which is the biggest upgrade to the Ethereum network since the Merge in September 2022, went live at 1:55 pm UTC on the 13th of March.\n\nAs reported previously, the Dencun upgrade aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and, notably, to decrease the transaction fees of L2 solution providers.\n\nThe average transaction fees on L2s like Optimism [OP], Arbitrum [ARB], Base, and zkSync have dropped significantly by 92%, 23%, 94%, and 33%, respectively, since the implementation of the Dencun hard fork.\n\nAMBCrypto sourced this data via a Dune Analytics dashboard compiled by Marcov.\n\nETH remains in good hands\n\nETH exchanged hands at $3,988 at press time, per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data.\n\nIts statistically positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], whose value has climbed by over 10% in the last week, caused the altcoin to witness a 5% price uptick during the same period.\n\nA 2% increase in its supply on cryptocurrency exchanges over the past week indicated a rise in profit-taking activity.\n\nHowever, a look at its performance on a daily chart revealed that market sentiment remains markedly bullish.\n\nFor example, reading from ETH\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator which tracks market trends, showed the MACD line (blue) significantly above the trend (orange) and zero lines.\n\nWhen these lines are positioned in this manner, it indicates strong bullish momentum in the market.\n\nIt suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, and there is potential for continued price growth.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nFurther, the altcoin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was 0.26 as of this writing. In an uptrend and above zero, ETH\u2019s CMF showed that liquidity inflow into the market remained high.\n\nRegarding the demand for the leading altcoin, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow (MFI) were 76.57 and 65.54 at press time. These values showed that coin accumulation exceeded sell-offs."

        "title": "What Are Wrapped Tokens And How Do They Work? - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "The wrapped token market has witnessed substantial growth in the last three years, with Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) alone worth a significant $10.58 billion \u2013 a sum worth the budget of three small African countries put together.\n\nAt time of writing, wBTC had seen a price increase of 1.7% in a single day, with its price hovering around $68,443.00. This shows that more people are wrapping their digital assets to use them in new ways in the DeFi space. Combined, the market cap for wrapped tokens today stands at $12.1 Billion.\n\nAs the market cap indicates, wrapped tokens like wBTC are gaining traction. Consequently, crypto thought leaders have expressed enthusiasm for the potential of wrapped tokens to revolutionise the DeFi landscape.\n\nBinance, for instance, highlighted the cross-chain functionality that wrapping brings to tokens, allowing for a token pegged to the value of the original asset.\n\nWrapping brings cross-chain functionality to your tokens.\n\n\n\nWhen wrapping a token, you\u2019re provided with a token pegged to the value of the token you wrapped.\n\n\n\nLearn why this is useful below \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/KoT90K7bU4 \u2014 Binance (@binance) March 4, 2023\n\nBut what exactly are wrapped tokens, and how do they work?\n\nWrapped Tokens: What They Are And How They Work?\n\nWrapped tokens are like digital vouchers representing another asset from a different blockchain. They\u2019re crucial for allowing different blockchain networks to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, like how an interpreter helps people who speak different languages communicate. They could be cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or NFTs.\n\n\ud83d\udd36 How do Wrapped Tokens work?\n\n\n\nA key step in creating wrapped tokens involves 'locking' a specific amount of a native blockchain's coin into a smart contract.\n\n\n\n\u2013 This process serves to generate the corresponding wrapped token.\n\n\n\nTypically, a DAO or a trusted entity monitors this\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RhG7xkPCNN \u2014 Stroom (@StroomNetwork) January 23, 2024\n\nPut simply, wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) \u2013 which is the first and most prominent wrapped token \u2013 is like a copy of Bitcoin that is tradable on Ethereum\u2019s Blockchain (ECR-20). So, for every wBTC, there\u2019s a real Bitcoin saved somewhere safe (pegged at a 1:1 ratio) through a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians.\n\nSource: Gate.io\n\nThis setup makes sure that wBTC always has the same value as Bitcoin. It\u2019s like having a voucher that you can swap for a real item at any time. This way, people can use Bitcoin on Ethereum\u2019s network, which normally wouldn\u2019t accept it, without needing anyone to oversee the process.\n\nThe Need For Wrapped Tokens In The Crypto Ecosystem\n\nInteroperability is the answer.\n\nImagine you have a ticket for a bus, but you need to take a train. You can\u2019t use the same ticket, right?\n\nWrapped tokens solve this by \u201cwrapping\u201d a token (like a bus ticket) into a new form (a train ticket) so it can be used on another blockchain, increasing the places where you can use your digital assets and helping everyone join the DeFi movement.\n\n3/ @WrappedBTC makes interoperability possible \ud83c\udf10\n\n\n\nBy enabling use of #bitcoin on the Ethereum network, $wBTC lets $BTC holders engage in:\n\n\u2022 Lending\n\n\u2022 Yield farming\n\n\u2022 Margin trading\n\n\u2022 & other aspects of the growing DeFi ecosystem \u2014 Okcoin (@Okcoin) September 9, 2021\n\nIn other words, these tokens act as a bridge, allowing assets from one blockchain to be used on another. This not only makes blockchains more versatile but also increases liquidity, with which assets can be traded easily. This is especially important in Decentralised Finance (DeFi), where wrapped tokens help create a more fluid and dynamic financial environment.\n\nYet, wrapped tokens didn\u2019t just appear out of nowhere; certain entities created them to solve a specific problem at some point in the history of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Creation of Wrapped Tokens\n\nThe first significant wrapped token was wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin, created by BitGo, Kyber, and Ren in 2019.\n\nWhat these innovators hoped to achieve was the need for assets to traverse the blockchain divide, and they acted to bridge the gap. As key players and organisations, they set the stage for a more interconnected blockchain world.\n\nAfter this, over the years, the crypto space has witnessed the birth of more wrapped tokens, like wETH (wrapped ETHER), wBNB (wrapped BNB), wSOL (wrapped Solana), and many others.\n\nThe Genesis of these Versed Tokens\n\nThe concept of wrapped tokens took shape around October 2018, with wBTC launching on January 31, 2019, from a collaboration between Kyber Network and BitGo. This marked a pivotal moment in blockchain history, as it allowed Bitcoin holders to \u2018wrap\u2019 their coins and use them in Ethereum\u2019s vibrant DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWrapped Tokens vs Regular Tokens\n\nWrapped and normal tokens are clearly distinct from each other \u2013 especially in terms of interoperaberability.\n\nWrapped tokens can be used on multiple blockchains. They\u2019re like a passport that lets a token travel and be accepted in different crypto countries.\n\nRegular tokens usually stick to their own blockchain. It\u2019s like having money that can only be spent in the country where it was made.\n\nPurpose:\n\nWrapped tokens are ceated to represent another asset on a different blockchain, allowing that asset to be used in new ways.\n\nRegular tokens serve various purposes on their native blockchain, like voting, paying fees, or buying services.\n\nCreation Process:\n\nWrapped tokens are made through a process called \u201cwrapping,\u201d which involves locking up the original asset and issuing a new token on a different blockchain.\n\nRegular tokens are directly issued on their native blockchain without needing to be wrapped.\n\nMarket Participation:\n\nWrapped tokens enable participation in decentralised finance (DeFi) on blockchains where the original asset couldn\u2019t normally operate.\n\nWith regular tokens, participation is limited to their native blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSecurity and Trust:\n\nWrapped tokens require trust in the custodian or smart contract that holds the original asset.\n\nWith regular tokens, security and trust are based on the underlying blockchain\u2019s protocol.\n\nWrapped tokens provide seamless interoperability between blockchains thanks to Ethereum, but what do wrapped tokens like Zcash mean for crypto investors? https://t.co/NWnrasw4Cb \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) October 26, 2019\n\nControversies and Challenges\n\nWrapped tokens aren\u2019t without their drama. They\u2019ve faced criticism for potential security holes and for giving too much control to the few custodians who hold the keys to the wrapping process. These risks must be carefully managed to maintain the integrity of wrapped tokens.\n\nWrapped tokens are poised to play a transformative role in the future of blockchain technology and DeFi. They offer a glimpse into a world where the barriers between different cryptocurrencies are dissolved, paving the way for a more fluid and interconnected digital economy.\n\nAs we look to the future, these digital chameleons will likely play a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain technology and finance.\n\nAuthor: Ayanfe Fakunle\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organisations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to rise above the $73,000 mark early Thursday, as the BTC exchange-traded funds keep fuelling excitement among investors. Ethereum (ETH), which was on a roll due to the Dencun Upgrade, dropped below the $4,000 mark after the upgrade went live last night. It remains to be seen how ETH manages to recover. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of minor dips and gains across the board. Memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) became the biggest gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 32 percent. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), on the other hand, turned out to be the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of over 7 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $2.77 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 1.43 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $73,505.47, registering a 24-hour gain of 2.02 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 63.10 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $3,991.25, marking a 24-hour dip of 1.08 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 3.45 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour gain of 9.84 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.1712. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 15.95.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour dip of 2.07 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $96.01. LTC price in India stood at Rs 8,349.99.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.6836, seeing a 24-hour dip of 1.67 percent. As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 59.38.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Today\n\nSolana price stood at $166.45, marking a 24-hour gain of 11.55 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 14,300.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (March 14)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\ndogwifhat (WIF)\n\nPrice: $2.91\n\n24-hour gain: 32.03 percent\n\nJupiter (JUP)\n\nPrice: $0.9458\n\n24-hour gain: 17.36 percent\n\nBonk (BONK)\n\nPrice: $0.00003442\n\n24-hour gain: 17 percent\n\nPancakeswap (CAKE)\n\nPrice: $4.93\n\n24-hour gain: 15.51 percent\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPrice: $0.00001017\n\n24-hour gain: 15.43 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (March 14)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR)\n\nPrice: $7.84\n\n24-hour loss: 7.11 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $4.09\n\n24-hour loss: 6.62 percent\n\nSei (SEI)\n\nPrice: $0.8787\n\n24-hour loss: 6.08 percent\n\nBittensor (TAO)\n\nPrice: $639.42\n\n24-hour loss: 5.80 percent\n\nWEMIX (WEMIX)\n\nPrice: $3.28\n\n24-hour loss: 4.95 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin has skyrocketed to $73,000, registering a 47% surge over the last month and 199% increase over the past year. This upward momentum is credited to the growing interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs and the impending Bitcoin halving event, which historically triggers significant price movements. There has been a steady increase in mainstream acceptance and investments from both retail and institutional investors following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Now that Bitcoin has breached the $73,000 threshold, the market eyes at the $76,000 level. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has rapidly outpaced MicroStrategy in accumulating Bitcoins, accumulating nearly 204,000 BTC within just two months of its launch, indicating a surge in demand. Blackrock's Bitcoin holdings now stand at over $14.76 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cThe global crypto market cap has reached $2.77 trillion, marking a 1.69% increase from yesterday. With another day of BTC hitting all-time highs, the fear and greed index has now moved into the extreme greed category, meaning a correction is due and sooner or later the bears are going to have a good day at the market. However, with bulls having full control of the market currently, top altcoins namely BNB and SOL have been competing for the fourth largest crypto after BTC, ETH and USDT. Yesterday the ETH Dencun upgrade went live, which will have a positive impact on layer 2 gas fee transactions. Though MATIC reached its highest price in more than a year - similar price action was not visible in OP and ARB.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory, hitting new all-time highs amid rapid buy-ups after each dip. However, analysts suggest a cooling phase may be on the horizon as BTC has nearly doubled in price since late January without significant pullbacks. Negative bearish divergence on the 4-hour chart's relative strength index (RSI) hints at potential lower prices. Meme coins' soaring values indicate a possible pullback, with BTC trading around $73,192, up 1.40% in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cOn March 13, Bitcoin jumped to around $73,000, supported by a solid base with a pivot point at $70,013 and resistance levels between $73,824 and $79,904. Key support levels at $67,154, $64,861 and $62,192 offer a safety net against potential downside. Technical indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI) of 71 and the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at 68,547, indicate strong buying interest, reinforced by bullish candlestick patterns. A break above $72,000 could sustain the bullish trend, while a break below could prompt a re-evaluation. However, caution is advised if the price drops below $72,000, potentially signalling a shift in trend despite the current optimism.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin continues to rally after a week of record spot ETF net inflows of $1.1 billion. MicroStrategy which recently bought $821.7 million worth of bitcoin, is now raising $500 million more to buy additional Bitcoin.This price action reflects strong institutional buying and new ATHs don't take much time unlike earlier. $74,000 is the next price level to watch before it eventually hits 100,000.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Yes, Ethereum staking is worth it for most holders. Staking earns you rewards and contributes to the security and functionality of the Ethereum network. If you want to stake ETH as a solo staker you need 32 ETH, which is a high bar for most holders. However, liquid staking solutions allow users to stake much smaller amounts and generate virtually the same rewards.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain received its biggest upgrade to date. The Merge upgrade moved Ethereum from Proof-of-Work over to Proof-of-Stake. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and also laid the foundation for future upgrades, which will significantly improve the scalability of the network.\n\nWith the introduction of Proof-of-Stake on Ethereum, ETH holders now have the opportunity to stake their coins and earn staking rewards in the form of additional ETH. In this article, we\u2019ll explain Ethereum staking and present the different options ETH holders have when it comes to earning staking rewards.\n\nKey highlights: The Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September of 2021.\n\nThis means that ETH holders can now stake their ETH to provide additional security to the network and earn rewards.\n\nIf you want to run your own validator, you need 32 ETH.\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH, you can still earn staking rewards. You can use liquid staking protocols such as Lido or stake your ETH with the help of a crypto exchange.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum now uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, in which validators stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Validators are rewarded for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking that blocks proposed by other validators follow the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\nValidators who are reliable and act in the best interests of the network receive ETH as a reward. At the time of writing, validators on Ethereum are earning an APR (annual percentage rate) of about 4%. If you\u2019re investing in Ethereum and don\u2019t plan to sell in the short term, staking ETH is certainly worth considering to passively grow your ETH holdings.\n\nThe rewards earned by each validator depend on the total number of validators that are active on the Ethereum network, as well as network activity (more activity means more potential income from transaction fees).\n\nThe catch is that validators who are not reliable or are found to be breaking the rules are punished by having a portion or the entirety of their ETH stake taken away.\n\nShould I stake my Ethereum?\n\nThere's little reason not to stake Ethereum if you plan on holding ETH for an extended period of time. While the rewards for staking are not enormous, they can still add up over time and increase your holdings. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,700. With an expected APR of 3.5% for staking, a single ETH would generate 0.035 ETH in rewards over 1 year ($129.5 at current market rates).\n\nIt's worth noting that Ethereum staking does have certain drawbacks. For one, you cannot withdraw your ETH immediately. This can be detrimental if you decide you'd like to sell ETH quickly, as you will typically have to wait a couple of hours up to a couple of days for your ETH to be unstaked (also known as a \"cooldown period\"). The cooldown period is different between different protocols and platforms.\n\nAnother potential drawback, which impacts liquid staking protocols exclusively, is the fact that the token you receive in exchange for your staked ETH (for example, stETH on Lido), can drop in value relative to Ethereum. This means that if you want to convert your stETH back to ETH to claim rewards and unstake ETH, you might be selling at a loss. However, this rarely occurs and is only really a concern during periods of extreme bearish activity.\n\nstETH (a liquid staking ETH derivative by Lido) is, for all intents and purposes, pegged to the value of ETH.\n\nWho can stake ETH?\n\nIn order to launch your own validator, you need to have 32 ETH. At the time of writing, this translates to about $57,000, so it\u2019s definitely not accessible to everyone from a financial perspective.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are still ways to earn staking rewards with your ETH, even if you don\u2019t have the 32 ETH required to launch your own validator. We\u2019ll discuss the different ways to stake ETH a bit further in the article below.\n\nInitially, staked ETH coins could not be withdrawn. However, this was changed with the Shapella upgrade in April of 2023, which gave users the ability to withdraw their staked coins.\n\nWhere to stake ETH?\n\nThere are four distinct options for ETH holders who want to stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nSolo staking\n\nStaking as a service\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking through crypto exchanges\n\nHowever, solo staking and staking as a service are limited to those that have at least 32 ETH.\n\nDo you have 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you have 32 or more ETH to stake, you can access solo staking or staking as a service solution. Of course, you can also use other ways of staking ETH that are also available to users who have less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nSolo staking\n\nSolo staking involves launching your own Ethereum validator and maintaining it yourself. Each validator you run requires a stake of 32 ETH.\n\nWhen you\u2019re solo staking, you\u2019re directly participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum blockchain and contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization. In addition, you remain in full control of your private keys and receive full staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. This is why the Ethereum Foundation describes solo staking as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for Ethereum staking.\n\nWhile solo staking certainly has a lot of benefits, it is the least accessible way to stake ETH for the average person. The most obvious barrier to entry is that you need at least 32 ETH, which is simply out of reach for most Ethereum investors. Operating a validator also requires some technical expertise, and you need to ensure that your validator stays online continuously to avoid inactivity penalties.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nThere are various staking as a service providers that offer to manage one or more Ethereum validators on your behalf. When using these services, you\u2019re required to provide ETH (32 ETH per validator). In most cases, you get to keep control of your private keys, which is a plus.\n\nOf course, staking as a service providers need some form of compensation for operating validator nodes on your behalf. So, while your validators will be earning ETH staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol, you will have to pay a fee to the service provider to keep your validators up and running.\n\nSo, staking as a service can be a good option if you have the sufficient amount of ETH to have your own validators but don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of setting up a node and keeping it operational.\n\nOverall, your returns will be slightly lower than what you\u2019d get with solo staking, as you\u2019ll have to pay a fee to the provider. Some examples of staking as a service providers are BloxStaking and Abyss Finance.\n\nDo you have less than 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH to stake, you can't engage in solo staking, but there are other options available to you.\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking pools take ETH deposits from multiple users and pool them together to launch Ethereum validators. This makes it possible for anyone to stake their ETH, even if they don\u2019t have 32 ETH themselves.\n\nStaking pools are a very popular way of staking Ethereum, and many of them offer liquid staking, which is a very handy feature. Here are two examples of the top two Ethereum staking pools available today.\n\nLido\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Lido is the most popular way to stake Ethereum. At the time of writing, over 30% of all ETH was staked through Lido.\n\nAfter staking your ETH through Lido, you will receive an equivalent amount of stETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH and any accrued rewards. These stETH tokens can be used in DeFi protocols or even sold if you need liquidity.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that the stETH to ETH exchange rate is usually skewed in favor of ETH, so you will likely receive a bit less than 1 ETH for each stETH you sell. Of course, you are also able to redeem your stETH for staked ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is also a liquid staking solution that allows users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. The minimum amount of ETH that can be staked through Rocket Pool is 0.01 ETH, which makes the service highly accessible.\n\nWhen you stake ETH through Rocket Pool, your staked coins and accrued rewards are represented with rETH tokens. Similarly to stETH, you can use rETH in any way you please. rETH holders can redeem their tokens for ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nOverall, staking pools are a good option for anyone who\u2019s looking to earn Ethereum staking rewards but has less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges offer Ethereum staking services to their users. For example, you can stake your Ethereum on Binance, which is a solid option since you will be able to retain liquidity thanks to BETH, a token that represents ETH staked through Binance.\n\nWhen staking through an exchange, you deposit ETH to the exchange. The exchange then pools together ETH from multiple users to deploy Ethereum validators. The rewards earned by these validators are then distributed to the users who staked their ETH, but the exchange will typically take a cut from the rewards as a fee for the service they provide.\n\nStaking through exchanges is probably the most convenient way to earn Ethereum staking rewards, but it also requires the most trust. When you deposit your ETH to a centralized crypto exchange, you have to trust that they will manage your funds responsibly. In addition, there could be a negative impact to the decentralization of Ethereum if exchanges control a large number of validators.\n\nComparison of Ethereum staking methods\n\nNow that we\u2019ve briefly explained each different Ethereum staking method, let\u2019s do a quick comparison of their pros and cons.\n\nMinimum amount Pros Cons Solo staking 32 ETH Full control over staking setup\n\nReceive full rewards\n\nContributes most to decentralization High barrier to entry\n\nRequires technical knowledge Staking as a service 32 ETH Much simpler than solo staking\n\nKeep control of keys required to withdraw or transfer staked ETH Service providers take a fee\n\nHigh barrier to entry Staking pools Small (0.01 ETH or less) You can stake smaller amounts of ETH\n\nMany staking pools offer liquidity tokens\n\nNon-custodial options available Smart contract risks\n\nLiquidity token price fluctuations Crypto exchanges Small (0.01 ETH or less) Very convenient way of staking ETH\n\nMany exchanges offer liquid staking options Requires trust in the exchange\n\nExchange takes a cut of the rewards\n\nCentralization risks\n\nEthereum \"restaking\"\n\nRecently, the concept of Ethereum \"restaking\" has started to gain traction in the crypto community. Through protocols such as EigenLayer, users who own staked ETH can choose to \"restake\" their coins to help provide security to applications that function on top of the Ethereum network. Essentially, this means that staked ETH can be used to validate networks and services other than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to earn additional rewards on top of the standard ETH staking yield.\n\nCurrently, the most popular Ethereum restaking protocol is EigenLayer, which supports restaking both for ETH as well as liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH. Please keep in mind that restaking is a relatively new concept and doesn't have a long track record in real-world conditions. If you're using a protocol such as EigenLayer to restake your ETH, you could be taking on substantially more risk than if you just kept your coins staked normally.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014ETH staking is a good choice for long-term holders\n\nEthereum staking is worth it if you\u2019re an ETH holder and plan to hold your coins over the long term. This is already the position of many ETH holders, as Ethereum is widely perceived as one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold for the long term. Before deciding whether staking is right for you, make sure to check the current ETH staking rewards to see what kind of APR to expect.\n\nIf you\u2019re also interested in cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, check out our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now."

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.\n\nThe success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:\n\n-no further ETPs for other tokens\n\n-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N \u2014 Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) March 14, 2024\n\nFollowing the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAltcoins Fall: Will Ethereum And Solana Bulls Surpass Expectations? 6 months ago\n\nA part of the letter read:\n\nRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of the Ethereum token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.\n\nEthereum price on a deep correction on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's net worth revealed - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum and one of the most vocal advocates of cryptocurrency, has a significant portfolio comprised mainly of ETH tokens. In fact, during the bull market in 2021, he became the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire. In the meanwhile, the price of ETH dropped significantly, but Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wealth is still substantial. So, how much is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth today?\n\nVitalik Buterin and Ethereum\n\nTo better understand Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth, we first have to delve deeper into his relationship with the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin is the inventor and co-founder of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain with an integrated smart contract functionality. Buterin first elaborated on the concept in a white paper in 2013, arguing that Bitcoin (back then, the sole relevant blockchain) lacked application development via an integrated scripting language.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and supporting decentralized applications (DApps). It utilizes its crypto tokens called Ether (Bitcoin ( is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and supporting decentralized applications (DApps). It utilizes its crypto tokens called ETH ) to execute transactions and run smart contracts. Unlike BTC ), which emerged as an alternative currency, Ethereum primarily aims to support fully decentralized contracts and apps to simulate a global virtual computer.\n\nRecommended video: Vitalik Buterin explains Ethereum\n\nSource: Ethereum YouTube\n\nThe idea failed to take off initially, but the Ethereum white paper circulated, the interest grew, and it finally caught up at a Bitcoin conference in January 2014, where it was described as a global processing machine operating on a decentralized network with virtually limitless applications. Ultimately, the project was crowdfunded and launched on 30 July 2015.\n\nFun fact: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s inspiration for decentralized money came from his Vitalik Buterin\u2019s inspiration for decentralized money came from his World of Warcraft gaming experience. He stated that Blizzard removed the damage component from his beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell one day. He cried himself to sleep, and on that day, he realized \u201cwhat horrors centralized services can bring\u201d and soon decided to quit.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH portfolio\n\nIn 2014, before it was publicly launched, Ethereum conducted a pre-sale where people could acquire Ether by paying with Bitcoin. ETH\u2019s initial token supply was over 72 million tokens, with 16.53% allocated to Vitalik Buterin and its other seven co-founders.\n\nThis initial batch of ETH is the source of most of his crypto portfolio and the most significant driver of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth. As of August 1, 2024, Vitalik Buterin holds 245,178 ETH tokens. As the current price of each token is $3,188.82, this makes Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH portfolio total value equal to $781.83 million. In other words, Buterin\u2019s total value in held Ether is a little over $780 million.\n\nVitalik Buterin claims he never held more than 0.9% of total supply of Ether, and that was at the end of 2015. According to Arkham Intelligence, as of December 2023, the inventor of Ethereum held 0.2% of total ETH supply.\n\nI never personally held more than ~0.9% of all ETH, and my net worth never came close to $1b. Also, I'm pretty sure there are no criminal laws against pre-mining. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 10, 2018\n\nSince nearly all of it comes from Ether, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is highly dependent on the current price of the crypto coin. In November 2021, near ETH\u2019s peak price, the native token went over the $4,635 mark, making Buterin\u2019s net worth about $1.46 billion. Similarly, his future net worth will fluctuate according to the performance of his crypto invention.\n\nButerin\u2019s portfolio includes a number of other crypto tokens, but their combined worth amounts to a fraction of his ETH wealth and does not change the total net worth by much. Significant sums include 869,509 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) worth approximately $0.5 million, another 248,273 tokens or $0.85 million worth of WETH (WETH), about 250 trillion of Doge-Inu (DINU) worth $85,12, and small amounts sums of THE, USDC, INDSHIB, DOJO, and other tokens.\n\nButerin proposes radical innovations to boost Ethereum speed Although Ethereum has made significant advances over the years, it keeps lagging behind some of its competition \u2013 literally. Newer blockchains like Solana can generate blocks in 0.4 seconds, beating Ethereum\u2019s 12 seconds many times over.\n\n\n\nTo address this, Buterin has proposed radical new solutions, including the \u201csingle-slot finality (SSF)\u201d and \u201cbased pre-confirmations\u201d that would provide guaranteed inclusion of the transaction in the next block for an additional fee. Buterin has emphasized the need to balance network speed and integrity, but if successful, the changes could transform the crypto industry, likely increasing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in the process.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s non-crypto assets\n\nButerin was one of the earliest investors in StarkWare, an Israeli software tech company focused on cryptography, more precisely, zero-knowledge proof technology that focuses on blockchain scalability of the Ethereum platform. In May 2022, it was evaluated at $8 billion.\n\nAs there are few reliable sources and zero public data on Buterin\u2019s assets, it is impossible to know for sure how much his non-crypto portfolio adds to his total net worth. Therefore, we will not take it into account when calculating Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in this article.\n\nAbout Vitalik Buterin\n\nBorn in Russia in 1994 and raised in Canada, the father of Ethereum showed exceptional skill in arithmetics and coding since his earliest years. He was the person to envisage how Ethereum should look and work and outlined the draft of its design in 2014, and the blockchain went live in 2015.\n\nRecommended video: Vitalik Buterin On Creating One Of The World\u2019s Largest Cryptocurrencies\n\nSource: Business Insider YouTube\n\nAs such, Ethereum expanded the capabilities of a blockchain from mere financial assets to a range of diverse functionalities in finance, gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. He has built a legacy of innovative thinking and decentralization advocacy, winning respect within the crypto and wider technology community.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth: the bottom line\n\nThe single asset that makes Vitalik Buterin wealthy is his stake in Ethereum, or the number of ETH tokens he holds and their combined value. At the moment, it is about $781.83 million, but the sum fluctuated wildly, going as high as $1.6 billion in November 2021 and as low as less than $300 million in June 2022.\n\nAs it is, Vitalik seems dedicated to tying his net worth to his pet project, binding his financial fate to the success of the Ethereum blockchain and the associated cryptocurrency. We can only wait and see how it goes in time, but it does mean one thing: the great crypto inventor truly cares about the project, inspiring and reassuring many crypto investors willing to bet on their share of ETH.\n\nFAQs about Vitalik Buterin net worth\n\nHow much is Vitalik Buterin's net worth? The vast majority (almost 99%) of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth comes from the value of ETH. His 245,178 ETH tokens are valued at $781.83 million as of August 1, 2024.\n\nWho is the largest owner of Ethereum? The single largest owner of Ethereum is Vitalik Buterin, with 245,178 ETH held in his crypto wallet as of August 1, 2024.\n\nDoes Vitalik Buterin own crypto other than ETH? Yes, Vitalik Buterin owns other tokens, such as WETH, STRK, KNC, and SDOG. However, almost 99% of his crypto portfolio\u2019s worth is derived from Ethereum.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "content": "Ethereum-based project, OMG Network (formerly known as OmiseGo) announced today that it has finally launched to mainnet its solution that scales Ethereum to thousands of transactions per second while simultaneously reducing transaction fees to one-third of the usual amount.\n\nOMG Network V1 Mainnet Beta, which has been in the works for three years employs the More Viable Plasma (MoreVP) specification to increase the processing capacity of Ethereum. The solution batches several transactions in a single block while charging a one-time fee.\n\nCommenting on the development, Vansa Chatkavanij, OMG Network CEO discussed how blockchain finally unlocked permissionless transactions for global ecommerce on the internet, with the Ethereum network already providing the security infrastructure for such transactions.\n\nChatkavanij added that the OMG platform will facilitate true global ecommerce, adopting the security of Ethereum while also allowing for transactions that are done at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAlongside the mainnet rollout, OMG Network also released a block explorer and a demo web wallet which allows users to enter the network.\n\nBitfinex launches USDT on OMG Network\n\nFollowing the rollout of OMG Network V1 Mainnet Beta, cryptocurrency trading platform, Bitfinex has integrated its Tether (USDT) stablecoin on the OMG network to reduce transaction times, make payments faster and also lower transaction fees.\n\nThe new integration builds on the recent usage of Ethereum and especially USDT for token exchange and will allow traders to take move their assets more quickly in the event of increased market volatility such as that witnessed in March.\n\nPaulo Arduino, Bitfinex CTO said in a release,\n\nBy migrating USDt value transfers to the OMG Network, we save costs, drive performance improvements, and relieve pressure on the root chain. This is good for Bitfinex, our users, and the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, news of OMG Network launching its Ethereum scalability solution follows a recent listing of the project\u2019s token on leading cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, a period that saw the coin gain 25% within 24 hours."
