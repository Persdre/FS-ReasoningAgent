But with the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, many investors are left wondering, is Ethereum a good investment?\n\nIn this guide, we will delve into the factors that make Ethereum an attractive investment option, as well as the potential pitfalls to look out for. Whether you are a seasoned investor or a curious beginner, gaining insights into Ethereum's investment potential can help you navigate the complexities of the digital currency market.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: An Overview\n\nEthereum is not a cryptocurrency \u2014 it\u2019s a global computer for running decentralized apps (dApps). Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, and it's the required form of payment for running your app or processing your transaction on the highly-desired Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is really good as a store of value, it doesn't support smart contracts like Ethereum does. Arguably, Ethereum is equally capable as a store of value. This being said, many prefer bitcoin to store value because of its hard-capped supply. While both the supply of Bitcoin and Ether are increasing, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin in circulation. With Ethereum 2.0 and EIP-1559 however, Ether may become deflationary, that is, the supply of the token will actually decrease with time.\n\nEther has been competing with Bitcoin for the top spot as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization since its release in 2015 and came close to overtaking Bitcoin in February 2018. Both of these coins have hit new all-time highs since then, and there appears to be more room for both to grow in 2024. Some experts predict Ethereum will \"flip\" Bitcoin this market cycle to become the dominant cryptocurrency in the industry.\n\nHow Ethereum Has Performed Since Launch & in 2024\n\nEthereum has had a volatile price history since its launch in 2015. In its early days, Ethereum was trading at just a few dollars per coin. However, during the cryptocurrency boom of late 2017, Ethereum reached a high price of over $1,400. In Nov. 16, 2021, it reached an all-time high of $4,891.70. Since then, Ethereum's price has fluctuated significantly, driven by factors such as market speculation, technological developments, regulatory news and overall market sentiment.\n\nHow Did Ethereum Perform in 2023?\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum performed exceptionally well, experiencing significant growth in its value and market capitalization. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 brought about scalability improvements and lower transaction fees, making the platform more efficient and attractive to investors and developers. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications also boosted Ethereum's performance, as more projects were built on its blockchain. Overall, Ethereum solidified its position as a leading smart contract platform and continued to show strong growth potential.\n\nHow Much is Ethereum Right Now?\n\nAs of Jul. 18, 2024, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $3,406.85\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nPrice predictions are not always accurate, but a Ethereum price forecast can highlight potential investment opportunities. Benzinga has compiled important information regarding ETH future prices to address questions about whether Ethereum will rise in value. Discover ETH price forecasts here.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nDecided you want in on the Ethereum action? Listed below are a handful of exchanges where you can purchase Ether. If you're new to crypto, jump to our guide on How to Buy Ethereum or compare exchanges with the Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges guide.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nThe overwhelming performance of Ethereum has attracted traditional and institutional investors alike. Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies provide you with the following advantages over traditional investments that point to Ethereum being a good investment:\n\nVolatility: While this was previously seen as a negative, smart investors have realized market cycle patterns and are able to capitalize on the parabolic gains produced by market bubbles.\n\nWhile this was previously seen as a negative, smart investors have realized market cycle patterns and are able to capitalize on the parabolic gains produced by market bubbles. Liquidity: Ethereum is arguably 1 of the most liquid investment assets due to the worldwide establishment of trading platforms, exchanges and online brokerages . You can easily trade Ethereum for cash or assets like gold instantly with incredibly low fees. The high liquidity associated with bitcoin makes it a great investment vessel if you\u2019re looking for short-term profit. Digital currencies may also be a long-term investment due to their high market demand.\n\nLower inflation risk : Unlike world currencies \u2014 which are regulated by their governments \u2014 Ethereum has a transparent inflation plan that is subject to less meddling. The blockchain system is infinite, and there\u2019s no need to worry about your crypto being deflated.\n\n: Unlike world currencies \u2014 which are regulated by their governments \u2014 Ethereum has a transparent inflation plan that is subject to less meddling. The blockchain system is infinite, and there\u2019s no need to worry about your crypto being deflated. Decentralized finance : Ethereum and DeFi are relatively young \u2014 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and many other new applications are becoming more mainstream on a daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive gains.\n\n: Ethereum and DeFi are relatively young \u2014 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and many other new applications are becoming more mainstream on a daily basis.

Finality : The consensus mechanism of a blockchain ensures the integrity and security of the transaction record. Ethereum offers customizable consensus methods such as RAFT and IBFT for enterprise networks, which provide quick transaction finality and require less infrastructure than the Proof of Work algorithm.\n\n: The consensus mechanism of a blockchain ensures the integrity and security of the transaction record. Ethereum offers customizable consensus methods such as RAFT and IBFT for enterprise networks, which provide quick transaction finality and require less infrastructure than the Proof of Work algorithm. Tokenization: Ethereum enables businesses to represent any digitally registered asset as a token. By tokenizing assets, companies can diversify their product offerings (e.g. unique paintings), develop new incentive models, as well as fractionalize previously large assets (e.g. real estate) and allow for crowdsourced data management.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum may play a part in the future of monetary exchange and global computing systems, but it is equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding cryptocurrency investing. However, a few are certainly overblown (or will be fixed soon) and mistakenly make some investors think that Ethereum is a bad investment.\n\nVolatility: If you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn\u2019t sell your investment for more than $7,051. Although you would be doing great now, to avoid painful losses in the short term, keep a close eye on the market. This isn't a unique disadvantage for Ethereum as all cryptos (except for some stablecoins) are volatile so this alone doesn't make Ethereum a bad investment by any means..\n\nIf you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000.

This isn't a unique disadvantage for Ethereum as all cryptos (except for some stablecoins) are volatile so this alone doesn't make Ethereum a bad investment by any means.. High transaction fees : Arguably Ethereum's largest drawback, transaction fees, hold back the network from reaching mainstream adoption. Using Ethereum's blockchain can cost hundreds of dollars, so retail investors with smaller amounts of capital are priced out from using the network. While other smart contract blockchains have cheaper fees, Ethereum has the most applications and use cases built on its blockchain.\n\n: Arguably Ethereum's largest drawback, transaction fees, hold back the network from reaching mainstream adoption.

New regulation: The government is unlikely to let cryptocurrencies remain completely unregulated for long. New regulations could interfere with business models, and cause crashes that are entirely out of your control.\n\nThe government is unlikely to let cryptocurrencies remain completely unregulated for long. New regulations could interfere with business models, and cause crashes that are entirely out of your control. Threat of online hacking : Hacks are a threat facing many cryptocurrency investors. Most exchanges let you buy and sell your cryptos using a mobile app or website. However many users also store their crypto on exchange wallets. This leaves them susceptible to losing their investments should the exchange get hacked, and their private keys being stolen. Cryptocurrency held on most exchanges isn\u2019t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\n: Hacks are a threat facing many cryptocurrency investors.

Competition: There are a ton of emerging smart contract platforms giving Ethereum a run for its money, namely Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Polkadot. While these cryptocurrencies offer better scalability than ETH, they lack decentralization and the robust DeFi ecosystem that Ethereum has on its network.\n\nThere are a ton of emerging smart contract platforms giving Ethereum a run for its money, namely Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Polkadot. While these cryptocurrencies offer better scalability than ETH, they lack decentralization and the robust DeFi ecosystem that Ethereum has on its network. Proof of Work consensus: Although Bitcoin also uses proof of work consensus, this is more of a con for Ethereum. Transactions on Bitcoin are only necessary to transfer the crypto, while Ethereum's network is used for a variety of functions. Proof of work is more expensive and slower than proof of stake, which is currently being used by many ETH competitors.\n\nEthereum Trading Signals\n\nIntoTheBlock provides a fantastic suite of fundamental and technical trading signals to help you make your own informed decision on whether Ethereum is a good investment or not.\n\nHow to Store Ethereum Safely\n\nSo, is Ethereum a good investment? It can be if you do your research, manage your coins properly and keep an eye on the market. Crypto investing is not as simple as calling a broker and buying or selling. You are actively involved in the process, and that means you need a wallet. Cryptocurrency wallets are a fundamental part of the ecosystem, giving you the ability to easily send and receive money.\n\nThere are two types of wallets: software and hardware. MetaMask and Exodus Wallet are typically the best route to go for software wallets, and the Ledger Nano X is the best hardware wallet.\n\nBZ Pro Tip: If you lose access to your wallet\u2019s private key, whatever cryptocurrency was associated with the wallet is now lost forever. The best way to prevent this, is to handle your private key and seed phrase with extreme care. A forgotten seed phrase can remove currency from circulation forever. A memorized seed phrase can carry billions of dollars across borders with 0 physical evidence.\n\nEthereum NFTs\n\nA key driver for Ethereum's blockchain is the rise of NFTs. Almost every high-value NFT is secured by Ethereum's blockchain, including CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Art Blocks. Many new users on Ethereum were drawn to its network to invest in NFTs, so if NFTs continue to breach into the mainstream, it's likely Ethereum will continue to gain adoption. While other platforms like Solana and Avalanche have NFTs, the market for non-fungible tokens on these blockchains is magnitudes smaller than that of Ethereum.\n\nDisclaimer: Do not take out a loan to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Do not purchase them with credit. Do not do anything that could endanger you or jeopardize your financial future. If you aren\u2019t sure how much risk you are capable of handling, consult a financial advisor who is trained for this.\n\nEthereum vs. Other Investment Options\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have completely different use cases. Bitcoin acts as a store of value, similarly to gold. Ether acts as a store of value too, while the Ethereum Virtual Machine enables a host of innovative applications such as DeFi, NFTs and the metaverse.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine allows coders to write programs called \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Ethereum smart contracts can automate thousands of financial products and are the building blocks of NFTs. These smart contracts enable full-fledged applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs).\n\nWhile very basic smart contracts are technically possible on Bitcoin's blockchain, Ethereum's custom programming language and huge team of developers make it the likely long-term settlement layer. Bitcoin's blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger for processing payments. Ethereum is a ledger with a full computer attached, allowing much, much more than just processing payments.\n\nAs far as which of the two is a better investment, it's impossible to say for sure. It\u2019s likely that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will stand the test of time and coexist peacefully in the future. Bitcoin is ahead now but Ethereum seems to be the clear winner in terms of utility though it is generally more volatile. At the end of the day, your investment decisions must be made by you (or an investment advisor). The best thing you can do is to educate yourself as much as possible before risking any of your hard-earned money, and never invest money you aren\u2019t willing to lose entirely. You don't want to end up on the front page of Wall Street Bets, after all.\n\nShould You Invest in Ethereum?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum can be a risky but potentially rewarding venture. As one of the largest and most established cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a strong community and a wide range of use cases beyond just digital currency. Its smart contract functionality has enabled the development of decentralized applications and other blockchain innovations. However, like any investment, there are risks involved, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. It's important to do thorough research and understand your risk tolerance before deciding to invest in Ethereum.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ Does Ethereum have a future? A Ethereum\u2019s future looks promising with the implementation of Ethereum 2.0, the rise of decentralized finance applications, and the recent adoption of ETH ETFs. Its scalability, security, and adaptability make it an attractive choice for users and developers in the blockchain space. Q How do you mine Ethereum? A Ethereum is an unregulated digital currency that can be mined effectively by most modern graphics cards (GPUs). Mining Ethereum is actually quite simple, and can generate passive income for people with low electricity costs. Q Can Ethereum reach 100k? A According to Changelly, Ethereum could hit $100,ooo by 2033.\n\n***Information is not intended for U.S. users"

        "title": "What\u2019s Next for Ethereum ETFs Following SEC Approval? - Foley & Lardner LLP",
        "content": "Following the approval and launch of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (EFTs) in January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight Ethereum ETFs for listing and trading on SEC-regulated exchanges on May 23, 2024. The approval represents a significant milestone that paves the way for increased institutional and retail investments in crypto ETFs and addresses critical regulatory issues that have surrounded Ethereum for years. The approval of these Ethereum ETFs is especially noteworthy in light of recent comments by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler who suggested that Ethereum, due to its staking mechanics, might be classified as a security under SEC regulations.\n\nThe approval of these applications occurred without much resistance, which is a notable departure from the contentious process that preceded the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. As outlined in our prior article, the SEC only approved BTC ETFs after three federal judges ordered the SEC to grant approval following Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory in court. In Grayscale Investments v. SEC, the D.C. Circuit found the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s application to list a BTC ETF.\n\nIn contrast, this time the SEC approved the Ethereum ETF applications of its own volition. While this maneuver might have been to avoid more litigation and public scrutiny, the approval shows a steady departure from \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d and a movement toward actions that promote growth in the cryptocurrency industry and investor freedom.\n\nThis piece begins by explaining what the SEC has approved and why. Next, our team comments on what to expect in the future and what this all means for the cryptocurrency industry and investors going forward.\n\nThe Approval Order\n\nThe SEC approved the listing and trading of eight Ethereum (ETH) ETFs: the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF[1], the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and the Franklin Ethereum ETF. All the ETH ETF sponsors are familiar names from the first round of BTC ETFs.\n\nThe most important development from the approval order was the SEC heavily implying that ETH is a commodity and not a security. The SEC approved the applications under the rules for commodity-based trust shares. None of the sponsors filed applications under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is required for ETFs that trade securities. Additionally, the SEC only cited court precedents that involved commodities and not securities to support approving the applications.\n\nThe SEC further justified its approval in ways reminiscent of how it explained approval of the BTC ETFs. Notably, the commission cited the high correlation between spot ETH prices and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures market. This is significant because CME surveillance of spot ETH markets would help detect any market manipulation that could affect the integrity of ETH ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the Ethereum ETFs comes with specific conditions, including a prohibition on staking ETH via ETH ETFs. If the sponsors of these ETFs want approval to stake ETH, they will need to submit a proposed rule change and wait for SEC approval.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAlthough the SEC, in late May, approved the sponsors\u2019 applications to list ETH ETFs on public exchanges, we likely will not see the ETFs listed for trading on those exchanges until mid-to-late July, at the earliest. Each sponsor must submit an S-1 filing as a registration statement and wait for SEC approval before the ETFs can actually be listed for trading. Recently, the SEC returned the submitted S-1 forms with slight comments, asking sponsors to resubmit by July 8, 2024, which delayed the expected launch. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had previously stated that an end of June launch for the ETH ETFs was a \u201clegit possibility,\u201d but recently revised his prediction, suggesting an expected launch date of mid-to-late July, pending the SEC\u2019s review and final approval of the resubmitted S-1 forms.\n\nSimilar to our prediction for the BTC ETFs, we again expect a heated battle for market dominance. Generally, the first movers in the ETF industry box out competitors by gaining significant market share early on. Other factors, such as brand recognition, price competition, commitment to the crypto industry, and developments in disruptive technology may also prove important. But at the moment, it is unclear what factors will affect the ETH ETF market or to what degree each factor will affect the market. Price and market power will likely be important to investment banks, but analyst prowess may be relatively unimportant considering that the ETH ETFs are single-asset funds.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs represents a clear and positive step in the classification of ETH as a commodity, the SEC remains free to argue that ETH staking is an investment contract (a.k.a., a security) subject to its jurisdiction. That said, the SEC cannot rationally assert that ETH alone is not a security in the case of ETH ETFs but that it is a security in other cases. If sponsors want to stake the ETH in the ETFs, the SEC may put up much more a fight than they did in approving the ETF applications in the first place. Notably, the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) aims to classify ETH and many other crypto assets as commodities. The House of Representatives passed FIT21 on May 22, 2024, but the bill\u2019s prospects in the Senate are uncertain. It remains to be seen if FIT21 will be the first piece of federal cryptocurrency asset legislation.\n\nThe Approval Order only covers ETH ETFs, not any other single-crypto-asset fund or any multi-asset-crypto-fund. However, the fact that the SEC has now approved two cryptocurrency ETFs shows a shift in the political and regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency assets. Even if the SEC treats the \u201cvast-majority\u201d of cryptocurrency assets as securities, the focus will undoubtedly shift to which cryptocurrency asset will be the next to gain ETF approval.\n\nOur Perspective\n\nOverall, this is a positive step forward by the SEC and for the cryptocurrency asset industry, which is piercing mainstream financial markets in aggressive fashion, pushing innovative investment and technology opportunities to the forefront.\n\nThe Approval Order demonstrates that crypto assets can start life as a security and transition to a commodity (or other non-security) over time. Thus, Ethereum\u2019s founders, and the founders of many other cryptocurrency assets, can rest easier knowing that their assets either are or can become so decentralized that the SEC cannot classify them as securities.\n\nEven following the Approval Order, we still expect SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to reiterate his position that most cryptocurrency assets are still securities in the eyes of the SEC. Chairman Gensler affirmed this belief in the wake of approving BTC ETFs, and again in the days leading up to the ETH ETF Approval Order. But we are optimistic that the SEC\u2019s decision to approve two cryptocurrency ETFs demonstrates the SEC staff\u2019s commitment to a \u201cmerit-neutral\u201d perspective.\n\nThe Approval Order will stimulate growth in the fledgling United States cryptocurrency retail market. When the ETFs are listed on public exchanges, U.S. investors will be able to buy, sell, and hold ETH in their IRAs, 401Ks, and brokerage accounts. In the coming years, it is very possible we will view the SEC\u2019s decision to approve ETH ETFs as an important step in what became a trend of integrating cryptocurrency assets into traditional finance networks through ETFs and other financial instruments.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s action is certainly a good step forward for investor freedom, the SEC is still preventing investors from unlocking the full potential of their investment. The decision to prohibit sponsors from staking ETH in the ETFs likely deprives investors of an average additional 2.61% return on ETH staked for one year. The staking issue will pose many crucial questions going forward: How will sponsors and investors craft staking agreements for each ETF? What will the SEC do when a sponsor submits a proposed rule change to allow staking? Can the SEC resolve this issue amicably by cooperating with the industry, or will the courts have to decide?\n\nWe believe that the SEC cannot credibly assert that ETH alone is a security in some cases but not in other cases, so the freedom to stake ETH in the ETFs should not be as big of an issue the SEC is setting it up to be. Still, the SEC may need to hear that from a judge before it concedes.\n\nIn conclusion, we would be remiss to not remind readers that good governance by cryptocurrency-savvy, ETF-savvy officers and directors, and expert SEC legal advice by counsel, will all be necessary for sustainable market success in this industry. The digital assets industry is still a young, volatile, and highly creative technology sector that is fraught with perils identified as legal and regulatory \u201crisk factors\u201d in several prospectuses.\n\nETFs are complex. Cryptocurrency assets are beyond complex. Sponsors and banks should not seek SEC approval for a cryptocurrency asset ETF, nor should a bank, broker, or RIA contract with a cryptocurrency asset ETF sponsor or authorized participant, unless led and advised by seasoned counsel.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Chatoo, a summer associate in Foley\u2019s Miami office, for his contributions to this article.\n\n[1] On May 31 ARK Invest ended its partnership with 21Shares and is no longer involved with the ETF. The SEC has approved 21Shares to continue under the rebranded name of 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs start trading Tuesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. - Fortune",
        "content": "New spot ETFs for Ethereum\u2014which will let investors purchase the second most popular cryptocurrency in the form of stocks\u2014 are expected to begin trading on Tuesday, July 23. The Securities and Exchange Commission has green lit at least three funds to enter the market that day, sources told Reuters, although it\u2019s believed that a total of eight Ethereum ETFs will launch simultaneously.\n\nThe instruments follow in the footsteps of the eleven trading spot Bitcoin ETFs. Having accumulated over $54 billion in assets under management since launching in January, Bitcoin has soared 47% this year. Here\u2019s all you need to know about their Ethereum counterparts.\n\nWhat is a spot Ether ETF?\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the SEC\u2019s reservations, Ether is legally considered to be a commodity, but the corresponding ETFs will be securities.\n\nETFs first came to market in 1993. The funds pool together a basket of securities, such as a handful of different energy stocks, and the price aligns with the indexes that it tracks. They are listed on exchanges and can be traded during market hours, thus operating like stocks.\n\nSpot Ether ETFs will track the spot\u2014or current\u2014price of Ether. The products give investors access to the underlying crypto without the need to own a crypto wallet. The ETFs will be set up as grantor trusts, meaning investors will own a share of the Ether held by the trust.\n\nWho issues them and what are the fees?\n\nEight asset managers are proposing to offer Ethereum ETFs: BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Invesco/Galaxy Digital. Each instrument will be near-identical, so the fees charged to investors are competitive. For now, we know that Franklin Templeton will charge 0.19%, VanEck at 0.20%, and Invesco and Galaxy Digital will charge a 0.25% fee for its jointly filed ETF.\n\nThe full list of fees will be revealed when the final registration statements, or S-1s, are submitted to the SEC. This will be on Tuesday, if trading begins for all eight.\n\nWhere can I access them?\n\nThey will be listed on the Nasdaq, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWhy would someone buy an Ethereum ETF?\n\nBitcoin and Ether tokens represent units of ownership\u2014and thus value\u2014of an underlying blockchain. Beyond that, they are very different.\n\nWhereas Bitcoin may be a long-term hedge against inflation, Ethereum is closer to a tech investment. The blockchain\u2019s main premise is \u201cto remove the intermediary and allow for 24/7 uptime in financial services, such as trading and lending, in addition to tokenization, digital collectibles, and digital identity,\u201d Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, told Fortune.\n\nWhile for now crypto markets are tightly correlated, this may not always be the case, he adds. So, Ether ETFs allow investors to diversify which corners of the crypto economy they want to invest in.\n\nWill their popularity match the spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nDemand for the funds will be 20% that of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, told Fortune. This prediction is because the market capitalization of Ether is about one-third of the size of Bitcoin. Plus, he adds, the ETFs will lack a key benefit of holding Ether: Investors will not be allowed to stake, which generates yields. But, even at this smaller size, they would be \u201cextremely successful\u201d by any ETF launch standard, says Seyffart. Similarly, K33 Research predicts that during the first six months of trading, inflows will be $4 billion\u2014a quarter of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen judging their success, it\u2019s key to evaluate performance after six months of trading, rather than simply on \u201cgame day\u201d and the initial weeks, Leah Wald, CEO and president of Cyberpunk Holdings Inc., told Fortune. Launching in summer, they\u2019re coming to market when trading is typically \u201cmore muted,\u201d she points out. Plus, success should also be judged on volume and spread, rather than simply inflows, as the health of these metrics foreground AUM growth down the line, she adds, as investors feel safe allocating dollars into these new securities.\n\nWho will be investing in them?\n\nInstitutional investors, such as hedge funds, pension funds, banks and endowments. Retail investors will also access them, either by buying them directly, or through portfolio allocations via wealth advisors. The latter group will likely dominate the first six months of trading, as the Q1 13Fs for the spot Bitcoin ETFs reveal that over 80% of total AUM was from non-professional investors.\n\nHow will the ETFs impact the crypto market?\n\nIf K33\u2019s prediction of $4 billion in inflows over six months is accurate, at current prices, this would mean 1% of Ether in circulation would be absorbed by the ETFs by the end of the year. This absorption is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to strengthen Ether\u2019s price in the second half of the year, says Lunde.\n\nThe inflows would also be bullish for the wider market, history suggests. The fresh capital flowing into Bitcoin via the ETFs have boosted the crypto market cap by 46% in 2024, according to K33. Lunde anticipates the products \u201ccould further expand the broad market strength\u201d as they enable sidelined capital to enter the market. Plus, Bitcoin ETF investors have \u201chave proven to handle volatility with grace, and flows have been solid even during deep corrections,\u201d says Lunde, suggesting ETFs can open up the market to new investors committed to the long-term.\n\nLastly, as BlackRock, a behemoth of traditional finance, is issuing one of the funds, this shows the firm is diving deeper into crypto. This grants the industry a \u201csolid and well-needed stamp of approval,\u201d he says."

        "content": "Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin on Wednesday cautioned against voting for political candidates based solely on whether they have adopted a \"pro-crypto\" stance.\n\n\"The game of politics is much more complicated than just 'who wins the next election', and there are a lot of levers that your words and actions affect,\" Buterin wrote in a blog post that warned even Putin and the Russian government had \"expressed willingness to become 'open to crypto.'\"\n\nButerin's post comes as Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president, rallies members of his party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, and a day after venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz told employees of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that they plan to make significant donations to political action committees supporting Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Ben & Marc Show,\" which features the a16z co-founders, Horowitz said that the Joe Biden administration, in the form of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has \"fought\" them every step of the way by \"using very nefarious means.\"\n\n\"They've sued I think over 30 of our companies,\" added Horowitz. \"They're losing almost all these lawsuits, but the problem is that when you're a startup you don't have the money to fight the U.S. government and so they're kind of nuking the industry in that way.\"\n\nFairshake, a super PAC backed by crypto's top companies, is now one of the top-spending PACs in this election cycle. Of the $160 million in total contributions it has raised, 94% can be traced back to just four companies: Ripple, Andreesen Horowitz, Coinbase and Jump Crypto.\n\n\"There is a particular style of being 'crypto-friendly' that is common to authoritarian governments, that is worth being wary of. The best example of this is, predictably, modern Russia,\" added Buterin, a Russia-born coder who built ethereum in his late teens.\n\nTesla chief Elon Musk and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, as well as crypto leaders like Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have also endorsed Trump.\n\nIn early June in San Francisco, technologists, crypto executives, and venture capitalists paid up to $300,000 per ticket to join a Trump fundraiser that ultimately raised more than $12 million.\n\n\"In particular, by publicly giving the impression that you support 'pro-crypto' candidates just because they are 'pro-crypto', you are helping to create an incentive gradient where politicians come to understand that all they need to get your support is to support 'crypto,'\" continued Buterin, who is known for periodically posting longer essays opining on existential threats to the ecosystem writ large.\n\nButerin did not single out any names in his post of either political candidates, or of those opting to support them.\n\nTrump \u2014 who launched his latest non-fungible token collection on the solana blockchain in April \u2014 has been making increasingly bullish comments on crypto.\n\nHe is accepting digital currency donations and has pledged to defend the rights of those who choose to self-custody their coins, meaning that they don't rely on a centralized entity like Coinbase to hold their tokens and instead, do it themselves in personal crypto wallets, which are sometimes outside the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Trump also vowed at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington in May to keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and \"her goons\" away from bitcoin holders.\n\nMeanwhile, following a meeting with bitcoiners at Mar-a-Lago with about a dozen mining executives who pledged cash and votes to him, Trump declared that all future bitcoin will be minted in the U.S., should he return to the White House.\n\nOn Monday, the Republican presidential nominee added Ohio Senator JD Vance to his ticket as vice president \u2014 a move viewed by many as a net win for the crypto sector. Vance has advocated for looser regulation of crypto and disclosed in 2022 that he personally holds bitcoin .\n\nIt comes in stark contrast to the Joe Biden White House, which has been seen as hard on crypto. Under President Biden, the SEC has dialed up actions on the sector, and even in the absence of hard-and-fast rules from Congress, the U.S. has proven to be one of the most active enforcers of penalties and legal enforcements against crypto companies.\n\nThe angrier the crypto industry got at the SEC for arresting and prosecuting them, the more people like Vance saw a chance to stake out a position on the opposite side of a crypto-skeptical Biden administration.\n\nHowever, the perception that Biden is anti-crypto and Trump is pro-crypto has some Biden allies concerned enough to take their case directly to senior White House officials.\n\nTrump is set to headline the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee on July 27."

        "content": "Lee Enterprises newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nEthereum is considered the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ethereum's price has had its share of highs and lows. Why does its price change so much, and how can investors navigate these ups and downs?\n\nA Bit of Background - What Is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is not just a digital currency. It is a platform that allows developers to build and run applications without a central authority (like a bank or the government). This makes it different from Bitcoin, primarily a digital form of money.\n\nThe currency used on this network is called Ether (ETH). Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has become the backbone of many innovative technologies, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's Price History\n\nEthereum's price has seen its share of highs and lows. When it first launched, Ether was priced at about $0.30. By early 2018, during intense interest in cryptocurrencies, its price skyrocketed to around $1,400. However, this boom was followed by a severe crash, which brought the price down to around $80 by the end of the year.\n\nDespite these fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience. In 2021, it reached new heights, surpassing $4,000, likely due to the rising popularity of DeFi and NFTs. These technologies primarily rely on the Ethereum network, which results in an increased demand for Ether.\n\nWhy Does Ethereum's Price Fluctuate So Much?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Ethereum's price fluctuations:\n\nMarket Sentiment: Like the stock market, cryptocurrency prices are heavily influenced by people's thoughts and feelings. Joyous news, such as a big company starting to use Ethereum, can drive the price up. Negative news, like a hack or stricter regulations, can cause the price to drop.\n\nLike the stock market, cryptocurrency prices are heavily influenced by people's thoughts and feelings.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, issued a warning on Wednesday against choosing a candidate purely based on whether they claim to be \u201cpro-crypto.\u201d In a blog post, Buterin said it\u2019s more important to scrutinize a candidate\u2019s broader policies to ensure they support cryptocurrency\u2019s underlying goals, including internationalism and protection for private communications.\n\n\u201cIf a politician is pro-crypto, the key question to ask is: Are they in it for the right reasons?,\u201d wrote Buterin. \u201cDo they have a vision of how technology and politics and the economy should go in the 21st century that aligns with yours?\u201d\n\nThough Buterin does not mention any politicians or crypto investors by name, his comments come just one day after Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz threw their support behind former President Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential election. The founders of Andreessen Horowitz noted on their podcast yesterday that Trump\u2019s crypto regulation plan is \u201ca flat-out blanket endorsement of the entire space.\u201d The influential venture capitalists join the ranks of other notable Silicon Valley players, including Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump in the last week.\n\nFurther, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder made the case that signaling you broadly support any \u201cpro-crypto\u201d candidates could incentivize politicians to promote the cause in bad faith. Buterin notes that authoritarian leaders, particularly in Russia, have claimed to support crypto in an effort to consolidate power.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they also support banning encrypted messaging, if they are a power-seeking narcissist, or if they push for bills that make it even harder for your Chinese or Indian friend to attend the next crypto conference \u2014 all that politicians have to do is make sure it\u2019s easy for you to trade coins,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nThe co-founder of Ethereum suggested to look into a \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d politician\u2019s views on crypto five years ago. He says this can serve as a guide for whether the politician may reverse their position five years in the future.\n\nNotably, former President Trump starkly opposed decentralized tokens five years ago. In a tweet from July 2019, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cnot a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money.\u201d In a follow-up tweet, he said \u201cwe have only one real currency in the USA,\u201d referring to the United States dollar.\n\nBut in May, Trump completed a total flip-flop on his stance regarding cryptocurrencies, becoming the first major presidential candidate to accept bitcoin donations. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump\u2019s crypto fundraising efforts have collected $3 million worth of donations in the second quarter."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs\u2019 launch will catapult its price to new heights, expert says.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s staking feature plays a key role in its prices.\n\nBitwise CIO expects $15 billion in inflows over the next 18 months.\n\nWith spot Ether exchange-traded products set to hit markets next Tuesday, one expert says Ethereum will hit a new all-time high soon after.\n\nMatt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer, said there are three reasons why Ethereum will rise above $5,000 after the ETFs start trading.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s slow supply growth, lack of miners, and staking will pay serious dividends and enable the new ETFs to outperform Bitcoin funds, Hougan said in a new investor note.\n\nHe has previously estimated that investors will pour $15 billion into spot Ethereum ETFs in their first 18 months of trading.\n\nEthereum supply slows\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are inflationary, meaning more are created and sold on the market over time.\n\nBitcoin does this, but the amount that will ever exist is capped at 21 million.\n\nEthereum is also inflationary, but a technical feature that slows this process was added three years ago.\n\nThe burn feature destroys a small portion of Ether with every transaction.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhen people swap, trade, or lend on the Ethereum network more frequently, more Ether can be destroyed than produced.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the net amount of Ether hitting the market has been nearly zero as of September 2022.\n\nThe network produces an equal amount of Ether as the burn feature destroys.\n\nThe total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. The total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. (Etherscan/Etherscan)\n\nHougan said this slowed growth and the launch of a new demand source will increase Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThere\u2019s less Ethereum on the market, and with the launch of Ethereum ETFs, many Wall Street firms will start buying it for their products.\n\nMore demand translates to higher prices.\n\nMiners aren\u2019t stakers\n\nBitcoin mining is an industry that demands enormous resources, from electricity costs to high-end machines. Miners regularly sell the Bitcoin they mine to pay these costs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case with Ethereum stakers.\n\nEthereum operates a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. This means it doesn\u2019t require an industrial-grade mining operation to keep it secure.\n\nInstead, users must lock up 32 Ether, which is worth roughly $111,000 today, and become validators who secure the network.\n\nValidators are paid in newly created Ethereum to prevent fraudulent transactions on the network.\n\nRunning a validator is far less expensive than running a profitable mining outfit. This means there is less need to sell Ethereum to continue operating.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, there is simply less forced selling each day in Ethereum than in Bitcoin,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nStaked and off the market\n\nMore than 33 million Ether are staked today, nearly 28% of the entire cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, according to a Dune dashboard by analyst Hildobby.\n\nMore importantly, says Hougan, this is Ether that\u2019s not moving soon either, as they are locked up for a set period, meaning it cannot be withdrawn or sold.\n\n\u201cCurrently, 28% of all ETH is staked, meaning it is effectively off the market,\u201d Hougan said\n\nThe combination of low inflation, fewer sellers in Ether stakers, and millions of Ether off the market make the proposition of an ETH ETF especially bullish, said Hougan.\n\n\u201cIf the ETPs are as successful as I expect \u2014 and given the dynamics above \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine ETH not challenging its old record.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 3% over the past 24 hours to trade at $65,000.\n\nEthereum is up 1.8% to $3,476.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nLiam Kelly is a DeFi correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Is XRP Ready for $0.7? Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Verge of $0.00002, Ethereum (ETH) Reversal Halted - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's 30% rally placed the asset at the forefront of the bull market, with the potential to break even higher, potentially hitting this year's high of $0.7, but numerous factors should align for it.\n\nOver the last few days, XRP has demonstrated remarkable strength, breaking through major resistance levels and drawing interest from the cryptocurrency community. With many speculating as to whether the momentum can push XRP even closer to $0.7, the rally has brought the cryptocurrency very close to a critical threshold.\n\nNumerous signs point to the possibility that XRP will keep rising. First, there has been a noticeable surge in trading volume for the asset, which suggests that investors are actively participating in it. As more market participants join the rally, this spike in volume frequently precedes subsequent price increases.\n\nFurthermore, technical research reveals that XRP has overcome a number of resistance levels and converted them into support. The previous thresholds at the $0.52 and $0.54 levels are now serving as support, giving the next leg up a strong foundation. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are also seeing gains, and the market's attitude toward cryptocurrencies is currently positive overall. This general bullishness on the market makes it easier for XRP to profit from the upward momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu regains important positions\n\nShiba Inu is getting closer to the $0.00002 price threshold, which could be the next move for the asset since it is already trading close to the month's high. The main issue with the asset right now, though, is the lack of momentum.\n\nWith steady ascents toward the $0.00002 mark, SHIB has demonstrated a comeback in the last few days. This level poses a major psychological obstacle for investors and traders. Crossing above this barrier might open the door for more gains and possibly spark a bigger rally. Technical indicators show that SHIB has overcome a resistance level of 100 EMA.\n\nThe asset is currently up against the 200 EMA resistance, though, and it could be a major obstacle. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is getting closer to the overbought area, indicating that the current rally may be flagging. Even with the improvement, the trading volume is still low when compared to earlier spikes.\n\nThere is reason for concern because this weak trading activity suggests that there may not be enough market interest to sustain the current price movement. A spike in volume would be required to give SHIB the necessary momentum to continue on its upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum stops\n\nEthereum has hit the 50 EMA resistance level and now might retrace below key values like $3,300. Luckily, we saw a volume surge, which could be a sign of an upcoming reversal.\n\nEthereum experienced a setback after its recent rally brought it close to the 50 EMA resistance level. At $3,300, a critical support level, the asset is presently having difficulty holding its position. The 50 EMA presents a significant challenge because, if not decisively broken, it frequently functions as a barrier that can stop upward momentum. The increase in trading volume is one aspect of Ethereum's current market activity that is positive.\n\nStronger interest and participation from traders are frequently indicated by increased volume, and this can result in more persistent price movements. The increase may suggest that buyers are entering the market, which could lead to a reversal.\n\nWe might witness a further retracement of the asset, possibly testing lower support levels like $3,200, or even $3,000. This could happen if the asset is unable to hold its position above $3,300. Further, worth keeping an eye on is the Relative Strength Index, which can reveal if an asset is overbought or oversold and offer insights into potential future price movements."

        "title": "Ethereum VS Solana: Which Blockchain is Better for Minting NFTs? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "If you\u2019re struggling to decide between choosing Solana or Ethereum to mint your Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), you have come to the right place. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore each blockchains\u2019 strengths, capacities, weak points, and overall differences so you can make a better decision that suits your goals in the NFT market.\n\nEthereum: Ecosystem, Marketplace, and Security\n\nEthereum is undoubtedly the largest ecosystem in the DeFi (decentralized finance) sector, with thousands of projects of all kinds building on it. So it\u2019s no surprise that the vast majority of NFTs are running on it as ERC-721 tokens.\n\nTo be accurate, roughly 95% of all the NFT ecosystem uses Ethereum, so it\u2019s no coincidence that when investors look for an NFT marketplace, the first one they usually run up to is OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to size, Ethereum takes the lead with a much bigger pool of buyers and sellers \u2013 or, in other words, trading volume. So if you mint NFTs in an Ethereum-based marketplace like OpenSea, you could get more exposure and people willing to buy or place bids on your NFTs. On the other hand, everyone knows there\u2019s also a huge supply of NFTs that no one would ever like to buy or bid for.\n\nWant to mint your first NFT on OpenSea? Check our step-by-step guide here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s attributes make it one of the top ecosystems for starting a DeFi project. Its data architecture and security components are the reason why so many developers are building on top of its blockchain.\n\nHowever, when network activity increases exponentially (which is something frequent), the network suffers a major transaction backlog, which leads to an enormous spike in transaction fees that usually surpass the digits per transaction, something that could be affecting the number of users who can afford to mint NFTs.\n\nThis has prompted NFT creators and collectors to seek alternative blockchains with higher throughput, scalability, and lower gas fees. One option that has become a very serious competitor is Solana \u2014a high-performance blockchain that leverages different cryptographic mechanisms to scale its network (we\u2019ll discuss this later.)\n\nWhile paying elevated gas fees can be a crippling experience sometimes, the upside is there\u2019s more money flowing in Ethereum, so the flipping ceiling is way higher. Data from CryptoSlam shows that Ethereum has had a whopping selling volume of over $1.8 billion in the last 30 days, compared to $120 million from Solana-based marketplaces.\n\nAccording to current data from CryptoSlam, the most popular NFT collections in the market exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These include CryptoPunks, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and so forth.\n\nAdditional data shows that the average NFT sale price in Ethereum (as of Q4 2021) was around $3,000 compared to Solana\u2019s $1,000.\n\nSolana: Throughput, Low Fees, Growing Ecosystem\n\nSolana takes the lead in terms of technology, functionality, and versatility.\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain that uses a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History, which leverages a set of protocols to execute transactions with high throughput\u2014 more than 60,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nIn Solana, transaction costs are usually less than a dollar. Many NFT projects and collectors are migrating to Solana to benefit from its scalability and low transaction fees. They have more freedom to build their projects without suffering from technical limitations, which is why Solana is turning into a hub for general NFTs.\n\nMinting NFTs with a Solana-based marketplace like Solsea is remarkably cheap, fast, and easy to profit from once it hits the secondary market. Usually, Solana mints are quickly snapped up, and royalties in Solana-based markets are also frequently higher compared to Ethereum-based ones.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s ecosystem isn\u2019t nearly as big as Ethereum\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t growing. In fact, Solana\u2019s user base has been growing at a much faster pace since the beginning of 2022, and even analysts from investment bank JP Morgan have claimed that it could overtake Ethereum in the long run.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, the NFT market in Solana gained significant momentum throughout the third quarter of 2022. By the end of January, the ecosystem\u2019s sales volume crossed the $1 billion mark.\n\nOne of the most popular collections on the Solana blockchain is the Degenerate Ape Academy, a collection of 10,000 unique NFT Apes.\n\nWhile they may look similar to the Bored Apes from Ethereum, they have their own set of unique traits.\n\nThey can be pretty expensive, too\u2014the highest sale price for a Degen Ape was $1.1 million in September 2021. However, in mid-December, an NFT from the Solana Monkey Business collection was sold for over 13,000 SOL, or about $2 million.\n\nGrowing ecosystems frequently offer early adopters a great opportunity to establish themselves at the top of the list by the time they reach a larger audience. However, one of their problems is that the risk is usually higher. Since the beginning of 2022, the Solana network has suffered several downtimes, forcing users to liquidate their positions as they were unable to top up their collateral during the outages.\n\nAnother concern that developers have addressed lately is the rise of rug pulls in Solana. This is usually the problem with emerging technologies, as scammers will try to spot and take advantage of any weak points they can find. However, rug pulls and scams can happen on both sides of the story, so it\u2019s not only about security issues but rather making sure you do good research before investing in an NFT or any DeFi projects.\n\nRugpulls are the most common type of scam in the DeFi ecosystem. If you want to learn how to spot them, check our latest guide on the matter.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nEach blockchain has its own pros and cons, so it really comes down to what you want to do with each one. If you\u2019re looking for a high-throughput blockchain with scalability and low gas fees, then Solana might be more suitable for you.\n\nSolana\n\nPros:\n\nHigher throughput and scalability.\n\nGrowing ecosystem.\n\nLow gas fees and environmentally friendly.\n\nMinting NFTs is cheap and relatively straightforward.\n\nCons:\n\nLess secure network.\n\nLower exposure with a smaller market.\n\nDowntimes are more frequent.\n\nNow, if you want exposure to a bigger market and benefit from the security aspects, then you might be better off with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\n\nPros:\n\nAccess to a larger market.\n\nHigh network security.\n\nNFTs are sold for a much higher price on average.\n\nCons:\n\nNetwork congestion can cause transaction delays.\n\nLower throughput and scalability.\n\nTransaction fees can become unpayable for a good percentage of users who want to mint NFTs."

        "title": "The launch of Ethereum ETFs: the news from the community - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The crypto world is buzzing with news, July 23, 2024, will mark a crucial date for Ethereum (ETH) investors: on this date, in fact, the launch of several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on ethereum in the United States is expected, an eagerly awaited move that could lead to a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States recently responded to the issuers regarding the final approvals for these ETFs, granting preliminary approval for at least three of the eight proposed.\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs: the news from the community\n\nThe ETFs on ether cash represent a significant innovation for the US financial market. The issuers of these ETFs have worked closely with the SEC to ensure\n\nthat their registration statements become effective, thus allowing the ETFs to start trading smoothly. This intense collaboration was necessary to meet the strict regulatory requirements and to gain the necessary trust from the regulatory authorities.\n\nThe introduction of ETFs on cash ether could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. ETFs represent an accessible and regulated investment tool that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to purchase them directly.\n\nThis could lead to an increase in the demand for ether, as institutional and retail investors look for safe and regulated ways to enter the bull market of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to analyst John Smith, the preliminary approval by the SEC for ether ETFs is a positive signal indicating a growing recognition and acceptance of cryptocurrencies by regulatory authorities.\n\n\u201cThis move could pave the way for further financial products based on cryptocurrencies in the future, further contributing to legitimizing the cryptocurrency sector as a whole,\u201d said Smith.\n\nWith at least three of the eight proposed ETFs on ether already preliminarily approved, the competition among issuers is becoming fierce.\n\nAmong the main contenders are high-profile financial companies such as VanEck, ProShares, and WisdomTree, all with extensive experience in managing ETFs on other asset classes. The competition between these financial giants could lead to significant innovation in the design of ether ETFs, with the goal of attracting a wide range of investors.\n\nThe regulatory challenges\n\nDespite the preliminary approval, the issuers of cash ether ETFs still face several regulatory challenges. The SEC, in fact, has expressed concerns regarding the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the possibility of market manipulation. For this reason, the issuers must demonstrate that their products are designed to mitigate these risks and protect investors.\n\nJulie Anderson, expert in financial regulation, emphasized the importance of this verification process.\n\n\u201cThe SEC is trying to balance innovation with investor protection. Issuers must demonstrate transparency and solidity in their proposals to obtain final approval,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the launch of cash-settled ether ETFs on July 23 could mark the beginning of a new era for the cryptocurrency market. Investors will finally have access to a regulated instrument to invest in Ether, which could lead to an increase in confidence in the cryptocurrency market and greater participation from institutional investors.\n\nFurthermore, the success of ETFs on ether could pave the way for the approval of other financial products based on cryptocurrencies, such as ETFs on other cryptocurrencies or on diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. This could further expand investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector and help stabilize the market in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe preliminary approval of cash ether ETFs by the SEC represents an important step towards the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial markets.\n\nThe launch scheduled for July 23, 2024, is awaited with great interest by investors and industry operators, as it could mark a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the issuers will overcome the regulatory challenges and if they will manage to obtain the final approval from the SEC. In any case, the attention of the financial world will surely be focused on this historic event, which could open new perspectives for investment in cryptocurrencies."

Discover SCENE\n\nA blog post published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Wednesday urged prospective voters not to support political candidates simply because they call themselves pro-crypto.\n\nThe post elicited a wide range of reactions from crypto industry figureheads, and didn\u2019t sit well with some of the industry\u2019s more conservative voices\u2014particularly Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, an increasingly vocal backer of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cVitalik is an idealist, not a realist. He is one of the more politically naive people I have read and/or interacted with in crypto,\u201d Selkis told Decrypt. \u201cMoreover he\u2019s Canadian, and he\u2019s given thinly veiled permission to vote for the most provably authoritarian and anti-tech president in American history because he\u2019s intellectually overconfident but politically weak.\u201d\n\nSelkis co-founded the crypto market intelligence firm Messari in 2017. Over the past few years, he\u2019s emerged as a political heavyweight within the crypto industry, coordinating efforts to fund a crypto-friendly political action committee, while railing against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Twitter (aka X) for what advocates say is a regulatory war on crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \"pro-crypto\"https://t.co/rEbRjZYtFB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 17, 2024\n\nIn his blog post, titled \u201cAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \u2018pro-crypto,\u2019\u201d Buterin emphasized that supporting crypto isn\u2019t limited to the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies or blockchain tech.\n\nHe argued that a politician\u2019s stance on issues like privacy, internationalism, and even immigration are part of the larger \u201ccypherpunk\u201d picture\u2014and that a candidate simply claiming they\u2019re \u201cpro-crypto\u201d to get more votes isn\u2019t a very meaningful embrace of those values.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter if they also support banning encrypted messaging, if they are a power-seeking narcissist, or if they push for bills that make it even harder for your Chinese or Indian friend to attend the next crypto conference,\u201d Buterin wrote of a presiding political dialogue in the U.S. \u201cAll that politicians have to do is make sure it's easy for you to trade coins.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at venture capital firm Variant Fund, replied on Twitter that Buterin\u2019s post had \u201csolid points,\u201d but that some readers were likely to draw a conclusion that Buterin himself did not explicitly state.\n\n\u201cToo many people will read the headline as \u2018Vote Biden!\u2019 and miss the rest,\u201d Chervinsky wrote.\n\nAnother headline for this could have been \"Don't sacrifice your cypherpunk ethos for a particular 'pro-crypto' politician or policy proposal.\" I entirely agree with that principle. Politicians will come and go. Privacy, speech, and the rule of law must be preserved. https://t.co/QrrBwoDNGu \u2014 Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) July 17, 2024\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a non-profit focused on crypto policy issues, recommended an alternative headline for Buterin\u2019s post.\n\n\"Don't sacrifice your cypherpunk ethos for a particular 'pro-crypto' politician or policy proposal,\u201d Van Valkenburgh suggested on Twitter. \u201cPoliticians will come and go. Privacy, speech, and the rule of law must be preserved.\u201d\n\nIncentives aligned?\n\nCastle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter wrote that crypto already aligns with his \u201clibertarian/conservative values,\u201d and that it only makes sense that Republicans would embrace it. He also argued that Trump has surrounded himself with politicians that are \u201cauthentically pro-crypto,\u201d such as his vice presidential pick Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and the one-time presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nButerin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nOn Twitter, Selkis has described November\u2019s coming choice between President Joe Biden and Trump as an existential moment for crypto. On Wednesday, he wrote his \u201cpolitical allegiances [are] based on who is mentally competent to be commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI also like Trump's evolution on crypto,\u201d the CEO added.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Vitalik's political commentary is meaningless to me, and should be to you as well if your primary focus is American politics. He is a Canadian and Russian. I humbly suggest that he fix those governments first, and stay out of American politics. \u2014 Ryan Selkis (d/acc) \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@twobitidiot) July 17, 2024\n\nIndeed the former president has changed his tune on crypto since saying Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam\u201d in 2021. Accepting crypto donations now while defending the industry, Trump is set to be a headline speaker at next week\u2019s Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nFollowing the failed assassination attempt against Trump by Thomas Matthew Crooks during a Pennsylvania rally Saturday, Selkis\u2019 comments drew mixed reactions. \u201cThe Civil War for the country started today,\u201d Selkis wrote, prior to posting, \u201cPraying for peace. Preparing for war.\u201d\n\nWithout explicitly naming any politician, Buterin wrote that a politician\u2019s thoughts on crypto years ago are a relevant gauge for future expectations. How a politician acts when supporting freedom and supporting corporations are at odds with each other is telling too, he wrote.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of decentralization among crypto pioneers like Satoshi Nakamoto, Buterin reprised a quote from the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He described Nakamoto\u2019s response to someone doubting cryptography\u2019s ability to solve political problems as a rare statement on the subject, and an early lesson that informed crypto\u2019s core values.\n\n\u201cWe can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom,\u201d Satoshi wrote of peer-to-peer networks. \u201cGovernments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure [peer-to-peer] networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for writing this,\u201d Linda Xie, the co-founder of Bountycaster, a bounty service for the decentralized social media network Farcaster, wrote on Twitter. Previously, she posted, \u201cI'm not a single-issue voter on crypto and won't support someone just because they are pro-crypto.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing Buterin\u2019s blog post, Selkis wagered that Buterin wouldn\u2019t debate him because it would reveal \u201chow little he understands politics outside of textbooks.\u201d Still, Selkis pondered whether Buterin could present himself one day as \u201ca debate equal.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warns against voting on crypto policy, as a16z founders endorse Trump - Fortune",
        "content": "One of crypto\u2019s most influential voices has warned the industry to refrain from voting for political candidates based solely on their digital asset policies. In a blog published Wednesday, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin argues that electing candidates simply for being crypto \u201cfriendly\u201d could hurt the industry more in the long-run. Considering whether candidates are ideologically at-odds with what crypto stands for, is more important than if they endorse the right to trade coins in the here and now, he argues.\n\n\u201cIf you care about freedom, you might want the government to respect your freedom to have the kind of family you want. If you care about building more efficient and equitable economies, you might want to look at the implications of that in housing,\u201d he continues. Buterin added that losing site of these bigger questions could lead crypto voters to lose sight of the ideals that \u201coriginally created crypto in the first place.\u201d\n\nIn his view, crypto payments are just one iteration of the decentralization movement\u2019s larger ideological goal of freedom, and a party\u2019s commitment to protecting this goal is what should be on the ballot. \u201cDecentralized networks are good at protecting freedom, and money is an important sphere where such networks can be applied \u2013 but it\u2019s one important sphere among several,\u201d he writes.\n\nAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \"pro-crypto\"https://t.co/rEbRjZYtFB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 17, 2024\n\nTrump, who has committed to be the \u201ccrypto president,\u201d will speak at Bitcoin 2024 next week, an annual conference that also serves as a tribal gathering for fans of the original cryptocurrency. Details of what he will discuss have not been disclosed. David Bailey, CEO, BTC Inc., the organizer of the Bitcoin Conference, told Fortune in a statement that Trump will \u201cshare his vision for the future of the American Bitcoin industry and its impact on the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nIn his blog post, Buterin also listed examples of technologies that should also be protected in the name of freedom, beyond just crypto and blockchains. This includes encrypted messaging, privacy from centralized AI companies, and prediction markets and Community Notes that he argues help people form \u201chigh-quality opinions about important topics in an adversarial environment.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s appeal to higher ideals, however, was quickly met with suggestions he was ignoring political reality.\n\n\u201cMuch of this seems too clever by half. Good crypto policy requires electing pro-crypto candidates, period. Political reality beats idealism every time,\u201d responded prominent crypto layer Jake Chervinsky on X. Another user added, \u201cThe underlying goal has to be mass adoption, which requires good policy. The tech is inherently democratic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sorry mum\u2019\n\nButerin\u2019s blog comes just one day after Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, co-founders of tech venture capital firm a16z, announced their endorsement of Donald Trump on a podcast. \u201cFor little tech, we think Donald Trump is actually the right choice. Sorry mum, I know you\u2019re going to be mad at me for this, but we had to do it,\u201d Horowitz said. On that same podcast, Andreessen expressed his fears over how the Democrats might regulate Silicon Valley: \u201cMy big concern is what we saw in crypto was the foreshadowing of what\u2019s gonna happen in AI.\u201d\n\nThe a16z founders aren\u2019t the first prominent members of the industry to make their support for Trump public.\n\n\u201cI am going to vote for the person who\u2019s going to do the best job for our economy\u2026I am a voter when it comes to economics, and on that basis, Trump.\u201d ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said during an interview with YouTuber Kevin Paffrath last month.\n\nIn addition, this week it was reported that Tesla CEO and meme coin enthusiast Elon Musk is donating $45 million per month to a new pro-Trump super political action committee, called America PAC. Further donors to the lobbying group include the Winklevoss twins, who founded crypto exchange Gemini, and former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Kelly Craft, who has lobbied on behalf of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nProminent crypto figures turning to Trump is also indicative of a wider shift. A June survey by Paradigm found that 13% of Republican swing voters are now more convinced to vote for him in light of his recent crypto conversion. Moreover, just over one third of Republicans view crypto positively, the survey found."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Is $3.7K Realistic for ETH or is a Correction to $3K Coming? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following a revival in buying interest and demand, Ethereum\u2019s price has surged, reclaiming the 100 and 200-day moving averages.\n\nThis price action suggests a shift towards a potential rally, with buyers targeting a new yearly high in the mid-term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA detailed analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals that after a notable increase in buying pressure near the substantial $3K support region, the cryptocurrency initiated a bullish spike, surpassing the 100-day ($3340) and 200-day ($3152) moving averages.\n\nAdditionally, ETH has reclaimed the significant resistance region of $3.5K, a crucial barrier for buyers in recent months. This price action indicates a strong buyer presence in the market, aiming for a new yearly high.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has formed a sideways wedge pattern over the recent months. It is expected to continue its upswing after a short-term period of market consolidation, aiming to breach the wedge\u2019s upper boundary at $3.7K. Successfully surpassing this level could lead to a new yearly high above $4K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, an increase in bullish momentum led to an impulsive surge, breaking the multi-month descending trendline.\n\nThis impulsive move also saw the price reclaim the significant $3.3K resistance region, previously filled with supply. This development reflects strong buyer interest in the market, aiming for higher levels in the long run.\n\nHowever, Ethereum reached its prior major swing high in the 4-hour timeframe, resulting in sideways consolidation.\n\nThis swing serves as a robust resistance level, and breaking above it could pave the way for another impulsive surge toward the key $3.7K resistance zone. The ongoing consolidation phase is a positive sign for the market, confirming the recent breakout above the trendline and completing a pullback to it. If the price surpasses its prior central pivot of $3524, the continuation of the bullish movement will become imminent.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a bullish reversal, a closer examination is essential to determine if the bullish trend will persist. The chart highlights the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a crucial metric for evaluating futures market sentiment. Values above 1 indicate aggressive buying by bulls, while values below 1 suggest bearish selling pressure.\n\nAs depicted in the chart, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio surged above 1, simultaneously with the bullish revival in Ethereum\u2019s price. This surge indicates strong buying interest in the perpetual market, suggesting a notable bullish sentiment. If this upward trend in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio continues, it confirms a potential mid-term bullish trend in the market, with the price likely rallying toward higher values."

        "title": "How Will Ethereum Evolve In 2025? - Jumpstart Media",
        "content": "Ethereum is a leading cryptocurrency prized for its versatility and innovation, though traders should be mindful of potential price volatility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world, although a relatively new player in the realm of trading and investment, has nonetheless made a significant impact with its unique features. Operating on decentralized networks called blockchains, cryptocurrencies have introduced a new way of thinking about technology. While the practical applications of this system might not always seem as immediately obvious as the buzzworthy technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse, blockchain is nonetheless a core component of a significant tech revolution\u2014one that is reshaping the economy and tech sector entirely.\n\nDespite its origins in the crypto space, blockchain technology is expected to evolve beyond its current scope, promising to revolutionize payment systems and financial infrastructures. An ideal future might see a hybrid model that integrates traditional financial mechanisms with blockchain\u2019s novel features to enhance transactional efficiency and security.\n\nBlockchain facilitates direct asset transfers without the need for third-party oversight, but its decentralized nature also introduces volatility and price fluctuations. These aspects have deterred some potential traders and led others to minimize their transactions to avoid significant losses. For blockchain to be viable for daily transactions, it must advance to be both safer and compliant with established market standards.\n\nBeyond the financial industry, researchers believe blockchain can also be transformative for other industries by enhancing market efficiency and transparency. It simplifies global supply chains by reducing errors, improves tracking, ensures secure record-keeping and even enables personalized loyalty programs, to name a few. While challenges such as scalability and interoperability remain, ongoing advancements are expected to address these hurdles.\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrencies, one of their major draws is their independence from any central authority. This autonomy is particularly appealing to investors who value anonymity and security, as no institution or individual can seize their digital assets on the blockchain\u2014except in criminal cases, of course. This feature is crucial in regions plagued by significant inflation, currency devaluation or authoritarian regimes.\n\nAdmittedly, the prices of cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and unpredictable due to their decentralized nature. Therefore, investors must be well-prepared and adopt sophisticated strategies to grow their portfolios. For those invested in Ethereum (ETH), understanding the Ethereum price prediction for 2025 is vital for crafting a long-term investment plan that aims to maximize gains and minimize losses.\n\nEthereum\u2019s role and innovations\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, trailing only behind Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH is not just used for trading. Ethereum is celebrated for its innovation and ingenuity, even outside of the crypto community. The Ethereum network has facilitated the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the concepts of decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nOperating as an open-source network, Ethereum incorporates smart contract functionality that is pivotal for DeFi. It is continuously upgraded and maintained by teams of validators, who are compensated with Ethereum tokens for their efforts. Without their assistance, transactions wouldn\u2019t move on the system. These tokens, often referred to as gas fees, incentivize the community to keep the network secure and efficient. Unfortunately, the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to increased demand and higher gas fees, which can make Ethereum less accessible to some investors.\n\nDespite high gas fees, many believe that Ethereum\u2019s robust and secure system justifies the cost. The platform\u2019s high security and continuous upgrades make it one of the most reliable blockchain systems worldwide.\n\nMarket trends and price action\n\n2022 has been a difficult year for Ethereum as it navigated through a bear market and the subsequent crypto winter. In 2023, much effort went towards consolidation, as there\u2019s no way to build and achieve growth without having a firm foundation first. Nonetheless, the prices ultimately remained relatively low.\n\nHowever, by the beginning of 2024, Ethereum\u2019s value started to climb as a result of the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This had long been anticipated by market participants for around a decade and was expected to have far-reaching effects on the market.\n\nThis approval helped Bitcoin reach new all-time highs, while altcoins like Ethereum managed to break through some key resistance levels. As of June 26, Ethereum has stabilized at the US$3,400 mark, with projections estimating continued growth throughout the rest of the year. The general consensus among experts is that Ethereum could get to US$20,500 by the end of the decade. This ambitious goal reflects confidence in Ethereum\u2019s unique model and scalability solutions that continue to attract investors.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025\n\nFor cryptocurrency investors, both the short-term and long-term outlooks are crucial. Common forecasts suggest that Ethereum will hit US$5,000 by December of this year before climbing even higher in 2025. The much anticipated official approval of Ethereum-backed ETFs is expected to significantly influence this growth, though investors should stay alert to potential market corrections.\n\nBy 2025, ETH might reach a new peak at US$6,500, with its price likely oscillating between US$4,500 and US$5,500 on average. These fluctuations present opportunities to buy more and strategically expand your asset portfolio. Generally speaking, while the market\u2019s direction in 2025 remains uncertain, an upswing could significantly enhance Ethereum\u2019s price potential, whereas a bearish trend could lead to modest pullbacks.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, staying informed and adaptable is key to achieving a positive outcome.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHeader Image from Unsplash"

        "content": "With the Ethereum ETF set to debut next week, the market is waiting to see how its impact compares to that of Bitcoin. Indeed, BTC became the first crypto to get spot ETF approval in the United States, breaking the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) rejection streak in January.\n\nThere is no denying the impact that Bitcoin had on the market after its debut. Just three months after launch, the leading crypto surged to a $73,000 price, setting a new all-time high mark. Yet, one expert predicts that the upcoming crypto ETF could actually be more impressive.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs Expected to Officially Launch July 23\n\nEthereum ETF to Have a Bigger Impact Than BTC?\n\nEarlier this month, Kraken\u2019s head of strategy, Thomas Perfumo, told Bloomberg that Ethereum\u2019s ETF was a \u201crising tide lifts all boats,\u201d situation. He reinforces the importance of the arrival, and what it means for crypto. Now many have wondered if the Ethereum ETF could actually have a bigger impact than its Bitcoin counterpart.\n\nOne such person who believes in its potential is Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a recent report, the executive highlighted what the crypto market could expect from the product. Moreover, he discussed how it could be the biggest crypto-based ETF yet.\n\n\u201cThe first few weeks could be choppy, as money may flow out of $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) after it converts to an ETP,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cBy year-end, I\u2019m confident the new highs will be in,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Says SEC is Open to Solana ETF After Ethereum Launch\n\nAfter discussing the impact that Bitcoin had on the market, Hougan asked if ETh could \u201csee the same sort of impact,\u201d when it arrives. He answered, saying he thinks, \u201cIt might be bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the new Ethereum ETPs will attract billions. And I think the money flowing into these new ETPs will have a bigger impact than it did with Bitcoin,\u201d he stated. Hougan notes that lower short-term inflation rates and ETH staking play a role. It will be interesting to observe, as crypto could be heading toward a monumental bull rally."

        "title": "Launch of Ethereum ETFs Announced, Crypto Rebounds Over 20%! Analysis from July 17, 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Wed 17 Jul 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter reaching the lower part of its range, Ethereum rebounded by nearly 22%. Let\u2019s examine together the future outlook for ETH.\n\nSituation of Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nAfter reaching the lower part of its range around $2,900, a zone mentioned in the bearish hypothesis of the analysis of June 26, Ethereum attracted buying interest allowing it to rebound by more than 22%. In less than two weeks, the crypto price regained $3,500. It seems that this increase was accelerated by the announcement of the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs. Now, ETH has stabilized around its resistance. The most significant value zones are located on both sides of the crypto: below the current price, one can note $3,065. Above, one can identify the $3,800 zone.\n\nA value zone is a price range rich in volumes that can act as a key level for investors.\n\nAt the time of writing this text, the price of Ethereum is trading just below $3,500. The latest fluctuations of ETH show a short-term bearish trend on the verge of being reversed, which could thus signal a continuation of the medium and long-term bullish trend of the crypto. These statements can be supported by the fact that Ethereum has managed to reposition itself above the 200-day moving average. Unsurprisingly, the dynamics of Ethereum have resumed with more fervor, as evidenced by its price and oscillators. All these elements undeniably demonstrate a resurgence of buying interest in Ethereum.\n\n\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market, now an instructor at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. There, you will find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest in perpetual contracts on Ethereum seems to have followed the trajectory of its underlying asset\u2019s price. This indicates an increase in speculative activity on ETH. Considering Ethereum\u2019s recent rise, the predominantly seller liquidations, as well as a positive funding rate, the optimism surrounding Ethereum is evident. One can naturally conclude that this interest in ETH/USDT contracts is mostly buying-oriented, thus reinforcing the conviction of continuing the bullish momentum of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USDT\n\nThe liquidation heatmap of ETH/USDT over three months reveals that the previously identified liquidation zone at $2,850 has been reached and likely sparked buying interest. Now, the most prominent liquidation zones are mainly above the current price of Ethereum. Notable are the zones between $3,500 and $3,600, and just above, between $3,650 and $3,750. Higher, the most significant zone is at $3,900. Below the current price, $3,000 can still be noted. Approaching these levels could trigger massive orders, increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones, therefore, represent crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf the price of Ethereum stays above $3,065, one could anticipate a continuation of the bullish trend leading to a break above $3,500. The next resistance to consider would then be around $3,700 or even $3,800. If the bullish movement continues, it could reach $4,000 or even $4,100. At this point, this would represent an increase of more than 18%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to stay above $3,065, one could foresee a return around $2,900. The next support to take into account, if the bearish movement continues, would be around $2,800. Lower, the support at $2,720 can be noted. At this point, this would represent a decrease of about 21%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter reintegrating the lower part of its range, Ethereum demonstrated a significant rebound. The crypto\u2019s buying interest thus seems to have strengthened, supported by recent announcements and a medium to long-term bullish trend that seems to be continuing. Therefore, optimism seems to dominate regarding the cryptocurrency\u2019s future. However, it will be crucial to closely observe the price reaction to various key levels to confirm or refute current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant against potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Lastly, let us remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also change rapidly based on more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Pectra Devnet nears launch: Will ETH climb higher? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Developers continued to work on Plectra upgrade for the Ethereum network.\n\nChanges in staking rewards were discussed to mitigate centralization and other risks to the network.\n\nApart from the market recovery, the increasing attention around Ethereum [ETH] has helped it soar over the past few days. The upcoming Plectra update could further help Ethereum see green.\n\nDevelopers continue with their work\n\nIn the 137th All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the primary focus was on the progress of two testnets, Pectra Devnet 1 and PeerDAS Devnet 1.\n\nPectra Devnet 1 is nearing its launch, with both Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL) clients prepared. The Ethereum Foundation DevOps team is rigorously testing various client combinations to ensure compatibility and stability.\n\nPeerDAS Devnet 1 is currently undergoing bug fixes before its planned relaunch. Once these issues are resolved, the devnet is expected to be restarted by the end of the week.\n\nIn addition to testnet updates, the call also covered research on fork choice testing by the TxRX team at Consensys. Their newly developed test generator aims to identify potential bugs and deviations in client software from CL specifications.\n\nThe successful launch of Pectra Devnet 1 is a significant step towards the Pectra upgrade, which is expected to introduce several improvements to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe ongoing development of the fork choice test generator is crucial for enhancing the reliability and security of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNew changes for stakers\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is also considering adjusting its staking rewards to maintain a lower staking rate, potentially around 25% or 12.5%.\n\nThis change could have a substantial impact on the returns ETH holders receive from staking. The Ethereum Foundation is exploring this option to address several concerns.\n\nA lower staking rate is seen as a way to mitigate the risk of centralization, where a significant portion of ETH becomes concentrated in a few large staking pools.\n\nThis centralization could potentially threaten the network\u2019s security and decentralization.\n\nAdditionally, a lower staking rate might reduce the likelihood of a mass slashing event leading to a chain split, a scenario where ETH holders might pressure the protocol to restore lost funds.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,455.17 and its price had grown by 1.16% in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent surge in price, the network growth for the Ethereum token had declined, suggesting that new addresses were slowly losing interest in the ETH token.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nMoreover, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen significantly, implying that the frequency at which ETH was trading at had also fallen.\n\nIf these trends continue, ETH\u2019s chances of rallying further would diminish even further."

        "content": "Crypto tokens added nearly 4% to market capitalization, pushing it to $2.52 trillion as traders digest news of the shooting at Donald Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF approval is expected this week, fueling the anticipation of Ether token holders and crypto traders.\n\nBitcoin sustains above $65,000 as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP extend gains on Wednesday.\n\nCrypto market capitalization increased nearly 4% in the last 24 hours and climbed to $2.522 trillion on Wednesday, as seen on CoinGecko. Almost all cryptocurrencies ranked in the top 10 assets by market capitalization have rallied in that period.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains have likely catalyzed rallies in Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, among other assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $65,260, and Ethereum, Solana, and XRP extend recent gains.\n\nAdditionally, Spot Ethereum ETF approval is anticipated this week, and this is likely the other key market mover for the assets.\n\nEthereum, Solana, and XRP rally amidst ETF hype, Donald Trump rally incident\n\nETF experts and analysts believe that a Spot Ethereum ETF approval is likely this week. As anticipation brews, Ether holders and traders expect gains, and the sentiment is positive, as seen on cryptoeq.io.\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, believes that the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely approve the ETF by Thursday, July 18.\n\nWe don't have a new over/under launch date yet because we haven't heard what the SEC's game plan is. Hope to hear soon. But if you forced me gun to head style to give my best guess for date I'd go with July 18th. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\nCrypto traders are likely digesting the news of the events that unfolded at former US President and candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rally on Saturday, as the shooting was followed by a rally in crypto prices. Analysts at on-chain data tracker Santiment attributed this to traders anticipating Trump\u2019s win in the November 2024 Presidential elections and his pro-crypto stance.\n\nFormer US President Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech at a Bitcoin Conference later this month, on July 27. The Presidential candidate is expected to deliver his speech in Tennessee, in person, despite injuries sustained at the shooting.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum, Solana and XRP extended gains by 3.2%, 4.1% and 12% respectively, per CoinGecko data. The three assets have positive returns for the last seven days period.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and XRP extend gains\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,488, hitting a new two-week high at $3,517 previously on the day, while XRP touched a three-month high at $0.6188."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nTL; DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) surges above $3,400 as market sentiment improves\n\nSolana (SOL) retreats to $155 despite analysts predicting a move to $200.\n\nClandeno (CLD) is tipped to outperform the market with 40X gains after listing.\n\nEnthusiasm has returned to the crypto market after the failed assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump. This caused major cryptocurrencies to hit key price levels. Ethereum (ETH) surpassed $3,400 while Solana (SOL) marched towards the $160 mark.\n\nThis market excitement has spilled to Clandeno (CLD), a new blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Analysts laud Clandeno (CLD) as the best new cryptocurrency to buy during its live ICO. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) investors are partially booking profits to buy CLD tokens in anticipation of the predicted 40X surge.\n\nWill Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Clandeno (CLD) turn out to be the best altcoins to invest in? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Smashes $3,400\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $410 billion, was one of the biggest gainers in the past few days. Trading at $3,395 at press time, Ethereum (ETH) is up 10% in the past week. Ethereum (ETH) is taking a breather after reaching a high of $3,490 on July 16.\n\nInvestors are optimistic that Ethereum (ETH) could soon reach $4,000 as ETH spot ETFs are rumored to start trading on July 23. This will be a major win for Ethereum (ETH) and new cryptocurrencies such as Clandeno (CLD). Clandeno (CLD) is tipped for massive growth, while Ethereum (ETH) can only register modest gains for its holders.\n\nSolana (SOL) Corrects After Reaching $160\n\nSolana (SOL) jumped from $134.17 on July 12 to $160 on July 16. This marked a 19.2% jump. However, Solana (SOL) has surrendered its gains, retreating to $155.17 at press time. Analysts have come in full force, predicting that Solana (SOL) is headed to the $200 price level.\n\nSolana (SOL) is one of the best-performing assets over the last year, surging 454%. Expert analysts claim that Solana (SOL) has limited growth potential. Bullish analysts are predicting a move to $80,000 for Bitcoin. New cryptocurrencies such as Clandeno (CLD) will see huge gains when leading cryptos surge.\n\nAs Solana (SOL) corrects, investors are leaning towards Clandeno\u2019s (CLD) live ICO.\n\nClandeno (CLD) is Set for 40X Growth\n\nClandeno (CLD) is set to transform the e-commerce industry by offering launching an innovative blockchain-based online marketplace. The new e-commerce platform will focus on addressing several challenges affecting the industry. Clandeno (CLD) will have unmatched transaction efficiency, improved security and decentralized governance.\n\nApart from its user-centric approach, Clandeno (CLD) is focused on delivering a great investor experience. This starts with launching CLD, a native token with several utilities within the Clandeno (CLD) ecosystem. With a total supply of only 525 million CLD tokens, investors are guaranteed price appreciation. The Clandeno (CLD) team will lock the liquidity pool for 20 years and team tokens for 2.5 years.\n\nInvestors are flocking to buy CLD tokens during the initial coin offering because Clandeno (CLD) is poised for 40X growth. Clandeno (CLD) has a practical utility and a growing community of investors to see an exponential price surge during the crypto bull run.\n\n\n\nTo find out more about the Clandeno presale, visit their website here.\n\n*This article was paid for.

The Ethereum [ETH] launch is set for 23rd July, according to a renowned crypto analyst. This milestone comes after Bitcoin\u2019s ETF success.\n\nAmidst these developments, VanEck\u2019s recent filing for a Solana ETF has intensified market anticipation.\n\nSolana in the Spotlight\n\nAs Ethereum takes center stage, Solana [SOL] emerges as the next potential ETF candidate. Known for its speed and low costs, Solana could be the third major crypto to secure an ETF.\n\nThis prospect has already boosted Solana\u2019s market position and investor interest.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, recently replied to an ETF approval week tweet and added more fuel to the Ethereum ETF launch speculations. In the tweet, he stated that the the launch could be on 23rd July.\n\nSocial buzz and whale activity\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Solana\u2019s social volume data shows recent stability with a slight downward trend.\n\nHowever, whale holdings have increased since January. The total supply held by whales stood at 42% of the total supply at press time.\n\nThis indicated strong institutional interest despite waning social volume trends, which may result from Ethereum stealing public attention.\n\nSolana correlation insights\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Hyblock buy volume in the last two years indicated that the correlation between Ethereum and Solana stood at 0.44. This suggests a moderately positive relationship between the two giants.\n\nThe connection could benefit SOL as Ethereum\u2019s ETF launch approaches, potentially driving increased interest in both assets.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, Solana was trading around $160.79, forming a bullish pennant pattern. The recent breakout above key resistance signals potential for further gains.\n\nIf it breaks through the bullish pennant resistance, the rally will continue. Both the RSI and MACD indicators support an optimistic bullish outlook."

Buterin\u2019s argument highlights the risks of such a narrow focus and emphasizes the broader values that originally motivated the creation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nButerin acknowledges that \u201ccrypto\u201d has become an increasingly significant topic in political discourse, with various jurisdictions considering legislation to regulate blockchain activities. He mentions examples such as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) in the EU, efforts to regulate stablecoins in the UK, and the regulatory actions by the SEC in the United States. While he views many of these legislative efforts as mostly reasonable, he expresses concern over extreme measures like treating almost all coins as securities or banning self-hosted wallets. These fears have driven the crypto community to become more politically active, favoring candidates who are lenient towards crypto.\n\nHowever, Buterin argues against this trend, asserting that making political decisions based solely on a candidate\u2019s crypto stance risks betraying the deeper values that drew people to the crypto space. He notes that within the crypto community, there is often an overemphasis on the centrality of money and the freedom to hold and spend it. While he agrees that financial freedom is crucial, he cautions that an exclusive focus on cryptocurrency is not aligned with the original ideology that inspired the creation of crypto.\n\nButerin traces the roots of cryptocurrency back to the cypherpunk movement, which advocated for free and open technology to protect and enhance individual freedoms. He recalls the early battles against restrictive copyright legislation and the importance of decentralization, citing a statement from Satoshi Nakamoto that emphasizes the power of peer-to-peer networks. Bitcoin, according to Buterin, was seen as an extension of this spirit, offering a decentralized means of online payment.\n\nHe argues that the ideology that originally created crypto was about more than just financial freedom; it encompassed a broader vision of decentralization and individual liberty. Buterin points out that there are other technological freedoms just as foundational as financial freedom, such as the freedom and privacy of communication, digital identity, and thought. He stresses that these freedoms are increasingly important as more of our lives become mediated by technology, particularly AI.\n\nButerin urges the crypto community to remember these broader goals and not to reduce their political engagement to a single issue. He argues that supporting a politician simply because they are pro-crypto can lead to aligning with values that contradict the foundational principles of the crypto movement. For instance, he says, a politician who supports crypto for the wrong reasons might also advocate for policies that undermine other freedoms.\n\nHe also discusses the importance of internationalism, a value dear to many in the cypherpunk community. Buterin highlights how cryptocurrency can contribute to global economic equality by providing access to financial systems for people in poorer countries. He cautions that politicians who favor protectionist policies, such as tariffs, may harm internationalism even if they are pro-crypto.\n\nButerin emphasizes the need to evaluate politicians on a broader set of values beyond their stance on cryptocurrency. He suggests looking at their positions on other related issues, such as encrypted messaging and digital privacy, and considering whether their overall vision aligns with the values of decentralization and individual freedom."

        "content": "Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,500 resistance zone. ETH is consolidating above the $3,380 support and might attempt another increase.\n\nEthereum is correcting gains and struggling near the $3,500 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,375 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise unless there is a close below the $3,350 support.\n\nEthereum Price Fails To Surpass $3,500\n\nEthereum price made another attempt to clear the $3,500 resistance zone. ETH struggled to continue higher above $3,500 and started a downside correction like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $3,450 and $3,420 levels.\n\nThe price even dipped below $3,400 and tested $3,375. A low is formed at $3,376 and the price is consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,516 swing high to the $3,376 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,375 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,375 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $3,450 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,516 swing high to the $3,376 high.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,480 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,500 level. A close above the $3,500 level might send Ether toward the $3,550 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,640. An upside break above the $3,640 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,750 resistance zone in the coming days.\n\nMore Downsides In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,450 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,380 and the trend line.\n\nThe first major support sits near the $3,350 zone. A clear move below the $3,350 support might push the price toward $3,270. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,150.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,380\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,450"
