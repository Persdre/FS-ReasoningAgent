        "title": "Solana takes on Ethereum as \u2018DEX war\u2019 takes new turn - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Activity on Jupiter, Solana\u2019s biggest DEX, trumped Ethereum-based Uniswap\u2019s numbers\n\nETH\u2019s volume remained higher than SOL\u2019s, while JUP and UNI sentiment differed\n\nJupiter, a decentralized exchange built on the Solana blockchain, has overtaken Uniswap as the DEX with the highest number of Unique Active Wallets (UAWs). AMBCrypto noticed this after looking at data from DappRadar.\n\nAt press time, UAWs on Jupiter exchanges were over 205,000. Uniswap, built on Ethereum [ETH], had less than 170,000.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nUAW measures the crypto-wallet addresses that interact with a network or applications. If the metric increases, it implies a rise in user activity. On the other hand, a decrease suggests dwindling attention.\n\nAs can be seen below, Jupiter\u2019s active wallets rose over the last 24 hours while Uniswap\u2019s declined. However, this is not just about the DEXs mentioned. Instead, it speaks more of the competition between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nFor years, Ethereum dominated Solana on this front. However, this cycle has been different, and there are reasons attached to it too. For starters, Solana has been the chain producing most of the top memecoins.\n\nWhile a few have appeared on the Vitalik Buterin-developed blockchain, it has not been able to match Solana. For instance, you could mention dogwifhat [WIF], Bonk [BONK], and Popcat [POPCAT] as some of the memecoins that have grown incredibly on Solana. On the other hand, PEPE seems like the only major one that has come out of the other.\n\nBeyond the emergence of tokens, another factor that has played a part is the transaction fees. Investigations revealed that the cheap fees Solana offers has helped with retaining traders. Though fees on Ethereum are now lower than before, it\u2019s still nowhere close to what Solana\u2019s fees are.\n\nSimply put, the DEX takeover happened as a result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThat being said, on-chain data also revealed that Ethereum\u2019s volume is still much higher than Solana\u2019s.\n\nETH, UNI, overtake SOL, JUP on some fronts\n\nAt press time, Solana\u2019s volume was $3.32 billion. Ethereum, on the other hand, registered a figure of $12.39 billion. On the price front though, SOL led ETH in terms of growth.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was changing hands at $139.03 \u2014 A 537.65% hike in the last 365 days. Within the same period, ETH\u2019s price appreciated by \u2018just\u2019 61.10%.\n\nShould this performance remain the same in months to come, then SOL could topple ETH all through this cycle. However, it is important to note that the DEXs mentioned have their native tokens too.\n\nFor Jupiter, the ticker is JUP. Uniswap\u2019s UNI is more popular as it is a lot \u201colder\u2019 than the former. At the time of writing, JUP\u2019s price was $1.02, representing a 75.53% hike in the last 90 days.\n\nMeanwhile, UNI changed hands at $7.08 following a 14.54% hike within the same period. Regardless of the price action though, the Weighted Sentiment of Solana-based JUP was negative.\n\nEthereum-based UNI was in the green, indicating that market participants are more bullish on it than JUP. However, sentiment without action might not affect prices as JUP might continue to outperform UNI.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nFor Ethereum and Solana, the battle might not stop anytime soon. Ergo, participants might need to keep an eye out for developments on their respective blockchains."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Saw a Huge Surge as Furrever Token Hits $1 Million Presale Milestone, Launches $10,000 Competition - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nDespite recent turbulence in the crypto markets, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a remarkable surge in prices over the past two days. This unexpected rally comes amidst a backdrop of uncertainty, indicating renewed investor confidence in these leading cryptocurrencies. Adding to the fervor, Furrever Token (FURR) has achieved a significant milestone, surpassing $1 million in presale funding, and has now launched a lucrative $10,000 competition, further igniting excitement in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's Resilience Shines as Whales Drive Market Surge: What's Next for Crypto?\n\nAmidst recent market turbulence, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged resilient, witnessing a remarkable surge driven by whale activity. On May 3, the total market value soared to $2.18 trillion, propelled by a 10% increase in Bitcoin's price to approximately $64,300.75. Notably, over $2.8 billion worth of BTC was accumulated by whales within 24 hours, signaling renewed confidence in the market. Analysts interpret indicators such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Bollinger Bands, foreseeing a potential short-term turnaround.\n\nDespite recent corrections, market intelligence suggests key support levels and hints at a rebound, fostering optimism among investors. As Bitcoin trades at $61,721, attention turns to sustaining momentum above $59.7K, with the community eagerly anticipating further market growth and potential milestones.\n\nEthereum's Regulatory Challenges and Price Dynamics: Insights for Investors\n\nAmidst its pivotal role in the crypto landscape, Ethereum (ETH) faces a complex interplay of regulatory hurdles and market dynamics, offering crucial insights for investors. Currently trading at $3,158.07 with a 6% increase since yesterday, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $373 billion. However, the path to launching Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain, with regulatory approval prospects cast into doubt by analysts like Bloomberg's James Seyffart. Seyffart suggests that approval for spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024 is improbable, potentially delayed until 2025, citing cautious behavior from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum's price trajectory reflects this uncertainty, experiencing fluctuations within a ranging channel, with bullish signals indicating potential for testing new highs. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands provide further insights into Ethereum's market momentum and consolidation phase. As Ethereum navigates through regulatory challenges and market fluctuations, its future outlook remains a subject of intense interest, with regulatory decisions poised to significantly impact adoption and integration of Ethereum-based financial products.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): Pioneering Cuteness in Crypto with $1 Million Presale Success and $10,000 Frenzy Bonanza Competition\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has rapidly ascended as a darling of the investor community, captivating enthusiasts with its innovative approach and endearing charm.

        "content": "Sat 04 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum is distinguished by an operation of remarkable audacity in the crypto sphere: the burning of 12.7 billion dollars\u2019 worth of ETH. This strategic move, far from being a mere supply reduction, reveals a profound vision and a commitment to the stability and longevity of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum and the Reduction of Its Crypto Supply\n\nThe burning of ETH, implemented following a major upgrade of Ethereum thousand days ago, involves the destruction of a portion of the transaction fees.\n\nThis process no longer rewards the miners with these fees, but rather removes them from circulation, inducing a notable deflationary effect.\n\nTo date, approximately 4.3 million ETH have been eliminated, marking a decisive shift in the platform\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nThis reduction in supply aims to increase the scarcity of the ETH crypto, which, theoretically, could support or increase its value in the market.\n\nComparable to stock buybacks in the financial world, this strategy can promote an appreciation of the price, thereby offering investors an opportunity for gain, provided the demand remains stable or increases.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s reaction to this massive burn has been predominantly positive, interpreted as a sign of maturity and responsibility on the part of Ethereum\u2019s developers.\n\nBy controlling inflation and reinforcing user trust, Ethereum solidifies its position as a leader among alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nEconomic and Technical Implications\n\nThrough this burn, Ethereum also improves the security and stability of its network. This makes a majority control less attractive in a Proof of Stake framework. Thus, the ETH crypto becomes more resistant to manipulation attempts, ensuring greater reliability for large-scale transactions.\n\nThe burning process also acts as a catalyst for innovation. By adjusting its economic structure, Ethereum encourages developers to design cost-optimized decentralized applications (dApps), promoting the emergence of new uses and functionalities within the ecosystem.\n\nIn the long term, this strategy could redefine the economic landscape of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum positions itself as a technological platform and a strategic economic player, positively influencing its own economy and that of the sector more broadly.

        "title": "Bitcoin \u2013 This falling metric could be the key to Ethereum, Solana price rallies - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Top altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB registered major gains over the last 24 hours\n\nHowever, metrics and technical indicators weren\u2019t all bullish\n\nBitcoin\u2019s last 24 hours have been productive, with the cryptocurrency climbing back above $63,000 on the charts. As expected, most of the market\u2019s altcoins followed suit, with their charts seeing green as well. However, the latter\u2019s performances fueled a fall in Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] dominance. In fact, it hit such a critical level that a fresh altcoin season could be right around the corner now.\n\nAltcoin season is here\n\nCaptain Faibik, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the same, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is now moving inside a rising wedge pattern. What this means is that the chances of BTC dominance falling over the coming days are quite likely. This would be a positive sign for altcoins as their market cap is likely to surge then.\n\nMags, another famous crypto-analyst, also shared a tweet mentioning a historical event. The tweet stated that in 2020, the altcoin market was in an accumulation phase. That ended in the second half of the year, kick-starting a massive bull rally.\n\nThe analyst believes a similar trend can be seen this time around, further increasing the chances of an altcoin season soon. If the rally happens, then altcoins\u2019 market capitalization can be expected to hike dramatically.\n\nA look at the top altcoins\n\nTo see whether altcoins are preparing for a rally, what better way than to check the performance of the top alts? According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum [ETH], the king of altcoins, pushed its price up by more than 4.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $3,111.72 with a market cap of over $373 billion.\n\nLike ETH, BNB and Solana [SOL] also turned bullish as their values surged by 3.6% and 5%, respectively. At press time, BNB was trading at $586, while SOL\u2019s value rested at $145.2.\n\nHowever, it was surprising to note that despite the recent price upticks, investors\u2019 confidence in these top altcoins remained low. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH, SOL, and BNB\u2019s weighted sentiments all remained in the negative zone.\n\nHowever, the good news was that Ethereum\u2019s open interest rose slightly along with its price. A rise in this metric is usually a sign that the prevailing price trend is likely to continue.\n\nSOL\u2019s open interest took ETH\u2019s lead as it registered an uptick as well. On the contrary, the same for BNB fell, despite its price recording an uptick on the charts.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart to see whether it could sustain its bull run. We found that its Money Flow Index (MFI) went sideways after an uptick, while its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved south.\n\nThese suggested that investors might not see ETH\u2019s price rise explosively in the short term.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nSimilarly, Solana\u2019s technical indicators looked pretty bearish too. Both its MFI and CMF went south, indicating that the token\u2019s rally might not last.\n\nConsidering these data sets, it will be interesting to see how soon a fresh altcoin season comes along."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nIn the midst of recent turbulence in the crypto markets, characterized by a brief spell of uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have emerged as beacons of resilience, surging to new heights. However, amidst this soaring trajectory, Furrever Token (FURR) has ignited a fresh wave of excitement by unveiling a lucrative opportunity for investors: the chance to pocket a substantial $10,000 reward. As BTC and ETH continue their upward ascent, the allure of FURR's enticing competition adds an extra layer of intrigue to the already exhilarating world of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Rockets Towards $62,000 Amidst Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nAmidst a recent tumultuous period for the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) is staging an impressive rebound, surging by nearly 5% to reach around $61,857.26. This resurgence follows a sharp dip below $57,000, with BTC climbing 5.2% over the last 24 hours. Market analysts are closely eyeing the critical $62,000 level, identified as a key resistance point on BTC's daily chart. While some traders anticipate a bullish breakthrough, others caution against a strong rejection, emphasizing the significance of sustained volume and candlestick closure above this threshold.\n\nTechnical indicators and on-chain data suggest various levels of resistance and potential targets, with some analysts eyeing $82,000 as the initial objective. With signals of bullish momentum strengthening, Bitcoin's price action continues to draw attention, with a possible bull flag formation on the weekly chart signaling further upward potential towards all-time highs and beyond.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Regulatory Hurdles as SEC Decision Looms\n\nAmidst a backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,081.29, marking a 3.5% increase since yesterday. As the deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approaches, industry experts express skepticism regarding approval. Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor doubt the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs this May. Three prominent applicants, VanEck, Ark 21 Shares, and Hashdex Nasdaq, face hurdles as the SEC scrutinizes underlying securities issues, potentially leading to postponements rather than outright denials.\n\nConcerns are raised that Ethereum may be classified as a security by the SEC, a move that could impact not only Ethereum but also other major cryptocurrencies and ETF applicants. In contrast, Hong Kong's crypto market experiences significant growth, with nearly $300 million in weekly inflows following the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This divergence from the U.S. market, where spot Bitcoin ETFs face notable outflows, underscores the shifting dynamics of global crypto investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): A Whimsical Journey Through Presale Success and Cute Crypto Innovation\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is poised to captivate investors and accelerate through its remaining presale stages, leveraging a unique blend of charm and innovation. With a mission to infuse the crypto space with a delightful dose of cuteness, FURR transcends traditional use cases, offering users an irresistibly charming experience.\n\nIn a market dominated by serious blockchain projects, FURR stands out by fostering a warm and friendly community centered around the universal appeal of adorable cat imagery. The tokenomics of FURR are designed to incentivize participation, with 65% of tokens available during the presale, creating ample opportunities for early investors to secure their stake in this whimsical ecosystem. Moreover, the team's commitment to transparency and longevity is evident through the allocation of 10% of tokens, locked for a year, reassuring the community of their dedication.\n\nThe launch on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PancakeSwap further enhances accessibility and liquidity, ensuring a seamless experience for investors. Held on the Gleam platform, the competition spans 7 days, offering participants the opportunity to accumulate points by completing various tasks.

        "title": "Ethereum NFTs on Blast \u2013 Should ETH holders worry now? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Blast overtook Ethereum in terms of NFT volume\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price fell, network growth and velocity grew significantly on the charts\n\nEthereum [ETH] has largely been dominant in most sectors across the crypto-space. On a certain front, however, it would seem that the tides have shifted in favor of the Blast network.\n\nNFTs on full Blast\n\nRecent data suggests that over the last 24 hours, Blast NFT collections like PAC REKT, Blastopians, and Plutocrats have collectively generated more volume than the entire Ethereum NFT market across all exchanges.\n\nNow, even though Blast outperformed Ethereum in terms of NFT volume, a significant portion of this volume can be attributed to wash trading. For context, Wash trading in NFTs inflates trading volume by buying and selling between controlled wallets, creating fake popularity, and misleading investors. It undermines the NFT market by distorting prices and reducing real liquidity.\n\nEven though a large part of Blast\u2019s NFT volume can be due to wash trading, the declining interest in Ethereum NFTs does raise concerns about the state of the network. In fact, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of NFTs being traded has fallen significantly.\n\nTaking a deeper look\n\nNFT collections on other networks such as Bitcoin and Mythos managed to outperform Ethereum NFTs. According to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC and Crypto Punks were not able to get into the top 5 most sold NFTs over the last month. The number of Crypto Punk buyers fell by an alarming 20%, whereas the number of BAYC buyers fell by 2.78%.\n\nIf this trend continues, Ethereum may lose its top spot in the NFT sector soon.\n\nETH holders bleed\n\nAs far as ETH\u2019s price is concerned, at press time, it had climbed back above $3,000 on the back of Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. Additionally, the network growth for ETH continued to rise as well.\n\nRising network growth is a sign that new addresses have been showing interest in ETH. Velocity climbed too, implying a surge in transaction activity on the Ethereum network.\n\nRising interest from new addresses and growing velocity could help ETH see green and push the altcoin to the levels it was trading at prior to the latest market correction.\n\nHowever, the size of the addresses showing interest in ETH will also play a key role in Ethereum\u2019s future price movement.\n\nFor instance, addresses holding 100-10,000 ETH were declining at press time, according to Santiment\u2019s data. Substantial purchases made by large addresses can play a huge role in ETH\u2019s price trajectory in the future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator"
