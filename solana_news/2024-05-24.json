        "title": "SEC approval of Ether ETFs acknowledges Ether is a commodity - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight spot Ether ETFs in a bulk order. However, there is another formality before they can be sold to the public, which may take a few months. A key aspect of the order is that each ETF is considered a \u2018Commodity-Based Trust Share\u2019. Several years ago the SEC classified Ether as a commodity, but that changed over a year ago without any announcement. It concluded that Ether had become a security following the migration to Ethereum 2.0, which adopted Proof of Stake. This came to light due to Ethereum development house Consensys suing the SEC over claims that Ether is a security.\n\nTherefore, the ETF\u2019s recognition of Ether as a commodity marks a significant reversal. There\u2019s considerable debate about the reason for the abrupt shift. With Congress passing the FIT 21 crypto Bill this week with the backing of many Democrats, the politics around crypto is shifting. That\u2019s particularly in the run up to an election where the Biden administration\u2019s crypto stance might be viewed as a potential vote loser.\n\nInterestingly, the SEC Commissioners did not directly vote on the ETFs, unlike the Bitcoin ETFs. Instead, they delegated the authority to the Division of Trading and Markets. While delegation is a common practice, it\u2019s notable that this decision would not have been made without the majority of the Commissioners\u2019 approval, as highlighted by Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart.\n\nThe eight ETFs are from Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock\u2019s iShares, VanEck, ARK 21shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.\n\nConsensys to continue its fight\n\nMeanwhile, Consensys has vowed to continue with its litigation against the SEC. \u201cToday\u2019s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security \u2013 contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week, as described in our recent lawsuit against the SEC,\u201d the company wrote on X. \u201cWe will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cthis seemingly last minute approval is yet another example of the SEC\u2019s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crypto community that\u2019s been unhappy with the SEC. Both Congress and the Senate voted in favor of a resolution to overturn an SEC accounting bulletin (SAB 121) that effectively blocks banks from providing digital asset custody. It is the first digital assets-related law passed by both legislative branches, yet another sign of the changing political tide. However, the White House has vowed to veto it."

        "content": "London, UK, May 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BlockDAG Network are all making significant moves in the market. This is what\u2019s happening;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin surged over $70,000 per BTC on Wednesday, nearing its all-time high of $73,500 reached last March. Meanwhile Ethereum has seen a 20% rise to nearly $4,000 per Ether, as the crypto market anticipates a pivotal vote in Washington.\n\nThe rally follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting updates from entities applying to issue spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts foresee approval triggering a $4.2 trillion price surge, especially after the SEC's communication with potential fund managers, suggesting accelerated approval may be imminent.\n\nETF analysts have increased approval odds, citing the political climate and potential impact on Ethereum's value. The decision is expected this week on VanEck's and Ark/21 Shares' ETF applications, with analysts anticipating a significant market response akin to Bitcoin's ETF approval in January.\n\nThe potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is predicted to propel the Ethereum price to $8,000 by 2024 and $14,000 by 2025, impacting Bitcoin positively as well. With spot Bitcoin ETFs reporting record inflows and continued growth since their launch, analysts anticipate further market highs, aligning with projections of a $150,000 Bitcoin price by 2024 and $200,000 by 2025, amounting to a combined near-$4.2 trillion valuation for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn the meantime, BlockDAG Network is revolutionizing the cryptocurrency landscape, emerging as the fastest-growing community in the crypto world and hosting the largest Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of 2024. With over 120,000 holders already on board, up $31 million in record time and a goal of $600 million within reach, BlockDAG is not just a network but a whole movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network stands out with its cutting-edge Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture, which allows it to achieve unmatched transaction speeds of 10 blocks per second. This high throughput positions BlockDAG as an ideal solution for both everyday transactions and institution-level decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The platform\u2019s commitment to technological excellence ensures a seamless and efficient user experience.\n\nBlockDAG introduces a unique mining system designed to provide passive income opportunities. The newly launched X1 mobile miner allows users to mine cryptocurrencies on their smartphones without significant data or battery usage. This innovation means anyone can earn money virtually anywhere and everywhere, making mining more accessible and convenient than ever before.\n\nJoining the BlockDAG Network means becoming part of a vibrant, global community of enthusiasts dedicated to making this project the best in crypto-history. With tens of thousands of members, the community is the backbone of the project\u2019s extreme success, driving innovation and growth through continuous engagement and collaboration.\n\nBlockDAG Network is on an ambitious journey to \u201cthe moon,\u201d with every milestone bringing it closer to the ultimate goal of revolutionizing the digital space.\n\nThe BlockDAG presale is the fastest growing in crypto history, offering an unmatched opportunity to join a burgeoning journey. Expert analysts predict incredible potential for BlockDAG, with $BDAG tokens projected to reach $10 in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of Bitcoin and Ethereum's market surge, BlockDAG Network emerges as the fastest-growing community and the largest ICO of 2024.\n\nAnalysts project BlockDAG's $BDAG token to reach $10 by 2025 from its current $0.0085 price, marking an unprecedented rise. As the BlockDAG presale gains momentum and rises upwards from the $31 million already raised, it's clear: in this time BlockDAG Network will redefine the future of cryptocurrency.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, cofounder of Ethereum, made a notable move in the cryptocurrency space today by transferring 80 ETH, valued at approximately $300,000, to the privacy-focused coin mixer Railgun. This transaction marks the latest in a series of monthly transfers Buterin has made to Railgun over the past six months.\n\nRailgun, renowned within the crypto community for its robust privacy protocols, offers coin mixing services designed to protect user anonymity and prevent malicious activities. Buterin has been an outspoken advocate for Railgun\u2019s privacy pools protocol, which he argues significantly bolsters user privacy by complicating efforts to trace transactions back to their origin. \u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d Buterin has previously stated, underscoring the critical role of privacy in cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe privacy pools protocol employed by Railgun uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transactional anonymity, addressing mounting concerns about privacy breaches in the crypto ecosystem. This innovative approach has made Railgun a favored platform for users seeking heightened security and confidentiality in their crypto dealings.\n\nEthereum Navigates Privacy Imperatives\n\nButerin\u2019s consistent use of Railgun reflects a broader industry trend towards prioritizing privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. As regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies intensifies globally, platforms like Railgun, which emphasize privacy, are increasingly viewed as essential for maintaining transactional confidentiality while complying with regulatory requirements. This trend is particularly significant for Ethereum, which continues to see growing adoption and an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nThe timing of Buterin\u2019s latest transfer coincides with a bullish phase for Ethereum\u2019s market performance. Recent data shows ETH trading at $3,740, a 2.06% increase over the past 24 hours and a significant 29% rise over the past week. This surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is fueled by community anticipation around potential approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nButerin\u2019s strategic move underscores the importance of privacy-focused solutions like Railgun in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to gain traction and regulatory landscapes shift, the role of platforms like Railgun in safeguarding user privacy is set to become increasingly vital."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s powerful new \u2018EigenLayer\u2019 promises a wave of innovation. But is it a threat to the blockchain? - Fortune",
        "content": "Ethereum has spent the current bull market living in the shadow of Bitcoin, but two recent developments could thrust the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain back into the spotlight. The first is the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s surprise move to greenlight Ethereum ETFs. The second is a popular but divisive new investing feature called EigenLayer, which has received $100 million in backing from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Crypto.\n\nEigenLayer is a new protocol, or set of instructions, that sits atop the main Ethereum blockchain. It offers a way for those who have already invested tokens by means of staking\u2014a blockchain feature that rewards those who lock up their tokens to secure the network\u2014the ability to \u201crestake\u201d those tokens. The term is what it sounds like. By restaking, users take Ethereum tokens they have already invested and then invest them again. But instead of receiving a reward from the Ethereum network, as happens with staking, those who restake get paid by other projects piggybacking off the blockchain\u2019s existing security pool.\n\nRestaking has existed for some time but EigenLayer is seeking to turbocharge the process by adding a lot more participants. The protocol aspires to be something akin to an Amazon Web Services for cryptoeconomic security.\n\nThe implications of this are \u201cprofound,\u201d a16z wrote in a blog post about the company, noting that EigenLayer has the potential to accelerate innovation on Ethereum \u201c100x faster.\u201d While this appears to be a promising development for the blockchain, EigenLayer has yet to be tested at scale. And while it could result in a burst of innovation for Ethereum, some point to a major potential drawback: a new concentration of risk that, in a worst-case scenario, could harm both users and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Should Ethereum users view EigenLayer with excitement, fear, or both?\n\n\u2018Opens up a wormhole\u2019\n\nThe arrival of EigenLayer is a boon both to investors, who can now more easily earn an additional slice of yield, and for developers who can more quickly add a trust layer in the form of collateral. The issue, however, is that using the same pool of collateral to secure multiple aspects of the blockchain creates new vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt opens up a wormhole,\u201d Rushi Manche, cofounder of Ethereum layer 2 Movement Labs, told Fortune. Manche raised a troubling hypothetical posed by EigenLayer critics: What happens if there\u2019s a hack or a bug in the restaking smart contract? How does that affect the wider ecosystem which is also relying on this single deposit?\n\nAt the same time, Manche noted that proponents say \u201can entire new design space has opened up\u201d for developers thanks to EigenLayer, allowing the same asset to be stretched much further and achieve much more. From this view, the rewards far outweigh the risk. It\u2019s also worth considering the drawbacks if tools like EigenLayer are not available.\n\nSpecifically, in the absence of restaking, decentralized applications built on top of Ethereum must create their own proof-of-stake token\u2014a high bar of entry for any startup. With restaking, protocols can dip into the main blockchain\u2019s almost $95 billion of staked Ether for security. To revisit the cloud computing analogy: If hackers want to attack small businesses, they have to get past the likes of Google Cloud or AWS on which those businesses rely. EigenLayer proponents make the same case: Hackers need to get past a security system created by Ethereum, which has worth more than triple the market cap of Nike.\n\nBut, what happens when the same collateral gets reused again and again?\n\n\u201cEigenLayer reminds me of the 2008 recession: undercollateralize, overleverage. That\u2019ll go well,\u201d one X user posted\u2014just one of the industry onlookers who have drawn parallels with the financial crash, where banks rehypothecated subprime mortgage loans.\n\nAustin Campbell, the former head of portfolio management at Paxos, told Fortune that the comparison isn\u2019t trivial. \u201cAt the core of every levered system is the simple truth that the more leverage you use, the less stable your system is,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is a risk of \u201ccascading failures\u201d if one project fails, agrees Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. But he and many experts were also quick to offer nuance to the 2008 parallels: Restaking doesn\u2019t involve rinse-and-repeat borrowing and lending. Instead, it\u2019s taking a locked-up asset, and locking it up again. Think of it more like reusing the security deposit on an apartment to secure further apartments, suggests Jack O\u2019Holleran, CEO of Skale, an Ethereum layer 2.\n\nBut then what if you trash both apartments?\n\nOne scenario of so-called apartment trashing would be if those operating the restaking services\u2014known as AVS for \u201cactively validated services\u201d\u2014choose to devalue the restaked tokens. \u201cThere could be this \u2018house of cards\u2019 effect, but backwards,\u201d says O\u2019Holleran.\n\nThe debate is analogous to the criticism of liquid staking provider Lido, which currently accounts for 28% of all Ethereum being staked. In theory, Lido introduces a \u201ccentralized point of failure\u201d which is \u201cobviously concerning,\u201d Tekin Salimi, founder of dao5 Capital and seed investor in EigenLater, told Fortune. But in his view, rather than barring this innovation, diversifying the liquid staking providers is the solution.\n\nNoting these concerns, EigenLayer says on its website that it includes a \u201cveto committee\u201d to contain slashing\u2014the term used in the Ethereum world for destroying the collateral of validators who fail to fulfill their duties\u2014and to prevent contagion to the mainnet or other protocols. It will serve as a \u201cdoubly-trusted intermediary between AVS and staker.\u201d So, slashing conditions fall to each AVS, instead of the overall protocol\u2019s discretion. But what this will really look like in practice, is unclear. To that effect, slashing risks remain \u201cthe most real and yet the most undefined\u201d of all those raised, thinks Vance Spencer, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t overload the system\u2019 Ethereum founder warns\n\nEigenLayer has given rise to specific security concerns, but also to a more broader existential one: What fraction of staked tokens can be concentrated on a separate protocol on Ethereum, which holds up decentralization as its paramount value? According to O\u2019Holleran, empowering EigenLayer amounts to the Ethereum community giving considerable leverage and power to another system. Furthermore, copycat restaking services are also popping up, such as Karak, which announced a $48 million Series A raise last month. In addition, an unnamed but similar version is soon coming to market, sources close to the matter told Fortune.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder, raised concerns about EigenLayer in a blog post last May. \u201cBe wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u201cscope\u201d of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d he wrote. Buterin warns of the \u201cslippery slope\u201d of the underlying network\u2019s \u201cfragile\u201d social consensus losing credibility. His message was clear: Don\u2019t overload the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nOne of the concentration risks of top concern to Buterin is overloading the system\u2019s security.\n\nThe strength of Ethereum\u2019s security system is directly correlated to the economic value of the network\u2014it would be prohibitively expensive for hackers to muster the resources to defeat the consensus system that protects the network. \u201cWe agree that Ether is being used to secure the main net network, and that is the only purpose thereof,\u201d says Campbell. But if you are using your staked tokens to secure Ethereum and other networks, then the surface of things that Ether is being used to secure grows. So, the value resting on any single point gets larger, explains Campbell, which may provide more attractive incentives for hackers.\n\nThe second concentration risk concerns decision-making. Let\u2019s say 40% of Ethereum\u2019s tokens eventually becomes restaked and EigenLayer\u2019s smart contract experiences a hack or bug. It\u2019s unclear when there would be consensus to rollback Ethereum to release it, explains Tom Schmidt, partner at crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that threshold is,\u201d he admits."

        "title": "ETH vs. ADA: Is Cardano or Ethereum a Better Investment in 2024? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Markets got a big spike in Ethereum price this week on crypto exchanges. What\u2019s behind it and what factors can investors take into consideration to determine whether Ether or its friend Cardano is the better buy?\n\nEthereum has a birthday coming up on July 30. It was launched in 2015 to create a \u201cworld computer\u201d with the same Web3 blockchain properties as Bitcoin has for storing cash and making payments.\n\nCardano was launched on September 23, 2017 by initial coin offering (ICO) and founded by an Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Today it\u2019s the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum Market Cap (May 22): $451.8 billion\n\nCardano Market Cap (May 22): $17.2 billion\n\nCertain differences between the two cryptocurrencies are an advantage for one or the other and a good reason to be bullish or bearish for ETH or ADA tokens.\n\nBut some of the two networks\u2019 differences are tradeoffs that are more complex to evaluate as yielding an advantage for either crypto. Here are 7 key factors at play in the future Ethereum price against Cardano:\n\n1. ETH vs. ADA \u2013 Technical Analysis (a tie)\n\nEthereum price is nearly all the way back to its ATH (all time high) after spiking this week on Ethereum spot ETF buzz. Cardano has a long way to go. That might actually be more bullish for ADA, with more upside left in its price.\n\nThe recent Ethereum ETF approval will shake up the entire meta for investing in Ether. If bulls take the price past $4,000, another 12.5% increase would pump ETH to $4,500\u2014 within striking range of the previous Ethereum ATH of $4,721 in Nov. 2021.\n\nForbes recently mentioned an Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck predicts $11,800 by 2030. An even more bullish outlook forecasts $10,000 ETH by the end of the year.\n\nOver the short term, Cardano technical indicators and moving averages over the weekly span recommended \u201cSell\u201d on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum technical indicators for the seven-day span recommended \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d according to data from Investing.com.\n\n2. Ether Spot ETF \u2013 Regulatory Analysis (bullish ETH)\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it. Charles Hoskinson would certainly agree: U.S. regulators seem to favor Bitcoin and Ethereum over Cardano and other DeFi networks.\n\nThe SEC said okay to Ethereum futures ETFs in October, revealing it didn\u2019t seem to think of Ether as an unregistered security. However, the U.S. regulator has classified Cardano and other cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities in lawsuits against multiple blockchain companies, while ignoring Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nAs Fortune Magazine reported on May 1, \u201cFurthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints.\u201d\n\nThe SEC lawsuit against Ripple has taken years (since Dec. 2020) and still has not yet been resolved. It is costly and leaves the future unsure for the currencies under the government\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nMarkets abhor uncertainty.\n\nIt may not be fair, but it\u2019s a bullish factor for ETH and bearish for ADA.\n\n3. ADA vs. ETH \u2013 Fundamental Analysis (a wash)\n\nFundamental analysis is the preferred method of investors who are not total degenerates. Instead of chart technical analysis or meme currency voodoo economics, the fundamentalist looks at an investment prospect and asks what would \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d author Benjamin Graham do if he were here?\n\nGraham says:\n\n\u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nIf a business\u2019s expected future revenues discounted to the present day exceed its current market value, then it may be a good investment. If they match or fall short of the business\u2019s market cap, then it may be a poor investment.\n\nADA: $263.8 million TVL (3% annual reward rate + 121% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $16.4 Billion\n\nETH $64.9 Billion TVL (5.5% annual reward rate + 145% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $453 Billion\n\nGoing by the data above without any further context, it appears Cardano would be the winner, because its inflows make up a much smaller portion of its market cap than Ethereum (0.019 to 0.22), but only if we expect it to grow at the same rate as Ethereum in the future.\n\nThe lopsided institutional adoption between the two will make that difficult for Cardano unless it finds a use case, a feature/benefit, and a narrative that shakes up the retail Internet markets for cryptocurrency.\n\n4. Cardano vs. Ethereum \u2013 Gas Fees (cat\u2019s game)\n\nThere are lower and more predictable fees on Cardano, but higher fees on Ethereum are also a feature, not necessarily a bug. They make it more expensive to misuse the network for cybercrime that doesn\u2019t pay, so it\u2019s more secure. Big institutions like that.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why the industry leader, Bitcoin\u2019s slow, expensive network, with a low transaction bandwidth holds its capital so well. In many ways these built-in costs qualify participants better than Know Your Customer policies and automatically and without discriminating on any basis other than ability and willingness to pay the network\u2019s fees.\n\nStill for newcomers, enterpreneurs, startups, and investors starting out with a smaller cash pile, smart contract blockchain networks with lower fees like Cardano have an advantage. Transaction fees on both networks are highly variable and spike during periods of high network use.\n\n5. Ease Of Use \u2013 Cardano (another tie)\n\nSome people in Web3 feel Ethereum has an ease-of-use problem. It\u2019s become too overgrown with complicated, byzantine layers on top of layers, creating a steeper learning curve and potential security threats.\n\nBlockchain advocate Daniel Cawrey wrote in a recent opinion article on Blockworks:\n\n\u201cEthereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.\u201d\n\nWhile true, much like Ethereum\u2019s higher transactions fees\u2014 the complexity of Ethereum may be a reason to be bullish for ETH. It could simply be proof of the network\u2019s success. As Cawrey acknowledges in the piece, the network is beginning to achieve its \u201cworld computer\u201d concept.\n\nAny computer architecture expert would be hard-pressed to explain how a Turing-complete global computer that anyone can use on a peer-to-peer network would become anything but a flying spaghetti monster of complexity.\n\n6. Ether vs. Cardano Whales (bullish ADA)\n\nA massive 15,000 ETH whale deposit to Kraken on May 18 spotted by Whale Alert suggested a bear run on Ether by whales could be incoming, but after the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETF a surge in whale-sized transactions has been net positive for the network, according to IntoTheBlock data.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano whales have been extremely bullish for ADA in May. They boosted holdings in Cardano tokens by 11% in a month. Whales tend to be smart money with some of the most advanced analytics and market outlooks to know what they\u2019re doing, so that\u2019s positively bullish for Cardano.\n\nhttps://x.com/intotheblock/status/1790774801277042863\n\n7. Ethereum vs. Cardano Memes (bullish ETH)\n\nMeme coins are a definite advantage for Ethereum. While Cardano does have meme coins, none of them are notable and they have not topped the market cap charts like Ethereum\u2019s SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.\n\nCardano has succeeded in making a simpler, lower-fee Ethereum, but crypto markets tend to reward projects that leaven their technology with some meme karma. Maybe an Orange Pill Moon Boys NFT collection or something with a dog on it would do the trick."

        "content": "The crypto market was filled with euphoria over the past day with the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This came after months of speculation on the possibility of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nDespite the wave of joy that rippled across the crypto market, ETH\u2019s spot market price responded sluggish with buyers unable to seize the bullish sentiment. ETH\u2019s price traded between $3.5k and $3.9k during the time.\n\nHow will the ETF approval after Ethereum\u2019s price action in the short and long term?\n\nETH Move Priced In Before ETF Approval\n\nA look at the ETH price action on the four-hour timeframe showed that buyers could have seized the initiative, based on social sentiment to register a significant pump ahead of the approval.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nOn 20 May, ETH pumped 15% rising from $3.1k to $3.7k with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) noting the buying strength by rising to 93. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) surged to a monthly high of +0.53.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the ETF approval showed profit taking moves with price dropping sharply below the $3.7k support level. This presents two trading plays for ETH, based on the short term and long term.\n\nShort term, ETH could dip from $3.7k to $3.4k offering 6.6% profit opportunities. From the $3.4k support level, ETH could go on a strong upward move toward a new all-time-high (ATH) above $4k for 12% profit.\n\nOpen Interest Supports Short Term Bearish Outlook\n\nETH Open Interest | Source: Coinalyze\n\nData from Coinalyze showed that market participants in the futures market leaned bearish in the short term with the Open Interest dropping by 3.49% over the past 24 hours.\n\nShorting ETH over the next few days could yield the best profit making opportunity on the altcoin before the Ethereum ETFs start trading, driving bullish sentiment in the long term.\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "title": "How far will Ethereum (ETH) go? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Sat 25 May 2024 \u25aa 10 min read \u25aa by Thomas A.\n\nBull markets in cryptocurrencies generally benefit altcoins in a second phase. In the month of May, Ethereum (ETH) performed over 15%, and nearly 65% since the beginning of the year. This resurgence of Ethereum comes after the SEC approved the establishment of ETFs on the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. While the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum remains high, the cyclicity of Ethereum\u2019s price seems to act with as much precision in the structure of this bull market. Decoding the indicators and the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nSoon an ETF to boost the market?\n\nAs with Bitcoin (BTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the establishment of an ETF on Ethereum. Thus, this decision will allow major global managers to expand the cryptocurrency offerings to their clients. However, the SEC still needs to approve its commercialization\u2026\n\n\u201cThis decision follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which quickly attracted $13.3 billion in net inflows, setting performance records for ETFs at their launch. The arrival of Ethereum ETFs could experience similar success, attracting a new influx of capital to the second-largest cryptocurrency.\u201d Crypto: Ethereum ETFs approved by the SEC! \u2013 Cointribune\n\nThis same announcement for Bitcoin had particularly favored the price hike to historical highs. The arrival of an ETF on Ethereum thus leaves potential for a return to the November 2021 highs of $4,868. In May 2024, ETH thus represents nearly 17.7% of the market capitalization. This market share is still far behind Bitcoin, with a dominance near 53%.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs could thus instigate a catch-up effect compared to Bitcoin. Moreover, these ETFs could also be used to create ETFs representing a basket of cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\nTaking a look at fractals: the rise persists\n\nA major indicator for measuring the viability of the trend on ETH is to use fractals. Indeed, the Hurst exponent (read more) allows measuring the degree of trend persistence from one time scale to another. Furthermore, the Hurst exponent is ideally bounded between 0 and 1. With Ethereum, a Hurst exponent close to 1 indicates significant upward potential, and consequently a good symmetry with major lows. Conversely, a Hurst exponent close to 0 will indicate that the trend is anti-persistent and is likely to turn downward.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price (top chart) and Hurst exponent (bottom chart). Measures the positive (>0.5) or negative (<0.5) persistence of the trend. Graph and data by Thomas ANDRIEU.\n\nGraphically, we see that ETH gained significant upward potential in mid-2022, and reconfirmed it in early 2023. The ensuing bull market, in accordance with theory, was accompanied by a decrease in the Hurst exponent, signaling the loss of upward potential. In March 2024, the Hurst exponent was below 30%, indicating a bearish risk, or at least, the absence of upward potential. Nevertheless, the recent rebound in Ethereum seems to reaffirm a renewal of upward potential, thereby limiting the bearish risks observed in spring 2024.\n\nDespite everything, this approach encourages us to be more cautious about the nature of the bull market compared to 2023. Indeed, it appears clear that the bull market has exhausted a significant portion of its overall potential.\n\nThe cycles acting on ETH\n\nIn several papers, we have had the opportunity to highlight a cycle close to 3.6 years on Ethereum. Furthermore, this dominant cycle corresponds to the same dominant cycle as Bitcoin (BTC). The timing of this cycle thus allows us to judge, and compare, the different bull or bear markets. For example, the bull market observed on Bitcoin since 2023 is strongly symmetrical to previous bull markets.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we know that two cycles of 4 months and 22 months synchronized in February 2018. We are now looking for the time period needed to achieve the next constructive interference. By calculating the LCM(4,22), we get 44 months (3.6 years), which strongly correlates with the cyclicity of equities and Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cyclicity (BTC) \u2013 Cointribune).\u201d Technical Indicators: Constructive Interferences and Destructive Interferences \u2013 Cointribune\n\nThus, a little more than 3.6 years separate the major peak of 2018 from that of 2021 on Ethereum. Likewise, 3.6 years separate the major low of early 2019 from that of mid-2022, etc. We see here a clear cyclical dynamic, mainly fueled by the correlation of Ethereum with Bitcoin. In this perspective, which remains admittedly theoretical, we could expect an Ethereum peak around mid-2025. We will finally mention the good symmetry observed so far between the current bull market and the previous bull market.\n\nCurrent cycle for Ethereum and previous cycle\n\nETH remains correlated with Bitcoin\n\nIn our previous paper, we highlighted the importance of the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin. The lows and the major lows of the cryptocurrency market are indeed linked to the relationship that exists between the two main cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe notice in our case that a high correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and Ethereum is conducive to translating major lows on Bitcoin. Conversely, a low correlation coefficient (prominent low of the coefficient) is likely to translate a sharp weakening of market strength, and major peaks. A major explanation would be that, during bull markets, the dependence of altcoins on Bitcoin decreases.\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) decorrelates from other assets \u2013 Cointribune\n\nETH price (top chart) and 6-month correlation coefficient with Bitcoin price (bottom chart). Graph by Thomas ANDRIEU.\n\nGraphically, we can verify that major lows on ETH are linked by a very high correlation with Bitcoin. However, before major bull markets on ETH, we notice that the BTC/ETH correlation is minimal. In March 2024, the 6-month correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum thus reached a low around 70%. By symmetry, this indeed signaled the likely arrival of an intense bull market on ETH. The study of the correlation between the two assets, however, does not allow us to effectively judge the probable highs on Ethereum.\n\nDespite everything, we see that the correlation between the two assets remains generally high. It is mostly above 80%, which is significant.\n\nTowards $6,000?\n\nThe Technical Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price can provide us with additional elements. Indeed, we notice that the consolidation of March/April 2024 does not undermine the bullish trend initiated since 2023. On the contrary, the recent bullish breakout allows us to set an initial target (almost reached) towards the recent peaks around $4,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\n\nThen, as we have highlighted, it would be coherent, given the correlation with Bitcoin, to reach the historical peaks at $4,800. In the continuation of this theoretical bullish movement, the next extended target of the consolidation pattern (flag, logarithmic scale) would be near $6,000. This level does not seem graphically and statistically impossible. Conversely, continued difficulties in surpassing recent peaks, or a prolonged drop below $3,000, would signal a probable exit from the bullish trend.\n\nWe have also mentioned the good timing of this dynamic, similar to that of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, we see that a continued upward trend would be with less foundation than the rise of 2023 and early 2024. This necessarily encourages greater attention to market strength indicators.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs seems to have triggered a break in the consolidation since March. The upward trend on Ethereum thus continues:\n\nWith an extension of demand to ETFs and the rebound of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nA weakening of bullish strength in terms of fractals. Nevertheless, the upward potential seems to be maintained in April/May concerning the price rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the market\u2019s timing and cyclicity still seem relevant. So far, a certain symmetry persists between the current bull market and the previous one. The upward dynamic is thus accompanied by the market\u2019s structural cycles.\n\nThe correlation with Bitcoin is maintained despite a decorrelation in March 2024. This signal indicates that the bull market on ETH is likely to continue in line with Bitcoin.\n\nFinally, Technical Analysis clearly shows a potential for continuation. The target towards previous peaks, then towards historical peaks, would thus be likely in a bull market. If the bullish strength is maintained, some extended targets are around $6,000, and beyond by extension.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency Will Soar 116%, According to Standard Chartered. Is It a Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A Standard Chartered analyst expects Ethereum to more than double by the end of the year. Here's how that bullish analysis checks out, and how it moved markets this week.\n\nAnalysts from a major British bank say that Ethereum (ETH 0.07%) should more than double from here to the end of 2024. Does this projection make sense?\n\nStandard Chartered's bullish Ethereum analysis\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of crypto research and emerging markets foreign exchange at Standard Chartered (OTC: SCBF.F), hung an $8,000 year-end price target on Ethereum (ETH 0.07%) earlier this week.\n\nSpeaking to the crypto news site The Block on Tuesday, Kendrick predicted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Ethereum's spot price. He argued that the approval would inspire large money inflows into the Ethereum cryptocurrency, similar to the inflows that followed after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe analyst also noted that he called the money-flow effects of the Bitcoin ETF approval correctly, and underscored the long-term price boosts that should result from these substantial investment moves.\n\nMind you, Kendrick based his Ethereum price target on his latest Bitcoin (BTC -1.31%) target. In other words, the Ethereum ETFs strike him as good news for the crypto market as a whole, not necessarily driving Ethereum prices any faster than the rest of the sector. Historically, Ethereum has closely followed Bitcoin's price movements due to their strong market correlation and shared investor sentiment.\n\n\"Given that we now see Bitcoin reaching the $150,000 level by end-2024, this would imply a level of $8,000 for Ether,\" the Standard Chartered analyst said.\n\nSEC moves closer to approving Ethereum ETFs\n\nTwo days later, the SEC approved a rule change that will result in the first Ethereum-based ETFs on the American markets. The funds aren't hitting the market right away, as the SEC must review each application in detail before approving anything. While this process could take months, the established precedent of Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the SEC's approval may be expedited. It's still a big move in the direction of final approvals, which looks like a matter of time now.\n\nCrypto investors were enthusiastic about Standard Chartered's forecast, driving Ethereum's price 23% higher the next day while Bitcoin rose as much as 7%.\n\nMarket reactions to the forecast and ETF news\n\nThe two largest cryptocurrencies barely moved on the actual ETF news, though. Ethereum has stayed steady since Kendrick's forecast and Bitcoin is down by a couple of percent on Friday.\n\nBut Kendrick's analysis still looks directionally correct. The combination of ETF approvals and the recent Bitcoin halving should indeed power another price surge in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many smaller altcoins over the next year or so. Growth investing star Cathie Wood of Ark Invest also pegged her year-end Bitcoin target at approximately $150,000, with much loftier long-term goals in mind.\n\nEvaluating Kendrick's analysis and its implications\n\nFrom a perspective of simple logic, the idea of rising crypto prices makes sense.\n\nBitcoin's market value is receiving boosts from both sides of the supply and-demand calculation. The halving of Bitcoin mining rewards makes it harder to come by freshly minted digital coins. At the same time, the new ETFs open the floodgates to nearly direct Bitcoin investments by several new types of buyers -- retail investors can now access Bitcoin ETFs (and soon Ethereum ETFs) in their retirement accounts, while institutional money managers can rely on familiar ETFs instead of opening new accounts in unapproved crypto exchanges.\n\nBurning the value candle at both ends, Bitcoin is experiencing higher demand and strictly limited supply. That's a recipe for higher prices, especially since the necessary Bitcoin mining process stops making economic sense unless coin prices increase enough to make up for the smaller rewards.\n\nAnd where Bitcoin goes, other cryptocurrencies tend to follow. In particular, Ethereum tends to follow Bitcoin's price chart quite closely:\n\nBalancing your portfolio with crypto investments\n\nStandard Chartered's Ethereum target stands 116% above the smart contracts pioneer's current price (and 160% beyond where it sat before Kendrick spoke to The Block). I can't promise that it will meet this exact goal, but I'm convinced that both Ethereum and Bitcoin will rise as the year plays out.\n\nUnexpected twists can throw a spanner in the works, of course, and other unplanned events might drive the cryptos even higher instead. You never really know what will happen in this young and volatile market until it happens.\n\nHence, I wouldn't recommend backing up the truck, betting the literal farm, or otherwise going overboard with crypto investments right now. A diversified approach with crypto playing a modest part in a diversified portfolio will let you enjoy the benefits of a price surge without risking it all. Ethereum looks like a solid buy today, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Kendrick's specific $8,000 target to materialize."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nExperts are warning of the looming threat that the newly approved U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could pose if staking is ever introduced.\n\nIn a crucial bid to push the approval process over the line, Ethereum ETF issuers dropped language regarding the staking of customer ETH.\n\nWhen the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus in September 2022, it required ETH to be locked up in a process called staking. The staked ETH belongs to validators who help to secure the network. They\u2019re rewarded for staking their ETH, but can be penalized if they don\u2019t verify transactions on time.\n\nCentralization concerns have arisen in the past when single validators gained control of large portions of staked ETH. At time, people have even compared liquid staking provider Lido to a \"cartel\" when it swelled in size.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRemoving staking language from ETH ETF applications was a move to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution could cause a long-term problem.\u201d Ganesh Swami, CEO and co-founder of blockchain data analytics company Covalent, told Decrypt, \u201cIf multiple ETFs use the same custodians, this type of centralization would cause concentration to increase, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.\u201d\n\nTaking a look at the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that Coinbase is the custodian for 90% of the total assets. While this poses an obvious centralization risk already, adding staking to the equation, well, ups the stakes.\n\n\u201cStaking ETH ETFs are not a new concept, they exist in other countries, but clearly the U.S market brings a much larger scale,\u201d Andrew O\u2019Neill, analytical lead on digital assets at S&P Global, told Decrypt. \u201cThe risk in that case is that if ETFs are concentrating their stake with a small number of custodians, this could create validator concentration risks in the consensus mechanism.\u201d\n\nCoinbase, which is already the second largest Ethereum validator, is currently set to be the custodian of at least six out of the nine firms planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If we see similar interest as we did with the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which as a group currently have a market capitalization of $54 billion, this concentration of power could pose a security risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can measure concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower that number, the higher the central point of failure.\u201d Mona El Isa, CEO and co-founder of institutional DeFi company Avantgarde Finance, told Decrypt, \u201cIf any party amassed that much control, they could potentially alter the state of the blockchain itself. That poses serious risks to security.\u201d\n\nIt appears that staking was removed from Ethereum ETF applications due to the SEC\u2019s view that staking is equivalent to a securities service. It\u2019s not without precedence. The SEC has sued companies, like Kraken and Coinbase, to stop them offering staking services to U.S. customers.\n\nAs staking is currently not allowed for ETF providers or custodians, there are no guidelines put in place to reduce the potential centralization and concentration risks that could be looming.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes one Ethereum (ETH) competitor could more than double in price.\n\nCrypto trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 718,900 followers on the social media platform X that interoperability blockchain Polkadot (DOT) is poised to rally due to major network advances.\n\nHe also says DOT is likely to see a boost from ETH\u2019s upward momentum as well.\n\n\u201cPolkadot did a retest at the crucial levels and wakes up slowly. Given their Polkadot 2.0 release and the JAM ( Join-Accumulate Machine) white paper and the correlation with ETH, I\u2019m expecting a lot from them. Next target is likely $18.\u201d\n\nPolkadot is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe analyst also believes the broader altcoin market is entering a bullish phase after correcting.\n\n\u201cThe altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction. The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60%-70% from here. I think Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next two-four months.\u201d\n\nHe says alts could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cThe altcoins are still heavily undervalued.

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ether: SEC opens door to Ethereum ETFs - Business Today",
        "content": "In a landmark decision, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signalled its approval for the potential launch of eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. This move follows the SEC's approval of the first bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, marking a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe SEC's approval on Thursday involved crucial rule changes that pave the way for ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Applications from prominent financial groups such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Invest received the green light. While this represents a major step forward, a second round of approvals will be necessary before these products can officially launch.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these approvals has fueled a surge in ether's price, which has climbed more than 20% since Monday and over 60% since the beginning of the year. This reflects the growing confidence among investors regarding the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC's decision comes after months of silence on the matter. On Monday, the regulator unexpectedly provided feedback on pending applications to issuers and exchanges, triggering a flurry of paperwork revisions and submissions. This swift action was likely prompted by approaching deadlines for responses to ether ETF applications from VanEck and Ark Invest.\n\nWhile the SEC's Thursday approval marks a significant milestone, the timing of the second round of approvals and the subsequent launch of ether ETFs remains unclear.\n\nCommenting on the development, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink stated: \"The Ethereum ETF approval is a second large step forward for the crypto industry... The attention and adoption around the Ethereum ETF also proves the long-term thesis we have been building around, that the capital markets will be the next large source of adoption for the cryptocurrency industry, essentially being the key force that is driving it to new heights.\"\n\nNazarov highlighted the potential of the approval to shine a spotlight on Ethereum's smart contract and decentralised application capabilities, which are attracting growing interest from major financial institutions.\n\nSumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX commented, \"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s green light for spot Ether ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It builds on the success of Bitcoin ETFs, offering a secure and regulated way for investors to access Ether. This broader acceptance will fuel mainstream adoption and reflect a maturing regulatory environment, paving the way for further legitimising the entire digital asset space.\"\n\n\"Ethereum plays a pivotal role in the decentralised ecosystem, and this regulatory progress will be instrumental in shaping the future of Web3 and the ongoing digital revolution. The SEC decision is particularly important, as earlier media reports suggested the SEC was investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH), and its potential classification as a security,\" Gupta added.\n\nMeanwhile, Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman of CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem India Ltd said, \"The SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a watershed moment in digital finance, poised to catalyse a sustained bull run while tempering volatility to align with traditional asset classes. This monumental achievement not only validates the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies but also sets the stage for widespread institutional and retail involvement. Regulated investment vehicles for Ethereum will bolster investor confidence and ignite further innovation within the blockchain sphere.\"\n\nMaradiya added, \"In the Indian market, this development heralds a new era of global digital asset integration, offering invaluable insights for our regulators. Indian investors stand to benefit from expanded portfolio diversification and enhanced access to global crypto markets. This pivotal juncture has the potential to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption in India, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic financial ecosystem. Moreover, it presents retail investors with a unique opportunity to harness the power of this asset class for wealth creation.\"\n\nThis landmark decision by the SEC could potentially usher in a new era for cryptocurrencies, further solidifying their integration into traditional financial markets."

        "title": "Ethereum Sets Sights On Pectra Upgrade For Q1 2025, Promising Major Enhancements - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Ethereum core developers have set their sights on launching Pectra, the blockchain\u2019s next major upgrade, by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This ambitious timeline hinges significantly on the inclusion of the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of about 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to introduce an opt-in container for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. The EOF represents a pivotal advancement, promising enhanced efficiency and flexibility for developers and users alike.\n\nPectra\u2019s upgrade is poised to be transformative, with the integration of PeerDAS, a cutting-edge data availability sampling solution. PeerDAS leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing peer-to-peer infrastructure to enhance data integrity and accessibility, thus bolstering the overall robustness of the network. This innovation is crucial for maintaining ETH\u2019s competitive edge in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the Pectra upgrade is the replacement of the existing account abstraction EIP-3074 with a newly proposed EIP-7702, authored by Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 aims to elevate externally owned accounts (EOAs) by enabling them to operate as smart contract wallets during transactions. This enhancement is expected to streamline user interactions with decentralized applications (dApps), making Ether more user-friendly and versatile.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Upgrades: Prague And Electra In Pectra\n\nPectra comprises two main components: the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer and the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer. Together, these updates will usher in a series of technical improvements designed to enhance Ether\u2019s scalability, security, and functionality. Despite the forward momentum, some elements of the upgrade remain under discussion. Notably, there is a consideration to postpone the implementation of Verkle trees, a complex and critical upgrade aimed at optimizing data storage and retrieval on the Ethereum network, to the subsequent Osaka hardfork.\n\nThe development community is actively debating the final scope of Pectra, ensuring that all changes align with Ethereum\u2019s long-term vision and objectives. This collaborative approach underscores the dynamic and open nature of Ethereum\u2019s development process, where community input and rigorous testing are paramount.\n\nAs the proposed launch date for Pectra approaches, the level of excitement building around the Ethereum ecosystem is increasing. It is said that these planned upgrades will considerately boost the performance and usability of the platform in cementing its position as one of the leading blockchain networks. Strong momentum for future innovations and scaling towards greater deployment within the decentralized tech space.\n\nRelated Reading | Dogecoin Analyst Foresees 13x Surge to $2 Amid Potential Altseason Boom"

        "title": "How To Invest in Crypto Without Buying Crypto - Investopedia",
        "content": "You can gain exposure to cryptocurrency without buying any by purchasing shares of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Bitcoin Trusts, or ETPs linked to cryptocurrency futures through cryptocurrency exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission also gave three exchanges the green light to begin listing eight Ether Spot ETPs in May 2024.\n\nThese indirect ways of investing in crypto are much cheaper and possibly less risky than purchasing crypto outright. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you want to invest in crypto without buying crypto.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Although cryptocurrency has existed for some time, many consider it a relatively new investment with a major learning curve.\n\nInvesting directly in cryptocurrencies can be challenging because of their volatility, and some investors prefer using more traditional investments.\n\nYou can indirectly invest in crypto through funds and cryptocurrency-related stocks.\n\nOptions include spot and futures-based crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat Is Indirect Crypto Investing?\n\nYou have options if you don\u2019t want to open an account on a crypto exchange and buy cryptocurrencies. You can invest in cryptocurrency indirectly through traditional methods like stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs.\n\nThere are pros and cons to consider, including security, fees, and the risk of losses. When you buy cryptocurrency through third parties, those funds are going to earn their keep somehow, so you should consider any additional costs when deciding whether to buy crypto using an indirect method.\n\n\n\nHere are some ways you can invest in crypto indirectly.\n\nCrypto ETFs\n\nWhen trying to get broad access to a particular asset class, the first port of call is usually ETFs. Investment funds can be found that track pretty much everything, from gold to the S&P 500. Unfortunately, with cryptocurrency, it\u2019s a little more complicated.\n\nAfter many years of denying spot cryptocurrency ETF applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under pressure from a 2023 D.C. Court of Appeals decision, approved the first 11 in January 2024. Previously, the regulator only gave the green light to ETFs that owned bitcoin futures contracts. Here are some:\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)\n\nGlobal X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS)\n\nHere are the first Bitcoin spot ETFs to be approved:\n\nARK 21shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nBitwise Bitcoin Trust (BITB)\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nIshares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nVaneck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nWisdomtree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\nIn May 2024, the SEC gave three exchanges approval to list certain Ether Spot ETFs. NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX are able to list and trade shares of:\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (NYSE Arca)\n\nBitwise Ethereum ETF (NYSE Arca)\n\niShares Ethereum Trust (Nasdaq)\n\nVanEck Ethereum Trust (Cboe BZX)\n\nARK21 Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nFidelity Ethereum Fund (Cboe BZX)\n\nFranklin Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nThere are catches to investing in crypto this way. First, futures contracts and ETF shares don\u2019t necessarily deliver the same returns as their target assets. Second, ETFs for crypto can be complex and have fees that can eat into your potential returns.\n\nFees and underlying investments vary based on which fund you choose, so be sure to read the prospectus carefully to know what you\u2019re getting.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nOnce spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, calls became louder for Ethereum's native token, ether, to get the same treatment. Ether-based ETFs were only able to use futures contracts to track the price of ether rather than directly holding the digital currency, as traditional ETFs and now many Bitcoin ETFs can do. However, this has changed following the SEC's May 2024 exchange proposal approval.\n\nAsset managers like VanEck, Grayscale, and Fidelity have filed for permission to launch Ethereum ETFs, which would give investors exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency via SEC-regulated funds. This would likely give Ethereum greater liquidity, improve price tracking, and lead to potentially lower fees than futures-based ETFs can offer.\n\n\n\nOther countries, including Canada, have been quicker in adopting spot crypto ETFs.\n\nCrypto ETFs vs. Crypto ETPs\n\nETPs are financial instruments that track underlying securities, an index, or other financial products traded on exchanges. They can be purchased and sold throughout the trading day, like stocks. ETFs are the most common form of ETP. Other types of ETPs are exchange-traded notes, which specialize in debt securities, and exchange-traded commodities, which track the performance of commodities such as precious metals, agricultural products, and energy resources.\n\nWhen the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, they were classified as ETPs under the Securities Act of 1933 rather than ETFs as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940. Thus, the term ETP is a bit of a misnomer, though Investopedia has followed the more common usage in the investment community despite the SEC's determination.\n\nWhat are the implications? Besides having a less diversified portfolio, ETPs are governed by slightly different rules. Diversification and the type of assets held played a role in this designation. With bitcoin ETPs, physical spot exposure is given to a single commodity of cryptocurrency. Conventional funds, like other ETFs and mutual funds, must hold a more diverse range of assets. Registered under the Securities Act of 1933, ETPs are not subject to the same diversification and leverage restrictions as ETFs. This provides more flexibility in the types of assets they can hold, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile ETPs are subject to securities regulations, they do not offer the same level of investor protection as ETFs. Investors should exercise more caution and conduct thorough due diligence. The tax treatment of ETFs and ETPs can also differ. Investors should consult with tax professionals to understand the tax implications of investing in crypto ETPs. Lastly, the crypto market in which crypto ETPs are now players (since they have to trade crypto tokens) is not SEC or CFTC-regulated.\n\nCryptocurrency and Blockchain Stocks\n\nAnother way to invest in crypto without buying digital tokens is to purchase shares in companies that work in blockchain or hold cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nCompanies specializing in blockchain technology are often involved in crypto mining, software development, and other blockchain-based services. Notables include Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Canaan Inc. (CAN), HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE), and Bitfarms (BITF). These companies have different risk and reward trade-offs than those directly invested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlternatively, some companies hold cryptocurrencies or are directly involved in them. For instance, Coinbase (COIN), a publicly traded company, is one of the largest and best-known cryptocurrency exchanges. As of its Dec. 31, 2023 Form 10-K, it held more than 74,000 bitcoin, ether, solana, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGenerally, as crypto prices decline, related stocks also struggle. This volatility is one of the risks inherent in this sector, a key point to remember when exposing your portfolio to crypto-related products. Given the rapid changes in cryptocurrency regulations and market moves\u2014and as a general rule of thumb for investing\u2014it's prudent to diversify your portfolio to guard against crypto's risks and consult a trusted financial professional to review your investment plans.\n\nThere are also ETFs that specifically invest in companies with links to cryptocurrencies.\n\nCrypto and Your 401(k)\n\nYou can invest a part of your retirement funds in cryptocurrencies with minimal effort. In 2022, Fidelity announced that clients could add Bitcoin to its 401(k) accounts. Fidelity buys the coins and holds them in a digital asset account.\n\nThis was a major step toward bringing cryptocurrencies fully within the mainstream through traditional retirement investment portfolios. Ultimately, it's often up to your employer to decide on the specific portfolio of funds available to you for your 401(k).\n\nCredit Card Rewards\n\nCredit card rewards are one final method to fill your cryptocurrency portfolio without opening your fiat wallet. Several cards allow you to earn crypto when you swipe, tap, dip, click, or do anything else to use a credit card for payment.\n\nExamples of cryptocurrency credit cards include the Gemini Credit Card, and cards offered by the Crypto.com and Coinbase exchanges.\n\nSome cards, like the Venmo credit card, offer flexible redemption options, including cryptocurrency. When you earn crypto as a credit card reward, you invest in crypto without buying crypto.\n\nIs Crypto Worth Investing in? There are many risks when investing in crypto\u2014fraud, hacks, significant losses from price fluctuations, regulatory changes, and more. It's best to talk to a financial advisor familiar with cryptocurrency to learn if it's suitable for your financial circumstances and portfolio.\n\nHow do Beginners Invest in Cryptocurrency? Knowing how to invest in crypto can be intimidating, given the complexity of blockchain technology, the hype surrounding it, and the many available currencies. The first step is to get up to speed on the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, how blockchain technology underpins them, the kind of crypto wallet you will need, and the differences among cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and altcoins. Reputable resources such as Investopedia and courses offered by universities\u2014many freely available online\u2014can be invaluable. Platforms like Coinbase or Binance might be a good choice for your initial steps into the market since they have accessible interfaces and resources to guide you. Once in, stay updated on crypto news and regulatory developments.\n\n\n\nWhich Crypto Is Best to Invest in Now? Investing in cryptocurrency comes with many risks, the most prevalent being the loss of capital from wild price swings. If you feel you must invest in cryptocurrency, it's best to talk to a financial advisor who is familiar with it and find out if it's suitable for your financial circumstances. Additionally, it's essential to remember you should never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially when investing in cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency directly requires getting set up on an exchange and finding ways to store your digital coins safely. It can also mean potentially having a lot of money tied up in a volatile asset.\n\nFortunately, there are alternatives. You can invest indirectly in cryptocurrencies through ETFs that own future contracts tied to currency prices, bitcoin ETFs that securitize bitcoin holdings, or by purchasing shares in companies involved in cryptocurrency mining, software development, and other services. Alternatively, you can consider a credit card with cryptocurrency rewards or see if your employer offers this asset class through your 401(k).\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Yesterday, the crypto market was stunned by the approval of Ethereum ETFs. Amid this, veteran trader Peter Brandt issued a warning regarding the future of staking in the cryptocurrency space, particularly with respect to Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandt predicted significant turmoil, suggesting that staking could lead to massive financial losses and bankruptcy.\n\nIn particular, the trader, known for his controversial market predictions, called the staking inherently risky. He compared it to a leveraged asset, where investors borrow or leverage ETH or SOL by lending them out at interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt emphasized that this process inevitably attracts the attention of regulators. He predicted that central banks and government treasuries will soon impose strict regulations on staking, which will eventually put an end to it in its current form.\n\nStaking\n\n=\n\nOwning/borrowing/leveraging an asset (ETH/SOL/name it)\n\nLending it out for revenue (i.e.: interest)\n\n=\n\nEventual involvement by CBs/govt treasuries\n\n=\n\nRegulatory authority over staking\n\n=\n\nEnd to staking https://t.co/hv835g3pfK \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 24, 2024\n\nHe expressed skepticism about the sustainability of betting activities, drawing a parallel to historical financial scams. Brandt suggested that many investors seeking high returns through betting may soon realize the flaws in their strategy, citing the infamous figure of Carlo Ponzi, after whom Ponzi schemes are named.\n\nBrandt's warning coincides with the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs . Notably, all issuers of these ETFs did not include staking point in their applications. This exclusion highlights a critical distinction: while nonstaked ETH is classified as a commodity, staked ETH is treated as a security by the SEC.\n\nDespite these concerns, staking is still of significant interest to ETF issuers. It offers them the opportunity to earn interest simply by holding tokens and participating in network verification."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) could soar by 60% following the approval of the first-ever Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds by U.S. regulators, according to a leading crypto trading firm.\n\nWhat Happened: The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. This decision could lead to a significant surge in the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to a post on Telegram from the crypto trading firm QCP Capital.\n\nQCP Capital predicted a 60% increase in the value of Ethereum after the ETF approval. The news of the potential approval has already caused Ethereum\u2019s price to surge by nearly 20% since Monday.\n\n\u201cWith Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,\u201d QCP wrote.\n\nSee Also: Bonk, Pepe Outstrip Gains Of Bitcoin, Ethereum Amid Searing Hot Rally \u2014 Beat Biggies Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In Trading Volumes\n\nQCP Capital also pointed out that the approval of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETFs in January led to a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value. Since then, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of over $73,000. This has also resulted in a substantial increase in Ethereum purchases, with CryptoQuant data showing an 85% rise in Ethereum taker buy volume since May 1.\n\nWhy It Matters: The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The approval of Ethereum ETFs would open the door for mainstream investors to access the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a surge in its value. This development could also affect other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, which may find it harder to outperform Ethereum after the ETF approval.\n\nMoreover, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could have political implications. As Cathie Wood predicted, crypto could be a significant issue in the 2024 White House race. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could further solidify the importance of crypto in the political landscape.\n\nAdditionally, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could bring back the \u201canimal spirits\u201d to the crypto market, as predicted by a crypto trader.\n\nPrice Action: Ether is trading at $3,672, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, however, the coin is up nearly 20% this week and 56.08% up year to date.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Sink Over Inflation Concern In Fed Minutes: Analyst Says Odds \u2018In Favor\u2019 Of King Crypto Bulls\n\nImage Via Shutterstock"

        "title": "This Ethereum Rival Could Skyrocket by Nearly 2x Over the Short to Medium-Term, Says Coin Bureau\u2019s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor.\n\nTurner tells the 2.47 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau channel that the layer-1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) possesses more upside potential based on technical analysis.\n\n\u201cThe weekly chart appears to be painting a wonky head and shoulders pattern that looks eerily similar to the topping pattern FTM saw in late 2021. Notably, this pattern implies that there could be one more leg higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to Turner, Fantom could go up by approximately 98%, nearing double its current price.\n\n\u201cZooming out on the weekly chart suggests that FTM could rally as high as $1.60 in the short to medium term where it will likely stall out due to resistance, also known as bag holders, from the previous bull market. After that, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.810 at time of writing.\n\nOn the reasons supporting his bullish thesis for Fantom, the Coin Bureau host says,\n\n\u201cFTM has some solid \u2018pump-a-mentals,\u2019 so to speak. It has a low price tag and a market cap that isn\u2019t so large as to prohibit an epic pump.\n\nThe fact that FTM\u2019s supply has already vested to investors and the team suggests there will be minimal sell pressure from their side, particularly when you factor in the Fantom Foundation\u2019s apparently enormous runway\u2026\n\nThe only thing that FTM is missing is a narrative that retail investors can understand. And more retail accessibility. Specifically, FTM is not currently listed on Coinbase though it\u2019s possible this could change if regulations in the US change.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "It was another eventful week in the cryptocurrency markets, with Ethereum going under the spotlight this time. Let\u2019s unpack.\n\nLast weekend went very quietly, with little to no real action in terms of news and price movements. However, everything changed on Monday evening when Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts raised their prediction rate for the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs this week to 75% from 25%.\n\nThis caused immediate shock in the markets, as ETH exploded by over 20% from $3,100 to a multi-week peak of $3,800. The rally kept going in the following days for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which exceeded $3,930 at one point as speculations arose about whether it would be able to break the $4,000 barrier.\n\nBitcoin also followed suit on the way up and skyrocketed from $67,000 to a six-week high of its own at almost $72,000 on Monday evening. However, both assets failed to maintain their run at the end of the week, even though the big news from yesterday was that the Securities and Exchange Commission had indeed approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs to go live for trading in the US at some point.\n\nBoth BTC and ETH dropped by more than 4% just hours before the ETFs were greenlighted, faced tons of volatility after that, and failed to recover most losses. In fact, ETH has performed worse than BTC on a 24-hour scale and sits at $3,700 now, while bitcoin is above $68,000.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nStill, ETH is among the top performers in the past week, having surged by 18%. Other big gainers from this week include BONK (43% up) and PEPE, which charted a few consecutive all-time highs.\n\nMarket Data\n\nMarket Cap: $2.676T | 24H Vol: $133B | BTC Dominance: 50.2%\n\nBTC: $68,191 (+1.47%) | ETH: $3,671 (+18%) | BNB: $596 (+2.5%)\n\nThis Week\u2019s Crypto Headlines You Can\u2019t Miss\n\nSEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETFs for Public Trading. As mentioned above, the biggest news this week in the entire industry came from the US securities regulator. Despite previous dabbling with whether ETH is a security or not, the SEC greenlighted eight spot Ethereum ETFs, perhaps due to political pressure.\n\n8-Day Winning Streak: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Strong Inflows. The ETF front has been quite strong in the past several days as the spot BTC products recorded an impressive streak that now stretches to nine consecutive days of positive inflows.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: A Delicious Slice of Crypto History Turns 14. May 22 will forever remain in the Bitcoin history books as the Pizza Day. On this day, 14 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz made one of the first transactions involving paying with BTC and purchasing two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC, and we celebrated this massive achievement earlier this week.\n\nSolana ETFs to See More Demand Than Other Altcoin Funds: Bloomberg Analyst. Following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the approval of Ethereum-based products, experts have now started to speculate which will be the next crypto asset in line. According to Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart, Solana ETFs could follow suit, but there\u2019s a lot of controversy on that front.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein Steps Down. Another big piece of news from this week came from the company behind the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF \u2013 Grayscale. Michael Sonnenshein, who spent 10 years at the asset manager, decided to step down from his last job as CEO. The person who will be replacing him comes from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBitcoin Network Sees Lowest New Addresses Created Since 2018. Despite all the positive news around Bitcoin, not everything is going its way. The new addresses count has declined substantially in the past few weeks and recorded their lowest levels since the bear market in 2018.\n\nCharts\n\nThis week, we have a chart analysis of Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Shiba Inu, and Polkadot \u2013 click here for the complete price analysis."

        "title": "Mauvaise nouvelle pour les sceptiques : les ETFs Ethereum approuv\u00e9s par la SEC - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 24 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is abuzz following the stunning announcement from the SEC: the approval of Ethereum ETFs. This decision, which could redefine institutional investors\u2019 access to digital assets, comes at an important time for the market. While Bitcoin had already paved the way with its own ETFs earlier this year, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is set to gain unprecedented exposure in traditional financial markets.\n\nThe Historical Approval of Ethereum ETFs\n\nLast night, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a decisive step by approving several applications for Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant breakthrough for the second-largest crypto. Among the companies that received SEC approval are financial giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Ark/21Shares, and Invesco/Galaxy. This approval pertains to the 19b-4 forms, essential for setting up these funds, but there remains a crucial step: the approval of the S-1 forms, necessary before the ETFs can be marketed.\n\nJames Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, highlights the unexpected nature of this decision by stating: \u201cA week ago, I would have said you were a bit crazy to think these ETFs would get SEC approval.\u201d This remark underscores the rapidity and unpredictability of the SEC\u2019s shift in position, which until recently seemed reluctant to engage in discussions with Ethereum ETF issuers.\n\nGrayscale, one of the companies benefiting from this approval, expressed its satisfaction through a spokesperson: \u201cAt Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to collaborate constructively with regulators as they review Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential to bring Ethereum into the U.S. regulatory framework through ETFs.\u201d\n\nTowards a New Investment Paradigm\n\nWhile the approval of the 19b-4 forms suggests a willingness by regulators to allow the commercialization of Ethereum ETFs, it does not guarantee final approval of the S-1 forms. According to James Seyffart, \u201cThere is likely to be a delay before we see S-1 approvals and these ETFs begin trading. My estimate is that it will take at least a week, but probably longer. If history is any guide, it could take much longer and be measured in months.\u201d This statement reflects the uncertainty that still hangs over the exact launch timeline of these new financial products.\n\nIn any case, the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is not only a significant step for the issuers of these products, but it could also have profound repercussions on the crypto market as a whole. This decision follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which quickly attracted $13.3 billion in net inflows, setting performance records for ETFs at their launch. The arrival of Ethereum ETFs could see similar success, attracting a new influx of capital into the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThis SEC turnaround comes amid pro-crypto movements within the U.S. Congress, where several recent votes have shown growing support for crypto-friendly legislation. For example, last week, the Senate passed a resolution to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, thereby facilitating the offering of cryptocurrency custody services by regulated banks. Additionally, the House of Representatives approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which is expected to bring much-needed legal clarity for cryptocurrencies.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF was not expected as soon as it appeared. However, the market's reaction is not what the majority of Ethereum bulls likely expected. In its current state, Ethereum barely moved past the local resistance level and even retraced further.\n\nSo, what's holding Ethereum back?\n\nOnly 19b-4s approved, Not S-1s\n\nThe current approval pertains only to 19b-4s and not the more significant S-1s. In simple terms, this means that while a step has been taken toward greater acceptance, the bigger, more impactful approvals are still pending. The market knows this and is not getting too excited until the S-1s are also greenlit. It is a classic case of the market pricing in expectations \u2014 partial approval is good but not groundbreaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Delegated authority\"\n\nThis ETF approval was handled by the Division of Trading and Markets using \"delegated authority.\" This implies that a commissioner could still challenge the decision within the next 10 days. There is a sense of uncertainty hanging over the market, knowing that this approval might not be the final word. It feels a bit like they are trying to sneak this through, keeping the vote somewhat under the radar due to its political nature.\n\nThese points create a scenario where the Ethereum ETF approval, while positive, is not a guaranteed ticket to the moon. There remains political maneuvering, and further approvals needed to solidify the move. Plus, against the backdrop of broader regulatory and economic uncertainties, investors are playing it safe for now.\n\nDespite the lack of momentum, Ethereum is still looking well positioned for a rally; above numerous key technical resistances, cheap network fees might attract more activity and a fair price level ahead of the major $4,000 threshold."

        "content": "The crypto market is quite susceptible to ETF approvals, as it seems, and the past 24 hours brought even more enhanced volatility for the entire sector.\n\nAfter the hype from the start of the business week settled, the largest cryptocurrencies, including the one that got the green light from the SEC, have turned red.\n\nBTC Drops Below $67,000\n\nThe start of the current business week couldn\u2019t really foresee what was going to happen. BTC had calmed at around $67,000 after the quiet weekend, but it all changed on Monday evening when reports emerged that the SEC could actually greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the week.\n\nBitcoin, alongside most of the crypto market, went on a wild ride and soared by five grand in hours. This resulted in tapping its highest price tag in almost two months of nearly $72,000.\n\nThe rally came to a halt at that point and BTC started losing value gradually. Still, it traded in a range around $70,000 until yesterday evening when it slumped by a few grand to under $68,000. This came hours before the SEC\u2019s deadline to make a decision on whether it will approve or reject all ETF applications.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

However, it has lost some ground once again and now struggles below $67,000.\n\nIts market cap is down to $1.310 trillion, and its dominance over the alts is 50.2%.\n\nAlts in Red\n\nThe aforementioned developments around the Ethereum ETFs impacted the underlying asset\u2019s price the most, as expected. ETH skyrocketed by over 20% on Monday to a six-week peak of its own at over $3,900. It also went down and up yesterday ahead of the SEC approval but now sits 4% down on the day at $3,655.\n\nThe rest of the larger-cap alts are in no better state. Solana, Dogecoin, Toncoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu have all dumped by 5-8%. BNB, XRP, TRX, and BCH are also in the red.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has lost over $100 billion since yesterday and is down to $2.617 trillion on CG."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Approval: How is This Milestone Different to the Bitcoin ETF Approval? - The Fintech Times",
        "content": "The crypto industry has completed another step towards mainstream acceptance as spot Ethereum exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But how is this approval different to Bitcoin\u2019s in January?\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the SEC approved a spot Ethereum ETF meaning that, to begin with, certain investment firms could now offer an ETF of the cryptocurrency. While the SEC still needs to sign off on registration statements for VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise, in theory, it shouldn\u2019t be long before these firms can start officially trading Ethereum ETFs.\n\nInterestingly the news comes at a time when the regulator is deciding whether to classify the digital asset as a security. Furthermore, the approval follows more news in the crypto world as the United States House of Representatives voted in favour of legislation to provide greater regulatory clarity over digital assets.\n\nEric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, the trading platform, explains how these discussions fit within the larger picture of cryptocurrencies\u2019 global acceptance: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s approval of the ETH spot ETF, after months of politically driven objections, was overdue but is very welcome. Despite the SEC\u2019s stance that ETH is somehow a security, we are seeing another key part of the crypto industry unlocked for institutional investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet another sign of how the crypto industry is changing and another step towards crypto rightly being treated the same as any other asset class. This approval means new institutional investors from the US, less volatility, and more evidence for crypto\u2019s long-term future in the world of finance. But let\u2019s be honest: Even a rejection would not have changed much about the positive future for ETH and the entire crypto space.\u201d\n\nAnother milestone in one year?!\n\nEarlier this year, the crypto industry rejoiced as the US regulator announced a huge milestone that many had been calling for: Bitcoin ETFs. As a result of this move, US investors, both institutional and retail, could track the movements of Bitcoin and make purchases without having to set up an account or digital wallet with an unregulated exchange.\n\nWith the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, we set out to find out if this has solidified cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment recognised by the masses, or if they are still viewed as a niche and dangerous investment.\n\nReacting to the SEC\u2019s first stage approval, Alex Saleh, head of partnerships at Coincover, the blockchain protection company comments: \u201cThis is a welcome surprise given the challenges of the Bitcoin ETF approvals and the SEC\u2019s historical hostility towards crypto. The US is the largest market for ETFs in the world, and where the US moves, others usually follow.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Ethereum ETFs still needs to go through a second stage of approval, but if given the green light, would represent a major vote of confidence in the role that digital assets will play in our financial system and open the floodgates to more of these products.\u201d\n\nMore exposure\n\nSaleh continues: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s move is another sign of the growing appetite for crypto ETFs and could introduce fresh demand pressure on Ethereum spot prices, since exposure to Ethereum would be opened to a wider pool of investors.\n\n\u201cWith that said, there is still a lot of uncertainty on the timing of when Ethereum ETF products will hit the market, and which market players will be participating. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict any changes in demand for the underlying asset that will lead to further price discovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting moment for the crypto community, but there are still risks that come with any new financial instrument. Volatility is a given, and widespread adoption of Ethereum ETFs would lead to fund managers accumulating large amounts of Ethereum across a range of custody methods. This will be a prime target for hacks, attacks, and possible human error. We anticipate greater expectations around risk mitigation and security capabilities, meaning security is paramount and must be a top priority for ETF managers.\u201d\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Bitcoin ETF\n\nDaniel Seifert, UK country director of Coinbase, the global crypto exchange notes how this approval further roots cryptocurrencies in the mainstream world of investing. He says: \u201cCoinbase welcomes this ETF approval and believes it will have a similar, positive impact on the industry, as experienced upon the approval of BTC ETFs.\n\n\u201cThis move solidifies the fact that cryptocurrency is not merely a trend, representing a global transition towards digital assets in order to reshape the existing financial system. The expansion of crypto\u2019s utility will have significant effects on innovation, and we expect to see an escalation of activity in the market. Coinbase is excited to serve asset managers with the full suite of Prime products and further the positive impact on the industry.\u201d\n\nA good step in the right direction but we need to be cautious\n\nMona El Isa, founder of Avantgarde Finance, a crypto asset management firm, explains that while this is a good move for the crypto industry, an ETF takes away some of what makes Ethereum Ethereum.\n\nShe explains: \u201cThe approval of the Ethereum ETF is a positive development, boosting institutional demand as it is packaged in a way that traditional investors understand. However, the risks lie in the details of how these ETFs will implement, monitor, and manage risk, especially if they involve staking Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe centralised nature of these funds contradicts the ethos on which the asset class was built. Owning an ETF makes your investment purely speculative and ironically removes some of the key features that originally drove the popularity of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThere are also concerning centralisation risks in the current Ethereum staking landscape that need addressing. The top three staking pools control over half the total stake, with a measly 9% left for truly decentralised options. Lido dominates liquid staking with 85% of the market. It\u2019s clear we urgently need new on-chain, decentralised staking alternatives to break up these monopolies.\n\n\u201cWhile ETFs may boost institutional demand short-term, the space must solve these centralisation issues to maintain crypto\u2019s value proposition long-term. The rushed ETF timing also seems more politically motivated than grounded in addressing these crucial risks.\u201d"

        "content": "Sat 25 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nCrypto experts warn that centralization concerns could lead to \u201cserious\u201d security risks following the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in the United States, especially if staking is integrated.\n\nRisks Related to the Centralization of Ethereum Validators\n\nThe issuers of Ethereum ETFs had to remove the clause concerning the staking of clients\u2019 ETH to facilitate the approval process. However, this decision could have long-term consequences on network security.\n\nSince the transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022, validators must lock up their ETH in a process called staking. They receive rewards for securing the network but incur penalties for poor performance.\n\nCentralization issues have already arisen when some validators seized a significant portion of the staked ETH, with some even comparing the liquidity provider Lido to a \u201ccartel.\u201d\n\nGanesh Swami, CEO of Covalent, explained to Decrypt: \u201cThe removal of the staking clause in ETH ETF authorization applications was intended to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution might cause a long-term problem. If multiple ETFs use the same custodians, it would increase concentration, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.\u201d\n\nLack of Regulation and Potential Risks\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States already illustrate the risk of centralization, with Coinbase holding 90% of the total assets. Adding staking could worsen the situation. Andrew O\u2019Neill of S&P Global points out that if ETFs concentrate their participation with a small number of custodians, this could create risks of concentration of crypto validators.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest Ether validator, is expected to be the custodian for six of the nine companies planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If the enthusiasm is similar to that of Bitcoin ETFs, this concentration of power could threaten network security.\n\nMona El Isa of Avantgarde Finance explains: \u201cOne can measure the concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower this number, the higher the single point of failure.\u201d\n\nThe SEC views staking as a securities service, which explains its removal from Ethereum ETF applications. However, authorities have not established any guidelines to mitigate the risks of centralization and concentration without staking. The SEC has already sued Kraken and Coinbase to prevent them from offering staking services to U.S. clients.\n\nCrypto experts are therefore calling for heightened vigilance regarding Ethereum ETFs to avoid major security risks. It is crucial for regulators and industry players to collaborate in developing clear guidelines aimed at reducing these potential risks and ensuring the long-term security of the Ethereum network.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "ETH Price Struggles to Surge Even After Ethereum ETF Approval, Sell The News Soon? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Following the approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, May 23, the price of Ether (ETH) has remained stagnant at $3,800, showing no significant signs of an upward trend.\n\nDespite this, ETH has experienced a notable rally of over 30% in the past week. Investors are currently adopting a cautious stance, observing whether this development will result in a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Shows Major Volatility\n\nAhead of the U.S. SEC announcing its decision to spot Ethereum ETF approval, the ETH price witnessed some wild swings. In the tense hour preceding the official approval, ETH initially dropped to $3,500 around the time of the traditional U.S. market close.\n\nSubsequently, it surged close to $3,900 upon the emergence of initial unconfirmed reports suggesting approval, ultimately settling above $3,800 after confirmation. Amid these massive price fluctuations, it turns out that a whale sold a staggering 7,900 ETH holdings worth $29 million.\n\nDuring the turbulent episode, liquidations of leveraged crypto derivative positions surged to over $350 million throughout the day, marking the highest figure since May 1, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nThe majority of these liquidated positions were longs anticipating price increases, totaling approximately $250 million. This indicates that traders who had overextended themselves with leverage were taken by surprise by the abrupt price drop. Among the affected, ETH traders bore the brunt, with $132 million in liquidations.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead?\n\nThe approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs could drive more than $500 million in inflows as predicted by analysts. However, this might take some time to realize and kickstart the uptrend.\n\nSeveral on-chain indicators have been pointing out that Ethereum can easily form a base above $4,000 and can continue rallying to $5,000-$6,000 up until August this year.\n\nWhile the approval of the Bitcoin ETFs led to strong institutional inflows, it will be interesting to see whether the Ether ETF launch could lead to greater institutional adoption.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Algorand, the blockchain protocol, has released an attention-grabbing ad campaign aimed directly at Ethereum and Solana, two considerable rivals in the crypto world. In the context of the ad, customers are trying to pay with different cryptocurrencies in a supermarket environment.\n\nBitcoin was said to be slow, with one of the customers being told that it may take up to 27 minutes for the funds to go through. When trying to settle Ethereum payments, users were stunned by the outrageously high fees that they had to pay; at the same time, attempts at Solana payments were simply refused time and again.\n\nOn the other hand, Algorand\u2019s own token, known as ALGO, was processed quickly and without any hitches witnessed earlier in the exercise, thereby underscoring Algorand\u2019s claimed value propositions of superior efficiency and speed for real-world use cases.\n\nThe campaign was launched at a time when Algorand is seeking to strengthen its ground and take users from other blockchains. According to data from DeFiLlama, Algorand currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $92.6 million, which is actually lower than Ethereum and Solana.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAlgorand\u2019s native token ALGO has experienced a 2.54% price decline. As of now, the token is trading at $0.1804 following Coinmarketcap stats. This price change shows that there is uncertainty in the effect of this advertising campaign on the Algorand market volatility."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana lost around 10% of its value in an unexpected manner. The asset that looked well-positioned for the rally after the preliminary approval of the Ethereum ETF is currently looking weaker than the rest of the market, and it's not clear if it's going to recover properly.\n\nExamining the chart, Solana experienced a sharp decline, dropping from around $176 to $164. This significant drop has brought SOL down to test its support level at $160, which has previously acted as a strong support area. If this level fails to hold, the next major support lies at $150, corresponding with the 200-day moving average (orange line).\n\nOn the resistance side, Solana faces immediate resistance at $176, a level it struggled to maintain before the recent drop. Above this, the next key resistance is around $190, where the 50-day moving average (blue line) currently resides. Breaking through these levels would be necessary for any substantial recovery.\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to Solana's decline. First, market sentiment following the Ethereum ETF approval has been mixed, with some assets benefiting while others like Solana suffer. Additionally, technical factors such as failing to maintain key resistance levels might have triggered stop-loss orders, accelerating the sell-off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor traders and investors, the $160 support level is critical. If Solana can maintain this level, it may consolidate and attempt another upward move. However, if it breaks below $160, the next significant level to watch would be $150. This could indicate further downside potential, and investors might need to brace for more volatility.\n\nEthereum stays composed\n\nThe expected kick in price that many attributed to Ethereum's ETF effect turned out to be a fiasco. There are quite a number of factors that could be responsible for bringing out such poor price performance, although, for the time being, the more important question remains: could there be price growth ahead, rather than talks about the failed rally?\n\nEthereum, until this point in time, had not been able to really breach key resistance levels, even after ETF approval. Critical reasons behind this are the kind of approval \u2014 it was not the full-blown S-1 type \u2014 and, hence, the doors for further regulatory issues are still open.\n\nBesides, the Division of Trading and Markets gave this consent under delegated authority, which is subject to challenge over the next 10 days. All this amounts to some additional uncertainty that adds to the overall position of the markets.\n\nBut it is not all bad over the long term. The plain fact that any acceptance of an Ethereum ETF, even partial, sets a precedent in this space and sets off further potential and larger instances of crypto adoption.\n\nCardano's weird position\n\nCardano is not the most noted asset in the market, does not bring much volatility and, therefore, did not form very noticeable moves in previous weeks. However, we can see some potential here because ADA is approaching a major support, which can afterwards serve as a base for a reverse.\n\nAt this point, the chart is showing Cardano establishing a new level of support around $0.45. This level has been tested several times and has held up under the pressure of the downside, perhaps pointing to some real interest in that price. The volume spike on this new movement definitely strengthens the case for this to be an important level for the price. If ADA can hold onto this level, it might serve as a nice base upon which to initiate an upward move.\n\nOn a daily chart, ADA has its immediate resistance located at $0.50. This is a price level at which the ticker has seen rejections in the onward price action for the last couple of days. One critical thing to note is that once breached, the current fanatical rally could see a target at $0.55, exactly where the 200-day moving average lies."
