Currently priced at $2,950 per ETH, Tuesday saw the bulk of this decline, culminating in a weekly low of $2,817.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAmid this turbulence, attention has been drawn to a suspected Ethereum Foundation address, \"0xd7,\" which reportedly sold 100 ETH for 291,267 DAI via the Cow Protocol today.\n\nThis transaction was followed by a transfer of the acquired DAI to another Ethereum Foundation address, \"0x9e.\" Notably, this suspected Ethereum Foundation address has been consistently exchanging ETH for DAI through the Cow Protocol in recent times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow solid is that foundation?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of Ethereum and related technologies. According to reports from Arkham, the known accounts of the Foundation currently boast 310,867 ETH, valued at $915.15 million.\n\nExcluding exchanges and select projects, the foundation stands as one of the largest altcoin holders, with assets estimated to exceed $1 billion, encompassing holdings in WETH.E worth $91.87 million, along with 329,239 DAI \u2014 some of which arrived in foundation addresses today.\n\nThe revelation of one of the foundation's key holders offloading a portion of their ETH holdings has sparked speculation regarding its potential impact on Ethereum's future trajectory. The implications of such actions on the price of main altcoin remain uncertain, leaving investors and enthusiasts with unanswered questions."

With continued community support and positive secondary indicators like crypto ETF approvals, futures trading for flagship memecoin Dogecoin on Coinbase Derivatives, and the anticipation of Bitcoin pricing eventually reaching 100,000 USD, $BRETT\u2019s growth picture remains bullish.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing in real time how memes are not just an easy and funny way to share information on the internet, but to create almost immediate wealth by harnessing the power of these memes,\u201d said $BRETT trader Crash. \u201cThis is the culmination of the grassroots financial movement of the past decade, from Bitcoin to r/WallStreetBets to now $BRETT, allowing people to escape the economic drudgery of living in The Matrix.\u201d\n\nBase is Coinbase\u2019s L2 built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase recently released new smart wallet technology built on Base, with $BRETT quickly becoming the most popular memecoin available for purchase there. Coinbase continues to be ambitious in its promotion of Base and the memecoins sold there, with plans to onboard over 1 billion users to the chain. Community response memecoins like $BRETT are also an easy way to boost early liquidity for the developers of new platforms on Base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$BRETT is one of the original characters of the Boy\u2019s Club written by Matt Furie, the creator of the famous cartoon that has also inspired the popular Pepe meme and popular $PEPE memecoin. $BRETT involves a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens, with a 6% transaction tax distributed to liquidity pools and burned tokens, aiming to reduce the overall supply and potentially increase the value over time.\n\n$BRETT continues to hold strong amid recent sideways market movement for memecoins.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBut the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.\n\nEconomist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve.\"\n\nAnalysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee\u2014which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates\u2014would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.\n\nSome thoughts on the current crypto cycle #1 The crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF. #2 ETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers. #3 Solana established itself as the chain of choice for\u2026 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) May 1, 2024\n\nDuring a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said, but warned that it was \u201clikely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.\u201d\n\nBut even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. \"I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut,\" he said during a press conference in Japan last month. \"This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that.\"\n\nHe was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to \"decentralize your own security,\" after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.\n\nTo prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig Safe wallet.\n\n\"M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust,\" he wrote. \"Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.\"\n\nThe \"m-of-n\" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym 0xkofi on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage.\n\nThe above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for >90% of my personal funds \ud83d\ude42 M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust.

It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win.\"\n\nBut not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself,\" he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.\n\nThat's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.\n\nPeople often think of @safe wallets as a team only solution. While this might have been true in early 2020, the user base has since evolved significantly. Today, individuals make up more than 99% of @safe users, including notable ones like @VitalikButerin and @punk6529 https://t.co/EyZuKpF2xa \u2014 Daniel (@danftz) May 1, 2024\n\nAlthough Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin.\n\n\"Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and Punk6529,\" wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as Daniel on Twitter.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This wallet contains millions worth of Ethereum.\n\nThis premined whale had spent almost nine years in dormancy \u2013 this means since 2015, the year that followed the end of the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nThe reactivated wallet contains almost 2,000 ETH worth $5,876,786.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 1,969 #ETH (5,876,786 USD) has just been activated after 8.8 years!https://t.co/MzyVVkMhIc \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 2, 2024\n\nEthereum Foundation dumps ICO ETH\n\nPrior to this awakening, an ancient wallet that belongs to the Ethereum Foundation was reactivated after nine years.

This money put into it during the period of the Ethereum ICO was moved to a new blockchain address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, the market has reacted negatively when the Ethereum Foundation has released large amounts of Ethereum.

Earlier today, it was reported that another wallet linked to the foundation sold 100 ETH for 291,267 DAI via the Cow Protocol.\n\nEthereum whale activity soars high\n\nThis awakening of an ancient whale took place after the overall activity of Ethereum whales demonstrated the largest growth in addresses over the past year. Approximately 139,560 new ETH wallets were created on a single day \u2013 April 29, according to cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nEarlier this week, the second-largest cryptocurrency saw a tremendous decline of 12.16%, falling from $3,243 to the $2,960 zone. It was followed by a small rebound of 3.87%. This discount provided a great opportunity to buy the dip, and traders immediately took advantage of this, setting up almost 140,000 new wallets, expanding the network.\n\nProminent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has just tweeted that he expects Ethereum may go down to the $2,500 zone \u201cfor the most optimal play.\u201d However, he does not believe that crypto markets are likely to be in for such a heavy correction. \u201cMost of the downside is already in,\u201d he added."

        "content": "Bitcoin price reclaiming above $59,200 would hint that BTC has already bottomed out, setting the tone for a run north.\n\nEthereum price holding above $2,900 keeps a bullish reversal pattern viable despite falling momentum.\n\nRipple price coils up for a move north as XRP bulls defend $0.5000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price slipped below $60,000 on Wednesday as markets tried to front-run the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n\nIn the mid-April meeting, the Fed alleged new uncertainty concerning whether it could cut rates later this year because of inflation data from the previous quarter. This had markets anticipate a rate hike, causing Bitcoin price to dump, going as low as the $56K range.\n\nIn a surprising twist on Wednesday, however, the Fed decided to keep rates unchanged, with the improved sentiment sending BTC back into the $58,000 range.\n\nThe sentiment has extended to Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices as they continue to hold above key support levels.\n\nAlso Read: Relief wave on altcoins likely as Bitcoin price shows a $5,000 range\n\nKey level to watch as Bitcoin price slowly grinds up\n\nBitcoin price drop on Wednesday saw it draw close to testing the Bull Market Support Band at $55,831. However, dovish news from the FOMC may have turned around fortunes as the BTC price is slowly grinding up. If the bulls can manage to haul BTC back above the $59,200 level, it could solidify the recovery, effectively meaning that BTC has bottomed out at $56,552.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin price remains in the woods amid falling momentum and growing bearish sentiment, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators.\n\nIf the Bull Market Support band fails to hold as support, Bitcoin price could extend the fall toward the $52,000 threshold, or in a dire case, test the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, with the RSI holding well above the mean level of 50, and the AO still in positive territory, all hope is not lost for BTC bulls. And while a flip of $59,200 into support would solidify a recovery rally, the bearish thesis will only be invalidated once BTC breaks and closes above $72,000.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price reclaims $59K as Fed leaves rates unchanged\n\nEthereum price still flirts with 25% upside potential\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern. This bullish pattern will be executed after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline in the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the height of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point. The descending wedge pattern remains viable, given that the Ethereum price continues to hold above $2,900 in the 12-hour timeframe.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, with the lower highs of the RSI, the bears could have their way, sending Ethereum price below the $2,900 buyer congestion level. Such a move would not only negate the bullish reversal pattern but also encourage more sell orders.\n\nTraders looking to open long positions for ETH should wait for the RSI to reclaim above 50 mean level, a move that could be accompanied by a bounce of Ethereum price above the lower boundary of the pattern. A 12-hour candlestick close above $3,212 would provide a good entry.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum attempts recovery from dip amid unchanged interest rates and accusations leveled at SEC Chair\n\nRipple price defends against further downside\n\nRipple price could pivot around $0.4952, marked by the 50% Fibonacci placeholder, as XRP bulls show commitment to defend the $0.5000 threshold. The RSI has managed to record higher lows in the one-day timeframe, which points to growing bullish momentum.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see the XRP price bounce with the prospect of reclaiming the $0.5715 peak of the range. In a highly bullish case, the gains could be seen in the rippling price foray above $0.6000, which is almost 17% above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the 50% Fibonacci placeholder fails to hold as a support, the Ripple price could drop. A candlestick close below $0.4782 would produce a lower low, hinting at a possible trend reversal.\n\nSpooked holders would then pull the trigger, sending Ripple price below the $0.4500, or in a dire case, roll over to $0.4188. This would mean a fall of nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP sustains above $0.50 as traders digest news of Ripple XRP Ledger entry in the Japanese market."

        "title": "Ethereum price\u2019s $3360 rejection \u2013 Blame profit-taking or\u2026 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum saw two sizeable waves of profit-taking in the past month that projected doubts about an upcoming rally.\n\nThe ETH whales have added to their stash, with retail being keen to sell.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a rejection from the $3360 resistance level over the weekend. This outlined short-term bearish sentiment.\n\nIn other news, the latest Dencun upgrade was a success, helping L2 solutions reach low gas fees.\n\nThe next target for the developers is called Prague. Even though hopeful news was breaking, on-chain metrics showed a lack of faith from market participants.\n\nThe clues from the Ethereum supply distribution\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the supply distribution showed that almost every wallet holding anywhere from 1 to 100k ETH has been selling in recent months.\n\nThe micro wallets with under 0.1 Ethereum were the ones buying, hopeful of a rally after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] halving.\n\nIn the past, when the 100k-1 million token holder cohort was added to their stash, it came during a market rally. Sometimes it preceded a major retracement, like it did in mid-January.\n\nThe second half of April saw this cohort quiet down, neither adding to nor selling their supply.\n\nThe 1 million- 10 million cohort saw a sharp uptick in early March. Since then, they too have been quiet. Together, it showed that the large participants expected bullish sentiment in the coming months.\n\nA sharp spike in the 100k- 1 million holders\u2019 supply could be useful for traders to mark local tops and imminent retracements.\n\nDoes fear still rule the market?\n\nThe network realized profit/loss (NRPL) grows during periods of swift price appreciation as profits pile up. The first two weeks of March saw strong price rallies alongside NRPL spikes.\n\nThis indicated profit-taking activity.\n\nHowever, the NRPL has trended downward since then. It saw occasional spikes, such as in late March and mid-April, each smaller than the last.\n\nThis showed participants were keen on booking profits even though the price was just above the $3k support zone.\n\nIt indicated a lack of faith, which is part of the extended retracement Ethereum has witnessed in the past two months.\n\nOn the other hand, the mean dollar invested age (MDIA) has trended strongly higher in the past month. This metric shows that the asset is in an accumulation phase once again.\n\nIt fell sharply during the rally to indicate holders were realizing profits en masse.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIn the past month, the HOLDer sentiment has been stronger than the collective urge to book profits.\n\nIn conclusion, the metrics showed both fear and hope were present in the market, but long-term investors have more reason to hold on than to sell."

        "content": "Analysts predict peak cycle for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid regulatory uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory debates and SEC allegations intensify negative sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAs Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, dips below the $60,000 threshold, analysts suggest that BTC may have reached its peak for this cycle.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seems to be mirroring the movements of Bitcoin, as both cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing a downward trend.\n\nCommenting on the uniqueness of this crypto cycle, crypto veteran Alex Kr\u00fcger said,\n\n\u201cThe crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers.\u201d\n\nWhy is Ethereum losing its limelight?\n\nUndoubtedly, Bitcoin achieved remarkable performance by reaching new record highs in this cycle. However, Ethereum\u2019s position has declined, falling below Solana in terms of product-market fit and retail trader popularity.\n\nThis raises a question: Can Ethereum\u2019s price plummet to $2500 within the next 7 days?\n\nWell, to answer this, AMBcrytpo analyzed the liquidation levels for ETH.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the Ethereum market has a cluster of liquidation levels between $2640 and $2750, attracting traders due to high liquidity. Additionally, this price range aligns with a bullish order block observed at the range highs, further reinforcing its significance.\n\nThis underlines that Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to decline to this liquidity pocket before a potential reversal.\n\nThe concerns surround ETH\u2019s classification as a security\n\nMoreover, the ongoing debate surrounding whether ETH is a security has intensified negative investor sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAmidst these metrics, a new development also took place wherein Rep. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee noted,\n\n\u201cNew court filings indicate that @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of #ETH at a @FinancialCmte hearing to conduct oversight of his agency.\u201d\n\nThis highlights the increasing uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status and its impact on investor sentiment.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, @TheDustyBC, a content creator, took to X (Formerly Twitter) and said,\n\n\u201cEthereum not being kind on the feelings today.\u201d\n\nWay forward\n\nHowever, now with the hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on the 1st of May. And, the Hong Kong ETFs being a major disappointment, the execs are still waiting for the tables to turn. Needless to say, Kr\u00fcger claims,"

The RSI on the 1-day timeframe has been below neutral 50 for most of April, highlighting consistent downward momentum.\n\nThe OBV also slipped below a support level recently and retested it as resistance.
