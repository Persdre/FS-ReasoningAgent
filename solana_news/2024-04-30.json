        "title": "Ethereum and Altcoin Capitulation Approaching Amid \u2018One Final Push\u2019: Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are on the verge of a major market correction.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 800,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) may be making one final move to the upside before a market capitulation.\n\n\u201cIn order for confirmation of [bullishness], you would need to see ETH/Bitcoin get above its bull market support band and then start holding it as support. And if you don\u2019t see that, then I still think it\u2019s just going to be yet another lower high that everyone once again got excited about that ultimately resolved to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also says ETH and alts may be repeating a similar pattern from the last cycle when the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all altcoins minus Ethereum and stablecoins, suffered a severe correction against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, the ETH/Bitcoin capitulation occurred, it finalized after alt/Bitcoin pairs broke down.\n\nSo one thing about this bounce is that alt/Bitcoin pairs have not yet broken down. They haven\u2019t had a weekly close below their range low. So I think that you\u2019re seeing something very similar with alt/Bitcoin pairs that you saw over here [in June 2019], one final rally up to the bull market support band \u2013 it didn\u2019t even make it to the bull market support band back then \u2013 and then it came down. I think you\u2019re seeing something like that happen once again with alt/Bitcoin pairs, one final push before capitulation down to the range lows this summer\u2026\n\nI think this is the final push before the final capitulation into the summer, as we get into potential rate cuts.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Hit $10,000 If The SEC Changes Tune? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January this year broadened the outlook of the crypto market for most investors. Attention quickly shifted to Ethereum with companies swiftly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer spot ETH ETFs. For a short while, Ethereum price surged alongside Bitcoin price. Although the latter achieved a new all-time high of $73,837 according to data by CoinGape and CoinGecko, ETH topped out at $4,091.\n\nEthereum Price Market Update As Volatility Rages\n\nThe post-Bitcoin halving crypto environment remains in a precarious state. An initial climb in crypto prices waned, paving the way for the current correction. Bitcoin price changed at $60,715 on Tuesday during US hours, painting a 3.5% drop in the last 24 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto had been hammered the most, losing a modest 5.6% of its value to $2,984. A 6.6% fall in the market cap to $361 billion reflects the intense sell-off in April while the 8% spike in the 24-hour trading volume hints at the growing interest in Ether among traders.\n\nLosing support at $3,000 exposes Ethereum price to more selling pressure at the outset of May. The position of the smart contract token below two bull market indicators \u2014 the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA (blue and red lines on the chart) could further trigger more declines this week.\n\nA death cross pattern confirmed on April 17 when the 20-day EMA flipped beneath the 50-day EMA is another bearish signal that\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nSimilarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that sellers have more influence at the time of writing. Therefore, it would be imperative to anticipate continued losses to $2,800, and if push comes to shove $2,500.\n\nDespite the correction, the RSI is not oversold, suggesting that there\u2019s room for more downward movement.\n\nNevertheless, the same four-hour chart brings attention to a wedge pattern. If Ethereum price rebounds before breaking below the lower trendline support, chances of a targeted recovery will increase significantly.\n\nA falling wedge is considered a bullish pattern occurring after a substantial surge in the price of an asset followed by a drop, or consolidation. As the trendlines narrow, bulls fight to retake control.\n\nTraders will look for a breakout above the upper trend line, which often points to a breakout target equal to the distance between the widest points of the pattern. A 24% increase in price could drastically change Ethereum\u2019s outlook.\n\nIs Ethereum A Security?\n\nUS Regulators are undecided on Ethereum\u2019s status \u2014 whether a security or a cryptocurrency. With the expectations of a spot ETF gaining momentum, this determination is crucial and likely to set a precedent for many digital assets.\n\nA recent report by Fox Business producer Eleanor Terret revealed that Gary Gensler and the agency he heads, the SEC believed that Ethereum passed as security, but only for some time.\n\nThis revelation comes amid the ongoing Consensys lawsuit against the SEC. In the report, Terret said that Gensler and the SEC \u201cappear to have believed for at least a year\u201d that Ethereum was an \u201cunregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations.\u201d\n\nAn investigation dubbed \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d is being carried out by the SEC intending to unearth details of Ethereum being a security, especially on the sales of Ether from 2018.\n\nFormer executives of the SEC like Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman are on record stating that Ethereum was not a security. Hence, the ongoing investigation could throw this stance in the wind, further opening a can of worms for the SEC.\n\nOn the other hand, if the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation affirms Ether\u2019s status as a cryptocurrency, it could potentially bolster its position in the industry.\n\nAt the very least, it will increase the probability of spot Ethereum ETFs approval \u2014 a move that could blast ETH price above the previous all-time high. A clear path could also be opened for Ethereum to close the gap to $10,000 bolstered by increased adoption among retail and institutional investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Halving the Cake: Can Bitcoin & Ethereum Survive the Cut? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Toobit\n\nNew York, NY, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the looming question on investors' minds is whether Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, can withstand the challenges presented by their upcoming halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rewards miners receive for validating transactions, has historically sparked intense speculation and debate within the crypto community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToobit, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, offers insights into the potential implications of the halving for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Toobit's analysis, both Bitcoin and Ethereum face unique challenges and opportunities as they approach their respective halving milestones.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin's halving event, which took place on 19 April 2024, represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency,\" states a spokesperson from Toobit. \"The halving has officially raised the stakes for the asset. Not only is it scarce, but BTC price has hit an all-time high. This shows that there is a viable future for cryptocurrency despite all the noise. Every move from now onwards will dictate cryptocurrency history.\"\n\nWith the issuance of new Bitcoin rewards being cut in half, the Bitcoin halving event underscores the asset's scarcity and reinforces its position as a store of value. However, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's mining ecosystem and the potential impact on transaction fees.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with its popular EIP-1559 upgrade, adds another layer of complexity to the halving equation. Despite these changes happening several years ago, the Ethereum halving is not as clean cut as the Bitcoin halving, which may make it confusing for unfamiliar users. Toobit emphasizes the importance of staying updated with these developments, as they are responsible for the shaping of Ethereum's future viability as a leading smart contract platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism promised scalability and sustainability benefits, but it also introduced uncertainties regarding its economic model and network security,\" explains Toobit's spokesperson. \"It's easy to get excited about the new ETH price with each halving event and forget about the bigger picture. Therefore, we must also reflect on Ethereum's ongoing efforts to address scalability challenges and enhance user experience with every halving event.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you believe that this is time to start investing in crypto, Toobit is the place to start. Pick your choice of cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL (SOL price), DOGE (DOGE price), ETC (ETC price), FTM (FTM price), Storj (STORJ price), FIL (FIL price) or the 100 other tokens that Toobit offers.

With careful analysis and strategic planning, investors can navigate the halving landscape and capitalize on the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and Ethereum's maturing ecosystems.\n\n\n\nFor more information, crypto market analysis, and expert insights, visit Toobit's website at https://www.toobit.com/\n\n\n\nAbout Toobit\n\nToobit is a leading cryptocurrency platform dedicated to providing comprehensive insights, analysis, and tools for investors and enthusiasts.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to \"decentralize your own security,\" after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.\n\nTo prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig Safe wallet.\n\n\"M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust,\" he wrote. \"Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.\"\n\nThe \"m-of-n\" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym 0xkofi on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage.\n\nThe above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for >90% of my personal funds \ud83d\ude42 M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 1, 2024\n\n\"Your hardware wallet will be your fortress of solitude,\" Kofi wrote. \"It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night. It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win.\"\n\nBut not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself,\" he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.\n\nThat's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.\n\nPeople often think of @safe wallets as a team only solution. While this might have been true in early 2020, the user base has since evolved significantly. Today, individuals make up more than 99% of @safe users, including notable ones like @VitalikButerin and @punk6529 https://t.co/EyZuKpF2xa \u2014 Daniel (@danftz) May 1, 2024\n\nAlthough Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin.\n\n\"Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and Punk6529,\" wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as Daniel on Twitter.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, represented mainly by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is facing new challenges arising from global macroeconomic conditions, here is a price analysis.\n\nThe unexpected increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States in April and the decline in GDP in the first quarter reflect an evolving financial context that could negatively impact the price of major cryptocurrencies.\n\nImpact of Global Liquidity Tightening on the Analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices\n\nRyan Lee, analyst at Bitget, highlights that the global liquidity squeeze could have a significant impact on the performance of BTC and ETH in the month of May.\n\nWith the reduction of the FED\u2019s net liquidity, the market expects an average performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cLooking at the options market, the implied volatility of BTC and ETH has dropped from highs of 78% in April to around 58%, with a more significant reduction for options expiring at the end of May,\u201d\n\nobserve Lee.\n\nThis indicates that options market traders predict a low probability of a significant turnaround in the next month.\n\nWhile interest rates in the USA continue to rise, suppressing demand in the real estate sector and showing a direct influence on existing home sales, the cryptocurrency market is feeling this pressure.\n\nLee predicts a possible correction for BTC and ETH in May, followed by a volatile recovery.\n\nAccording to the analyst, BTC could fluctuate between $56,000 and $68,000, while ETH, influenced by events such as the launch of ETFs on Ethereum, could show greater volatility, fluctuating between $2,600 and $3,600.\n\nOther experts in the field share similar opinions, but with variations in short-term expectations. Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA, comments that \u201cthe strength of the US dollar and the increase in interest rates could continue to put pressure on cryptocurrencies, which traditionally benefit from a high liquidity environment.\u201d\n\nThe Influence of Macroeconomic Conditions on Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe behavior of cryptocurrencies in a climate of rising interest rates and a strong dollar raises significant questions about their role as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets. Traditionally, assets like gold have been preferred by investors during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nHowever, with the evolution of the global financial context, cryptocurrencies have also started to be perceived as possible alternatives. \u201cCryptocurrencies have shown remarkable resilience in times of economic turbulence, which could strengthen their appeal as an alternative investment in times of uncertainty,\u201d notes Jennifer Liu, market analyst at CoinDesk.\n\nThis point of view is supported by a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in various economic sectors, increasing their legitimacy and potential for stability.\n\nLooking to the future, technological innovation in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies continues to play a crucial role.\n\nWith the introduction of new features, such as improving the energy efficiency of mining operations and developing more user-friendly platforms, cryptocurrencies are trying to overcome some of the main critical issues that limit their adoption on a large scale. \u201cThe technological aspect cannot be underestimated,\u201d says Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro.\n\n\u201cInnovations such as Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake are indicators of the potential of these technologies not only as speculative assets, but as long-term sustainable solutions to various global problems.\u201d\n\nWith these ongoing developments, investors are encouraged to stay informed and proactive. Market conditions can change rapidly, and having a deep understanding of both economic dynamics and technological innovations can provide a significant advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, while macroeconomic challenges pose uncertainties, the adaptability and advancement of cryptocurrencies offer a window into a future where they can emerge as pillars of a new financial paradigm."

        "content": "Amidst the downturn of Ethereum and Solana, Raboo emerges as a compelling option for investors. With a token presale now in its third stage at $0.0042 and a projected 100x surge in 2024, Raboo is poised to disrupt the market. As investors ponder which crypto to buy, Raboo's potential for exponential growth steals the spotlight in the turbulent cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nRaboo: Emerging Powerhouse Amid Ethereum & Solana Downturn\n\nRaboo is captivating the cryptocurrency market with its remarkable progress and innovative features. As it passed the $1 million raised mark, Raboo boasts over 5,200 registered members and 1,800 token holders, signifying widespread interest and trust.\n\nThe exclusive NFT launch for presale token holders adds allure, offering potential rewards and perks. Its integration of social-fi and artificial intelligence elements creates a dynamic platform for meme enthusiasts, fostering engagement and community participation.\n\nWith a fully audited contract on the Ethereum blockchain, Raboo demonstrates its commitment to reliability and security, instilling greater confidence among investors. This meticulous auditing process ensures that the token's smart contract functions as intended, mitigating the risk of vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\nBy prioritizing security, Raboo provides investors with assurance regarding the integrity of their investments, fostering a conducive environment for participation in its ecosystem. This emphasis on transparency and risk mitigation not only strengthens investor trust but also positions Raboo as a trustworthy and dependable platform within the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum: Benefits, Challenges, and Future Outlook\n\nOne benefit of Ethereum is its robust ecosystem, offering a platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, fostering innovation and development in the blockchain space.\n\nEthereum's scalability challenges are primarily manifested in network congestion and high gas fees during periods of peak usage. Network congestion occurs when there is a surge in transactions, leading to delays in processing and confirmation times.\n\nAs a result, users experience slower transaction speeds and higher fees when prioritizing their transactions. Additionally, high gas fees, which are required to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum network, can become prohibitively expensive during peak periods, especially for smaller transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at addressing scalability issues through the implementation of proof-of-stake consensus and sharding, has faced delays and uncertainties, leading to concerns about the network's ability to handle growing demand and competition from alternative blockchain platforms.\n\nSolana: Advantages, Price Predictions, and Fluctuations\n\nOne benefit of Solana is its high throughput and low transaction fees, making it ideal for decentralized applications requiring fast and cost-effective transactions. However, Solana's price can be volatile, influenced by factors like network performance, market demand, and competition.\n\nDespite fluctuations, analysts predict continued growth potential for the Solana price as it establishes itself as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nHowever, investors should remain cautious due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions related to Solana price fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Raboo steals the spotlight amidst Ethereum and Solana downturns, its unique features like NFT launches, AI meme integration, and an audited Ethereum contract make it a standout choice. With its potential for massive growth and community engagement, Raboo emerges as a leader for those wondering which crypto to buy in the current market.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here."

        "title": "Solana and Ethereum Smart Contract Audits Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Ethereum Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has been the go-to choice for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts for several years. However, its success has also made it a prime target for attackers. Here are some key points to consider regarding Ethereum smart contract security audits:\n\nSolidity Language: Ethereum smart contracts are typically written in Solidity, a specialized programming language. Solidity has a rich set of tools and libraries for developers, but it can be prone to vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflow.\n\nOpenZeppelin: OpenZeppelin, a popular open-source framework, provides standardized contracts and libraries to help developers build secure Ethereum smart contracts. These pre-audited components reduce the risk of coding errors.\n\nAuditing Firms: Ethereum smart contracts are often audited by specialized firms that focus on blockchain security. These audits help identify vulnerabilities and suggest fixes before deployment.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum is home to numerous DAOs, which are organizations governed by smart contracts. DAO security has been a major concern, as vulnerabilities in these contracts can lead to large-scale theft.\n\nEthereum 2.0: The transition to Ethereum 2.0, which includes a shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, is expected to enhance security and scalability.\n\nHow Does an Ethereum Smart Contract Audit Work?\n\nThe finest security companies will subject their code to stress tests to determine how it performs in a variety of situations. According to experts, it is essential for a project to provide a comprehensive and explicit technical specification and, ideally, documentation of the deployment process.\n\nThese audits aim not only to identify vulnerabilities that black hat hackers could exploit but also defects that could prevent an Ethereum smart contract from functioning properly. The attack vectors under investigation can become quite technical, but they include replay attacks, in which malignant actors repeatedly transmit valid data in order to conduct fraudulent activities. Other attacks include reentrancy, reordering, and brief address attacks.\n\nOnce an investigation has been completed, crypto projects receive a detailed report of the vulnerabilities within their code, along with recommendations on how to mitigate their impact or eradicate them altogether. Therefore, the resources conserved by an effective audit can significantly outweigh the cost. Moreover, it can prevent reputational injury.\n\nSolana Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nSolana, a newer entrant in the blockchain space, has gained popularity for its high-speed and low-cost transactions. When it comes to Solana smart contract security audits, here are some key considerations:\n\nRust Programming Language: Solana smart contracts are typically written in Rust, a programming language known for its safety features. Rust\u2019s memory safety and other design choices reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities.\n\nProgram Library: Solana provides a standard library for writing smart contracts, which includes built-in functions to ensure security. This library encourages best practices in contract development.\n\nProgram Analysis Tools: Solana offers various program analysis tools and a developer-friendly environment, making it easier for developers to identify and fix issues.\n\nCommunity Auditing: The Solana community actively participates in auditing smart contracts. While this approach may lack the formality of third-party audits, it fosters a collaborative environment focused on security.\n\nInteroperability: Solana\u2019s interoperability with other blockchains and its support for cross-chain communication introduce new security challenges that need careful consideration.\n\nAre Solana Smart Contract Audits Different?\n\nAudits of smart contracts will vary marginally based on the blockchain code they are based on. Common security flaws in Solana can include omitted ownership checks, allowing attackers to circumvent access controls using spoofed configurations.\n\nAnd while smart contracts can call functions from external smart contracts, validation failures may allow black hat hackers to inject malicious inputs that influence the operation of the code. Top auditing firms will evaluate a Solana smart contract based on the quality of its documentation, security, architecture, and code. Additionally, vulnerabilities are designated severity levels, allowing business-critical issues to be addressed first.\n\nHow Do Smart Contract Audits Benefit Crypto Projects?\n\nAudits are essential for ironing out any bugs in a crypto project and ensuring that the code is suitable for widespread use. In 78 incidents during the first quarter of 2022 alone, hackers stole $1.33 billion; two-thirds of these attacks were on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. But how could a smart contract audit have assisted them?\n\nWell, common causes include crypto initiatives that prioritize speed over a comprehensive audit from a reputable service provider. They may also rely on internal teams to conduct security reviews. While this appears fiscally prudent, there is a risk that internal personnel are not up to date on the most recent cyber techniques used by malicious actors. Unavoidably, some will also believe that they are invincible. But complacency is the greatest enemy in the crypto space, and even the best initiatives can be hacked.\n\nHow Much Do Smart Contract Audits Cost?\n\nThe cost depends on how complex the smart contract is. According to Hacken, this can increase to $500,000 for larger initiatives with more lines of code, not to mention the additional engineering hours required. The company contends that these expenses pale in contrast to the economic harm that a smart contract vulnerability can cause.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how smart contract audits can make a difference: an audit uncovered at least one critical bug in 80% of initiatives. However, according to Hacken, only 75% of organizations have completely acted on an audit report in the past, with the remainder ignoring the conclusions or considering only a small number of recommendations. As a consequence, their security score was lower.\n\nHow Long Do Smart Contract Audits Take?\n\nIt is a process that requires several weeks, depending on the speed at which a crypto project operates. Initial audits typically take between 2 and 14 days, depending on the complexity and scale of a smart contract. These investigations can be expedited if necessary. Again, larger protocols may take longer, up to 30 days in some instances.\n\nDo Smart Contract Audits Improve Crypto\u2019s Image?\n\nBlockchain technology is becoming a bigger part of all our lives \u2014 and auditors ensure that crypto initiatives put their best foot forward. Improving the quality of smart contracts reduces negative press coverage of significant hacks and enhances the reputation of crypto projects in the eyes of the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum offer unique approaches to smart contract security. Ethereum, with its longer history, has established formalized auditing processes and a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s emphasis on safety through the Rust programming language and community engagement is a promising step towards ensuring secure smart contracts.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, security remains a top priority. Developers and organizations must carefully consider the trade-offs and security features of each platform when choosing where to deploy their smart contracts. As both Solana and Ethereum continue to evolve, the blockchain community can look forward to even more robust security measures and best practices for smart contracts.\n\nIn conclusion, the security of smart contracts is an ongoing concern, and it\u2019s essential for blockchain developers and organizations to stay vigilant, adopt best practices, and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain security to protect valuable assets and ensure the trust of users and investors."

This outlined short-term bearish sentiment.\n\nIn other news, the latest Dencun upgrade was a success, helping L2 solutions reach low gas fees.\n\nThe next target for the developers is called Prague. Even though hopeful news was breaking, on-chain metrics showed a lack of faith from market participants.\n\nThe clues from the Ethereum supply distribution\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the supply distribution showed that almost every wallet holding anywhere from 1 to 100k ETH has been selling in recent months.\n\nThe micro wallets with under 0.1 Ethereum were the ones buying, hopeful of a rally after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] halving.\n\nIn the past, when the 100k-1 million token holder cohort was added to their stash, it came during a market rally. Sometimes it preceded a major retracement, like it did in mid-January.\n\nThe second half of April saw this cohort quiet down, neither adding to nor selling their supply.\n\nThe 1 million- 10 million cohort saw a sharp uptick in early March. Since then, they too have been quiet. Together, it showed that the large participants expected bullish sentiment in the coming months.\n\nA sharp spike in the 100k- 1 million holders\u2019 supply could be useful for traders to mark local tops and imminent retracements.\n\nDoes fear still rule the market?\n\nThe network realized profit/loss (NRPL) grows during periods of swift price appreciation as profits pile up. The first two weeks of March saw strong price rallies alongside NRPL spikes.\n\nThis indicated profit-taking activity.\n\nHowever, the NRPL has trended downward since then. It saw occasional spikes, such as in late March and mid-April, each smaller than the last.\n\nThis showed participants were keen on booking profits even though the price was just above the $3k support zone.\n\nIt indicated a lack of faith, which is part of the extended retracement Ethereum has witnessed in the past two months.\n\nOn the other hand, the mean dollar invested age (MDIA) has trended strongly higher in the past month. This metric shows that the asset is in an accumulation phase once again.\n\nIt fell sharply during the rally to indicate holders were realizing profits en masse.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIn the past month, the HOLDer sentiment has been stronger than the collective urge to book profits.\n\nIn conclusion, the metrics showed both fear and hope were present in the market, but long-term investors have more reason to hold on than to sell."

        "title": "Ethereum to outshine Bitcoin this summer? Raoul Pal\u2019s bold prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Analyst claims ETH will eclipse BTC in crypto summer.\n\nThe US liquidity injection could boost the market in the second half 2024.\n\nEthereum [ETH] could outshine Bitcoin [BTC] as we inch closer to crypto summer. The bold projection was made by Raoul Pal, founder of Real Vision and key crypto market commentary figure.\n\nIn an X post, Pal underscored that crypto summer is an altcoin season that shifts attention from Bitcoin to others. Part of his post read,\n\n\u201cCrypto Summer is usually the start of Alts season, which goes full \u201cbubble-tastic\u201d in Fall. This is when ETH bases and begins to outperform BTC. This is when SOL accelerates its outperformance of BTC & ETH.\u201d\n\nAdding a timeline to his projection and how \u201ccrazy\u201d things can get, Pal highlighted that,\n\n\u201cOnce the markets are full refreshed, that is usually when The Banana Zone starts, picking up to full mania towards the latter part of the year\u2026and well into 2025\u201d\n\nThe US liquidity factor\n\nPal\u2019s projection is purely based on historical data. However, past performance doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate future outcomes. So, what could be the key catalyst for Pal\u2019s wild projection?\n\nAn easing macro front is one of the likely factors. The Singapore-based crypto trading firm, QCP, emphasized how US liquidity injection could drive markets.\n\nIn a weekend update over Telegram, the firm acknowledged that US inflation was still hot. However, it reiterated that the US treasury could inject more liquidity in the second half of the year. Part of the statement read,\n\n\u201cHowever, at this point, monetary policy might matter much less than fiscal policy, which will be the main driver of liquidity and asset performance.\u201d\n\nThe firm added that,\n\n\u201cThe upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on 1st May could also see higher issuances in short-term US bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity.\u201d\n\nLast week, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes made a similar projection. He highlighted that extra liquidity will be injected into the economy during the US elections.\n\nMore liquidity means an extra money supply within global or local markets, especially when central banks cut interest rates. This is a perfect condition for risk-on assets to rally.\n\nWhether Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin remains to be seen. However, much of the hyped \u201ccrypto summer\u201d could be fueled mainly by macro factors rather than historical cycles."

At press time, in just 24 hours, SOL\u2019s price was down by over 10% on the charts.\n\nIn fact, the price decline resulted in a slight drop in total assets under management (AUM) from last week, from $1.15 billion to $1.14 billion.\n\nWas this the reason?\n\nWhile it is difficult to pinpoint the bullish catalyst propelling investors toward Solana goods, the possibility of reduced network congestion could be a credible cause.\n\nSolana developers have been shipping release after release to alleviate transaction failures and congestion on the network, issues that have contributed significantly to the FUD around the coin.\n\nThe latest one to go out was the v1.18.12, which was currently being validated in the test environment.\n\nThe Solana community hoped that these improvements would finally resolve the ongoing troubles with the blockchain, which has been strained to its limits due to an explosion in meme coin trading.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe latest blow\n\nWith Bitcoin crashing below $60,000, the downtrend has persisted on SOL\u2019s charts, with the altcoin down 10% in 24 hours.\n\nThe latest drop appeared to be part of the broader market bloodbath, fueled by lackluster performance of newly-listed spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong."

        "content": "Runes on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain can save traders from massive losses in the coming months.\n\nStaking on the Ethereum blockchain is on the rise, raising concerns about its future as \u201cmoney.\u201d\n\nAhead of the FOMC meeting (Federal Open Market Committee) of May 2024, the crypto-market saw a significant decline. Bitcoin dropped to $56,494 \u2013 A level last seen on 28 February 2024. Market sentiment skewed towards the side of fear as investors rebalanced their portfolios in expectation of no rate cuts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s MVRV Ratio (7-D) fell to -8.099%, at press time. On average, Bitcoin holders were underwater. It suggested that the market value was significantly lower than the price at which most acquired BTC.\n\nIt could also be taken as a sign of undervaluation. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s market report for the month of April, Bitcoin will continue its downward journey for the majority of trading sessions in May.\n\nHowever, the report discusses three factors (Related to BTCFi, Options ETF, and Solana) that could reverse the king coin\u2019s trajectory. Investments through BTC ETFs will have a bigger impact on price, compared to the fed rate cut anticipation or geopolitical strains.\n\nSince 24 April, BTC ETF outflows have been outweighing the inflows. On 30 April, a $161 million outflow was registered \u2013 The highest in the last three days.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s report throws light on a fresh perspective though \u2013 It reveals numerous institutions are seeking approval for Bitcoin ETFs. If these ETFs are green-lit in May, it could lead to a significant hike in demand, potentially driving the price north.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s savior \u2013 Runes\n\nThe rise of DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain could save traders from registering massive losses in the coming months (AMBCrypto\u2019s report dives into its full details).\n\nInterestingly, the 7-day moving average of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap to transaction fee ratio fell below that of Ethereum. It highlighted a huge surge in activity on the Bitcoin network since the launch of the Runes protocol. Basically, this ratio indicates how much money is flowing into a cryptocurrency relative to the transaction fees being paid.\n\nAltcoins\u2019 performance in April\n\nFollowing Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps, the price of other cryptocurrencies also fluctuated by a significant degree. April was a volatile month for most altcoins. The broader market witnessed a downturn due to geopolitical tensions and inflation fears. However, some sectors thrived, like gaming tokens.\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s report, Ethereum\u2019s dominance has been challenged by Solana, whose DeFi market share has been surging steadily. Meanwhile, an Ethereum ETF is still pending SEC approval, and staking on the Ethereum blockchain is on the rise, raising concerns about its future as \u201cmoney.\u201d\n\nTake a look at AMBCrypto\u2019s Market Analysis \u2013 April 2024 Edition\n\nDive into April\u2019s market trends, valuable data, and exclusive insights to help yourself navigate through May\u2019s market movements.\n\nThe report delves deep into key topics like \u2013\n\nRising popularity of DeFi on Bitcoin\n\nAmerica\u2019s love for memecoins\n\nFall in USDT\u2019s dominance\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL masterstroke\n\nNFT market\u2019s recovery\n\nMarket forecast for May\n\nYou can also download the full report here."

        "title": "What Caused the Global Crypto Market Crash Today? - Coinfomania",
        "content": "The broader crypto market experienced a sharp decline from April 30 through to the first day of May. Investors are worried about the huge loss in numbers, one that has not been seen in almost 3 months. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market cap has crashed by 5.64% to $2.14 trillion in the last 24 hours.\n\nSince the beginning of 2024, the crypto market has had a bullish momentum, catalyzed by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the positive sentiment was sustained by the anticipation of the recently completed Bitcoin halving. However, it seems like the momentum has come to an end as prices took a nosedive, beginning the month of May in \u2018bloodbath.\u2019\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency has plummeted by 7%, trading below the $60,000 mark. Per CMC data, BTC is changing hands at $57,636 with a live market cap of $1.13 trillion. Similarly, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has declined by a notable 5% $2,892 in the last 24 hours.\n\nOther popular cryptocurrencies including XRP, Solana (SOL), and BNB have lost 1.47%, 6.19%, and 5.13% of their value respectively over the last day. The tokens that took the worst hit among the top ten cryptocurrencies include Dogecoin (DOGE), and Toncoin (TON) with 9.12% and 8.99% respectively loss respectively.\n\nAs the overall outlook seems like the downturn is not reversing soon, investors are curious about the reasons behind the trend. Let us take a look.\n\nWhy is the Crypto Market Down Today?\n\nBitcoin ETFs Saturation\n\nEarlier this year, the crypto market, led by Bitcoin experienced a rally following the approval of spot ETF by the United States regulatory watchdogs. As a result, billions of dollars were injected into the market from institutional investors causing an upward swing in the price of the asset. However, crossing to Asia, the Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF approval in Hong Kong did not generate the same buzz as it did in the U.S. On the opening day, only $8.5 million in Bitcoin ETF trading and $2.5 billion in Ethereum ETF trading was recorded. This reduction might signify a loss of interest in crypto exchange-traded funds.\n\nSentencing of Changpeng Zhao\n\nThe founder and former CEO of Binance, Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao was sentenced to 4 months in prison on April 30 by Seattle-based U.S. District Judge, Richard Jones. Following the event, the crypto market plunged by 5.12% to $2.21 trillion, indicating the level of attention the court case gained. CZ pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023 hence the sentence. Even though the prosecutors had asked for a three-year sentence, the embattled founder was given a slap on the wrist with a lenient sentence.\n\nMomentum Fade\n\nWhat is alarming cryptocurrency investors more is that the catalyst for the previous six months\u2019 surge has suddenly subsided. After adopting a \u201crisk on\u201d mentality in the middle of 2023, investors are now dealing with a slowing economy and the fact that interest rates will be higher for a longer period than initially anticipated.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are pictured as a hedge against inflation by investors, however, the reality is that cryptocurrencies are very volatile assets and their value can rise and drop sharply at any time. We may have witnessed a peak in cryptocurrency values for the time being unless there is a change in the economy\u2019s growth rate or investors\u2019 willingness to take on more risk."
