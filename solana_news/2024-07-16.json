        "title": "Ethereum ETFs start trading Tuesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. - Fortune",
        "content": "New spot ETFs for Ethereum\u2014which will let investors purchase the second most popular cryptocurrency in the form of stocks\u2014 are expected to begin trading on Tuesday, July 23. The Securities and Exchange Commission has green lit at least three funds to enter the market that day, sources told Reuters, although it\u2019s believed that a total of eight Ethereum ETFs will launch simultaneously.\n\nThe instruments follow in the footsteps of the eleven trading spot Bitcoin ETFs. Having accumulated over $54 billion in assets under management since launching in January, Bitcoin has soared 47% this year. Here\u2019s all you need to know about their Ethereum counterparts.\n\nWhat is a spot Ether ETF?\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the SEC\u2019s reservations, Ether is legally considered to be a commodity, but the corresponding ETFs will be securities.\n\nETFs first came to market in 1993. The funds pool together a basket of securities, such as a handful of different energy stocks, and the price aligns with the indexes that it tracks. They are listed on exchanges and can be traded during market hours, thus operating like stocks.\n\nSpot Ether ETFs will track the spot\u2014or current\u2014price of Ether. The products give investors access to the underlying crypto without the need to own a crypto wallet. The ETFs will be set up as grantor trusts, meaning investors will own a share of the Ether held by the trust.\n\nWho issues them and what are the fees?\n\nEight asset managers are proposing to offer Ethereum ETFs: BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Invesco/Galaxy Digital. Each instrument will be near-identical, so the fees charged to investors are competitive. For now, we know that Franklin Templeton will charge 0.19%, VanEck at 0.20%, and Invesco and Galaxy Digital will charge a 0.25% fee for its jointly filed ETF.\n\nThe full list of fees will be revealed when the final registration statements, or S-1s, are submitted to the SEC. This will be on Tuesday, if trading begins for all eight.\n\nWhere can I access them?\n\nThey will be listed on the Nasdaq, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWhy would someone buy an Ethereum ETF?\n\nBitcoin and Ether tokens represent units of ownership\u2014and thus value\u2014of an underlying blockchain. Beyond that, they are very different.\n\nWhereas Bitcoin may be a long-term hedge against inflation, Ethereum is closer to a tech investment. The blockchain\u2019s main premise is \u201cto remove the intermediary and allow for 24/7 uptime in financial services, such as trading and lending, in addition to tokenization, digital collectibles, and digital identity,\u201d Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, told Fortune.\n\nWhile for now crypto markets are tightly correlated, this may not always be the case, he adds. So, Ether ETFs allow investors to diversify which corners of the crypto economy they want to invest in.\n\nWill their popularity match the spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nDemand for the funds will be 20% that of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, told Fortune. This prediction is because the market capitalization of Ether is about one-third of the size of Bitcoin. Plus, he adds, the ETFs will lack a key benefit of holding Ether: Investors will not be allowed to stake, which generates yields. But, even at this smaller size, they would be \u201cextremely successful\u201d by any ETF launch standard, says Seyffart. Similarly, K33 Research predicts that during the first six months of trading, inflows will be $4 billion\u2014a quarter of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen judging their success, it\u2019s key to evaluate performance after six months of trading, rather than simply on \u201cgame day\u201d and the initial weeks, Leah Wald, CEO and president of Cyberpunk Holdings Inc., told Fortune. Launching in summer, they\u2019re coming to market when trading is typically \u201cmore muted,\u201d she points out. Plus, success should also be judged on volume and spread, rather than simply inflows, as the health of these metrics foreground AUM growth down the line, she adds, as investors feel safe allocating dollars into these new securities.\n\nWho will be investing in them?\n\nInstitutional investors, such as hedge funds, pension funds, banks and endowments. Retail investors will also access them, either by buying them directly, or through portfolio allocations via wealth advisors. The latter group will likely dominate the first six months of trading, as the Q1 13Fs for the spot Bitcoin ETFs reveal that over 80% of total AUM was from non-professional investors.\n\nHow will the ETFs impact the crypto market?\n\nIf K33\u2019s prediction of $4 billion in inflows over six months is accurate, at current prices, this would mean 1% of Ether in circulation would be absorbed by the ETFs by the end of the year. This absorption is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to strengthen Ether\u2019s price in the second half of the year, says Lunde.\n\nThe inflows would also be bullish for the wider market, history suggests. The fresh capital flowing into Bitcoin via the ETFs have boosted the crypto market cap by 46% in 2024, according to K33. Lunde anticipates the products \u201ccould further expand the broad market strength\u201d as they enable sidelined capital to enter the market. Plus, Bitcoin ETF investors have \u201chave proven to handle volatility with grace, and flows have been solid even during deep corrections,\u201d says Lunde, suggesting ETFs can open up the market to new investors committed to the long-term.\n\nLastly, as BlackRock, a behemoth of traditional finance, is issuing one of the funds, this shows the firm is diving deeper into crypto. This grants the industry a \u201csolid and well-needed stamp of approval,\u201d he says."

        "content": "Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin on Wednesday cautioned against voting for political candidates based solely on whether they have adopted a \"pro-crypto\" stance.\n\n\"The game of politics is much more complicated than just 'who wins the next election', and there are a lot of levers that your words and actions affect,\" Buterin wrote in a blog post that warned even Putin and the Russian government had \"expressed willingness to become 'open to crypto.'\"\n\nButerin's post comes as Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president, rallies members of his party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, and a day after venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz told employees of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that they plan to make significant donations to political action committees supporting Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Ben & Marc Show,\" which features the a16z co-founders, Horowitz said that the Joe Biden administration, in the form of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has \"fought\" them every step of the way by \"using very nefarious means.\"\n\n\"They've sued I think over 30 of our companies,\" added Horowitz. \"They're losing almost all these lawsuits, but the problem is that when you're a startup you don't have the money to fight the U.S. government and so they're kind of nuking the industry in that way.\"\n\nFairshake, a super PAC backed by crypto's top companies, is now one of the top-spending PACs in this election cycle. Of the $160 million in total contributions it has raised, 94% can be traced back to just four companies: Ripple, Andreesen Horowitz, Coinbase and Jump Crypto.\n\n\"There is a particular style of being 'crypto-friendly' that is common to authoritarian governments, that is worth being wary of. The best example of this is, predictably, modern Russia,\" added Buterin, a Russia-born coder who built ethereum in his late teens.\n\nTesla chief Elon Musk and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, as well as crypto leaders like Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have also endorsed Trump.\n\nIn early June in San Francisco, technologists, crypto executives, and venture capitalists paid up to $300,000 per ticket to join a Trump fundraiser that ultimately raised more than $12 million.\n\n\"In particular, by publicly giving the impression that you support 'pro-crypto' candidates just because they are 'pro-crypto', you are helping to create an incentive gradient where politicians come to understand that all they need to get your support is to support 'crypto,'\" continued Buterin, who is known for periodically posting longer essays opining on existential threats to the ecosystem writ large.\n\nButerin did not single out any names in his post of either political candidates, or of those opting to support them.\n\nTrump \u2014 who launched his latest non-fungible token collection on the solana blockchain in April \u2014 has been making increasingly bullish comments on crypto.\n\nHe is accepting digital currency donations and has pledged to defend the rights of those who choose to self-custody their coins, meaning that they don't rely on a centralized entity like Coinbase to hold their tokens and instead, do it themselves in personal crypto wallets, which are sometimes outside the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Trump also vowed at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington in May to keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and \"her goons\" away from bitcoin holders.\n\nMeanwhile, following a meeting with bitcoiners at Mar-a-Lago with about a dozen mining executives who pledged cash and votes to him, Trump declared that all future bitcoin will be minted in the U.S., should he return to the White House.\n\nOn Monday, the Republican presidential nominee added Ohio Senator JD Vance to his ticket as vice president \u2014 a move viewed by many as a net win for the crypto sector. Vance has advocated for looser regulation of crypto and disclosed in 2022 that he personally holds bitcoin .\n\nIt comes in stark contrast to the Joe Biden White House, which has been seen as hard on crypto. Under President Biden, the SEC has dialed up actions on the sector, and even in the absence of hard-and-fast rules from Congress, the U.S. has proven to be one of the most active enforcers of penalties and legal enforcements against crypto companies.\n\nThe angrier the crypto industry got at the SEC for arresting and prosecuting them, the more people like Vance saw a chance to stake out a position on the opposite side of a crypto-skeptical Biden administration.\n\nHowever, the perception that Biden is anti-crypto and Trump is pro-crypto has some Biden allies concerned enough to take their case directly to senior White House officials.\n\nTrump is set to headline the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee on July 27."

        "content": "Lee Enterprises newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nEthereum is considered the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ethereum's price has had its share of highs and lows. Why does its price change so much, and how can investors navigate these ups and downs?\n\nA Bit of Background - What Is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is not just a digital currency. It is a platform that allows developers to build and run applications without a central authority (like a bank or the government). This makes it different from Bitcoin, primarily a digital form of money.\n\nThe currency used on this network is called Ether (ETH). Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has become the backbone of many innovative technologies, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's Price History\n\nEthereum's price has seen its share of highs and lows. When it first launched, Ether was priced at about $0.30. By early 2018, during intense interest in cryptocurrencies, its price skyrocketed to around $1,400. However, this boom was followed by a severe crash, which brought the price down to around $80 by the end of the year.\n\nDespite these fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience. In 2021, it reached new heights, surpassing $4,000, likely due to the rising popularity of DeFi and NFTs. These technologies primarily rely on the Ethereum network, which results in an increased demand for Ether.\n\nWhy Does Ethereum's Price Fluctuate So Much?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Ethereum's price fluctuations:\n\nMarket Sentiment: Like the stock market, cryptocurrency prices are heavily influenced by people's thoughts and feelings. Joyous news, such as a big company starting to use Ethereum, can drive the price up. Negative news, like a hack or stricter regulations, can cause the price to drop.\n\nLike the stock market, cryptocurrency prices are heavily influenced by people's thoughts and feelings.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, issued a warning on Wednesday against choosing a candidate purely based on whether they claim to be \u201cpro-crypto.\u201d In a blog post, Buterin said it\u2019s more important to scrutinize a candidate\u2019s broader policies to ensure they support cryptocurrency\u2019s underlying goals, including internationalism and protection for private communications.\n\n\u201cIf a politician is pro-crypto, the key question to ask is: Are they in it for the right reasons?,\u201d wrote Buterin. \u201cDo they have a vision of how technology and politics and the economy should go in the 21st century that aligns with yours?\u201d\n\nThough Buterin does not mention any politicians or crypto investors by name, his comments come just one day after Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz threw their support behind former President Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential election. The founders of Andreessen Horowitz noted on their podcast yesterday that Trump\u2019s crypto regulation plan is \u201ca flat-out blanket endorsement of the entire space.\u201d The influential venture capitalists join the ranks of other notable Silicon Valley players, including Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump in the last week.\n\nFurther, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder made the case that signaling you broadly support any \u201cpro-crypto\u201d candidates could incentivize politicians to promote the cause in bad faith. Buterin notes that authoritarian leaders, particularly in Russia, have claimed to support crypto in an effort to consolidate power.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they also support banning encrypted messaging, if they are a power-seeking narcissist, or if they push for bills that make it even harder for your Chinese or Indian friend to attend the next crypto conference \u2014 all that politicians have to do is make sure it\u2019s easy for you to trade coins,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nThe co-founder of Ethereum suggested to look into a \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d politician\u2019s views on crypto five years ago. He says this can serve as a guide for whether the politician may reverse their position five years in the future.\n\nNotably, former President Trump starkly opposed decentralized tokens five years ago. In a tweet from July 2019, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cnot a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money.\u201d In a follow-up tweet, he said \u201cwe have only one real currency in the USA,\u201d referring to the United States dollar.\n\nBut in May, Trump completed a total flip-flop on his stance regarding cryptocurrencies, becoming the first major presidential candidate to accept bitcoin donations. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump\u2019s crypto fundraising efforts have collected $3 million worth of donations in the second quarter."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs\u2019 launch will catapult its price to new heights, expert says.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s staking feature plays a key role in its prices.\n\nBitwise CIO expects $15 billion in inflows over the next 18 months.\n\nWith spot Ether exchange-traded products set to hit markets next Tuesday, one expert says Ethereum will hit a new all-time high soon after.\n\nMatt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer, said there are three reasons why Ethereum will rise above $5,000 after the ETFs start trading.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s slow supply growth, lack of miners, and staking will pay serious dividends and enable the new ETFs to outperform Bitcoin funds, Hougan said in a new investor note.\n\nHe has previously estimated that investors will pour $15 billion into spot Ethereum ETFs in their first 18 months of trading.\n\nEthereum supply slows\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are inflationary, meaning more are created and sold on the market over time.\n\nBitcoin does this, but the amount that will ever exist is capped at 21 million.\n\nEthereum is also inflationary, but a technical feature that slows this process was added three years ago.\n\nThe burn feature destroys a small portion of Ether with every transaction.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhen people swap, trade, or lend on the Ethereum network more frequently, more Ether can be destroyed than produced.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the net amount of Ether hitting the market has been nearly zero as of September 2022.\n\nThe network produces an equal amount of Ether as the burn feature destroys.\n\nThe total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. The total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. (Etherscan/Etherscan)\n\nHougan said this slowed growth and the launch of a new demand source will increase Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThere\u2019s less Ethereum on the market, and with the launch of Ethereum ETFs, many Wall Street firms will start buying it for their products.\n\nMore demand translates to higher prices.\n\nMiners aren\u2019t stakers\n\nBitcoin mining is an industry that demands enormous resources, from electricity costs to high-end machines. Miners regularly sell the Bitcoin they mine to pay these costs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case with Ethereum stakers.\n\nEthereum operates a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. This means it doesn\u2019t require an industrial-grade mining operation to keep it secure.\n\nInstead, users must lock up 32 Ether, which is worth roughly $111,000 today, and become validators who secure the network.\n\nValidators are paid in newly created Ethereum to prevent fraudulent transactions on the network.\n\nRunning a validator is far less expensive than running a profitable mining outfit. This means there is less need to sell Ethereum to continue operating.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, there is simply less forced selling each day in Ethereum than in Bitcoin,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nStaked and off the market\n\nMore than 33 million Ether are staked today, nearly 28% of the entire cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, according to a Dune dashboard by analyst Hildobby.\n\nMore importantly, says Hougan, this is Ether that\u2019s not moving soon either, as they are locked up for a set period, meaning it cannot be withdrawn or sold.\n\n\u201cCurrently, 28% of all ETH is staked, meaning it is effectively off the market,\u201d Hougan said\n\nThe combination of low inflation, fewer sellers in Ether stakers, and millions of Ether off the market make the proposition of an ETH ETF especially bullish, said Hougan.\n\n\u201cIf the ETPs are as successful as I expect \u2014 and given the dynamics above \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine ETH not challenging its old record.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 3% over the past 24 hours to trade at $65,000.\n\nEthereum is up 1.8% to $3,476.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nLiam Kelly is a DeFi correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "'Ethereum Killer' Solana Could Soar To $174, Says Popular Crypto Analyst After Identifying This Bullish Pattern\n\nInfluential cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez predicts a bullish run for Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), often touted as an \u2018Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) killer,' amid growing market optimism around the digital asset.\n\nWhat Happened: On Monday, Martinez posted his optimistic prediction for Solana on X, formerly Twitter. He noted the formation of a \u201cW\u201d pattern in Solana\u2019s chart, which prompted him to forecast a rise to $174.\n\n\n\n\n\n#Solana appears to be forming a W pattern, which suggests $SOL will surge toward $174! pic.twitter.com/OxXODWi1yA \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2024\n\nAlso called a double bottom pattern in technical analysis, the \u201cW\u201d pattern typically occurs at the end of an extended bearish trend and signals a bullish reversal.\n\nSOL was last seen at around $174 more than six weeks ago in May.

        "title": "Is XRP Ready for $0.7? Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Verge of $0.00002, Ethereum (ETH) Reversal Halted - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's 30% rally placed the asset at the forefront of the bull market, with the potential to break even higher, potentially hitting this year's high of $0.7, but numerous factors should align for it.\n\nOver the last few days, XRP has demonstrated remarkable strength, breaking through major resistance levels and drawing interest from the cryptocurrency community. With many speculating as to whether the momentum can push XRP even closer to $0.7, the rally has brought the cryptocurrency very close to a critical threshold.\n\nNumerous signs point to the possibility that XRP will keep rising. First, there has been a noticeable surge in trading volume for the asset, which suggests that investors are actively participating in it. As more market participants join the rally, this spike in volume frequently precedes subsequent price increases.\n\nFurthermore, technical research reveals that XRP has overcome a number of resistance levels and converted them into support. The previous thresholds at the $0.52 and $0.54 levels are now serving as support, giving the next leg up a strong foundation. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are also seeing gains, and the market's attitude toward cryptocurrencies is currently positive overall. This general bullishness on the market makes it easier for XRP to profit from the upward momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu regains important positions\n\nShiba Inu is getting closer to the $0.00002 price threshold, which could be the next move for the asset since it is already trading close to the month's high. The main issue with the asset right now, though, is the lack of momentum.\n\nWith steady ascents toward the $0.00002 mark, SHIB has demonstrated a comeback in the last few days. This level poses a major psychological obstacle for investors and traders. Crossing above this barrier might open the door for more gains and possibly spark a bigger rally. Technical indicators show that SHIB has overcome a resistance level of 100 EMA.\n\nThe asset is currently up against the 200 EMA resistance, though, and it could be a major obstacle. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is getting closer to the overbought area, indicating that the current rally may be flagging. Even with the improvement, the trading volume is still low when compared to earlier spikes.\n\nThere is reason for concern because this weak trading activity suggests that there may not be enough market interest to sustain the current price movement. A spike in volume would be required to give SHIB the necessary momentum to continue on its upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum stops\n\nEthereum has hit the 50 EMA resistance level and now might retrace below key values like $3,300. Luckily, we saw a volume surge, which could be a sign of an upcoming reversal.\n\nEthereum experienced a setback after its recent rally brought it close to the 50 EMA resistance level. At $3,300, a critical support level, the asset is presently having difficulty holding its position. The 50 EMA presents a significant challenge because, if not decisively broken, it frequently functions as a barrier that can stop upward momentum. The increase in trading volume is one aspect of Ethereum's current market activity that is positive.\n\nStronger interest and participation from traders are frequently indicated by increased volume, and this can result in more persistent price movements. The increase may suggest that buyers are entering the market, which could lead to a reversal.\n\nWe might witness a further retracement of the asset, possibly testing lower support levels like $3,200, or even $3,000. This could happen if the asset is unable to hold its position above $3,300. Further, worth keeping an eye on is the Relative Strength Index, which can reveal if an asset is overbought or oversold and offer insights into potential future price movements."

        "title": "The launch of Ethereum ETFs: the news from the community - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The crypto world is buzzing with news, July 23, 2024, will mark a crucial date for Ethereum (ETH) investors: on this date, in fact, the launch of several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on ethereum in the United States is expected, an eagerly awaited move that could lead to a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States recently responded to the issuers regarding the final approvals for these ETFs, granting preliminary approval for at least three of the eight proposed.\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs: the news from the community\n\nThe ETFs on ether cash represent a significant innovation for the US financial market. The issuers of these ETFs have worked closely with the SEC to ensure\n\nthat their registration statements become effective, thus allowing the ETFs to start trading smoothly. This intense collaboration was necessary to meet the strict regulatory requirements and to gain the necessary trust from the regulatory authorities.\n\nThe introduction of ETFs on cash ether could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. ETFs represent an accessible and regulated investment tool that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to purchase them directly.\n\nThis could lead to an increase in the demand for ether, as institutional and retail investors look for safe and regulated ways to enter the bull market of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to analyst John Smith, the preliminary approval by the SEC for ether ETFs is a positive signal indicating a growing recognition and acceptance of cryptocurrencies by regulatory authorities.\n\n\u201cThis move could pave the way for further financial products based on cryptocurrencies in the future, further contributing to legitimizing the cryptocurrency sector as a whole,\u201d said Smith.\n\nWith at least three of the eight proposed ETFs on ether already preliminarily approved, the competition among issuers is becoming fierce.\n\nAmong the main contenders are high-profile financial companies such as VanEck, ProShares, and WisdomTree, all with extensive experience in managing ETFs on other asset classes. The competition between these financial giants could lead to significant innovation in the design of ether ETFs, with the goal of attracting a wide range of investors.\n\nThe regulatory challenges\n\nDespite the preliminary approval, the issuers of cash ether ETFs still face several regulatory challenges. The SEC, in fact, has expressed concerns regarding the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the possibility of market manipulation. For this reason, the issuers must demonstrate that their products are designed to mitigate these risks and protect investors.\n\nJulie Anderson, expert in financial regulation, emphasized the importance of this verification process.\n\n\u201cThe SEC is trying to balance innovation with investor protection. Issuers must demonstrate transparency and solidity in their proposals to obtain final approval,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the launch of cash-settled ether ETFs on July 23 could mark the beginning of a new era for the cryptocurrency market. Investors will finally have access to a regulated instrument to invest in Ether, which could lead to an increase in confidence in the cryptocurrency market and greater participation from institutional investors.\n\nFurthermore, the success of ETFs on ether could pave the way for the approval of other financial products based on cryptocurrencies, such as ETFs on other cryptocurrencies or on diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. This could further expand investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector and help stabilize the market in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe preliminary approval of cash ether ETFs by the SEC represents an important step towards the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial markets.\n\nThe launch scheduled for July 23, 2024, is awaited with great interest by investors and industry operators, as it could mark a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the issuers will overcome the regulatory challenges and if they will manage to obtain the final approval from the SEC. In any case, the attention of the financial world will surely be focused on this historic event, which could open new perspectives for investment in cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Ethereum Bull Run Sustained, Bad News: Speculators Are In - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Like Bitcoin and top altcoins, including Solana, Ethereum is holding steady. At the time of writing, it is trading above the local support at $3,300 and floating higher, targeting $3,700.\n\nSpeculators Flowing To ETH As Bulls Set Sight On $3,700\n\nThe leg up is fueled by multiple market-related factors, mainly the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the next few days. As seen from the daily chart, news of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracking the approval of 19b-4 forms sparked a wave of demand from May 20.\n\nHowever, speculators are permeating the scene even as prices remain steady and uptrend. CryptoQuant data shows that the estimated leverage ratio has risen in the past few trading days.\n\nWith this reading ticking higher, the ETH scene receives more leveraged traders keen more on profiting from price volatility rather than benefiting from what ETH as a digital asset presents.\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant, the estimated leverage ratio stood at 0.347 on July 16 before rising to 0.354 on July 17. The expansion suggests that traders are increasingly borrowing funds on perpetual trading platforms like Binance and OKX, hoping to make a killing if ETH bulls push prices above $3,700.\n\nAs prices rally, the estimated leverage ratio will likely climb even higher. The local top is at 0.358, as recorded on July 14. The all-time leverage ratio was at 0.392, registered in early July 2024.\n\nEyes On Spot Ethereum ETFs: Will It Be A Success?\n\nEthereum traders are confident that prices will rise, even breaching all-time highs, once spot ETH ETFs are launched. The latest reports show that the derivative product will launch early next week, allowing institutional investors to gain exposure.\n\nThe United States SEC has given the green light to three issuers to launch. However, it is expected that all spot Ethereum ETF applicants whose 19b-4 forms have been approved will be permitted to launch simultaneously.\n\nConfidence is high that spot Ethereum ETFs will follow the success of their spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to SosoValue, all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers manage over $53 billion of BTC as of July 18.\n\nEven so, though highly anticipated and likely to positively impact prices, the product will see a different level of demand than when spot Bitcoin ETFs launched.\n\nAnalysts pin this to Ethereum\u2019s lower market cap and the United States SEC\u2019s decision not to allow spot ETF issuers to stake ETH. By staking, issuers would receive rewards on behalf of their clients.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Rattles Industry After Warning of Pro-Crypto Candidates - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a post warning voters from supporting \"pro-crypto\" candidates that may be making superficial promises.\n\nButerin's post received a range of reactions, with one outspoken crypto startup CEO calling him \"politically naive.\"\n\nRepublicans and presidential candidate Donald Trump have increasingly embraced crypto during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA blog post published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Wednesday urged prospective voters not to support political candidates simply because they call themselves pro-crypto.\n\nThe post elicited a wide range of reactions from crypto industry figureheads, and didn\u2019t sit well with some of the industry\u2019s more conservative voices\u2014particularly Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, an increasingly vocal backer of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cVitalik is an idealist, not a realist. He is one of the more politically naive people I have read and/or interacted with in crypto,\u201d Selkis told Decrypt. \u201cMoreover he\u2019s Canadian, and he\u2019s given thinly veiled permission to vote for the most provably authoritarian and anti-tech president in American history because he\u2019s intellectually overconfident but politically weak.\u201d\n\nSelkis co-founded the crypto market intelligence firm Messari in 2017. Over the past few years, he\u2019s emerged as a political heavyweight within the crypto industry, coordinating efforts to fund a crypto-friendly political action committee, while railing against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Twitter (aka X) for what advocates say is a regulatory war on crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \"pro-crypto\"https://t.co/rEbRjZYtFB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 17, 2024\n\nIn his blog post, titled \u201cAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \u2018pro-crypto,\u2019\u201d Buterin emphasized that supporting crypto isn\u2019t limited to the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies or blockchain tech.\n\nHe argued that a politician\u2019s stance on issues like privacy, internationalism, and even immigration are part of the larger \u201ccypherpunk\u201d picture\u2014and that a candidate simply claiming they\u2019re \u201cpro-crypto\u201d to get more votes isn\u2019t a very meaningful embrace of those values.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter if they also support banning encrypted messaging, if they are a power-seeking narcissist, or if they push for bills that make it even harder for your Chinese or Indian friend to attend the next crypto conference,\u201d Buterin wrote of a presiding political dialogue in the U.S. \u201cAll that politicians have to do is make sure it's easy for you to trade coins.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at venture capital firm Variant Fund, replied on Twitter that Buterin\u2019s post had \u201csolid points,\u201d but that some readers were likely to draw a conclusion that Buterin himself did not explicitly state.\n\n\u201cToo many people will read the headline as \u2018Vote Biden!\u2019 and miss the rest,\u201d Chervinsky wrote.\n\nAnother headline for this could have been \"Don't sacrifice your cypherpunk ethos for a particular 'pro-crypto' politician or policy proposal.\" I entirely agree with that principle. Politicians will come and go. Privacy, speech, and the rule of law must be preserved. https://t.co/QrrBwoDNGu \u2014 Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) July 17, 2024\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a non-profit focused on crypto policy issues, recommended an alternative headline for Buterin\u2019s post.\n\n\"Don't sacrifice your cypherpunk ethos for a particular 'pro-crypto' politician or policy proposal,\u201d Van Valkenburgh suggested on Twitter. \u201cPoliticians will come and go. Privacy, speech, and the rule of law must be preserved.\u201d\n\nIncentives aligned?\n\nCastle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter wrote that crypto already aligns with his \u201clibertarian/conservative values,\u201d and that it only makes sense that Republicans would embrace it. He also argued that Trump has surrounded himself with politicians that are \u201cauthentically pro-crypto,\u201d such as his vice presidential pick Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and the one-time presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nButerin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nOn Twitter, Selkis has described November\u2019s coming choice between President Joe Biden and Trump as an existential moment for crypto. On Wednesday, he wrote his \u201cpolitical allegiances [are] based on who is mentally competent to be commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI also like Trump's evolution on crypto,\u201d the CEO added.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Vitalik's political commentary is meaningless to me, and should be to you as well if your primary focus is American politics. He is a Canadian and Russian. I humbly suggest that he fix those governments first, and stay out of American politics. \u2014 Ryan Selkis (d/acc) \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@twobitidiot) July 17, 2024\n\nIndeed the former president has changed his tune on crypto since saying Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam\u201d in 2021. Accepting crypto donations now while defending the industry, Trump is set to be a headline speaker at next week\u2019s Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nFollowing the failed assassination attempt against Trump by Thomas Matthew Crooks during a Pennsylvania rally Saturday, Selkis\u2019 comments drew mixed reactions. \u201cThe Civil War for the country started today,\u201d Selkis wrote, prior to posting, \u201cPraying for peace. Preparing for war.\u201d\n\nWithout explicitly naming any politician, Buterin wrote that a politician\u2019s thoughts on crypto years ago are a relevant gauge for future expectations. How a politician acts when supporting freedom and supporting corporations are at odds with each other is telling too, he wrote.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of decentralization among crypto pioneers like Satoshi Nakamoto, Buterin reprised a quote from the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He described Nakamoto\u2019s response to someone doubting cryptography\u2019s ability to solve political problems as a rare statement on the subject, and an early lesson that informed crypto\u2019s core values.\n\n\u201cWe can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom,\u201d Satoshi wrote of peer-to-peer networks. \u201cGovernments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure [peer-to-peer] networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for writing this,\u201d Linda Xie, the co-founder of Bountycaster, a bounty service for the decentralized social media network Farcaster, wrote on Twitter. Previously, she posted, \u201cI'm not a single-issue voter on crypto and won't support someone just because they are pro-crypto.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing Buterin\u2019s blog post, Selkis wagered that Buterin wouldn\u2019t debate him because it would reveal \u201chow little he understands politics outside of textbooks.\u201d Still, Selkis pondered whether Buterin could present himself one day as \u201ca debate equal.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs to launch next Tuesday. Here\u2019s why ETH's price could be set to explode - FXStreet",
        "content": "SEC preparing Ethereum ETFs to launch next week Tuesday after asking issuers to return final S-1s, says Bloomberg analyst.\n\nEthereum investment products raked in $72 million in inflows, its highest level since March.\n\nEthereum could set a new yearly high in the coming weeks after ETH ETF approval.\n\nEthereum is up more than 7% on Monday following updates from Bloomberg analysts that the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would potentially greenlight spot ETH ETFs to launch next week Tuesday. The increased inflows across global Ethereum investment products also align with the new development, as traditional investors seem to be preparing for a potential rally ahead of the launch.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Why ETH ETFs could perform well\n\nIn an X post on Monday, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said that the SEC plans to launch Ethereum ETFs on July 23 (next Tuesday) after responding to issuers today. Balchunas highlighted that the SEC asked issuers to submit their final S-1s with fees included on Wednesday before the launch can take place.\n\nThis may be highly bullish for the entire crypto market, considering the Bitcoin conference will be taking place next week, and US presidential candidate Donald Trump is listed among the speakers.\n\nUpdate: Nate's instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course! https://t.co/D21FD9Qf94 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 15, 2024\n\nReuters also reported that three industry sources confirmed that the SEC gave \"preliminary approval\" to at least three issuers to launch their spot ETH ETF products next Tuesday, provided they submit their updated S-1s before the week runs out.\n\nEight issuers, including Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, 21Shares, VanEck, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Invesco, will potentially launch their spot ETH ETFs on the same day.\n\nThe SEC approved issuers' ETH ETF 19b-4 filings last week but needs to greenlight their S-1 registration statements before the products can begin trading. Issuers submitted their updated S-1s with the SEC last week after the agency made light comments on them.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional investors are turning bullish on Ethereum as the ETH ETF launch draws closer. This is evidenced in the recent weekly performance of global Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed inflows of about $72 million, its highest level since the market rally in March, according to data from CoinShares.\n\nWhile some analysts have predicted that ETH ETFs may underperform, the recent growth across international Ethereum ETFs suggests otherwise. Additionally, most bullish investors speculate that ETH's low circulating supply due to locked ETH in staking protocols would allow the ETF inflows to spark a significant surge in ETH's price.\n\nEthereum CME open interest (OI) has also been growing faster than other derivatives exchanges, indicating a growing appetite among US investors for the largest altcoin.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could see a new yearly high\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,430 on Monday, up over 7% on the day. ETH's rise follows a general recovery across the crypto market after crypto investors reacted positively to presidential candidate Donald Trump's escape from gunshots during a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nAs a result, over $23.31 million worth of ETH short positions were liquidated whereas long liquidations significantly reduced to $3.86 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nETH's Long/Short Ratio, at 1.04, also shows the shift in market sentiment. The Long/Short Ratio estimates the total number of longs versus shorts in the market. A ratio above 1 suggests bulls are in control, and vice versa if it is below 1.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe recent change in market sentiment, combined with the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs on Tuesday, could propel ETH above the $3,974 to $4,093 resistance to set a new yearly high. On the downside, the $3,200 price level could serve as key support.\n\nIn the long term, trader @CryptoYoddha predicted that Ethereum could reach $13,654 in 2025 as its consolidation over the past few weeks suggests potential for higher growth.\n\nETH All-time chart"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt, regarded by many as a legendary figure on the financial markets since the 1970s, has sparked a wave of optimism in the Ethereum (ETH) community with his latest analysis. Brandt, known for his expertise in technical analysis, identified bullish chart patterns suggesting a potential price surge for the leading altcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, Brandt pointed to a \"four-month rectangle\" on the Ethereum price chart. This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation, where the price has been trading within a defined range. In his view, this consolidation could be a precursor to a breakout, potentially propelling the price of ETH up north.\n\nFurther bolstering his bullish outlook, Brandt identified a bullish \"horn bottom\" pattern. Explained simply, a horn bottom is a reversal pattern where the price dips down twice but fails to break a key support level, forming a hornlike shape. This pattern is often seen as a sign of accumulating buying pressure and a potential price increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA perspective on $ETH\n\nSupport was found at lower boundary of 4+ month rectangle, which was a retest of the Feb completion of a horn bottom\n\nTarget, pending upside completion, is 5600+ pic.twitter.com/EThcM61KpW \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 15, 2024\n\nTo illustrate his analysis, Brandt reportedly shared a price chart highlighting the identified patterns and his target price for ETH. This target sits comfortably above $5,600, a significant jump from current levels.\n\nBrandt's bullish call coincides with exciting developments surrounding a potential Ethereum ETF. Industry experts suggest the SEC might grant preliminary approval to several proposals by next Tuesday, July 23.\n\nAn ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum through a traditional investment vehicle, potentially attracting new capital and boosting the price."

        "title": "How Will Ethereum Evolve In 2025? - Jumpstart Media",
        "content": "Ethereum is a leading cryptocurrency prized for its versatility and innovation, though traders should be mindful of potential price volatility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world, although a relatively new player in the realm of trading and investment, has nonetheless made a significant impact with its unique features. Operating on decentralized networks called blockchains, cryptocurrencies have introduced a new way of thinking about technology. While the practical applications of this system might not always seem as immediately obvious as the buzzworthy technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse, blockchain is nonetheless a core component of a significant tech revolution\u2014one that is reshaping the economy and tech sector entirely.\n\nDespite its origins in the crypto space, blockchain technology is expected to evolve beyond its current scope, promising to revolutionize payment systems and financial infrastructures. An ideal future might see a hybrid model that integrates traditional financial mechanisms with blockchain\u2019s novel features to enhance transactional efficiency and security.\n\nBlockchain facilitates direct asset transfers without the need for third-party oversight, but its decentralized nature also introduces volatility and price fluctuations. These aspects have deterred some potential traders and led others to minimize their transactions to avoid significant losses. For blockchain to be viable for daily transactions, it must advance to be both safer and compliant with established market standards.\n\nBeyond the financial industry, researchers believe blockchain can also be transformative for other industries by enhancing market efficiency and transparency. It simplifies global supply chains by reducing errors, improves tracking, ensures secure record-keeping and even enables personalized loyalty programs, to name a few. While challenges such as scalability and interoperability remain, ongoing advancements are expected to address these hurdles.\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrencies, one of their major draws is their independence from any central authority. This autonomy is particularly appealing to investors who value anonymity and security, as no institution or individual can seize their digital assets on the blockchain\u2014except in criminal cases, of course. This feature is crucial in regions plagued by significant inflation, currency devaluation or authoritarian regimes.\n\nAdmittedly, the prices of cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and unpredictable due to their decentralized nature. Therefore, investors must be well-prepared and adopt sophisticated strategies to grow their portfolios. For those invested in Ethereum (ETH), understanding the Ethereum price prediction for 2025 is vital for crafting a long-term investment plan that aims to maximize gains and minimize losses.\n\nEthereum\u2019s role and innovations\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, trailing only behind Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH is not just used for trading. Ethereum is celebrated for its innovation and ingenuity, even outside of the crypto community. The Ethereum network has facilitated the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the concepts of decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nOperating as an open-source network, Ethereum incorporates smart contract functionality that is pivotal for DeFi. It is continuously upgraded and maintained by teams of validators, who are compensated with Ethereum tokens for their efforts. Without their assistance, transactions wouldn\u2019t move on the system. These tokens, often referred to as gas fees, incentivize the community to keep the network secure and efficient. Unfortunately, the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to increased demand and higher gas fees, which can make Ethereum less accessible to some investors.\n\nDespite high gas fees, many believe that Ethereum\u2019s robust and secure system justifies the cost. The platform\u2019s high security and continuous upgrades make it one of the most reliable blockchain systems worldwide.\n\nMarket trends and price action\n\n2022 has been a difficult year for Ethereum as it navigated through a bear market and the subsequent crypto winter. In 2023, much effort went towards consolidation, as there\u2019s no way to build and achieve growth without having a firm foundation first. Nonetheless, the prices ultimately remained relatively low.\n\nHowever, by the beginning of 2024, Ethereum\u2019s value started to climb as a result of the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This had long been anticipated by market participants for around a decade and was expected to have far-reaching effects on the market.\n\nThis approval helped Bitcoin reach new all-time highs, while altcoins like Ethereum managed to break through some key resistance levels. As of June 26, Ethereum has stabilized at the US$3,400 mark, with projections estimating continued growth throughout the rest of the year. The general consensus among experts is that Ethereum could get to US$20,500 by the end of the decade. This ambitious goal reflects confidence in Ethereum\u2019s unique model and scalability solutions that continue to attract investors.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025\n\nFor cryptocurrency investors, both the short-term and long-term outlooks are crucial. Common forecasts suggest that Ethereum will hit US$5,000 by December of this year before climbing even higher in 2025. The much anticipated official approval of Ethereum-backed ETFs is expected to significantly influence this growth, though investors should stay alert to potential market corrections.\n\nBy 2025, ETH might reach a new peak at US$6,500, with its price likely oscillating between US$4,500 and US$5,500 on average. These fluctuations present opportunities to buy more and strategically expand your asset portfolio. Generally speaking, while the market\u2019s direction in 2025 remains uncertain, an upswing could significantly enhance Ethereum\u2019s price potential, whereas a bearish trend could lead to modest pullbacks.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, staying informed and adaptable is key to achieving a positive outcome.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHeader Image from Unsplash"

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant price surge, trading at $0.44, up 40% over the last ten days, fueled by several internal and external factors that are generating renewed investor interest and optimism.\n\nCardano Price Crosses $0.45 First Time in 10-Days\n\nAfter having dropped to historic lows on Friday July 5, a positive shift in the US macroeconomic environment has provided a favorable backdrop for ADA\u2019s recent rebound phase. Positive Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data have bolstered investor confidence in the economic outlook, supporting the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nFurthermore, the anticipation of Ethereum ETFs expected to launch soon has spilled over into the altcoin market, including Cardano, as investors look for promising opportunities beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum\u200b\u200b.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe chart above shows how ADA price had slid to a 2024 bottom of $0.32 on July 5. But following the recent dovish macroeconomic reports, bulls have returned to the ADA markets with intensity.\n\nOn Tuesday July 16, ADA price briefly retested the $0.45 territory, marking 40% rebound over the last 10 days of trading. While Cardano price uptrend has mirrored the broader crypto market, on-chain data shows some internal bullish catalysts are also in play.\n\nCardano TVL Hits $240 Million Amid Market Rally\n\nOne of the key drivers of this price increase is the growing Total Value Locked (TVL) within Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. According to DeFiLlama, TVL has risen dramatically, starting the year under 200 million ADA and now exceeding 682 million ADA.\n\nProjects like the collateralized debt protocol Indigo and the decentralized exchange Minswap have both surpassed $50 million in TVL, reflecting robust adoption and engagement\u200b\u200b.\n\nValued at the current prices, the total value of assets deposited on the Cardano blockchain network has now crossed $240 million for the first time in 3-weeks. Typically, an increase in TVL is often considered a major bullish signal for the native token for a few reasons.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFirstly, Cardano\u2019s TVL surge is a prime indicator that daily active addresses and transaction volumes have risen, indicating strong network engagement. Secondly, it also indicates cooling selling pressure as more tokens are being locked up. This declining market supply could further accelerate ADA price rally, if the bulls remain in the driving seat.\n\nCardano Price Forecast: $0.50 Target in Sight\n\nCardano (ADA) has seen a notable bullish trend, trading at $0.43 after a 40% increase over the last 11 days. This upward momentum is reflected in the strong performance of key technical indicators, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon test the $0.50 resistance level.\n\nThe daily chart shows a robust uptrend as ADA has managed to climb from a recent low of $0.31 to its current price, supported by a positive Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL).\n\nThis indicator suggests a steady inflow of capital into ADA, highlighting growing investor confidence. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) dots are well below the current price, indicating a sustained upward trend and providing a near-term support level around $0.35.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also in a favorable position, currently at 56.36, which is just below the overbought territory. This suggests that there is still room for further price appreciation before ADA becomes overextended. The recent price action has seen ADA consolidate its gains around the $0.43 mark, creating a strong base for a potential breakout.\n\nIf ADA manages to clear the immediate resistance at $0.45, the next target would be $0.50. Beyond this level, the Fibonacci extension tool points to a potential rally towards $0.55, which could be a significant milestone for Cardano. Conversely, if the price retraces, strong support is likely to be found at $0.40 and $0.35, ensuring that any pullbacks are quickly contained."

        "title": "Launch of Ethereum ETFs Announced, Crypto Rebounds Over 20%! Analysis from July 17, 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Wed 17 Jul 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter reaching the lower part of its range, Ethereum rebounded by nearly 22%. Let\u2019s examine together the future outlook for ETH.\n\nSituation of Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nAfter reaching the lower part of its range around $2,900, a zone mentioned in the bearish hypothesis of the analysis of June 26, Ethereum attracted buying interest allowing it to rebound by more than 22%. In less than two weeks, the crypto price regained $3,500. It seems that this increase was accelerated by the announcement of the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs. Now, ETH has stabilized around its resistance. The most significant value zones are located on both sides of the crypto: below the current price, one can note $3,065. Above, one can identify the $3,800 zone.\n\nA value zone is a price range rich in volumes that can act as a key level for investors.\n\nAt the time of writing this text, the price of Ethereum is trading just below $3,500. The latest fluctuations of ETH show a short-term bearish trend on the verge of being reversed, which could thus signal a continuation of the medium and long-term bullish trend of the crypto. These statements can be supported by the fact that Ethereum has managed to reposition itself above the 200-day moving average. Unsurprisingly, the dynamics of Ethereum have resumed with more fervor, as evidenced by its price and oscillators. All these elements undeniably demonstrate a resurgence of buying interest in Ethereum.\n\n\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market, now an instructor at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. There, you will find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest in perpetual contracts on Ethereum seems to have followed the trajectory of its underlying asset\u2019s price. This indicates an increase in speculative activity on ETH. Considering Ethereum\u2019s recent rise, the predominantly seller liquidations, as well as a positive funding rate, the optimism surrounding Ethereum is evident. One can naturally conclude that this interest in ETH/USDT contracts is mostly buying-oriented, thus reinforcing the conviction of continuing the bullish momentum of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USDT\n\nThe liquidation heatmap of ETH/USDT over three months reveals that the previously identified liquidation zone at $2,850 has been reached and likely sparked buying interest. Now, the most prominent liquidation zones are mainly above the current price of Ethereum. Notable are the zones between $3,500 and $3,600, and just above, between $3,650 and $3,750. Higher, the most significant zone is at $3,900. Below the current price, $3,000 can still be noted. Approaching these levels could trigger massive orders, increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones, therefore, represent crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf the price of Ethereum stays above $3,065, one could anticipate a continuation of the bullish trend leading to a break above $3,500. The next resistance to consider would then be around $3,700 or even $3,800. If the bullish movement continues, it could reach $4,000 or even $4,100. At this point, this would represent an increase of more than 18%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to stay above $3,065, one could foresee a return around $2,900. The next support to take into account, if the bearish movement continues, would be around $2,800. Lower, the support at $2,720 can be noted. At this point, this would represent a decrease of about 21%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter reintegrating the lower part of its range, Ethereum demonstrated a significant rebound. The crypto\u2019s buying interest thus seems to have strengthened, supported by recent announcements and a medium to long-term bullish trend that seems to be continuing. Therefore, optimism seems to dominate regarding the cryptocurrency\u2019s future. However, it will be crucial to closely observe the price reaction to various key levels to confirm or refute current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant against potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Lastly, let us remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also change rapidly based on more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

It is currently trading slightly below the important $3,400 mark.\n\nThis uptick is in line with the rest of the market, which is currently experiencing considerable bullish momentum following the correction that took place last week.\n\nThe price has dipped a bit in the past few hours after briefly touching $3.5K on Binance.\n\nThat said, one of the most popular prop traders with 50 years of experience, Peter Brandt, has recently commented on the ETH price, outlining the possibility of a considerable surge.\n\nIn a tweet from earlier today, Brandt shared his \u201cperspective\u201d on ETH, saying that \u201csupport was found at the lower boundary of 4+ month rectangle, which was a retest of the Feb completion of a horn bottom.\u201d\n\nNow, a a horn bottom pattern in technical analysis is referred to price action identified by two downward spikes embracing a tiny middle candle, followed by a sharp rally.\n\nHere is Brandt\u2019s chart:\n\nThe interesting bit is that he said that the target for this pattern\u2019s resolution is above $5,600. If it happens, this would mean an increase of around 64% for ETH."

        "content": "Crypto tokens added nearly 4% to market capitalization, pushing it to $2.52 trillion as traders digest news of the shooting at Donald Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF approval is expected this week, fueling the anticipation of Ether token holders and crypto traders.\n\nBitcoin sustains above $65,000 as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP extend gains on Wednesday.\n\nCrypto market capitalization increased nearly 4% in the last 24 hours and climbed to $2.522 trillion on Wednesday, as seen on CoinGecko. Almost all cryptocurrencies ranked in the top 10 assets by market capitalization have rallied in that period.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains have likely catalyzed rallies in Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, among other assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $65,260, and Ethereum, Solana, and XRP extend recent gains.\n\nAdditionally, Spot Ethereum ETF approval is anticipated this week, and this is likely the other key market mover for the assets.\n\nEthereum, Solana, and XRP rally amidst ETF hype, Donald Trump rally incident\n\nETF experts and analysts believe that a Spot Ethereum ETF approval is likely this week. As anticipation brews, Ether holders and traders expect gains, and the sentiment is positive, as seen on cryptoeq.io.\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, believes that the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely approve the ETF by Thursday, July 18.\n\nWe don't have a new over/under launch date yet because we haven't heard what the SEC's game plan is. Hope to hear soon. But if you forced me gun to head style to give my best guess for date I'd go with July 18th. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\nCrypto traders are likely digesting the news of the events that unfolded at former US President and candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rally on Saturday, as the shooting was followed by a rally in crypto prices. Analysts at on-chain data tracker Santiment attributed this to traders anticipating Trump\u2019s win in the November 2024 Presidential elections and his pro-crypto stance.\n\nFormer US President Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech at a Bitcoin Conference later this month, on July 27. The Presidential candidate is expected to deliver his speech in Tennessee, in person, despite injuries sustained at the shooting.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum, Solana and XRP extended gains by 3.2%, 4.1% and 12% respectively, per CoinGecko data. The three assets have positive returns for the last seven days period.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and XRP extend gains\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,488, hitting a new two-week high at $3,517 previously on the day, while XRP touched a three-month high at $0.6188."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nTL; DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) surges above $3,400 as market sentiment improves\n\nSolana (SOL) retreats to $155 despite analysts predicting a move to $200.\n\nClandeno (CLD) is tipped to outperform the market with 40X gains after listing.\n\nEnthusiasm has returned to the crypto market after the failed assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump. This caused major cryptocurrencies to hit key price levels. Ethereum (ETH) surpassed $3,400 while Solana (SOL) marched towards the $160 mark.\n\nThis market excitement has spilled to Clandeno (CLD), a new blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Analysts laud Clandeno (CLD) as the best new cryptocurrency to buy during its live ICO. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) investors are partially booking profits to buy CLD tokens in anticipation of the predicted 40X surge.\n\nWill Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Clandeno (CLD) turn out to be the best altcoins to invest in? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Smashes $3,400\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $410 billion, was one of the biggest gainers in the past few days. Trading at $3,395 at press time, Ethereum (ETH) is up 10% in the past week. Ethereum (ETH) is taking a breather after reaching a high of $3,490 on July 16.\n\nInvestors are optimistic that Ethereum (ETH) could soon reach $4,000 as ETH spot ETFs are rumored to start trading on July 23. This will be a major win for Ethereum (ETH) and new cryptocurrencies such as Clandeno (CLD). Clandeno (CLD) is tipped for massive growth, while Ethereum (ETH) can only register modest gains for its holders.\n\nSolana (SOL) Corrects After Reaching $160\n\nSolana (SOL) jumped from $134.17 on July 12 to $160 on July 16. This marked a 19.2% jump. However, Solana (SOL) has surrendered its gains, retreating to $155.17 at press time. Analysts have come in full force, predicting that Solana (SOL) is headed to the $200 price level.\n\nSolana (SOL) is one of the best-performing assets over the last year, surging 454%. Expert analysts claim that Solana (SOL) has limited growth potential. Bullish analysts are predicting a move to $80,000 for Bitcoin. New cryptocurrencies such as Clandeno (CLD) will see huge gains when leading cryptos surge.\n\nAs Solana (SOL) corrects, investors are leaning towards Clandeno\u2019s (CLD) live ICO.\n\nClandeno (CLD) is Set for 40X Growth\n\nClandeno (CLD) is set to transform the e-commerce industry by offering launching an innovative blockchain-based online marketplace. The new e-commerce platform will focus on addressing several challenges affecting the industry. Clandeno (CLD) will have unmatched transaction efficiency, improved security and decentralized governance.\n\nApart from its user-centric approach, Clandeno (CLD) is focused on delivering a great investor experience. This starts with launching CLD, a native token with several utilities within the Clandeno (CLD) ecosystem. With a total supply of only 525 million CLD tokens, investors are guaranteed price appreciation. The Clandeno (CLD) team will lock the liquidity pool for 20 years and team tokens for 2.5 years.\n\nInvestors are flocking to buy CLD tokens during the initial coin offering because Clandeno (CLD) is poised for 40X growth. Clandeno (CLD) has a practical utility and a growing community of investors to see an exponential price surge during the crypto bull run.\n\n\n\nTo find out more about the Clandeno presale, visit their website here.\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "content": "Institutional crypto market data provider Kaiko has projected Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) after the launch of spot ETFs in the United States. The market anticipates the launch of spot Ethereum products with bulls projecting new market highs amid institutional inflows recorded pre-launch. ETH is down from the approvals of 19b-4 for several issues by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Growth to Surpass Bitcoin\n\nA recent report from Kaiko opines that Ethereum ETFs may push the assets above Bitcoin. The firm cited the Ether-Bitcoin price ratio amid recent fluctuations due to macro and industry factors. The price ratio of the asset relative to Bitcoin stands at 0.05 from 0.045 after the approval of 19b-4 by the SEC. A ratio shows the value of Ethereum is getting bigger than the market leader.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ETH to BTC, which measures the relative performance of the two assets, remains elevated around 0.05. This is significantly higher than pre-approval levels of nearly 0.045. A stronger ratio suggests ETH could continue to outperform relative to BTC following ETF launches.\u201d\n\nIn the last two months, ETH price has plummeted 20% initial frenzy with the SEC approval. While a pullback is linked to macro factors, spot Ethereum ETFs are poised to draw in institutional flows to the market. Traditional investors have become attracted to the altcoin leader because of its smart contract functionality and the number of decentralized applications (DApps) in the ecosystem. Last year. Wealth managers picked the asset with the most growth trajectory.\n\nETH Price Hits $3500 Ahead Spot ETF Debut\n\nThis year, spot crypto ETFs have dominated market spaces with billions pouring in from investors. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11 opened the gates for renewed market optimism on the heels of a new window for institutional investments. The successes of Bitcoin products drew investors to Ethereum as crypto prices jumped to new highs. The trading of ETH products expected this summer and related optimism led to issuers filing for Solana ETFs.\n\nETH price jumped over 2% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $3,415. The 24-hour low and high are $3,330 and $3,498, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 50% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase v SEC: Coinbase Refines Subpoena For SEC Chair Gensler\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "3 Altcoins To Sell Should Ethereum Tag $5,000 Post ETF Approval - CoinGape",
        "content": "Three Ethereum ETF operators received preliminary approvals earlier in the week as Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted trading to start next week. The news coincided with a general bullish wave in the cryptocurrency market as Bitcoin jumped above $65,000. As the market recovers following last week\u2019s sell-off, investors may want to pay attention to altcoins to sell if Ethereum rallies to $5,000 after spot ETFs begin trading.\n\n1. Altcoins To Sell \u2013 XRP (XRP)\n\nXRP is the native coin for the XRP Ledger, a blockchain designed to help financial institutions streamline cross-border payments using a fast and cost-effective network. Ripple Labs is the company behind XRP and XRPL. It has onboarded multiple banking institutions so far and continues its crusade to onboard more.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe price of XRP is trading around $0.5457, a 25.7% increase in the last 7 days. XRP price is displaying signs of a breakout that the entire crypto market has long awaited. Since the onset of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit in December 2020, the asset\u2019s price has been suppressed below the $1 cent level.\n\nThe Ripple network saw a surge in adoption following news that the CME Group would launch new daily price reference rates and real-time indices for XRP and ICP beginning July 29, 2024.\n\nConsequently, whales rush to buy the crypto asset, with one big player buying 38 million XRP ($20 million).\n\nThis comes as the Ripple-SEC lawsuit shows signs of ending. Following the recent settlement between Terraform Labs (TFL) and the SEC, Ripple appealed to the court to have its penalty reduced. Subsequently, the penalty was reduced to less than $120 million. Along the same lines, the SEC dropped its investigation into Ethereum, after which 19-4b ETFs were approved. The exact process could unfold for Ripple and XRP.\n\n2. MAGA (TRUMP)\n\nMAGA is among the many Trump altcoins that mushroomed when the former American president announced his bid to vie for the November 2024 elections. The crypto project also markets itself as a charity, donating proceeds of the 1% on-chain tax on buys, sells, and transfers to veterans and Child trafficking prevention services in the United States. As of July 15, MAGA has donated $1.7 million to these causes.\n\nTRUMP is the native token of the MAGA community, and its price jumped nearly 50% from $6.34 to $$8.03 over the weekend after an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The price of TRUMP had been rising gradually in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, in which the former president was slated to deliver a 30-minute speech. Following the attempt on his life, Trump has affirmed that he will still show up to the conference.\n\nAnalysis by Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence discovered that Gigantic Rebirth\u2019s (GCR) address, tagged \u201cGCR Address 1,\u201d still holds over 936,000 TRUMP tokens and has a profit of over $6.5 million.\n\nAnother address tagged \"GCR: Address 1\" still holds 936,279 $TRUMP($7.23M) and has not sold it, with a profit of more than $6.5M!https://t.co/qGFbpGAuJW pic.twitter.com/16LpqJX61e \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2024\n\nThis indicates that whales are still holding this altcoin. After winning the debate and escaping assassination, his odds of winning the elections may have just gone up, and with them, the price of TRUMP.\n\n3. Altcoins To Sell \u2013 Chainlink (LINK)\n\nChainlink is the glue that holds the majority of DeFi protocols together. Developed by Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink is a universal platform for blockchain builders and decentralized financial institutions. The main product of the Chainlink oracle network is the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which allows the secure and reliable transmission of data and its value between different blockchain networks. As an oracle network, Chainlink\u2019s services enable smart contracts to communicate securely with real-world data and services outside the blockchain network. This may impact real-world assets (RWA), DeFi, AI, and even DePIN sectors.\n\nLookonchain just spotted a whale who has secretly accumulated 12.75 million LINK ($167 million) across 93 different wallets in less than one month. Such a massive investment is a bullish signal for the crypto asset.\n\nIt seems that a mysterious whale/institution is accumulating $LINK! We noticed 93 fresh wallets withdrawing 12.75M $LINK($167M) from #Binance since June 24!https://t.co/SkqA1r0F1N pic.twitter.com/AJR4fT36VG \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 14, 2024\n\nChainlink price is up 2.5% in the last 24 hours to trade at $14.10. Chainlink price prediction shows strong support around $12.8, which may hold up the price if market conditions turn bearish. However, before that happens LINK is one of the altcoins to sell as you wait for the perfect entry position.\n\nLINK\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) just crossed above the mid-point, confirming a bullish uptrend and increasing buy momentum. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator also spotted a bullish cross-over, confirming a LINK bullish reversal.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price potentially hitting $5,000 post-ETF approval might seem like an exciting opportunity, it may also signify a good moment to reassess your altcoin holdings. As Ethereum gains momentum, some altcoins might struggle to maintain their value or relevance. XRP, LINK, and MAGA represent some altcoins to sell, allowing you to consolidate gains and potentially reinvest in more promising or stable assets.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who are crypto whales? In cryptocurrency, \"whales\" refer to individuals or entities that hold a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. These holders can significantly influence the market due to the sheer volume of their holdings. 2. What are altcoins? Altcoins, short for \"alternative coins,\" refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin including Ethereum. 3. Is Ethereum a good buy? Yes, Ethereum is a good buy. Analysts predict the Ethereum price will surpass its all time high when ETH ETFs launch.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

This is provided with no unforeseeable last-minute issues of course!\u201d Eric tweeted.\n\nNairametrics earlier reported that Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted that the Ethereum ETFs could attract up to $15 billion in net inflows in the first 18 months of trading pulling a similar feat to what Bitcoin ETFs launched in January achieved.\n\nMatt Hougan also expects the S-1 fillings of the issuers to be approved next week on Monday after trading hours. This will prepare it for the launch of trading the next day which is July 23.\n\nIf the S-1 fillings by the issuers are approved the spot Ether ETFs by the issuers are expected to be listed on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is the second crypto asset to have an exchange-traded fund in the United States after Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January.\n\nThere has been speculation about a potential Solana ETF this year after Ethereum ETFs have launched.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nAn S-1 filing is a registration statement that a company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it wants to go public and issue shares on a stock exchange. The form is also known as the \u201cregistration form\u201d because it registers the company with the SEC.\n\nThe United States SEC has completed the first phase of the Ethereum ETF approval which is the approval of the 19b-4 files by the SEC in May."

Comparing the two blockchains, Solana started the year with fewer tokens but has since overtaken Ethereum since its ecosystem has seen 65% more token listings in the first half of the year.\n\nWill Solana outperform Ethereum?\n\n\n\nHere are 3 charts from the recent CMC H1 report that show how it is already doing so \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Nic (@nicrypto) July 15, 2024\n\nThis leads to more users and more active addresses on Solana, which has the most daily active addresses of any Layer-1 blockchain. Ethereum, in comparison, ranks fourth.\n\nSolana is \u201cthe home of NFTs\u201d and leads in unique wallets, buyers and transactions, while Bitcoin and Ethereum lead in terms of volume.\n\nNic points to the meme coin madness driving Solana usage and awareness. \"The higher the returns, the more users they draw. It\u2019s a degen cycle and Solana is top here,\" Nic concludes and thinks, \"Solana is no longer in Ethereum\u2019s shadow.\"\n\nAlso Read: Solana Up 7% And Could Get To 50% Of Ethereum\u2019s Valuation As \u2018Most Liquid Election Proxy In Crypto,\u2019 Trader Says\n\nWhy It Matters: Crypto chart analyst Ali Martinez sees bullish short-term price action coming for SOL:\n\n#Solana appears to be forming a W pattern, which suggests $SOL will surge toward $174! pic.twitter.com/OxXODWi1yA \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2024\n\nA \u2018W chart pattern' is formed when an asset\u2019s price drops and then rises again before dropping once more and rising for a second time. A double bottom with a W shape signals bullish price momentum.\n\nAnother crypto trader recently confirmed a breakout for Solana, with yet another trader seeing Solana making a new all-time high later followed by a rally in ecosystem-related tokens.\n\nPrice Action: In the past 24 hours, SOL is up 3%, taking its weekly gains to 10.7%.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,400 resistance zone. ETH again tested $3,500 and seems to be struggling to continue higher.\n\nEthereum is holding gains and struggling near the $3,500 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,500 and $3,550 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Key Hurdle, Can It Continue Higher?\n\nEthereum price remained in a bullish zone above the $3,350 resistance zone. ETH even climbed above the $3,400 resistance to move further into a positive zone. However, the price seems to be facing strong resistance near the $3,500 zone, unlike Bitcoin which surpassed $65,000.\n\nA high was formed at $3,515 and the price is now consolidating gains. The price corrected a few points and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,350 swing low to the $3,515 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $3,500 level.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,520 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,550 level. A close above the $3,550 level might send Ether toward the $3,650 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,740. An upside break above the $3,740 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,800 resistance zone in the coming days.\n\nAre Dips Supported In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near $3,420 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,350 swing low to the $3,515 high.\n\nThe first major support sits near the $3,350 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,350 support might push the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,220.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,350\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,500"
