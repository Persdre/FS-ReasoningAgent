        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s fix for its gas fee problem is now live: What you need to know about the Dencun upgrade - Fortune",
        "content": "On Wednesday morning, the Ethereum blockchain completed an upgrade called Dencun, the biggest change to the network\u2019s code in over a year. The upgrade is an important step to help the world\u2019s second-most valuable blockchain overcome its scaling challenges, and reduce its infamous gas fees. But what exactly is Dencun and how does it work? Our plain-English explainer tells all you need to know.\n\nWhat is the Dencun upgrade?\n\nDencun describes two upgrades that took place at the same time on Ethereum. The name combines the \u201cCancun\u201d upgrade of the execution layer and the \u201cDeneb\u201d upgrade on the consensus layer. The latter refers to how network users agree on the state of the blockchain, while the former refers to how transactions are processed.\n\nIn technical terms, the upgrade is the result of a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d or EIP-4844, which improves the blockchain\u2019s propensity to handle data from secondary networks.\n\nGathering of the five families in London for the Dencun upgrade pic.twitter.com/4cyxFSQoVh \u2014 David Mihal.eth (@dmihal) March 13, 2024\n\nWhy did Dencun come about in the first place?\n\nThe upgrade will lower gas fees for the growing number of networks built on top of Ethereum that are known as Layer 2 (L2), or \u201croll-ups.\u201d This is important since gas fees have historically soared whenever there is a surge of activity on the blockchain, making it unviable to use at a large scale. Roll-ups help address this by processing transactions separately, and then stamping them to the main Ethereum blockchain in batches.\n\nWhile roll-ups have already made Ethereum more efficient, one issue that is that, post-compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to L2 data infinitely, requiring a greater volume of hardware as time goes on. This has meant that over 90% of the fees on roll-ups are used for this data storage.\n\nThe upgrade means L2 data will be added to the base Ethereum network via fleeting, more efficient \u201cblobs\u201d rather than data held indefinitely. Instead, \u201cblob data\u201d will be stored for 18 days.\n\nWhat about the main Ethereum network?\n\nThe overall effect should be lower costs, but users on the main blockchain (L1) won\u2019t enjoy these lower fees until at least 2026\u20132027, says Pitchbook\u2019s crypto analyst Robert Le, until there is \u201cfull danksharding,\u201d referring to a roll-up scaling method which provides extra storage for increased transactional capacity.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, you\u2019ll see less and less individual users, whether retail or businesses, transact directly on Ethereum. More will move to L2s and the only ones transacting on Ethereum will be the rollups,\u201d he said.\n\nEIP-4844 marks the beginning of the \u201cSurge\u201d phase for Ethereum, outlined by the network\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin in December. The aim of this phase is to reach 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nHow much will Dencun lower fees?\n\nGas fees had risen to an average of 98 gwei (a denomination worth one-billionth of an Ether, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain) the week before the upgrade, a level not seen since early May 2023, according to Ethercan data. A swap would cost users $87.45 in gas fees on average, while non-fungible token (NFT) sales average $147 in gas.\n\nAfter the Ethereum Dencun upgrade this week, EIP-4844 will reduce L2 gas fees. According to IntoTheBlock statistics, for a DEX swap, the gas fee for Aribitrum will be reduced from $2.02 to $0.4, Optimism will be reduced from $1.42 to $0.28, Base will be reduced from $0.58 to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/0x6jGDYF5z \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2024\n\nL2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. Swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges, which currently costs $1\u2013$2, should fall to around 10\u201320 cents, and could even go as low as a fraction of a cent.\n\nWhat does Dencun mean for the price of Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) has climbed over 150% since October. Last week it broke $4,000, for the second time ever, where it has hovered since, indicating it could soon pass its all-time high of $4,878.26, reached in November 2021.\n\nThe price surge is part of a broader bull crypto bull market spurred by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, and optimism that regulators will approve Ethereum ETFs, too, this year. But experts told Fortune they foresee the upgrade having a continued, positive impact on ETH\u2019s price that could be more significant than ETFs, as investors bet on the network\u2019s development potential.\n\nIt will be an \u201cabsolute game changer\u201d for the token, and is the \u201cbigger story right now,\u201d Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s CIO, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cThere are a billion applications you can build if transactions are below a penny that you can\u2019t build if they range from 10 to 50 cents,\u201d said Hougan. \u201cOnce we get them reliably free to people, you will see financial applications, DeFi and NFTs, but you will also see nonfinancial applications. I think we\u2019re gonna see this massive explosion of mainstream uses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a new type of technology, a new type of platform. I think that\u2019s what ETH has going for it on the sentiment side, and why it\u2019s doing so well,\u201d Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, added."

        "title": "Ethereum Completes Milestone Dencun Upgrade, Which Should Substantially Reduce Fees - Unchained",
        "content": "Layer 2 blockchain networks can now use a different way to store data, which is intended to help these rollups scale the Ethereum blockchain network that was plagued by huge spikes in gas fees in years prior.\n\nEthereum has completed a significant upgrade of its blockchain network, which is expected to pave the way for the next generation of crypto users to transact onchain without suffering significant spikes in gas fees.\n\nThe upgrade, named \u201cDencun,\u201d was completed early morning Wednesday ET after it was activated on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at epoch height of 269568, according to Ethereum developers in a live stream on YouTube. At one point, more than 3,600 people were watching the official rollout of Dencun on the livestream.\n\n\u201cWe basically enter this new era of Ethereum scalability,\u201d said Anthony Sassano, the creator of Ethereum-focused media site The Daily Gwei, referring to how Dencun implements EIP-4844 and \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which creates a highly optimized and much cheaper storage space where rollups can post data to called \u201cblobspace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first step on a long journey that has been going on for a few years now towards what we [Ethereum contributors] call full danksharding, which will greatly increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability properties specifically for layer 2s,\u201d Sassano added.\n\nRead more: How Much Will the Dencun Upgrade Really Reduce Ethereum Layer 2 Fees By?\n\nDencun is Ethereum\u2019s most substantial software change since Shapella, which occurred about 10 months ago. Before the hard fork upgrade, rollups had to store information such as transaction history in calldata, which is \u201creally expensive, because Ethereum calldata has to be stored forever,\u201d said Polygon\u2019s vice president of product, David Silverman, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nAfter the upgrade, when rollups post data to this new blobspace in the form of \u201cblobs,\u201d the information isn\u2019t stored forever and so it\u2019s much cheaper, while still providing similar security guarantees. Consequently, \u201crollups can generally pass those cost [savings] on along to their users,\u201d lowering transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks, Silverman added.\n\nThis impact could occur immediately or more gradually over time. The various L2s will go through their respective governance processes to change the target of where they\u2019re posting data from either calldata to blobspace or possibly a mix of the two. This means some networks may see changes immediately on day one, while others may take as long as a month-and-a-half, depending on when their governance votes are held and how easy it is for a rollup to integrate the upgrade, noted Silverman.\n\nFor example, the team for the layer 2 blockchain network Base, which was incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, said in a blog post that Base will have support for the Dencun upgrade on the first day.\n\nAnother Ethereum rollup, zkSync, is already ready to submit blob transactions, per Daniel Lumi, senior product manager at Matter Labs, the software firm building zkSync, adding that zkSync has a solution for where the protocol decides to post data.\n\nGetting Lucky\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comes as the price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, is trading around $4,000, a level not seen since the end of 2021 before Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers don\u2019t implement upgrades based on market pressure, the Dencun upgrade implementation coinciding with the start of an early bull market and ETH trading around the $4,000 level is \u201clucky,\u201d Silverman noted.\n\nThe DeFi Summer in 2020 ended in part because Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure was not ready to accommodate the mass of new users coming onchain, which became evident when gas prices to execute a token swap on a decentralized exchange soared to hundreds of dollars.\n\nAs a result of Dencun and specifically EIP-4844, which will bring transaction costs down, \u201cwe now have a ton more capacity from all these rollups to handle this next generation of users without gas prices spiking up to $200 [or] $300 per swap, killing our momentum,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cWe got lucky in the sense that we got this [the Dencun upgrade] out of the way before retail is coming back.\u201d"

Dencun ships a total of 9 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in all, making it tied for the largest single hard fork in terms of improvements shipped, according to Tim Beiko, who coordinates the Ethereum core developer calls, on the Ethereum Foundation livestream commemorating the event.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024\n\nPost-Dencun, most rollups and their users will see benefits within hours to days, as the availability of data blobs on Ethereum \u2014 introduced by EIP-4844 \u2014 should slash transaction fees by 5-10x.\n\nThis real-world benefit to users is primarily driving anticipation for the upgrade, according to Hannes Graah, a builder of crypto wallet Zeal.\n\n\u201cThe Dencun upgrade brings us closer to a future where fees are an afterthought, not a dealbreaker,\u201d Graah told Blockworks. \u201cJust as we generally don\u2019t worry about the cost of traditional domestic bank transfers, Web3 users should be able to transact without worrying about fees.\u201d\n\nAki Balogh, co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link, likens EIP-4844 to the \u201cNoSQL movement of the 2010s,\u201d which removed constraints of structured SQL data, through developments like MongoDB.\n\n\u201cGiving developers large blobs of temporary data (deleted after 30 days) provides them the opportunity to innovate while not increasing load on the network,\u201d Balogh told Blockworks, removing a major Ethereum bottleneck. \u201cSimilar to Mongo\u2019s effect, this proposal will help innovation as dApps and chains find new ways to use the temp storage space,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to scaling in Web2, this new data storage channel for Ethereum doesn\u2019t sacrifice decentralization, notes Philippe Schommers, head of infrastructure at Gnosis, which implemented Dencun already on Monday.\n\nRead more: Gnosis Chain premieres Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork\n\n\u201cWhen working towards scalability solutions on the blockchain, there are choices that developers have to make to prioritize decentralization,\u201d Schommers told Blockworks. \u201cWhen you look at Web2 infrastructure, it\u2019s easy to see how centralized scalability can be done, but that\u2019s not the path we\u2019re trying to follow.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cless glamorous\u201d Schommers said, it was part of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cbig ambition,\u201d calling Dencun \u201cone piece of the puzzle that gets us a little bit closer to building a larger scale, fully decentralized network.\u201d\n\nOthers are more effusive.\n\nLucas Henning, chief technology officer of Suku, says it\u2019s still early days and the upgrade \u201cwill guide the Ethereum ecosystem towards a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for Ethereum, and I am keen to see the effects of these changes on the decentralized world landscape,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, president of StarkWare. \u201cToday will go down as the date of birth for a dapp-for-everything culture.\u201d\n\nUpdated March 13, 2024 at 11:30 am ET, clarifying Dencun is equal to one earlier fork for the most number of EIPs included.\n\nCorrection March 13, 2024 at 1:40 pm ET: Misattribution of one quote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What You Need To Know Ahead of Ethereum's Dencun Update Wednesday - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Ethereum's next major network update, known as \"Dencun,\" is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nDencun is expected to lower transaction fees on the many Layer 2 networks built on top of the base Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis update is part of a major push by Ethereum developers to head toward mass scalability via Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nReports from digital asset managers Grayscale and Fidelity Digital Assets indicate the update could be a boon for scaling the overall Ethereum userbase.\n\nEthereum is scheduled to undergo a network update called the Deneb-Cancun, or Dencun, on Wednesday, aimed at improving user experience and lowering transaction fees for some users on the the network's Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nEther (ETH), the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, soared past $4,000 early Wednesday, but gave up some of those gains to trade a shade under that threshold at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat is the Dencun Ethereum Update?\n\nThe Dencun update prioritizes scalability, efficiency, and security through the implementation of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the most notable change is EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding, which seeks to optimize gas fees for Layer 2 network (L2) data and enhance the network's ability to handle greater transaction volumes via those secondary layers.\n\nExchanges may face delays in processing Ethereum transactions on Wednesday as the update rolls out. Coinbase (COIN) said Monday that it expects disruption due to the update to last for at least an hour on or around 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, although that could change. Kraken, meanwhile, is budgeting for about 15 mins of delay for maintenance around 4:00 a.m. Eastern time and recommends users \"not to place or cancel orders during this timeframe.\"\n\nBlobs, Rollups, Gas: What Is Changing?\n\nLayer 2 networks, such as rollups, are secondary blockchains built on top of the base Ethereum network. In a bid to scale transaction volumes, rollups compress transactions by bundling them. The initial verification for those transactions happens off the chain, but the transactions are settled on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHowever, even with the compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to Layer 2 data forever, expanding their hardware requirements, which are then passed on to users via higher transaction or gas fees. More than 90% of the fees paid by users on rollups are because of this data storage.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will alter that, allowing information related to Layer 2 networks to be added to the base Ethereum blockchain via temporary, more efficiently stored \"blobs\" rather than as permanent data. As of this writing, blob data will be available for 18 days. This is intended to lower costs.\n\n\"Each byte of data that L2s store on Ethereum costs roughly 16 gas. The introduction of blobs and a new fee market designed for blob data drops the gas cost down to 1 per byte of data stored,\" noted Fidelity Digital Assets in a report about the upgrade. \"This is a maximum gas cost reduction of 94%!\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum users on the main blockchain or Layer 1 users won't stand to benefit much from the lower fees found on Layer 2 networks after the upgrade.\n\nMore Accessible and Competitive Ethereum?\n\n\"Currently, Ethereum\u2019s performance is hindered by its slow transaction speed, low throughput, and high costs for users. With average transaction fees of $2.3 as of February 22nd, Ethereum is significantly more expensive versus alternatives like Solana. This threatens to drive away end users to other chains,\" said crypto asset manager Grayscale in a report.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade \"could help Ethereum compete in terms of scalability with faster chains,\" the Grayscale report said.\n\nFidelity also points out that in addition to differentiating it from competitors, the latest changes to the Ethereum network could help transition from being a general-purpose blockchain to a global database for Layer 2 networks. The best way to gauge the success of the Dencun upgrade will be to track the number of Layer 2 users via a metric such as active addresses,\" Fidelity said.\n\n\n\n(Update\u2014March 13, 2024: This story has been updated with more recent ETH price information.)"

        "title": "Blockchain startup Sei Labs creates an interesting solution to make Ethereum faster - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Sei Labs, a startup co-founded by a former Robinhood engineer and a former VC from Coatue, has launched a new open sourced project that offers a novel and exciting approach to make Ethereum faster and less expensive for developers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sei launched The Parallel Stack, a public good project \u2014 meaning free for any crypto developers to use. It aims to improve the performance of transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based layer-2 blockchains through the tried-and-true computer science concept of parallel processing, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\n\nSei Labs is a company the crypto community is already watching after it raised $30 million, at a valuation of $800 million, about a year ago to build its own super-speedy, open source, layer-1 blockchain focused specifically on crypto trading.\n\nBut now Sei has turned its attention to help improve Ethereum, a far bigger, more established blockchain, the biggest by total value locked, according to CoinMarketCap \u2014 aka the value of all the digital assets on the network.\n\nBy default, EVMs process transactions sequentially, one after another, a slow and inefficient method that doesn\u2019t scale well.\n\n\u201cThe biggest limitation of the EVM is the lack of throughput,\u201d Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, formerly of Robinhood, told TechCrunch. Ethereum\u2019s throughput can\u2019t go beyond 50 TPS, which is limiting growth of its ecosystem and results in high so-called gas fees, the fees charged to transact on Ethereum blockchains. These fees make Ethereum unaffordable for \u201c99.9% of normal users,\u201d Jog added.\n\nAside from The Parallel Stack, Sei Labs has also been working on upgrading its blockchain to Sei V2, a parallelized EVM, which processes multiple transactions simultaneously and would make it accessible to a \u201cglobal base of EVM developers,\u201d according to a November 2023 blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on scaling EVM for a long time and doing it by parallelizing,\u201d Jog said.\n\nObviously, the higher the transactions per second, the faster, more efficient and scalable a network is. For reference, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, by default, averages 5 TPS, while Ethereum\u2019s average 20-30 TPS. Solana\u2019s is around 2,500 TPS and some of the newer, Ethereum-centric layer-2 blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum can do 65,000 and 40,000 TPS, respectively.\n\nThe Parallel Stack can do around 5,000 TPS, but is aiming to hit 10,000 TPS by the end of the year, Jog said.\n\nSei, of course, isn\u2019t the only one working to make Ethereum faster and cheaper. Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, an \u201cEVM equivalent\u201d layer-2 blockchain, does an average of 2,000 TPS. But they use different design philosophies and Sei\u2019s focus is on higher throughput through parallel processing, said Jeff Feng, Sei Labs co-founder, previously an investor at Coatue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a stove; you can cook two things at the same time, as opposed to one dish then another,\u201d Feng said. \u201cHistorically if you wanted that kind of TPS, you needed to build on Solana and learn a brand new development framework.\u201d\n\nBut if Sei is building its own layer-1 blockchain, not derived from Ethereum, why would it be working to solve Ethereum\u2019s problem? Because Ethereum is where most developers are and scaling is a problem they think they can also address. And if Sei can offer them a way to adopt parallel processing to improve their Ethereum work, they could also learn core tenets of Sei\u2019s ecosystem along the way.\n\nPlus, they don\u2019t see the two blockchains as competitors. \u201cOur goal is to scale the EVM. There has been significant interest to have parallel EVMs and this is a natural next step: democratizing access to make it as plug and play as possible,\u201d Jog said.\n\nSo perhaps it makes sense that Sei is honing in on the EVM space, to reach a majority of the blockchain developers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost been a no-brainer but it clearly unlocks a level of performance and throughput that allows for applications much larger to successfully build and stay on Ethereum,\u201d Feng said. \u201cWith parallelization, it will bring the industry forward.\u201d\n\nBut why would they freely share their work as open source projects? Sei\u2019s framework isn\u2019t the first to do it, but holds true to the ethos many crypto projects have of providing open code for anyone to build with.\n\n\u201cI was at Robinhood when the GameStop saga happened; a small number of people were making decisions and we didn\u2019t know anything until the news came out,\u201d Jog said. The lack of internal transparency made him want to build a decentralized chain that is open sourced, so anyone can access it and it\u2019s not limited to a group of people.\n\nJog and Feng anticipate initial excitement for The Parallel Stack to come from existing Ethereum-focused applications that are hitting bandwidth issues and are looking for higher TPS options."

        "content": "Some Ethereum layer 2 networks have seen their median transaction fees decline by as much as 99% after the Dencun upgrade went live. These are some of the biggest winners.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade\n\nThe much anticipated Dencun upgrade has led to a significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum layer 2 networks, with the effects of the immediate scalability already taking shape across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live early on Wednesday after it activated on the Ethereum mainnet at epoch height 269568. The upgrade introduced the highly anticipated proto-danksharding functionality via EIP-4844, which integrates off-chain \u201cdata-blobs\u201d that decrease the costs associated with storing transaction data.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks, which are designed to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing transactions on the underlying blockchain, were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade. Data from a Dune dashboard created by \u201c@Marcov\u201d shows that popular layer 2 networks such as Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Zora and zksync have seen massive declines in their average transaction fees.\n\nAt the time of writing, median transaction fees had dropped to $0.05 on Optimism, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. So far, Optimism and chains based on Optimism\u2019s tech stack such as Base, have seen the biggest reductions in fees.\n\nWe love to see it. OP Chains have the most affordable decentralized L2 transaction fees after 4844, bringing us that much closer to the reality of seamless end-user experiences. \u2728In Blobs We Trust\u2728 pic.twitter.com/WOovhcZelk \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 14, 2024\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nStarknet, another Ethereum Layer 2 solution, posted a screenshot of the change in its transaction fees on X showing that a single gas transaction had declined 99% since the Dencun upgrade synchronized.\n\n\u201cDencun is both the most complex fork we\u2019ve shipped since the Merge, and tied for \u2018most total EIPs in a fork\u2019 with Byzantium. There were more teams than ever involved in the process, and it somehow all worked out smoothly,\u201d said the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Tim Beiko on X."

        "title": "Blobs, MSTR and more: This is Ethereum\u2019s broadband moment - Blockworks",
        "content": "The internet turned 35 earlier this week, and it seems only fitting that Ethereum would undergo arguably its largest upgrade ever just one day later.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork went off mostly without a hitch on Wednesday. Its arrival delivered a bevy of nine improvement proposals, with the blob-centric EIP-4844 being by far the most memeable.\n\nFor more than a decade after Tim Bernes-Lee (himself a dabbler in NFTs) first conceived the World Wide Web, internet users languished inside a slow, cumbersome internet plagued by bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\nDial-up modems could only handle up to about 50 kilobytes per second. The platforms we now take for granted \u2014 YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and TikTok \u2014 were as unfeasible back then as high-frequency trading on many layer-1 DEXs are today.\n\nThe arrival of broadband in the early 2000s immediately 10x\u2019d consumer-grade internet to 512 kb/sec. Impossible ideas could now be realized into billion-dollar dot-com powerhouses, radically overhauling the dynamics of our culture and turning us all terminally online.\n\nNow, two decades later, TV is all but dead, replaced by a gamut of streaming services. AR headsets backed by hyper-fast wireless blend our physical worlds with the same digital space that Bernes-Lee laid out in his 1989 paper outlining the web.\n\nWhat broadband did for the internet, blobs are now doing for Ethereum.\n\nBlobs give the raft of layer-2s their own space through which to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet without clogging up the blockspace intended for other users.\n\nThey have their own fee market, which means regular folk and their protocols of choice won\u2019t have to compete with rollups and sidechains for blockspace \u2014 leading to lower fees for all involved.\n\nDencun and its blobs have already massively reduced fees for the layer-2s that have adopted the new rules. For example, Optimism and Base fees are down to a fraction of an American penny per transaction compared to nearly $1 before the fork.\n\nYouTube debuted in 2005, a half-decade after the rollout of the first consumer-grade broadband services. Justin.tv, the precursor to Twitch, came two years later.\n\nIt could be that layer-2 fees rise over time as more layer-2s compete for blobspace. The true impact of Ethereum\u2019s successful push toward a cohesive and holistic multi-chain ecosystem, powered by \u201cblobband,\u201d probably won\u2019t be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the groundwork has now been laid. Welcome to Ethereum\u2019s blobband era.\n\n\u2014 David Canellis\n\nData Digest\n\n\ud83d\ude43 Solana has flipped Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum for total value locked (TVL) to become the fourth largest DeFi ecosystem \u2014 a first since November 2021.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a A quarter of a billion dollars was liquidated on centralized exchanges over the past 24 hours, 60% longs.\n\n\ud83e\udd2a Memecoin mania puts Solana number-one for DEX volume over the past day \u2014 $1.45 billion to BSC\u2019s $1.14 billion\n\n\ud83d\ude34 All quiet on the crypto front as BTC hovers around $73,000 as ETH sits just below $4,000.\n\n\u270bNo budge in the benchmarks: S&P and the Dow were flat during the pre-market trade. That\u2019s no surprise, considering the VIX\u2019s drop to 14 from its long-term average of 20.\n\n\u2705 Good news: A bull market with a high VIX tends to spell \u201cbubble trouble\u201d \u2014 so lower volatility with higher prices may be a boon for traders.\n\nIs the SEC in the crypto market\u2019s rear-view mirror?\n\nThe crypto pump is upon us.\n\nSOL is up 18% this week and almost 50% over the month. Binance\u2019s BNB and Filecoin are each up more than 80% over the past 30 days. Wormhole\u2019s Portal Bridge has facilitated more than $113 million in transfers from Ethereum to alt chains like Solana, Sui, and Arbitrum over the past week.\n\nHas the market forgotten that in the eyes of the SEC, they are all securities? Probably. Or maybe traders are just confident that Coinbase and Binance will emerge victorious in their legal battles with the regulator.\n\nIn June 2023, the SEC filed back-to-back lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities, among other things. The regulator named 13 cryptocurrencies available on Coinbase and ten that trade on Binance securities \u2014 despite none of these issuers being named co-defendants in the cases.\n\nThe SEC has also not filed any individual lawsuits against these alleged security token issuers, opting to take a different approach than it did in 2020 when it sued Ripple over its XRP token \u2014 a suit that ultimately did not play out in the regulator\u2019s favor.\n\nBoth cases are still playing out in the legal system, and you might remember the SEC was notably absent from the Department of Justice\u2019s historic $4.3 billion settlement with Binance back in November.\n\nBut if you look at token prices, you\u2019d think the SEC had dropped the cases.\n\nCoinbase and Binance are both waiting for rulings in their motions to dismiss their respective cases. If the suits are not fully dismissed, the exchanges will move on to the discovery process.\n\n\u2014 Casey Wagner\n\nCan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop?\n\nAfter offering an oversubscribed round where MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised nearly $800 million in senior convertible notes \u2014 mind you, they initially sought to raise $600 million before upsizing to $700 million last week \u2014 the company has proposed another $500 million in convertible notes.\n\nMSTR could, all-in-all, raise around $1.3 billion from its convertible notes offerings to fund its bitcoin purchases.\n\nWhile this represents a new approach to the same tactic we\u2019ve seen from MSTR in the past, Michael Saylor\u2019s firm might have found a way to ensure that the stock remains more attractive than the bevy of bitcoin ETFs on the market today.\n\nBy the numbers: MSTR has about $48 million in cash on hand as of December, but it has roughly $15 billion worth of bitcoin at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to note that while the company may spend that cash on hand, MicroStrategy appears to largely plan to add to its BTC hoard. The stock was around before the bitcoin ETFs, and so far, it looks like it won\u2019t only stick around, but may even outperform.\n\nCompare IBIT and MSTR, for example. MSTR is outperforming BlackRock\u2019s ETF even as the two go head-to-head over who holds the most bitcoin.\n\nMSTR\u2019s bitcoin buying spree has proven to be a win-win for them: Wall Street\u2019s happy and, more importantly, the crypto crowd goes bonkers when the company announces a new buy. And, trust me, the company is always announcing new buys. This year alone, MSTR has bought nearly 16,000 bitcoin.\n\nAdding to that, when bitcoin\u2019s price rockets, so does the company\u2019s stock. The company, at the end of 2023, was trading around $680. Now, the stock is getting close to $2,000 \u2014 up 200% in the last three months alone.\n\nSuffice to say, Saylor and MSTR keep hodling. The company isn\u2019t afraid to hit the buy button \u2014 even if it means raising some debt to do so \u2014 and the most recent debt offerings show that the company\u2019s appetite remains ravenous.\n\n\u2014 Katherine Ross\n\nThe Works\n\nWelcome to The Works \ud83d\udc4b Your daily slice of crypto (and not-so-crypto) from around the Web. \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Bakkt against the wall?

        "title": "Dencun Upgrade: Ethereum's Leap into the Future of L2 Scalability is Here - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with Ethereum, you know its mission \u2013 to be scalable, secure, and decentralized. As Ethereum's popularity has surged, so too have the demands on its network, raising gas fees and highlighting its scalability challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2 solutions, Ethereum's answer to the scalability problem, enabled handling transactions off the main chain without compromising its core principles. Still, gas prices on L2 \u2013 lower, but not yet low enough \u2013 remain a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s widespread adoption. Imagine finding an NFT collection you like, only to discover that the transaction will cost nearly as much as the NFT itself! Even on L2, this scenario is all too common.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, March 13, 2024, this is all going to change!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about the day? Well, the next Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, is scheduled for activation, as announced during Consensus Layer Call 127 and confirmed by Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDencun is poised to be a game-changer for Ethereum's scalability. Encompassing a hard fork involving Deneb (Consensus layer) and Cancun (Execution layer) upgrades, Dencun promises to usher in a new era of affordability for transactions on Ethereum L2s. With the upgrade already live on devnets and testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky, and Mainnet readiness confirmed, we finally stand on the brink of a gigantic leap forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most anticipated changes is the introduction of off-chain data blobs via Proto-Danksharding. Let\u2019s explore what this entails for Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnveiling Blobs and Proto-Danksharding\n\nData blobs are a novel concept designed to optimize L2 transaction data storage on Ethereum. Currently, rollups store their data in transaction calldata . It\u2019s not only limited in size but is also stored forever, creating a problem of always-rising requirements for running a validator.\n\n\n\n\n\nProto-Danksharding , as introduced by EIP-4844 , lays the groundwork for an innovative, dramatically more efficient data handling mechanism, addressing the limitations of current on-chain data storage. With data blobs, specifically designed to handle large amounts of data outside the main Ethereum blockchain, rollups will be able to store data in a more cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new storage solution for rollup transactions will reduce the rate of future Ethereum data growth, contributing to a leaner and more efficient network. For developers, this brings the ability to create more complex and data-intensive smart contracts without being hindered by prohibitive gas costs. For users, it translates into lower fees, making L2-based applications more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. Finally, it also allows Ethereum Validator Node Operators to optimize disk space usage as blobs are pruned after around 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expected Effect of the Dencun Upgrade on the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSeveral key players in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as OP Labs and the zkSync team, have provided quantitative insights into the expected benefits of this upgrade. OP Labs forecasts an extraordinary 20x reduction in gas costs for data storage on Ethereum by Optimism L2. Similarly, the zkSync team anticipates a tenfold decrease in gas costs for data storage, projecting the total gas costs on zkSync to drop from an average of $0.20 per transaction to under $0.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these projections highlight dramatic savings in data storage costs, it's important to keep in mind that the overall gas costs experienced by users involve multiple factors beyond L1 data storage. The Proto-Danksharding upgrade, by reducing the rate of future Ethereum data growth, addresses a crucial aspect of transaction costs. However, the actual effect on user transaction fees will vary, as these fees also depend on computational complexity, network congestion, and other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Dencun: The Road to Full Danksharding\n\nAs you can see, the Dencun upgrade is indeed a crucial milestone for Ethereum. Yet, it is only the first step on a much larger, bolder path towards full Danksharding. This future phase in Ethereum's evolution is set to massively boost the network\u2019s transaction processing capability and efficiency. Imagine a blockchain that can smoothly process more than 100,000 transactions per second. Yes, that's where we're headed!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, Proto-Danksharding sets the groundwork by integrating off-chain data blobs and reducing the cost of L2 data storage on Ethereum. The full Danksharding expands on these principles, aiming to increase the maximum amount of blobs per block from 16 to 64. This transition does not just mean an increase in data storage efficiency but a fundamental re-architecture of how blocks are processed and validated across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move towards full Danksharding will require several significant technical and operational changes:\n\nProposer-Builder Separation : This mechanism separates the roles of proposing blocks and building blocks within the network. Dealing with a large amount of blobs per block would be too tasking for a single builder+proposer, so the duties will be separated. Additionally, this change will reduce the risk of censorship or manipulation by preventing proposers (validators) from being influenced by the contents they're including in a block.\n\n\n\nData Availability Sampling: To ensure data within shards remains available, DAS allows nodes to verify the availability of shard data without needing to download the entire shard. This technique is crucial for maintaining blob data integrity and accessibility efficiently across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the Future of Ethereum!\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a pivotal milestone for Ethereum, marking a major leap forward in its evolution. This upgrade not only promises to elevate the platform's efficiency and L2 transaction affordability but also lays the foundational steps toward the much-anticipated transition to full Danksharding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we transition into this transformative phase, it's imperative for the Ethereum community, including developers, investors, and enthusiasts, to remain informed and actively contribute, thus ensuring a seamless evolution of the ecosystem. Engaging across forums, chats and social media, as well as participating in development projects, enriches our collective journey towards realizing a more efficient, inclusive, and forward-thinking blockchain platform for all."

        "content": "The imminent launch of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade at 14.00 UTC today, March 13, has sparked a notable surge in the prices of native tokens for layer-2 protocols, including Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate\u2019s data, the sector has surged by approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, reaching a total market capitalization of $20.21 billion. This growth maintains a consistent upward trend of 10% observed throughout the week.\n\nLayer-2 tokens increase\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token surged by approximately 10% to reach $2.18. This surge coincides with the team\u2019s planned release of over $1 billion ARB tokens this week.\n\nArbitrum is the leading layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution, with assets worth approximately $16 billion locked on the platform, according to L2Beat.\n\nDuring the same period, Polygon network\u2019s MATIC token witnessed a 4% uptick to $1.23, marking its highest value since March 2023. This upward trend is concurrent with a notable increase in the active addresses on the Polygon PoS chain, which recorded over 1 million daily active addresses for 20 consecutive days.\n\nSimilarly, Optimism\u2019s OP token rose by 2.26% to $4.5, according to CryptoSlate data, a significant milestone considering its starting point at around $3.5 earlier this month.\n\nNotably, the Optimism Foundation disclosed a private sale of 19.5 million OP tokens last week.

        "title": "Deep Dive Into Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade - LCX",
        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade\n\nThe highly anticipated Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is a hard divergence that signifies a substantial turning point in the continuous development of the Ethereum network. By capitalizing on the achievements of prior enhancements, including the recent Shanghai upgrade, Dencun endeavors to implement significant security, usability, and scalability improvements. This section will provide an in-depth analysis of the upgrade, examining the significant improvements and features that Ethereum stakeholders and enthusiasts can anticipate.\n\nCancun: Scalability Improvements- The Cancun enhancement primarily targets the Ethereum network\u2019s execution layer. The document presents a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to optimise gas efficiency and scalability. One noteworthy EIP is EIP-1234, which ensures a seamless transition to Ethereum 2.0 by modifying the block reward and delaying the \u201cdifficulty bomb.\u201d\n\nDeneb: Enhancing Security and Consensus- The Deneb upgrade is specifically designed to improve the security and consensus mechanisms of the Ethereum consensus layer. An essential EIP is EIP-2322, which introduces a more robust and efficient enhancement to the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nEIPs Finalised for Implementation- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade integrates a number of finalised EIPs that are now slated for deployment. These consist of:\n\nEIP 1559: This proposal (EIP-1559) presents a novel fee framework with the dual objectives of enhancing user satisfaction and diminishing transaction charges. The implementation of a dynamically adjusting base fee in response to network demand streamlines the process of fee estimation and mitigates congestion.\n\nEIP-2929: This EIP fortifies the Ethereum network\u2019s security by augmenting the expenses associated with specific operations. As a result, malicious actors will find prospective attacks more costly to execute.\n\nEIP-2537: It presents a novel opcode tailored for Ethereum, which streamlines the verification process of elliptic curve signatures by contracts. This improvement enhances both privacy and scalability.\n\nExpected Benefits- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade provides the Ethereum ecosystem and its users with tremendous potential. The objective of the upgrade is to furnish developers and end-users with a more streamlined and intuitive experience through the resolution of scalability concerns, optimization of gas efficiency, and reinforcement of security measures. Furthermore, it establishes the groundwork for forthcoming developments and facilitates Ethereum\u2019s shift towards a consensus mechanism that is entirely PoS.\n\nImplementation and Timeline- It is anticipated that the Cancun-Deneb Upgrade will take place in the future months, although an exact date has not been specified. By actively working on the deployment and testing procedures, the Ethereum community and developers are minimizing potential network disruptions and ensuring a seamless transition.\n\nTherefore, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade signifies a substantial advancement for the Ethereum blockchain. By prioritizing scalability, security, and usability, this upgrade endeavors to tackle significant obstacles and grant Ethereum and its thriving ecosystem access to fresh prospects.\n\nWhat Is the Concept of Proto-Danksharding?\n\nOne of the notable developments in the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is the implementation of danksharding and proto-danksharding. These technologies are designed to enhance the efficacy and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain. The aforementioned concepts are elaborated upon in the article titled \u201cEverything You Need to Know Regarding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade.\u201d\n\nDanksharding\n\nThe concept of partitioning the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, more manageable segments known as \u201cblobs\u201d is referred to as Danksharding. The objective of the upgrade is to augment the capacity of the Ethereum network and diminish transaction fees through the implementation of danksharding. By enabling parallel processing of transactions and smart contracts, this partitioning method increases throughput and scalability.\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nA feature proposed for the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade, proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) expands upon the notion of danksharding. It augments the functionality of danksharding by generating supplementary storage capacity for data on the Ethereum network. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the processing of substantial volumes of data in a more streamlined manner, thereby augmenting scalability.\n\nThe implications of proto-danksharding implementation for layer-2 rollups are substantial. Expanding the storage capacity for data structures is anticipated to result in a decrease in gas expenses linked to the utilization of layer-2 solutions, thereby providing Ethereum users with a more economical and uninterrupted experience.\n\nBy implementing danksharding and proto-danksharding, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade effectively tackles a significant obstacle that the Ethereum network currently encounters: scalability. These advancements enable the network to process a greater quantity of transactions and smart contracts, thereby promoting the expansion and acceptance of decentralized applications (dApps) constructed on the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn light of the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem, danksharding and proto-danksharding symbolize pivotal measures in the pursuit of Ethereum\u2019s overarching scalability objectives. Through enhanced transaction efficiency and capacity optimization, the upgrade establishes the foundation for a more scalable and sustainable Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade to Focus on \u201cBlobs \u201d\n\n\u201cBlobs\u201d refers to the partitioned sections of the Ethereum blockchain in the context of danksharding and EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding). The objective of danksharding is to partition the Ethereum blockchain into more manageable blobs, wherein each blob is specifically designed to execute transactions and smart contracts. These discrete blocks operate as autonomous segments within the wider Ethereum network. Danksharding establishes parallel processing by dividing the blockchain into blobs, which permits the concurrent execution of numerous transactions and smart contracts.\n\nAs previously stated, proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, expands upon this notion by incorporating supplementary storage capacity for data within individual blobs. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the incorporation of a greater quantity of data, including smart contract code, transaction data, and related metadata. By augmenting the storage capacity, proto-danksharding facilitates the more streamlined management of increased data volumes within individual blobs.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to employing clusters in danksharding and proto-danksharding:\n\nEnhanced Scalability: By partitioning the blockchain into smaller chunks, parallel processing is enabled, which increases the capacity of the Ethereum network to process a greater number of transactions and smart contracts. This enhanced scalability contributes to the reduction of transaction fees and congestion.\n\nEnhanced Resource Allocation: Through the partitioning of the blockchain into autonomous entities, resources including storage capacity and processing power can be allocated in a more streamlined fashion. Blobs can be configured to execute particular smart contracts or process specific categories of transactions, thereby optimising the allocation of network resources.\n\nFlexibility and Modularity: The flexibility and modularity of the Ethereum network are enhanced through the utilisation of containers. This feature facilitates the modification or elimination of blobs in response to the changing requirements of the network, thereby enabling the smoother integration of future scalability enhancements.\n\nIn its entirety, the implementation of blobs in danksharding and proto-danksharding furnishes the Ethereum blockchain with a more streamlined and expandable structure. Danksharding endeavours to facilitate the expansion of storage capacity within individual blobs, thereby augmenting transaction processing velocity, diminishing transaction fees, and bolstering the development of decentralised applications on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Recap"

        "content": "Wed 13 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nBehind the scenes of the cryptosphere, Solana, nicknamed the \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d is making noise. Figures reveal its rise to power, surpassing Ethereum on several fronts: daily activities, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. Vitalik Buterin and his team must step up their efforts to not lose their lead against this emerging rival.\n\nSolana: The New Queen of Blockchain?\n\nBut is the confidence of Solana\u2019s developers justified in their ambition to compete with Ethereum despite their youth? Observers remain skeptical of this fierce battle, where Solana is gaining ground on Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses (notably gas fees), while showing signs of vulnerability with its recurring outages.\n\nThe fight between these two cryptocurrency giants promises to be long and intense according to CoinTurk. Because in the kingdom of cryptocurrencies, Solana is carving out a prime spot for itself. According to the latest data, it outperforms its competitors by becoming the leading blockchain in terms of payment volumes over the past six months. With transactions totaling $1.7 trillion, Solana exceeds Ethereum ($1.1 trillion) and Tron ($869 billion).\n\nThe growth in liquidity on the Solana network is also stimulating the activity of DeFi protocols, making the platform more attractive. A new record for monthly transactions was set, while the number of daily active users now exceeds 800,000, reaching an unprecedented level.\n\nThis increased liquidity not only facilitates decentralized exchanges but also attracts DeFi projects in search of solid performances and abundant liquidity.\n\nSolana\u2019s ability to process a large number of stablecoin transactions promotes its global adoption, thus offering efficient and cost-effective financial services to users and developers.\n\nDespite its rise, Solana, the issuer of the SOL cryptocurrency, still has to catch up with Ethereum in terms of total value locked (TVL) on the network, closely followed by Tron.\n\nIn the realm of NFTs, Solana is also seeing its popularity rise with a significant increase in the total floor value of its collections. While Solana is shaping up to be a major player in the world of cryptocurrencies, the road to total supremacy is still fraught with challenges.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Today, at 13:55 UTC, or more precisely at block 8626176 of the Beacon Chain, the Dencun hard fork upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain was successfully executed.\n\nIts implementation combines two specific upgrades, known as Deneb and Cancun, where the first essentially concerns the consensus layer, while the second refers to the execution layer.\n\nDencun marks a milestone for the world\u2019s most well-known smart contract platform, and introduces improvements that could be remembered for a long time in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nBelow is everything you absolutely need to know.\n\nDencun kicks off: the long-awaited update of the Ethereum blockchain is successfully executed\n\nAfter the Shapella update dated April 2023, which started the unstaking of previously locked ETH within the Beacon Chain, Ethereum now concludes another fundamental chapter of its existence by inaugurating the Dencun hard fork.\n\nThis kind of substantial protocol change comes after the same renewal procedures have been tested on the Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky testnets, sometimes encountering quite a few difficulties.\n\nTechnically, Dencun combines two other updates that occur simultaneously on the consensus and execution levels of Ethereum (Deneb + Cancun).\n\nSeveral projects revolving around the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Optimism, Starknet, Arbitrum, and many others, have celebrated in synergy the ongoing technological revolution.\n\nThe @Ethereum ecosystem is on the brink of a game-changing upgrade with the Dencun release, featuring EIP-4844. \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 8, 2024\n\nIts implementation among the various clients operating on the network is designed to improve scalability, which remains the Achilles\u2019 heel of the infrastructure designed by Vitalik Buterin even after years.\n\nOne of the most significant changes introduced with Dencun is, in fact, the introduction of the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d designed within the \u2018EIP-4844 with the aim of reducing layer-2 fees, anticipating the future revision of \u201csharding\u201d.\n\nThe update completed today, however, adds many other infrastructure improvements, celebrating various Ethereum Improvement Proposals such as EIP-1153, EIP-4788, EIP-5656, EIP-6780, EIP-7044, EIP-7045, EIP-7514, and EIP-7516.\n\nThe work of Ethereum developers, who have been planning for years to shape the protocol by adding innovations that will improve scalability, has finally been completed even though it arrived after some delay in the original schedule that saw Dencun being launched in 2023.\n\nHowever, despite encountering small hiccups along the way, the entire cryptographic community of Ethereum definitively closes the door on a brilliant era in the history of smart contracts and opens a gateway that projects us directly into the future.\n\nMany fans and active members of the ecosystem such as EthStaker and Nethermind validators, took the opportunity to celebrate together the milestone reached, joining in a livestream with their audience.\n\nWARNING: the update of the clients will happen automatically based on the provider you are relying on. Whether you are a LST staker or a simple holder, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nIf, instead, you are only a staker (and have locked 32+ ETH on the Beacon Chain) you absolutely must update both the execution layer and the consensus layer, otherwise risking continuous slashing of the staked ether.\n\nThe advantages brought by Dencun to the world of layer-2: a small step towards danksharding\n\nAs mentioned, the Dencun update brings substantial benefits in terms of Ethereum scalability, introducing the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d within layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon ZkEVM, zkSync, Starknet, and many others.\n\nIn this phase, which anticipates the future implementation of sharding, with which the work of the blockchain will be fragmented, the so-called \u201cblobs\u201d have been introduced\n\nThe BLOBs are data storage spaces (as well as a new type of transaction), that replace the traditional pointers to calldata.\n\nThe blobs can be described as smaller partitions of the Ethereum database that allow to manage specific data segments improving the overall efficiency of the chain.\n\nThis translates into a significant reduction in gas costs incurred by various L2 rollups in the cryptographic ecosystem and greater transaction scalability.\n\nIt is estimated in this regard that in the coming days, when all second-level chains have updated their sequencers, the milestone of 100,000 tp/s on Ethereum will be reached.\n\nRegarding saving on fees, projections indicate a cost reduction of almost 5 times compared to the original price required to carry out an operation.\n\nWe remind you that, unlike what is erroneously described by less experienced people, the cost of transactions on the main layer remains UNCHANGED, while the advantage will be exclusively on layer-2\n\nThe much-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade is set to go live today at 13:55 UTC, bringing blob transactions and transient storage, and reducing costs on Ethereum's layer-2 networks via EIP-4844.\ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/unHY8Pa6KV \u2014 Moby Media (@mobymedia) March 13, 2024\n\nAs we approach the full version of sharding with this kind of compromise improving the experience for the end user in the Ethereum rollup ecosystem, the Dencun update marks another huge advantage.\n\nIndeed, the proto-danksharding will also benefit the class of data availability (DA) protocols such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail, helping networks store large amounts of data at reduced costs.\n\nIn this regard, we emphasize how L2 consistently use DA projects to store their on-chain data. Dencun could make it much cheaper to move large amounts of information, opening the doors to a phase of expansion for this niche.\n\nRegarding the success of the Ethereum hard fork and the milestone achieved in the context of DA, Polygon\u2019s co-founder, Jordi Baylina, stated the following in an interview with Coindesk:\n\n\u201cPrices should go down mainly because it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand. Your supply is higher, the availability of data on Ethereum will be higher, so the price should go down.\u201d\n\nAlthough we still do not know to what extent savings could occur, we can certainly affirm that Ethereum blockchain developers will be much freer to build smoothly, without thinking too much about technical hitches caused by data costs and network fees in rollups.\n\nNow the limit for creating successful protocols on Ethereum is only imagination: the future has arrived, and it looks brighter than ever."

        "content": "The recently launched Dencun upgrade live up to expectations as Ethereum L2 networks, like Optimism and Base, record massive plunge in transaction fees.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Dencun upgrade, Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions on Ethereum have recorded a significant decrease in their average transaction fees.\n\nDencun Upgrade Rolls Out\n\nRecall that the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade went live on the Ethereum mainnet yesterday, March 13, at precisely 13:55 (UTC).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDencun, which represents the most significant upgrade on Ethereum since the \u201cMerge,\u201d introduced a mechanism to reduce transaction costs on L2 networks.\n\nWith Dencun implemented on the Ethereum mainnet, L2 networks found a new way to store data, dubbed Binary Large Objects (blobs).\n\nThe blob feature allows L2 networks to store data off-chain, which becomes inaccessible after three weeks, rather than the expensive \u201ccall data\u201d solution that stores data permanently.\n\nL2 Networks Transaction Fees Drop\n\nSince the Dencun upgrade went live yesterday, it has been living up to expectations as top L2 networks, like Base, Optimism, and zkSync, have seen a sharp drop in their transaction fees.\n\nRecent data from Marcov\u2019s Dune-based tracker highlight the significant drop in transaction fees across major Ethereum-based L2 networks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor instance, the average transaction fee on Optimism, which stood at around $2.44 an hour before Dencun launched, has plunged to $0.068 at press time. Similarly, the average cost of transaction on Coinbase\u2019s Layer-2 Base has also plummeted to $0.196 from $1.212 within the same timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, zkSync\u2019s average fee has dropped to $0.162 from a daily high of $0.546, while Zora network\u2019s transaction cost also fell from $0.752 to $0.003.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the reduced transaction fee trend is dominant across L2 networks that have implemented blobs.\n\nThe average transaction costs on L2 networks that are yet to implement the upgrade have remained the same. For instance, Arbitrum falls within this category, as its average transaction cost has fluctuated between $0.65 to $0.84 over the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the high fee on Arbitrum would soon be a thing of the past, as the team behind the network plans to integrate with Dencun improvements today.\n\nBlobs are finally on Ethereum, here's an update on Arbitrum support! 1\u20e3 Tomorrow, all Arbitrum rollup chains can start to see lower fees as a result of Dencun x ArbOS Atlas upgrade. 2\u20e3 March 18th there will be additional fee reductions for Arbitrum One, as per ArbOS Atlas. \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024"

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction threatens a major tailspin after the successful mainnet launch of the Dencun Upgrade. The second-largest cryptocurrency briefly climbed to $4,087, testing its recent highs ($4,087) on Wednesday before sliding below the previous day\u2019s open of $4,008.\n\nTrading at $3,955 on Wednesday, ETH price has sustained a 2.5% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is down 20% in the same period, hinting at declining interest among traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith a market cap of $477 billion, Ethereum comfortably sits in the second position below Bitcoin\u2019s $1.4 trillion cap.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What\u2019s Next After Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum finalized the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet following three successful testnet launches. The landmark upgrade goes beyond introducing new features, it stands out for reducing fees on layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum \u2014 and is expected to spur growth.\n\nAs reported, \u201cblobs\u201d another key feature of the upgrade, brings to life a new locale to store data on the blockchain. This special space is isolated from standard transactions, attracting lower costs.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, is the biggest protocol improvement in a year, with Ethereum expected to significantly change the scaling landscape where layer 2 protocols will benefit the most.\n\nLayer 2 networks are preparing to incorporate \u201cblobs\u201d in their operations \u2014 a move likely to spark a pricing war. Arbitrum announced on X that it was ready to jump on the new data storage space in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe blobs have arrived on Ethereum! \ud83d\udc21 The Dencun upgrade has successfully launched on Ethereum mainnet making it one of the biggest upgrades to support Layer 2\u2019s in scaling Ethereum. Now with the Ethereum mainnet upgrade complete, we expect the ArbOS Atlas upgrade to be\u2026 \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024\n\nContrary to expectations, the Dencun upgrade was not a significant market mover. If anything, sell-side pressure quickly erased the move to the recent highs around $4,093.\n\nBased on the four-hour chart, Ethereum price has flipped below the important $4,000 level as well as the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nA neutral and downward-slopping Relative Strength Index (RSI) backs the correction as ETH searches for fresh liquidity.\n\nSeveral four-hour candle closes below $4,000 might accelerate the pullback. With the next major support at the 50-day EMA, investors should prepare for instability below $3,900.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on the retracement to maximize returns in the bull market, there is no need to fret as Ethereum price will stay bullish as long as it holds above the Ichimoku cloud levels.\n\nThe black line on the chart backs the uptrend as long as it is respected as support. In that case, a carefully executed dollar-cost average strategy would give traders many opportunities to buy the dip thus eventually contributing to new momentum above $4,000.\n\nA good place to start buying ETH is the short-term support at $3,950. However, if the decline continues below $3,900, the 50-day EMA (the line in red on the chart) might ignite a new bullish fire toward all-time highs.\n\nEthereum might run into considerable congestion in the range between $3,963 and $4,083. About 1.64 million wallets bought ETH at an average cost of $4,027, implying that they may want to sell at their respective breakeven levels, damping the uptrend.\n\nThe IOMAP model developed by IntoTheBlock points to robust support between $3,605 and $3,725. With approximately 835k addresses buying 4.11 million Ether in the range at an average price of $3,679, traders have a rough idea of how far down they can DCA if ETH price continues to fall.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Announces Ethereum's Upcoming Milestones: Verkle Trees and History Expiry Rebeca Moen Ethereum's network takes a major leap in scalability with the completion of the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone, paving the way for verkle trees and history expiry.\n\nThe Ethereum network has reached a critical milestone in its scalability roadmap with the successful implementation of \"Basic rollup scaling,\" according to an post by Vitalik Buterin on Warpcast. This development is a key component in Ethereum's transition to a more scalable and efficient blockchain, which is essential for its long-term success and adoption.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nFollowing this milestone, the Ethereum development community is setting its sights on the integration of verkle trees and history expiry. Verkle trees are an evolution of Merkle trees that will enable more efficient and compact proofs, reducing the amount of data validators need to store. History expiry is a concept that will allow old transaction data to be removed, thereby reducing the \"state bloat\" and making it easier for users to run full nodes.\n\nIntroducing \"Basic Rollup Scaling\"\n\nRollups are solutions that execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and post transaction data back to it. This \"Basic rollup scaling\" is the foundation that allows for increased throughput on the network while maintaining security by leveraging the main chain for data availability and consensus.\n\nThe Promise of Verkle Trees\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum development team is focusing on the integration of verkle trees. Verkle trees are a proposed upgrade to the existing Merkle trees, which are data structures that enable the secure and efficient verification of content in a blockchain. Verkle trees will optimize storage and computational efficiency, significantly reducing the size of proofs and making it easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnderstanding History Expiry\n\nAnother forthcoming feature is history expiry, a mechanism that will allow the Ethereum network to shed older historical data, thus preventing excessive growth of blockchain data size. This will alleviate the burden on nodes, ensuring that the requirement for storage space does not become a barrier for validators and full node operators, which in turn contributes to the decentralization and robustness of the network.\n\nCommunity Reactions and Expectations\n\nThe announcement received a positive response from the Ethereum community, with many expressing excitement and support for the progress. Vitalik's update on Warpcast garnered 1728 reactions and various comments from key players in the Ethereum ecosystem. Brian, from @br1an.eth, extended an invitation to discuss the update on the @unlonely platform, indicating a strong interest in the implications of this development.\n\nThe Future of Layer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nQuestions about the timeline for Layer 2 solutions adopting new features like blobs, a form of data storage that could further reduce fees, were raised by community members such as Hugo Montenegro (@hmheck). The anticipation for more affordable transaction costs was palpable, with users like Pacheco (@pachec0) expressing concerns over the current fee structure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum network's latest accomplishment in achieving the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone has generated enthusiasm among stakeholders and users alike. As the community looks forward to the implementation of verkle trees and history expiry, the path towards a more scalable and user-friendly Ethereum continues to unfold.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Stablecoin volumes on Solana grew significantly over the last six months.\n\nDaily activity on the Solana network surged while floor value of Solana NFTs spiked.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a large uptick in interest in its ecosystem over the last few weeks. This has led to a large surge in stablecoin volumes on the network as well.\n\nVolumes on the rise\n\nAccording to recent data, Solana became the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers at the time of writing, surpassing other chains in settlement volumes over the last six months.\n\nDuring this period, Solana recorded $1.7 trillion in transactions, outpacing Ethereum with $1.1 trillion and Tron with $869 billion.\n\nThis heightened liquidity within the Solana ecosystem not only facilitates smoother decentralized exchange operations but also attracts decentralized finance (DeFi) projects seeking a platform with robust performance and ample liquidity.\n\nThe network\u2019s ability to process a substantial number of stablecoin transactions enhances its overall adoption, as users and developers are drawn to a blockchain that offers efficient and cost-effective financial services.\n\nMoreover, the diverse use cases supported by high stablecoin volumes, including trading, lending, and yield farming, contribute to a dynamic and active Solana ecosystem.\n\nLooking at the activity\n\nIn terms of daily activity, Solana surpassed Ethereum and was slowly catching up to Tron. However, in terms of TVL (total value locked) on the network, it was seen that Ethereum reigned supreme followed by Tron and Solana.\n\nThis showed that despite a surge in activity, Solana has a long way to go before it could go toe to toe with Ethereum in the DeFi sector.\n\nNFT metrics\n\nIn terms of the NFT sector, it was seen that Solana NFT collections witnessed growth. The overall total floor value of Solana NFTs surged significantly over the last few days.\n\nHowever, the same level of growth wasn\u2019t observed in terms of sales volume for these collections. This indicated that despite the rising prices of the NFT collections, the number of NFT trades remained low implying that many addresses were choosing to hold their collections instead of trading them.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $150.93 and its price had grown by 1.75% in the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the volume at which SOL was being traded at had also grown by 15.23% during the same period.\n\nHowever, the RSI at which SOL was trading had declined suggesting a slowdown in bullish momentum."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s wallet address is experiencing an unprecedented surge to an all-time high, according to data from The Block\u2019s data dashboard. Notably, the blockchain has recorded more usage, specifically non-voting user transactions, than several major competitors combined. Solana\u2019s activity surpasses that of Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Tron, and Avalanche collectively. This remarkable milestone highlights Solana\u2019s growing prominence and widespread adoption in the blockchain space.\n\nDespite SOL still being 70% away from its previous ATH, the blockchain is attracting massive institutional interest. For instance, Pantera Capital, a major player in the crypto space, is reportedly considering a substantial investment of $250 million in SOL from FTX. This move is seen as a strong bullish signal for the blockchain.\n\nSolana's Wallet Surge Surpass Ethereum & Beyond 3\n\nEven with FTX holding 10% of the circulating supply, equivalent to $8 billion, industry insiders suggest that this might be the beginning of potential growth. With influential companies like Pantera expressing confidence in higher SOL prices, investors are paying attention, and following their lead could potentially lead to substantial gains.\n\nKeeping up the momentum, the Solana meme coin market is booming with a nearly $7 billion valuation, representing around 10% of the total market. Ryan Selkis of Messari highlighted Solana\u2019s standout features, such as a seamless trading experience highlighted by tools like Phantom and Backpack, DEXscreener trading integration, minimal fees, and rapid transaction processing. In a market cluttered with speculative tokens, these elements collectively distinguish the blockchain, setting it apart from the rest.\n\nSolana: Blockchain Powerhouse\n\nThe platform\u2019s appeal is not limited to its advanced functionalities but also to its cost-effectiveness. Solana\u2019s \u201cdirt-cheap\u201d gas fees attract a significant influx of retail money, making it an attractive choice for those seeking efficient transactions without breaking the bank. Despite experiencing occasional outages, the network is thriving and expanding, further solidifying its position in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, the platform has surpassed the combined daily transactions of several other major chains. As of the latest available data from Solana Floor on March 7, 2024, the network continues to assert its dominance in transaction volume, further solidifying its reputation as a blockchain powerhouse."

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow Chart March 2024 Update and How to Read It? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Confused by the ever-changing price of Ethereum (ETH)? The Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be your guide! In 2024, this chart has become an essential tool for both novice and seasoned investors navigating the volatile landscapes of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThrough this update, we delve into the nuances of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, offering a step-by-step guide on interpreting its colors and patterns. Moreover, we will uncover where Ethereum stands on this chart as of March 2024.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a vibrant visualization tool designed for long-term predictions of Ethereum\u2019s price movements. Inspired by the Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart, it combines a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to easily depict Ethereum\u2019s different market sentiments and valuation phases.\n\nThis approach facilitates the observation of exponential growth in cryptocurrency values, which might not be as perceptible on a standard linear scale.\n\nThe working of a Rainbow Chart\n\nLogarithmic scale: The chart uses a logarithmic scale, which shows proportional relationships in the data rather than absolute changes. This is useful for assets like Ethereum that can experience rapid price increases.\n\nColor bands: Each color band represents a different market condition, from \u201cbuy\u201d zones to \u201csell\u201d zones. The colors can also be seen as sentiment indicators, from fear at the bottom to greed at the top. The idea is to counteract emotional investment decisions by providing a visual cue.\n\nDynamic adjustments: Lastly, the chart adjusts as new price data becomes available, potentially shifting the regression model and the positions of the color zones.\n\nBeginner\u2019s guide to reading the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to interpret Rainbow Charts, here\u2019s a general guide to help you navigate it:\n\n1. Dark red zone (maximum bubble territory)\n\nThis extreme area signals that the asset is highly overvalued, and the risk of a significant correction or crash is elevated. Selling and taking profits in this zone could be wise to protect against potential losses.\n\n2. Red zone (overbought)\n\nThe red zone suggests that Ethereum is in an overbought condition. This means that the price has been pushed to levels that may not be sustainable in the near term.\n\nIn traditional market analysis, an overbought condition is often followed by a price correction as traders start taking profits, leading to an increased supply of ETH for sale.\n\n3. Dark orange zone (FOMO building up)\n\nIn the dark orange zone, buyers are dominating the market, and a sense of fear of missing out (FOMO) is building up. This indicates an intense buying pressure where new investors are entering the market.\n\nWhile this can lead to short-term price surges, it also increases the risk of a sudden market correction if sentiment changes or early investors start cashing out.\n\n4. Light orange zone (balanced market)\n\nThe light orange zone suggests that the forces of supply and demand are relatively even, leading to more stable prices. In a balanced market, neither buyers nor sellers have clear dominance, and the price of Ethereum moves within a more predictable range.\n\nThis stability can be seen as an opportune time for investors to reassess their positions without the pressure of extreme volatility. It might also indicate a period of consolidation before the next significant price movement.\n\n5. Yellow zone (hold)\n\nThe yellow zone implies that while there might not be strong signals to buy more ETH or to sell existing holdings, maintaining one\u2019s position could be advantageous in the long run.\n\nIt\u2019s a watchful wait stance, where investors keep a close eye on market developments without making immediate, drastic changes to their portfolios.\n\n6. Light green (still cheap)\n\nIn the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, the light green zone signifies a phase where ETH is considered relatively cheap. This zone indicates that the price is lower than the historical average, potentially offering investors a favorable entry point before an anticipated increase in value.\n\n7. Green zone (buy)\n\nOften considered the \u201cideal\u201d zone, the green band suggests that Ethereum is fairly valued. Prices in this range are thought to offer a good balance of risk and reward for long-term investors. Buying during the green phase is often recommended for those looking to accumulate Ethereum for the long haul.\n\n8. Blue zone (undervalued)\n\nAs prices move down into the blue zone, Ethereum is considered undervalued. This zone suggests that market sentiment may be overly bearish, and prices could represent a significant discount.\n\n9. Dark blue zone (basically a fire sale)\n\nThe bottommost bands signal that Ethereum is significantly undervalued, resembling a \u201cfire sale\u201d with meager prices. They present the best buying opportunity, offering the potential for substantial long-term gains as the market recovers.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart: March 2024\n\nIn March 2024, ETH lies in a light orange zone. This suggests a balanced market. So, the decision to buy, sell, or hold depends on an investor\u2019s strategy, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of considerations for each action:\n\nBuy ETH\n\nLong-term perspective : If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move.\n\n: If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): This period might be ideal for implementing or continuing a DCA strategy. Here, you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the market condition. This approach can help mitigate volatility and lower the average purchase price over time.\n\nSell ETH\n\nProfit-taking : If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals.\n\n: If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals. Portfolio rebalancing: The balanced market condition could be a good opportunity for portfolio rebalancing. If Ethereum\u2019s recent performance has skewed your investment portfolio away from your desired asset allocation, selling a portion of your ETH holdings to rebalance your portfolio can help manage risk.\n\nHold ETH\n\nWait-and-see approach : In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations.\n\n: In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations. Stability: If your analysis suggests that the market is likely to remain stable or improve, holding your position allows you to avoid potential transaction costs and taxes associated with selling, and you remain positioned to benefit from future growth.\n\nDecision factors\n\nMarket analysis : Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis.\n\n: Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis. Risk tolerance : Assess your risk tolerance. If potential short-term market downturns lead to uncomfortable stress levels or financial strain, adjusting your position might be prudent.\n\n: Assess your risk tolerance.

Investment goals: Align your actions with your investment goals. Whether you\u2019re investing for long-term growth, income, or speculation, let your goals guide your decision-making process.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart Use-Cases for Investors\n\nWhen considering investing in Ethereum, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be incredibly helpful. It provides insight into past price movements and potential future directions.\n\nBy analyzing different colored price ranges over time, investors can identify opportune moments to enter or exit positions. Essentially, the chart highlights areas where significant buying or selling activity is likely to occur, aiding decision-making processes regarding Ethereum investments.\n\nLimitations of Rainbow Charts\n\nLike any analytical tool, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has its limitations. Here are some of the key limitations to consider:\n\nHistorical data dependency : The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately.\n\n: The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately.

Its use of layers and colors makes it accessible, even for those new to technical analysis.\n\nComparative Analysis: It serves as a valuable comparative tool, enabling users to analyze market trends and price levels across various cryptocurrencies. This comparison can provide insights into Ethereum\u2019s performance relative to other digital assets.\n\nPredictive Insights: Incorporating the Ethereum Rainbow Chart into your analysis can aid in predicting future price movements based on historical market cycles. Observing patterns in price behavior can provide investors with a better understanding of potential future trends.\n\nDisadvantages of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nDespite its visual simplicity and utility, there are limitations to consider when using the Ethereum Rainbow Chart:\n\nNo Guarantees: No tool, including the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, can reliably predict future prices in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. While it may provide insights into past trends, it cannot guarantee future outcomes.\n\nLimited Historical Data: Unlike the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, which extends back to 2010, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has a more limited period. This shorter historical data may result in less accurate predictions and analyses.\n\nExternal Factors Not Considered: The chart does not account for external factors such as government regulations, economic conditions, or technological advancements. These factors can significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s price movements but are not reflected in the rainbow chart.\n\nEcosystem Changes: Changes within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as upgrades or protocol changes, are not accounted for in the rainbow chart. These developments can have substantial effects on Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics but are not captured within the chart\u2019s framework.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart and the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart differ in the price ranges they represent and their time frames. This difference is logical given Ethereum\u2019s historically lower value compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart dates back to 2010, providing a more extensive historical perspective, while the Ethereum counterpart records price performance only from 2015 onwards.\n\nBoth charts visualize historical price trends, aiding investors in identifying potential support and resistance levels. However, they should not serve as the sole basis for investment decisions, requiring additional analysis and consideration of various factors.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a helpful indicator, but remember, it\u2019s not a crystal ball. Cryptocurrency remains a volatile market. By understanding the Rainbow Chart\u2019s logic and combining it with your research, you\u2019ll be better positioned to navigate the ever-shifting world of Ethereum. So, are you ready to unlock the secrets of the Rainbow? Dive in and get charting!"

        "content": "Wed 13 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is about to undergo a major transformation with the Dencun upgrade. This long-awaited upgrade promises to revolutionize the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum network, paving the way for significant changes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n#Traders beware! #Ethereum price may encounter turbulence ahead of #Dencunupgrade, warns QCP Capital.\n\n\n\nStay ahead, strategize, navigate wisely through the storm. Knowledge is power!https://t.co/hz9rhQp19S \u2014 Coin Edition (@CoinEdition) March 13, 2024 The price of Ethereum (ETH) could be disrupted before the Dencun update\n\nDencun Upgrade of Ethereum: A Promise of Increased Scalability\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This is a technical innovation aimed at significantly reducing transaction costs for layer 2 blockchains.\n\nThis major advance could resolve the scalability issues currently hampering Ethereum. It would indeed allow the crypto network to potentially process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Such capacity would propel Ethereum to the status of an ideal cryptographic platform.\n\nWhat are the implications for crypto investors and developers?\n\nThe increase in transaction processing capacity and the reduction in costs generated by the Dencun upgrade could attract a wave of new developers and users towards the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis increased adoption would stimulate demand for ETH, positively influencing its price. Moreover, the upgrade could promote more diversification of the Optimism (OP) ecosystem and better availability of ZK-Rollups applications.\n\nEthereum Price: Contrasting Prospects\n\nAnalysts like QCP Capital are predicting a correction in the ETH price as the upgrade approaches. They highlight the increase in short positions on Ethereum options. This indicates some investor apprehension about a possible price drop. This trend could be explained by a desire to hedge against risks associated with altcoin investments.\n\nMarket indicator analysis also reveals mixed signals.\n\nOn one hand, the risk reversal for ETH has become negative. This suggests concern about a price drop.\n\nOn the other hand, the spot-forward spreads for Ethereum have slightly decreased. This denotes some confidence in the price stability.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $4,047.\n\nDespite short-term uncertainties, the Dencun upgrade represents a crucial milestone for Ethereum.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to rise above the $73,000 mark early Thursday, as the BTC exchange-traded funds keep fuelling excitement among investors. Ethereum (ETH), which was on a roll due to the Dencun Upgrade, dropped below the $4,000 mark after the upgrade went live last night. It remains to be seen how ETH manages to recover. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of minor dips and gains across the board. Memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) became the biggest gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 32 percent. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), on the other hand, turned out to be the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of over 7 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $2.77 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 1.43 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $73,505.47, registering a 24-hour gain of 2.02 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 63.10 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $3,991.25, marking a 24-hour dip of 1.08 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 3.45 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour gain of 9.84 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.1712. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 15.95.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour dip of 2.07 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $96.01. LTC price in India stood at Rs 8,349.99.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.6836, seeing a 24-hour dip of 1.67 percent. As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 59.38.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Today\n\nSolana price stood at $166.45, marking a 24-hour gain of 11.55 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 14,300.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (March 14)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\ndogwifhat (WIF)\n\nPrice: $2.91\n\n24-hour gain: 32.03 percent\n\nJupiter (JUP)\n\nPrice: $0.9458\n\n24-hour gain: 17.36 percent\n\nBonk (BONK)\n\nPrice: $0.00003442\n\n24-hour gain: 17 percent\n\nPancakeswap (CAKE)\n\nPrice: $4.93\n\n24-hour gain: 15.51 percent\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPrice: $0.00001017\n\n24-hour gain: 15.43 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (March 14)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR)\n\nPrice: $7.84\n\n24-hour loss: 7.11 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $4.09\n\n24-hour loss: 6.62 percent\n\nSei (SEI)\n\nPrice: $0.8787\n\n24-hour loss: 6.08 percent\n\nBittensor (TAO)\n\nPrice: $639.42\n\n24-hour loss: 5.80 percent\n\nWEMIX (WEMIX)\n\nPrice: $3.28\n\n24-hour loss: 4.95 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin has skyrocketed to $73,000, registering a 47% surge over the last month and 199% increase over the past year. This upward momentum is credited to the growing interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs and the impending Bitcoin halving event, which historically triggers significant price movements. There has been a steady increase in mainstream acceptance and investments from both retail and institutional investors following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Now that Bitcoin has breached the $73,000 threshold, the market eyes at the $76,000 level. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has rapidly outpaced MicroStrategy in accumulating Bitcoins, accumulating nearly 204,000 BTC within just two months of its launch, indicating a surge in demand. Blackrock's Bitcoin holdings now stand at over $14.76 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cThe global crypto market cap has reached $2.77 trillion, marking a 1.69% increase from yesterday. With another day of BTC hitting all-time highs, the fear and greed index has now moved into the extreme greed category, meaning a correction is due and sooner or later the bears are going to have a good day at the market. However, with bulls having full control of the market currently, top altcoins namely BNB and SOL have been competing for the fourth largest crypto after BTC, ETH and USDT. Yesterday the ETH Dencun upgrade went live, which will have a positive impact on layer 2 gas fee transactions. Though MATIC reached its highest price in more than a year - similar price action was not visible in OP and ARB.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory, hitting new all-time highs amid rapid buy-ups after each dip. However, analysts suggest a cooling phase may be on the horizon as BTC has nearly doubled in price since late January without significant pullbacks. Negative bearish divergence on the 4-hour chart's relative strength index (RSI) hints at potential lower prices. Meme coins' soaring values indicate a possible pullback, with BTC trading around $73,192, up 1.40% in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cOn March 13, Bitcoin jumped to around $73,000, supported by a solid base with a pivot point at $70,013 and resistance levels between $73,824 and $79,904. Key support levels at $67,154, $64,861 and $62,192 offer a safety net against potential downside. Technical indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI) of 71 and the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at 68,547, indicate strong buying interest, reinforced by bullish candlestick patterns. A break above $72,000 could sustain the bullish trend, while a break below could prompt a re-evaluation. However, caution is advised if the price drops below $72,000, potentially signalling a shift in trend despite the current optimism.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin continues to rally after a week of record spot ETF net inflows of $1.1 billion. MicroStrategy which recently bought $821.7 million worth of bitcoin, is now raising $500 million more to buy additional Bitcoin.This price action reflects strong institutional buying and new ATHs don't take much time unlike earlier. $74,000 is the next price level to watch before it eventually hits 100,000.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.\n\nThe success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:\n\n-no further ETPs for other tokens\n\n-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N \u2014 Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) March 14, 2024\n\nFollowing the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAltcoins Fall: Will Ethereum And Solana Bulls Surpass Expectations? 6 months ago\n\nA part of the letter read:\n\nRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of the Ethereum token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.\n\nEthereum price on a deep correction on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView"

Proponents of a sustained uptrend point to a confluence of positive factors. The long-awaited approval of a US-based Ethereum ETF is a hot topic, with speculation swirling that a green light could trigger a significant influx of institutional capital, potentially injecting billions into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, an event that cuts Bitcoin\u2019s mining reward in half, is expected to have a positive spillover effect on the entire cryptocurrency market, potentially propelling Ethereum further.\n\nSurge In Short-Term Ethereum Holders Signals Optimism\n\nThis optimistic outlook is bolstered by a surge in on-chain activity. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant increase in the number of short-term Ethereum holders.\n\nSource: TradingView/IntoTheBlock\n\nHistorically, this trend, with its 60% monthly price surge for ETH, aligns with bull markets, signifying an influx of new users entering the crypto space and actively participating in the network. Think of it as a crowded party \u2013 the more people show up (currently approaching the highs of the last bull cycle), the livelier the atmosphere becomes (and potentially the higher the price goes).\n\nBut, there\u2019s more to the story. A closer inspection of technical indicators paints a slightly different picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) are currently hovering in overbought territory, with RSI specifically nearing the 70 mark.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $2.677 trillion. Chart: TradingView\n\nIn simpler terms, this suggests that Ethereum\u2019s price at slightly above $4,000 might be stretched a bit thin and due for a potential pullback. Imagine a jump rope competition \u2013 if you\u2019re swinging too hard and fast (like an RSI over 70), eventually you\u2019ll trip yourself up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future: Balancing Act\n\nAdding a layer of intrigue, the sentiment among investors seems geographically divided. While the \u201cCoinbase Premium,\u201d a metric reflecting buying pressure, is thriving in the US, its Korean counterpart indicates ongoing selling activity.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Hodlers Eye Long Term: $520 Million BTC Go To Cold Storage 6 months ago\n\nThis regional disparity could be attributed to diverse market dynamics and investor preferences. Perhaps American investors, with a green Coinbase Premium, are more optimistic about the regulatory landscape surrounding crypto, while their Korean counterparts, with a red Korea Premium, are taking a more cautious approach.\n\nSo, what does this all mean for Ethereum\u2019s future? The answer, unfortunately, isn\u2019t as clear-cut as we\u2019d like. The confluence of positive factors like potential ETF approval, increased network activity with a surge in short-term holders, and a potential Bitcoin halving boost paint a bullish picture.\n\nHowever, technical indicators hinting at an overbought market and contrasting investor sentiment across regions introduce a note of caution. Ethereum is currently walking a tightrope \u2013 will it maintain its momentum or face a reality check in the form of a price correction? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Blasts Off! ETH Price to Hit New ATH This Week?\n\nStory Highlights The Dencun upgrade for Ethereum is here, aiming to significantly reduce transaction fees on Layer 2 networks.\n\nA key feature of Dencun is the use of \"blobs\" to store data for Layer 2 networks, reducing storage costs and congestion.\n\nHope is that the Dencun will lead to substantial improvements in transaction fees and network performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fans rejoice as the long-awaited Dencun upgrade finally arrives today, promising to shake up Layer 2 (L2) networks and potentially boost ETH prices beyond $4,000.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another update \u2013 it\u2019s a major milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, promising significant improvements in efficiency and scalability. But how exactly will Dencun shake things up?\n\nKey Features of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s Shapella upgrade, Dencun brings in several improvements to make Ethereum faster and handle more transactions. One exciting feature is the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, nicknamed \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d which aims to significantly lower L2 transaction fees.\n\nDencun\u2019s goal is to drastically reduce transaction costs, with fees dropping from $1 to just one cent. Even smaller transactions, which previously cost cents, can now be completed for a fraction of a cent. This cost reduction aims to greatly improve the user experience, surpassing previous upgrades like the September 2022 \u201cMerge.\u201d\n\nBesides fee cuts, the Dencun upgrade introduces blobs, a new way to store data for Layer 2 networks. These blobs store data for a shorter time, about 18 days, saving costs and making Ethereum more scalable.\n\nAlso Read: Top Reasons Why Ethereum Might Be The Best Bet in 2024 For Atleast 3x-5x Profits\n\nCommunity Enthusiasm and Developer Involvement\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, expressed excitement on Twitter about the upcoming arrival of Dencun.
