        "title": "No, ETH isn\u2019t suddenly a security now - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sale of ETH since the September 2022 \u201cMerge\u201d constitutes an unregistered securities offering in violation of US law, according to Fortune.\n\nIf the reports are true, then this investigation \u2014 just ahead of the SEC\u2019s May deadline for a decision on an Ethereum spot ETF (more on that later) \u2014 raises the question: Did Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake transform it into a security?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe slightly longer answer is \u201cstill probably no.\u201d\n\nETH tokens are not, in and of themselves, \u201csecurities\u201d in the way that stocks or bonds are. They do not confer legal ownership of any business entity or contractual rights to any kind of payments \u2014 they are just code in a decentralized database.\n\nWhen we talk about ETH \u201cbeing a security,\u201d we are instead actually asking whether the offer and sale of ETH tokens (in a particular context, between a particular buyer and seller) constitutes an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the dreaded Howey test. Under the Howey test, the offer and sale of an asset like ETH constitutes an investment contract if (1) someone invested money, (2) in a \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d (3) in the expectation of profit and (4) where that expectation is based on the \u201cessential managerial efforts of particular others.\u201d\n\nThe four Howey \u201cprongs\u201d have already been discussed and debated to death in the crypto space, so I\u2019ll avoid beating a dead horse here. But if you look closely at the language from Howey, I think two things quickly become apparent about the sale of ETH tokens over time:\n\nFirst, the sale of pre-mined ETH tokens to investors in Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO sure looks a lot like an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d ICO participants invested money (BTC) in order to receive their allocation of ETH (Howey prong #1). That BTC was pooled to fund a common effort led by Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation to develop the Ethereum blockchain and produce the ETH tokens (Howey prong #2). Given that the Ethereum blockchain \u201cpre-launch\u201d at the time of the ICO, the only plausible motivation to take part in the ICO was to make money on the price appreciation of ETH (Howey prong #3). And, at the time of the ICO, if Ethereum was going to succeed as a protocol and ETH was going to succeed as an asset, Vitalik and his developers were going to have to roll up their sleeves and put in some good old \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d to make the tokens worth anything (Howey prong #4).\n\nHad the SEC brought suit around the time of the Ethereum ICO, they would have almost certainly won in court, and that may well have been the end of ETH.\n\nHowever, the SEC didn\u2019t bring suit, and the statute of limitations for such a claim (typically five years) would have run out in 2019. And importantly, the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved in ways since its ICO that make current sales of ETH tokens look less like an investment contract than they once did.\n\nFor one thing, the proliferation of applications (think DeFi and NFTs) utilizing ETH for \u201cgas\u201d provides a \u201cconsumptive utility\u201d for ETH tokens that challenges the notion that current-day purchases of ETH are solely, or even mainly, based on profit expectation.\n\nEven more important, however, is the so-called \u201cHinman speech\u201d delivered in 2018 by Bill Hinman, then the director of corporation finance at the SEC, where he proposed that a digital asset\u2019s classification under Howey could evolve over time.\n\nAccording to Hinman\u2019s logic \u2014 to the extent that Ethereum\u2019s success no longer hinges on the efforts of a particular entity, like Vitalik or the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 the sale of ETH tokens would no longer fulfill the requirement of the final Howey prong that there be \u201cparticular others\u201d upon whose efforts a buyer would rely for their profits.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Staking or not, ETH is no security\n\nTherefore, regardless of the legally dubious nature of the ICO, the Ethereum network (at least from 2018 onwards) has become \u201csufficiently decentralized.\u201d This means that its native token constitutes a digital commodity like bitcoin, rather than an investment contract, subject to SEC jurisdiction.\n\nSince the Hinman speech, the securities law status of ETH has been at a bit of a stalemate. The SEC has never explicitly endorsed the notion that ETH (even pre-merge) is a digital commodity \u2014 which they readily concede with regard to bitcoin. And Gary Gensler regularly ties himself in knots before Congress trying to evade questions about his view on ETH\u2019s current legal status.\n\nBut the fact remains that (at least until now) the SEC has never brought an action specifically alleging that primary or secondary sales of ETH constitute investment contracts under Howey (like they did with over a dozen other tokens in the Coinbase, Binance and Kraken lawsuits). The SEC even went as far as to approve the listing of ETFs based on ETH futures contracts that trade on the CME, which would be hard to understand if the Commission felt that ETH tokens traded as unregistered securities.\n\nBut what about Ethereum\u2019s migration to proof-of-stake? Does the fact that ETH tokens can be staked for \u201cyield\u201d change the legal situation and turn either (A) current-day sales of ETH, or (B) the act of staking ETH into securities offerings under Howey?\n\nIn my opinion (and I spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about crypto securities law), no.\n\nWith regard to present-day sales of ETH tokens \u2014 whether directly from the Ethereum Foundation or on the secondary market \u2014 I don\u2019t think ETH\u2019s staking functionality makes much of a difference under Howey. That is, the ability to stake does not make ETH tokens any less useful for individuals who might buy them for their consumptive utility (i.e. gas fees).\n\nAnd while the Ethereum Foundation does indeed still hold a large supply of ETH tokens, there is no reason to think that the introduction of staking makes the foundation\u2019s \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d \u201cessential\u201d to the financial success of ETH in some way that was not the case at the time of the 2018 Hinman speech.\n\nThe question of whether the act of staking ETH in order to receive \u201cyield\u201d in the form of staking rewards constitutes an investment contract under Howey is more nuanced \u2014 but properly understood, the answer should still be no.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ether is the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat of crypto\n\nWhen you run a validator node and stake 32 ETH tokens in exchange for rewards, what you are actually doing is providing a service to the Ethereum network and getting paid for that service. You only get the reward if you honestly validate blocks, and you stand to lose your stake to \u201cslashing\u201d if you attempt to validate dishonestly.\n\nThis is very different from the type of passive \u201cyield\u201d you might expect to receive from holding a bond or a dividend-paying stock or real estate asset (which rewards ownership and not activity). Unlike with these traditional financial instruments, you are not relying on \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d of other people in order to profit when you stake ETH directly, but rather on your own skill and honestly as a validator.\n\nThis question becomes trickier, however, when we move from direct proof-of-stake validation to \u201cstaking services\u201d such as those run by exchanges like Coinbase and collaborative staking protocols like Lido and Rocketpool.\n\nAt one end of the extreme, you could see an argument for how custodial staking services could look quite security-like under Howey (given how reliant depositors would be on the staking service provider\u2019s efforts in order to earn yield).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, you could imagine a purely on-chain tool that allowed users to jointly stake their ETH in collective, automated, validator nodes with clearly defined behavior looking much more like direct staking than an investment contract.\n\nWhere the specific services by Coinbase, Lido and Rocketpool fall on this continuum is very much an open legal question \u2014 and one that in Coinbase\u2019s case is being actively litigated in federal court in the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut none of this makes ETH itself, even when being used for staking purposes, an investment contract and therefore none of this seems to justify the SEC\u2019s new investigation.\n\nWhy, then, might the SEC be pursuing this type of weak claim about Ethereum?\n\nObserving the success of the Bitcoin ETF \u2014 and the SEC\u2019s dissatisfaction with its launch \u2014 suggests that the investigation into Ethereum might be a pretext to deny the upcoming spot ETH ETF application.\n\nMoreover, acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s transition to a commodity despite its seemingly illegal ICO genesis could concede a legal strategy meant to apply to other token projects that the SEC believes aiming to circumvent securities classification (in other words, creating a loophole).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s actions could be seen as a strategic move to maintain regulatory leverage over the crypto market, rather than a clear-cut determination of Ethereum\u2019s status as a security.\n\nZack Shapiro is the Managing Partner at Rains and leads the law practice.

        "title": "Ethereum falls to lowest level against Bitcoin in 3 years amid panic selling - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum fell against Bitcoin to its lowest point in three years amid the carnage that followed Bitcoin\u2019s fall from $70,000 over the weekend. The ETH-BTC chart reached as low as 0.0462 BTC on Saturday, April 13, down 24% from the year-to-date high of 0.085 BTC.\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time high against Bitcoin came in 2017 when it touched 0.16 BTC before closing the year around similar levels to now at 0.048 BTC. It has since recorded lows around 0.018 BTC in late 2019 before rising significantly throughout the 2020 \u2013 2021 bull market.\n\nThe cycle peak of 0.088 BTC was met with a steady decline throughout 2023, 2022, and 2024. The 0.05 BTC level had been acting as a lower support level until it was breached this month. While the price remains within 7% of the support, it has been almost three years since we\u2019ve seen these prices.\n\nThe decline has been gradual and steady since the start of 2023, with a few bullish breakouts shut down within a couple of months.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains below the 0.05 BTC support level, it has recovered almost 7% from its weekend lows, holding relatively steady amid Bitcoin\u2019s continued struggles. Bitcoin fell from $70,000 to $61,700 over the weekend before recovering to $66,000. However, Bitcoin has retested $61,700 again and is trading around $62,000 as of press time. Ethereum initially followed Bitcoin down from $3,600 to $2,800 \u2013 it has since consolidated around the $3,000 mark, aiding it in its price war with Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the overall crypto market often follows Bitcoin, much of the altcoin market follows Ethereum. The ETH-BTC chart highly influences the delicate relationship between digital asset price movements, and it is one of the staples of the industry. Bitcoin dominance, another critical factor, reached a 3-year high this weekend, touching 57%, while Ethereum dominance dropped to just 15% from a recent high of 19%.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s EIP-3074 \u2018upgrade\u2019 could let wallet makers steal your money - Protos",
        "content": "With momentum carried over from the relatively smooth hard fork upgrades Shapella (Shanghai+Capella) and Dencun (Deneb+Cancun), Ethereum\u2019s next hard fork was supposed to be a breeze. Nevertheless, several analysts are waving red flags about one of its code changes, EIP-3074.\n\nThrough EIP-3074, Pectra will introduce codes that permit users to delegate all of their Ethereum assets to so-called Invokers \u2014 externally owned accounts (EOA) that users must trust to not steal their money.\n\nFollowing the naming convention of \u2018star + city portmanteau,\u2019 the upcoming hard fork Pectra (Electra+Prague) will introduce two new operation codes: AUTH and AUTHCALL. Together, these codes make up Ethereum Improvement Proposal number 3074 (EIP-3074).\n\nThe two codes are easy to understand. AUTH delegates power to an Invoker to conduct transactions while AUTHCALL calls that prior authorization to conduct subsequent transactions using that authorization.\n\nIncredibly \u2014 and for the first time in Ethereum\u2019s history \u2014 these two codes allow a third-party entity to send or transact Ethereum assets, including NFTs and ERC-20 tokens like USDC, inside your wallet forever. Unless developers modify the EIP before Ethereum hard forks later this year, the delegated powers remain with the Invoker permanently.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation ditches \u2018warrant canary\u2019\n\nEIP-3074 gives wallet makers even more power\n\nAlthough further details of the AUTH and AUTHCALL codes are quite technical, a final item of general importance to most crypto participants is EIP-3074\u2019s entrusting of unprecedented powers to wallet makers.\n\nBecause Ethereum developers realize the expansive and permanent power of AUTH instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), they have decided to limit the EOAs to which users may delegate their assets. Specifically, they have proposed limiting EOAs to a whitelist maintained by pre-approved wallet providers like MetaMask.\n\nThe solution to this blockchain problem? Trusted third-parties.\n\nEIP-3074: Trust us, bro.\n\nChainArgos CEO Jonathan Reiter explained Invokers\u2019 newfound powers in EIP-3074 even more explicitly, saying, \u201cI delegate authority over my account to an Invoker \u2014 something that can now call code over my assets \u2014 and that thing now has the ability to do stuff with my assets. And there\u2019s no way to revoke that delegation\u2026 The problem here is, because you can\u2019t revoke it, if I delegate to a contract \u2014 even if I think that contract is okay today \u2014 if it\u2019s upgradeable, they can steal my tokens in the future.\u201d\n\nSecurity researchers and auditors have raised similar concerns. Indeed, it\u2019s not enough for the user to simply ensure that they delegate only to presently trustworthy EOAs. If those EOAs are upgradeable smart contracts, the owner of those EOAs\u2019 private keys could swap honest code for malicious code in the future.\n\nWorse, even if an EOA is immutable, if that EOA interacts with additional smart contracts and those third-party smart contracts are upgradeable, EIP-3074 could expose users\u2019 assets to theft via malicious, third-party code upgrades in the future.\n\nRead more: Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups\n\nWhy are we further empowering the most powerful?\n\nGiven all of these risks, what exactly is the point of EIP-3074 in the first place? Mostly, in the opinion of co-author Matt Garnett, the code will save users time and money \u2014 assuming Invokers stay honest. Consider a first-timer\u2019s experience using Uniswap. First they must manually sign to authorize Uniswap. Then they need to pay to activate ETH on Uniswap before signing up and paying gas to activate USDC. Then they sign and pay gas to swap ETH for USDC and if more assets are involved, each one must also be activated with a separate signature and gas fee.\n\nIn the post-Pectra hard fork world, many of these signatures and gas payments could consolidate. For the user, they would only sign once to AUTH an Invoker with permission to perpetually trade their ETH or USDC on their behalf \u2014 without subsequent signatures.\n\nIn summary, EIP-3074 adds more trust and power with centralized and already quite powerful corporations like MetaMask by Consensys. Unless developers rethink this software change, the upgrade will entice users to entrust perpetual authority with third-party Invokers. These entities may now control users\u2019 wallets and might, by way of their own or third-party smart contract upgrades, change the rules of the game in the future to simply steal users\u2019 money.\n\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: will SOL's growth threaten ETH dominance? - OKX",
        "content": "With teams debuting their shiny new crypto projects every other week, navigating the world of crypto can be overwhelming for newcomers to the space. As you start to build a long-term, high-conviction trading strategy, it's likely you'll be researching prolific projects at the forefront of blockchain technology.\n\nOf today's crypto market leaders, two similar technologies that deserve exploring are major Layer 1 players Solana and Ethereum. As both Solana and Ethereum represent established Layer 1 blockchains backed by passionate communities and vibrant ecosystems, it can be difficult to separate the two given their strengths and unique selling points.\n\nEager for clarity? This guide aims to provide an objective comparison of Solana vs Ethereum as we demystify their technical attributes and explore what differentiates them. From exploring how each Layer 1 blockchain fares against the blockchain trilemma to understanding their future developments, here's everything you need to know when comparing Solana and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is the first blockchain platform to popularize smart contracts and self-executing programs that power decentralized applications (DApps). The leap forward with autonomous smart contracts sparked a wave of development in the decentralized space and established Ethereum as a DeFi pioneer, where users can borrow, lend, and trade crypto without relying on traditional financial institutions. Beyond DeFi, Ethereum's robust ecosystem encourages fresh innovation across various sectors, ranging from NFTs and GameFi to real-world asset (RWA) marketplaces and prediction markets. Overall, Ethereum's established developer community, strong security measures, and ever-evolving feature set solidify its position as a leading force in the blockchain world.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nA next-generation blockchain that improves upon the innovations of its predecessors, Solana debuted in 2017 amid scalability bottlenecks and rose to prominence because of its Proof of History (PoH) function. By timestamping transactions in a decentralized manner, Solana nodes can organize transactions more efficiently, leading to rapid confirmation times and affordable gas fees. This makes Solana a haven for fast-paced DApps that demand high transaction throughput. Beyond speed and affordability, Solana boasts a vibrant developer community drawn to its user-friendly programming languages and its potential for on-chain scaling solutions. This dev-first focus has fueled the creation of innovative projects within the Solana ecosystem, including play-to-earn games with immersive experiences and serialized NFT projects that allow ongoing content updates.\n\nHow Ethereum and Solana fare against the blockchain trilemma\n\nBefore diving into our Solana vs Ethereum comparison, it's important to first understand the concept of the blockchain trilemma. In short, the blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin that suggests developers for decentralized blockchains will encounter three main factors: security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nDespite their best efforts, developers will be forced to sacrifice one factor as a trade-off to meet the needs of the other two factors. One example of this would be Bitcoin. Known for its high level of security and decentralization, Bitcoin is often seen as the gold standard among decentralized networks. However, Bitcoin struggles with scalability, meaning it can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This is a major drawback for widespread Bitcoin mainstream adoption, as it can lead to slow transaction times and high fees.\n\nUltimately, understanding the blockchain trilemma is essential for evaluating different blockchain projects. Each project makes its own trade-offs between the three core principles mentioned above, and the ideal choice for you'll depend on your specific needs and priorities. Now that we have a clear understanding of the blockchain trilemma, let's dive into the security, decentralization, and scalability of Ethereum and Solana to see how these popular blockchains fare against such metrics.\n\nSecurity\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana prioritize security, employing robust mechanisms to safeguard user funds and network integrity. In both cases, validators stake their own tokens (ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana) to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. Ethereum's long history and battle-tested security measures inspire confidence in many users, but it's important to remember that security for any blockchain is an ongoing process, and vulnerabilities can still emerge. However, their approaches differ in their nuance of Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation. Ethereum's current PoS implementation is still under development compared to some established PoS blockchains, while Solana's PoS applies PoH alongside it.\n\nEthereum's security\n\nEthereum's current security relies on PoS, a consensus mechanism where validators stake their own ETH tokens to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. While the PoS implementation is a recent development, Ethereum's history with its previous Proof of Work (PoW) system and the ongoing security audits and improvements during its transition to PoS inspire confidence in its ability to protect user funds and network integrity. This established track record is a major advantage for users who prioritize a security model that's been thoroughly tested and refined over time.\n\nSolana's security\n\nSolana leverages a unique combination of PoH and delegated PoS (DPos) for security. PoH creates a verifiable record of time between transactions, preventing issues like replay attacks due to streamlined transaction ordering. Delegated PoS requires validators to stake not only SOL tokens but also Solana hardware, raising the potential cost of malicious activity. While Solana's security architecture is innovative and shows promise, its relative novelty compared to Ethereum's PoS system might lead some users to favor Ethereum's established track record.\n\nOverall, both Ethereum and Solana prioritize security with strong mechanisms to protect user funds. Ethereum's established track record with PoS inspires confidence in many users. However, Solana's innovative approach with PoH and bonded PoS offers additional security features and a potentially higher barrier to malicious actors. While Ethereum's PoS is well-understood, Solana's complex architecture with PoH may be less battle-tested, introducing the possibility of unforeseen vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the choice between these two platforms from a security standpoint depends on your individual risk tolerance and how you weigh a proven track record against advanced and disruptive features.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology. It refers to the distribution of power and control across a network, eliminating the need for a central authority. Both Ethereum and Solana aim for decentralization by applying the PoS consensus mechanisms. With PoS, validators who stake their own cryptocurrency tokens are responsible for verifying transactions. This economic incentive aligns validator interests with the health of the network, as malicious behavior could result in slashing and the loss of their stake. Additionally, both platforms aim to achieve a degree of resistance to censorship by distributing the validation process across a global network. This means no single entity can control or block transactions on the network.\n\nEthereum's decentralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is arguably one of the most decentralized in the world. With an estimated validator pool exceeding one million, Ethereum's validator base is constantly expanding, with plans to become even more distributed in the future. However, concerns remain about the potential influence of large staking pools that could hold a significant portion of the total staked ETH. As of writing, Lido dominates the staking landscape on Ethereum, controlling over 30% of staked ETH at one point. This concentration raises concerns about potential centralization, as Lido could potentially influence the network if it wanted to. Thankfully, the Ethereum team is actively working to mitigate this risk. The upcoming sharding upgrades as part of the Ethereum roadmap aim to further decentralize the network by increasing the number of validators required per shard. Overall, this will make it more difficult for any single entity to gain control, since the implemented upgrade will increase the number of validators required and lower the barrier to entry for individual stakers.\n\nSolana's decentralization\n\nAlthough Solana has been praised for its impressive throughput, its string of outages expose a potential vulnerability in this methodology. Solana adopts a different approach to decentralization and applies a DPoS system where validators are chosen based on factors like stake size and network performance. While this approach allows for faster transaction speeds, it also raises concerns about centralization as the validation power is concentrated among a smaller set of chosen validators.\n\nAdditionally, Solana's validator set is currently permissioned and employs a validator selection process with delegated PoS, meaning new validators need approval from the network to join. While this allows for faster transaction speeds, Solana's reliance on a specific set of validators for its PoH system raises questions about its true level of decentralization and reliability. This is especially true when compared to Ethereum's more geographically distributed validator network.\n\nThe perceived lack of reliability has also been underlined by Solana's network disruptions. To tackle this, Solana is working towards a permissionless validator set through its hotly anticipated validator client software, Firedancer. Firedancer implements Solana's version of PoS and aims to address some of the platform's current centralization concerns. By enabling anyone to run a validator node without prior approval from the network, Firedancer has the potential to significantly distribute validation power more evenly and greatly improve network decentralization in the long run.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Ethereum and Solana regarding decentralization depends on your priorities. If complete openness and permissionless participation are paramount, Ethereum might be the better choice despite its current scalability limitations. If faster transaction speeds are a priority, you might be willing to accept some centralization trade-offs with Solana, keeping in mind its ongoing efforts to become more decentralized in the future. However, if a technical issue or malicious attack disrupts the validator network, the entire Solana network can grind to a halt. This undermines the security and reliability of the platform, especially compared to more decentralized blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability refers to a blockchain's ability to handle a growing number of transactions without compromising processing speed or incurring high fees. This is a critical factor for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as expensive gas fees are often a deterring factor when it comes to regular usage and transactions. Scalability presents a contrast between Ethereum and Solana as each network has its own way of dealing with high transaction volume.\n\nEthereum's scalability\n\nAlthough it's established with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum has historically struggled with scalability due to its previous PoW consensus mechanism. This resulted in numerous scalability bottlenecks such as high transaction fees and slow processing times, which were major pain points for users looking to actively interact with Ethereum's ecosystem. In fact, it's this bottleneck that inspired many developers to strike out on their own and create their own scalability-focused Layer 1 blockchain, leading to the innovations in blockchain scalability that we see today.\n\nFortunately, the Ethereum Foundation has been hard at work upgrading the network with improved scalability in mind. From its PoS transition to numerous network upgrades like Dencun, the developments aim to significantly improve scalability by distributing the workload across multiple shards, potentially handling thousands of transactions per second. With the execution of its roadmap, we could see Ethereum reach a single block finality of 12 seconds. This is a fraction of its current 30-minute duration, and achieving this will dramatically improve the user experience and network efficiency.\n\nSolana's scalability\n\nMeanwhile, Solana is a high-performance blockchain that prioritizes scalability from its core design. Since its inception, Solana has had a laser-like focus on speed. Thanks to the network's introduction of innovations like PoH and tower byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), Solana is theoretically able to achieve a blistering throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second. On top of this, Solana also boasts gas fees that are mere fractions of a penny, making it significantly cheaper to interact with the network compared to Ethereum's historically high gas fees.\n\nThe combination of blazing-fast transaction speeds and negligible fees puts Solana's scalability in a league of its own compared to Ethereum's current state, as Solana is becoming the platform of choice for a wide range of DApps, particularly those requiring high throughput and cost-effectiveness. While Solana has yet to achieve its theoretical maximum throughput, it's certainly on its way to hitting this thanks to progress made with Firedancer. With its ability to process 600,000 transactions per second in test environments, Firedancer could be influential in markedly improving Solana\u2019s overall scalability.\n\nWhen considering scalability between Ethereum and Solana, both networks offer compelling options for developers and users seeking a scalable blockchain platform. While Ethereum focuses on a robust ecosystem and future scalability improvements with a strong emphasis on decentralization, Solana prioritizes raw speed and boasts impressive transaction processing capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Ultimately, the choice between these platforms depends on the specific needs of the project or user, with factors like transaction speed, cost, desired level of decentralization, and application type playing a key role in the decision-making process.\n\nSolana's potential threat to ETH dominance\n\nFor those unaware, ETH dominance refers to the ratio between the market cap of Ether to the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. Like with Bitcoin dominance, ETH dominance is often used to track Ether's value relative to other big-name cryptocurrencies. This is used to signify how ETH fares against the competition.\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (source: tradingview.com)\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (Source: tradingview.com)\n\nReferencing the chart above, we can see that ETH dominance is currently on a downward trend. This is based on how a recent death cross was formed on the daily time frame as the 50-day moving average recently crossed under the 200-day moving average. Additionally, the relative strength index shows that ETH dominance is declining from its current value of 44.1. With these indicators in mind, we can conclude that ETH dominance could decrease in the near future, hinting that there might be a relative increase in the value of altcoins as traders rotate out of ETH into promising crypto projects and altcoins like SOL. This trend has also been a huge reason why crypto traders have been speculating that Solana might threaten ETH dominance over time as it offers a faster, more scalable alternative with significantly lower transaction fees. This speculation is further fueled by the ongoing developments of Solana's Firedancer validator client software, which aims to address concerns about decentralization and news of how Solana recently overtook Ethereum in terms of DEX trading volume.\n\nThe future of Solana vs Ethereum: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist?\n\nThe competition between two leading Layer 1 blockchains like Solana and Ethereum is fierce. While Ethereum boasts a robust and established ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization, Solana offers blazing-fast transaction speeds ideal for high-throughput applications.\n\nAs both platforms continue to evolve, one important question emerges: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist in the future blockchain landscape? The answer might lie in specialization. Ethereum's upcoming sharding upgrades could address its scalability issues while maintaining its focus on security and decentralization. This would solidify Ethereum's strong positioning for complex financial applications and trading TradFi instruments like RWAs. Conversely, Solana's speed advantage could make it the go-to platform for applications requiring real-time transactions, such as DeFi markets with frequent trading or high-traffic GameFi titles.\n\nBeyond competition, we've seen a rise in cooperation between Solana and Ethereum. Thanks to the rise of decentralized interoperability bridging services like OKX Swap, both Layer 1 blockchains can seamlessly communicate with one another and enable asset transfers. We've even seen the emergence of shared developer tools and cross-chain projects fostering a more collaborative environment. Ultimately, the future might see a scenario where both Ethereum and Solana thrive, catering to different user needs and fostering innovation within the broader, interconnected blockchain space.\n\nFinal words on Solana vs Ethereum\n\nMany would agree that Solana may be the best option if speed, scalability, and low fees are important to you. This will likely be the case if you're interacting with high-frequency DeFi applications where every millisecond counts, or if you frequently trade Solana memecoins. However, if a robust and battle-tested ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization is your priority, Ethereum might be the better fit. This could be ideal for DApps requiring greater security for valuable assets or projects seeking a more established user base and compatibility with existing Ethereum-based DApps.\n\nUltimately, the best approach might not be a \"which is better\" scenario. As the industry continues to develop, we might see increased interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. This would allow users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly. For instance, imagine seamlessly transferring assets between Ethereum and Solana for lower transaction fees while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. The future of blockchain development is bright, with both Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana leading the charge. By staying informed about their ongoing advancements, you'll be well-positioned to make informed choices as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve.\n\nKeen to trade either Solana or Ether? Check out our spot trading pairs for SOL and ETH to get started with your crypto trading journey today.\n\nFAQs about Solana vs Ethereum\n\nIs Solana faster than Ethereum?\n\nYes, Solana is significantly faster than Ethereum in its current state. Solana boasts theoretical transaction speeds exceeding 65,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum's current average of 15 to 45 transactions per second. This difference is due to Solana's unique architecture designed for scalability, while Ethereum is still undergoing upgrades to improve its speed.\n\nIs Solana cheaper than Ethereum?\n\nYes, Solana transactions typically incur significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum. Solana gas fees are a fraction of a penny, while Ethereum gas fees can fluctuate and sometimes reach high levels depending on network congestion.\n\nIs Solana more secure than Ethereum?\n\nWith its established and battle-tested network and a larger validator base that offers greater decentralization, Ethereum is generally considered more secure than Solana. This can also be seen in how often Solana faces network outages compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhy does Ethereum have higher TVL (total value locked) than Solana?\n\nTVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency locked within DeFi protocols on a specific blockchain. Ethereum has a significantly higher TVL compared to Solana. This can be attributed to factors like Ethereum's first mover advantage that led to it having a more mature and established ecosystem. Specifically, Ethereum supports a wider range of DeFi applications and protocols, while the network effect could have caused the existing user base on Ethereum to attract further projects and users that reinforce its dominance in the DeFi space.\n\nCan Solana overtake Ethereum?\n\nThe future is, of course, uncertain. While Solana offers superior speed and lower fees as of writing, Ethereum is actively working on scalability improvements. Additionally, Ethereum's established ecosystem and user base are significant advantages. It's more likely that both platforms will coexist, with users choosing based on their specific needs. The rise of interoperability bridges could further enhance this coexistence by allowing users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly."

Gas fees: Staking and unstaking transactions on the Ethereum network require gas fees, which can vary. These fees can impact profitability, especially for smaller stakers.\n\nHow Much Ethereum Do You Need to Stake on Coinbase?\n\nUnlike solo staking, where you usually need the full 32 ETH, Coinbase allows users to stake any amount of ETH. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH on Coinbase. This flexibility makes staking accessible to everyone, regardless of the amount of Ethereum they hold.\n\nHow Much Can You Earn Staking ETH on Coinbase?\n\nWhen staking Ethereum (ETH) on Coinbase in mid-April 2024, the estimated reward rate is approximately 2.61% if you stake for 365 days. This rate isn't fixed and can vary over time. You can check the latest applicable rates directly within your Coinbase account. Commission charges reduce your actual returns.\n\nRewards are distributed every four to five days after the activation period. However, the rewards may not settle in your account immediately because of network conditions. While the estimated reward rate gives you an idea of what you can earn, the actual rewards may take some time to reflect in your account.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Unstake ETH on Coinbase?\n\nTo unstake ETH on Coinbase, you follow a specific process. Once you initiate the unstaking action, your assets will enter an unbonding period. After this period ends, you can withdraw the asset. However, there's an additional step: unbonded assets must be included in a batch before withdrawal. You'll need to wait until the unbonding transaction is part of one of Coinbase's batch times.\n\nFor U.S. clients, batch times are Monday-Friday at 12:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. PST; and Saturday-Sunday at 2:00 p.m. PST. Non-U.S. clients have different batch times: Monday-Friday at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. GMT; and Saturday-Sunday at 4:00 p.m. GMT.\n\nUnstaking ETH on Coinbase involves an unbonding period followed by waiting for batch withdrawal times. Be aware of these timelines when planning to unstake ETH.\n\nCan I Sell Staked Ethereum on Coinbase?\n\nYou cannot directly sell staked Ethereum on Coinbase. You would go through the process of unstaking it first, which typically takes one to four days depending on network conditions. Once the unstaking transaction is processed, you'll be able to claim your funds and sell them.\n\nUnstaking and claiming are separate blockchain transactions, and both require gas fees, resulting in costs associated with both processes.\n\nIf you have staked Ethereum on Coinbase and want to move it, you have a couple of options. You can unstake it and sell it or you can wrap it into cbETH and trade it as a liquid staking token. However, cbETH trades at a discount, so if you're looking to sell at the full value of your staked Ethereum, unstaking and selling it may be the better option.\n\nCoinbase Stakers Earn Rewards\n\nStaking Ethereum on Coinbase offers a straightforward and accessible way for users to actively participate in the Ethereum network and earn rewards. With Coinbase's user-friendly platform, you can stake any amount of ETH, even as little as 0.01 ETH, without the need for a full Ethereum node. While there are potential risks and considerations to keep in mind, such as centralized exchange risks, commission charges and gas fees, the benefits of earning passive income, supporting network security and contributing to a more environmentally friendly blockchain ecosystem can make staking on Coinbase an attractive option for many investors."

        "title": "Halving 2024: How Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR)\u2019s are Poised to Transform in the New ETF-Driven Market Landscape - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency community approaches the 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) halving, excitement builds not just for the potential effects on Bitcoin's price, but also for the broader implications for the market, including Ethereum (ETH) and emerging assets like Furrever Token (FURR) . This particular halving event, set for April 2024, coincides with significant market developments, notably the rise of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which could reshape investment strategies and market liquidity. Bitcoin's upcoming halving will reduce the reward for mining transactions by half, potentially constricting supply and influencing prices in a market that has already seen Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others like Furrever Token, make substantial gains. The interplay between these factors and the new dynamic introduced by ETFs could lead to unprecedented outcomes in the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving: A New Chapter in Crypto With the Rise of ETFs\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) community is poised on the brink of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, an event that could catalyze the cryptocurrency landscape. Scheduled for April 2024, this halving is not just another cycle in Bitcoin's existence but may mark a significant turning point for broader crypto adoption. Unlike previous halvings, the upcoming event coincides with the emergence of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), introducing a dynamic that could reshape market reactions post-halving.\n\nBitcoin's supply is finite, capped at 21 million coins. Every four years, the Bitcoin network undergoes a 'halving' where the block rewards given to miners are reduced by half. This mechanism decreases the rate at which new bitcoins are created, aiming to prevent inflation and preserve scarcity. Historically, each halving event has led to considerable bullish trends in Bitcoin\u2019s price. For example, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price escalated from around $12 to over $1,000 within a year. Similar patterns followed the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with prices peaking at around $20,000 and over $60,000, respectively.\n\nWhile past performance due to halving is notable, it's crucial to recognize that these price surges also aligned with significant global economic events, such as the European debt crisis, the ICO boom, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events underscore the influence of broader economic contexts on Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior, indicating that halving impacts are intertwined with global economic health and investor sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2024 halving introduces a novel factor that could significantly influence Bitcoin's market dynamics\u2014the approval and operation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These financial products allow a wider range of investors to engage with Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency handling, potentially enhancing mainstream adoption. The first quarter following the introduction of these ETFs saw about $12.1 billion in total inflows, suggesting a strong demand for Bitcoin through this new investment avenue.\n\nThe presence of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially absorb some of the post-halving sell pressure typically expected from miners reducing their holdings due to lower block rewards. By offering a new route for capital inflow into the Bitcoin market, ETFs provide a buffer against the volatility usually associated with reduced miner income.\n\nAs the 2024 halving approaches, the interplay between reduced miner rewards and the influx of funds via ETFs could mirror yet another halving effect, softening potential price drops and supporting gradual price increases. This synergy between ETF adoption and evolving market structures lays a robust foundation for Bitcoin's sustained rise, potentially influencing the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market matures, the 2024 Bitcoin halving emerges as a pivotal event, augmented by the integration of ETFs into the market structure. For investors and market participants, understanding these shifts is crucial. Staying informed and adaptable will be key in navigating the intricacies of this halving event, enabling stakeholders to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potential challenges. In this evolving narrative, Bitcoin not only retains its status as the leading cryptocurrency but also demonstrates its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing financial landscape.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Dips Below the $3,200 Mark as Whales and Institutions Offload Holdings\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing significant selling pressure, exacerbated by large-scale dispositions from whales and key institutional players. As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, with over $900 million in liquidations recorded in the last 24 hours, Ethereum has not been spared, seeing its price struggle to maintain support levels.\n\nRecently, Ethereum's price momentarily dipped below the $3,200 mark to reach $3,161 before recovering slightly to hover around the $3,280 level, marking a 5.62% decrease within a single day. This volatility has been partly attributed to substantial sales by major Ethereum holders. According to data from Lookonchain, four significant entities offloaded a total of 31,683 ETH, worth approximately $106 million, contributing to the downward pressure on prices.\n\nThe transactions involved well-known entities in the crypto space:\n\n- Cumberland deposited 17,206 ETH onto exchanges, valued at around $57.3 million.\n\n- Wallet address 0xC3f8 moved 7,976 ETH to Binance, totaling about $26.6 million.\n\n- Wallet 0x1717 transferred 4,000 ETH, worth approximately $13.32 million, to various trading platforms.\n\n- Alameda/FTX was reported to have moved 2,500 ETH to Binance, which amounts to roughly $8.33 million.\n\nThese moves reflect a broader trend of large-scale Ethereum sales, which can significantly impact the market due to the substantial volumes involved.\n\nThe continuous flow of ETH to exchanges suggests that the selling pressure may not abate soon. Another report from Whale Alert highlighted an additional transfer of $158 million worth of Ethereum to Binance by an unknown wallet, indicating the potential for further sell-offs in the open market.\n\nAside from market actions, Ethereum is grappling with several ecosystem challenges that may be influencing investor sentiment negatively. Recent developments have cast doubt on the prospects for an Ethereum ETF, as regulatory and market hurdles continue to loom large. This uncertainty, combined with the active shedding of assets by major stakeholders like Alameda/FTX, suggests a tough road ahead for Ethereum.\n\nAs Ethereum navigates through these turbulent market conditions, the community and potential investors are closely monitoring these developments. The influx of large volumes of ETH onto exchanges and the accompanying sell-off activities by prominent institutional players are crucial factors that market participants will need to consider. These dynamics are pivotal in shaping Ethereum's short-term price movements and broader market standing amidst an already volatile financial landscape.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Presale Exceeds $780,000\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is swiftly making its mark as a distinguished investment in the vibrant cryptocurrency market, drawing significant interest for its robust growth potential and appealing investor opportunities. Demonstrating outstanding success through its presale events, FURR has consistently attracted substantial investments. Presently in its sixth presale phase, the token has successfully raised over $780,000, illustrating its escalating popularity and the strong endorsement it enjoys from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFURR positions itself as an exceptionally attractive investment by offering the potential for investors to achieve up to 15X returns from each presale stage. Currently priced at $0.00048, the token presents an opportune entry point for investors looking to leverage its projected growth.\n\nThe token's appeal is further reinforced by the robust community support it commands.

        "title": "Which Crypto to Buy in 2024: Navigating Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Furrever Token (FURR) Market Trends - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the tumultuous sea of cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum (ETH) has recently demonstrated remarkable volatility, swiftly rebounding from a sharp drop to stabilize at a higher level, capturing the attention of both seasoned traders and crypto whales. This event underscores the persistent dynamism and significant capital movements within the crypto market. Concurrently, Dogecoin (DOGE) enjoys a hopeful rally, buoyed by broader market optimism and speculative interest ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Amidst these established giants, Furrever Token (FURR) continues to carve out its niche, showing impressive presale momentum and drawing substantial investments from a growing community of supporters. These developments highlight the ongoing activities and strategic plays in the cryptocurrency space, driven by key events and whale movements that often dictate market directions.\n\nWhales on the Move as Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds From $3,400\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently undergone a dramatic 24-hour period of trading that saw its price experiencing significant volatility. Initially, the cryptocurrency suffered a sharp 3.1% decline, dropping to $3,411, which led to the liquidation of tens of millions of dollars worth of positions within just an hour. However, not long after this steep drop, Ethereum saw a robust recovery, reaching a high of $3,615 before settling at $3,512 by the end of the day. Despite these substantial fluctuations, Ethereum's price remained essentially flat over the course of the 24-hour trading period.\n\nDuring this period of intense trading, the activities of major cryptocurrency investors, often referred to as 'crypto whales', were particularly noteworthy. According to a report from Spot On Chain, one such whale, known by the identifier \"0x347\", made a significant move by depositing 9,000 ETH into Binance. This deposit, valued at approximately $32 million, stands as the largest ETH deposit by this entity to date. After this transaction, \"0x347\" is now in possession of 29,738 ETH, which has an approximate market value of $106 million and has accrued an estimated profit of $68.5 million.\n\nIn addition, other reports by Lookonchain highlighted contrasting activities from another whale who took advantage of the market's dip to acquire 10,309 ETH, worth around $35.82 million. This purchase was part of a broader strategy that included a considerable investment just before a significant rise in Bitcoin's value on April 8.\n\nThe diverging actions of these major Ethereum holders reflect the mixed sentiments and strategies within the market regarding the short-term direction of Ethereum's price. While some see the recovery as a bullish sign indicating potential for further upward movement, others remain skeptical, viewing the rebound as merely a technical correction rather than the start of a sustained upward trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Ethereum constantly at the center of market speculation and analysis, the differing approaches of significant market players highlight the speculative and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to evolve, it remains a focal point for both opportunity and caution within the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 6% as Market Outlook Stays Hopeful\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), the leader among the world's meme cryptocurrencies, has experienced a surge, climbing 6% in the last 24 hours to reach $0.203. This increase comes amidst a broader wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market, spurred by the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. However, the excitement was short-lived as Dogecoin's price dipped to $0.192, culminating in a weekly gain of 3.2% and a monthly rise of 9.85%. Despite these fluctuations, Dogecoin maintains its status as the largest meme coin by market capitalization.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Dogecoin's current market position is that it trades at a considerable discount, 73% below its all-time high of $0.7316. This significant gap suggests potential undervaluation, fueling speculations that Dogecoin might be poised for substantial gains in the near future, especially as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\nMarket analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin's trajectory, predicting potential price increases leading up to the halving event slated for April 20th. This event is anticipated not only to impact Bitcoin but to have a ripple effect across various digital currencies, potentially ushering in another bull market.\n\nThe technical indicators on Dogecoin\u2019s price chart reinforce this optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), after peaking at 70, has seen a slight retreat, expected to stabilize around 60 or 55, suggesting that any declines might be short-lived and followed by further gains.\n\nAdditionally, trading volumes for Dogecoin have shown remarkable growth, with a 13% increase from the previous day, reaching around $2.52 billion. This heightened activity is indicative of growing investor interest, further evidenced by substantial purchases by whales on various trading platforms in recent days.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a strong likelihood that Dogecoin will experience significant price movements one or two more times before the Bitcoin halving event. This period could be critical for investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated market dynamics. As always, while the potential for high returns exists, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments calls for caution and thorough analysis before making any financial commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Near %200 Return Still Possible\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is rapidly gaining traction as a standout investment in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, capturing widespread interest due to its impressive growth potential and lucrative opportunities for investors. Demonstrating remarkable success across its presale phases, FURR has consistently drawn significant investments. Currently, in its sixth presale phase, the token has accumulated over $780,000, underscoring its popularity and the strong backing it has garnered from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nOffering investors the potential to achieve up to 15X returns from each presale phase, FURR positions itself as an exceptionally appealing investment within the crypto realm. Priced at just $0.00048, it offers an accessible entry point for investors keen on capitalizing on its expected growth trajectory.\n\nThe token's allure is further bolstered by the robust community support it enjoys. With over 4,300 active members on its official Telegram channel, FURR is at the heart of a vibrant hub for discussions, collaboration, and regular updates, which enriches the investment experience for its community members.\n\nLooking to the future, FURR\u2019s strategic roadmap and developmental initiatives indicate a strong commitment to achieving a dominant position within the meme coin sector. The team behind FURR plans to implement novel features, forge strategic partnerships, and engage in targeted marketing efforts, all designed to enhance its adoption and increase its value in the market.\n\nIn essence, Furrever Token presents a compelling investment proposition, backed by solid fundamentals, an active and engaged community, and a promising outlook for substantial growth. As FURR continues to progress towards achieving its strategic goals, it is well-placed to provide significant returns to early investors tapping into its potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Robert Smith support(at)furrevertoken.com https://furrevertoken.com/\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs can be tapped by developers to increase privacy and improve scalability.\n\nRead more: What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?\n\nAs a result of the mainnet launch, OKX\u2019s 50 million users globally can withdraw tokens from the exchange and onto its Ethereum-linked layer 2 if they want to transact onchain \u2014 including interacting with decentralized applications (DAPPs).\n\nOKX\u2019s platform token, OKB, used to pay network gas fees, increased 14% in the last 24 hours to trade at $59.15, data from CoinGecko shows. The move comes as OKX, which holds over $22 billion in crypto custody, has become the third-largest exchange by 24-hour trading volume with over $5.2 billion, behind only Binance and Bybit.\n\nThe public mainnet launch of X Layer follows in the footsteps of crypto exchanges Bybit and Coinbase releasing their own layer 2 blockchain network, Mantle and Base, respectively. Each has the aim of onboarding millions of people onchain.\n\nPolygon\u2019s CEO Marc Boiron, told Unchained that more crypto exchanges would be using the Polygon CDK to build out their own layer 2 networks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously some level of \u2018Hey, Base is doing this, and we see Bybit doing this,\u2019 but I think a lot of this is really just a big opportunity that exists and specifically in this ecosystem, where with Polygon you have the AggLayer that connects it all,\u201d Boiron said.\n\nX Layer plugs into Polygon\u2019s AggLayer, a protocol that enables an aggregated blockchain ecosystem to unify various layer 2 networks and allow users to move assets across chains.\n\n\u201cX Layer\u2019s connection to the AggLayer solves the fragmentation of liquidity and users across chains on the AggLayer so they can all grow together,\u201d Boiron said in an additional statement. \u201cOKX\u2019s 50M users now have an easy path to onboarding to X Layer and all the other chains connected to the AggLayer.\u201d"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto exchange OKX announced Monday that its Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling network, X Layer, has entered public mainnet\u2014becoming the latest name-brand blockchain to offer crypto users faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum's own mainnet.\n\nBuilt using the Polygon CDK, OKX\u2019s X Layer is also one of the first to take advantage of Polygon\u2019s so-called AggLayer. Unveiled by Polygon in January, the solution looks to make many different blockchains feel as if they are one through a shared network state and liquidity that lets funds seamlessly flow from one network to the next.\n\n\u201cWe are building an ecosystem that is as seamless and interoperable as possible,\u201d OKX\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in a statement, adding that \u201cX Layer has limitless potential thanks to [OKX\u2019s] strong community.\u201d\n\nThe Singapore-based exchange, which has over 50 million users globally, is one of crypto\u2019s largest by trading volume. Over the past day, OKX has seen $4.9 billion worth of crypto change hands\u2014more than the $4 billion in trading volume registered meanwhile at Coinbase, America\u2019s leading crypto exchange, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimilar to OKX\u2019s embrace of Polygon\u2019s tech, Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 network Base is built using the OP Stack from Optimism, a toolkit from another popular Ethereum layer-2 network. Since launching last July, Base has attracted around 8 million users while processing 154 million total transactions, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nIn addition to cheap transactions, layer-2 networks make interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) more feasible for users because they cost less to use. Through X Layer, users have access to 170 dapps, which is \u201cslated to increase exponentially,\u201d OKX said in a statement.\n\nAs of now, notable dapps released on X Layer include the decentralized exchange QuickSwap, community-building platform Galxe, and the infrastructure platform Thirdweb.\n\nOne noticeable difference between Base and Layer X is the latter network\u2019s embrace of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. Allowing someone to prove that a statement is true without divulging the statement itself, the concept in cryptography is core to Polygon\u2019s updated architecture and a vision for greater interoperability across chains.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cX Layer is a monumental next step in the industry's ambition to build a truly unified Web3,\u201d Polygon CEO Marc Boiron said in a statement. \u201cThe X Layer\u2019s connection to the AggLayer solves the fragmentation of liquidity and users across chains.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum Price : Will ETH Price Recover In 2024 ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has been facing challenges in holding onto its top spot in the market among altcoins. The bears causing the global cryptocurrency market decline are also dominating ETH. After dropping more than 11% in the last month, it appears the coin is loosing ground to Bitcoin. With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon for April 20, 2024, the crypto community is eagerly anticipating whether the price of Ethereum will see a rebound. Let\u2019s explore thoroughly to discover the potential.\n\nMarket Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum experienced a 5.19% drop in its price, falling to $3,086.39. The significant drop in its market performance has also been highlighted by the significant decrease of ETH, by 14.27% and 11.36% in the last week and month respectively.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum holds the title of the second largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $371.15 billion. Moreover, the coin experienced a drop of around 5.86% in its trading volume, reaching $21.77 billion, in the last 24 hours. This decrease shows lower liquidity and trader interest in the coin.\n\nETH price reached its highest point at $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021. After that, Ethereum has experienced a decrease of around 36.67% reaching the current price.\n\nFactors Determining the Recovery of Ethereum Price\n\nVarious factors play a role in the recovery of ETH price as discussed below.\n\n1. Bitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin Halving might also impact the rise in ETH trading price. The event that takes place after every four years, has a notable effect on the cryptocurrency market. It could impact the Ethereum (ETH) price in different ways. Initially, the halving decreases the amount of new coins being introduced into circulation. This limited availability may result in higher demand as investors look to spread out their investments. If the price of Bitcoin increases after the halving, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are expected to also see price hikes because of the increased interest in the market.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin halvings result in excitement and speculation within the investment community. This feeling can also affect other cryptocurrencies. Anticipating positive impacts from Bitcoin halving, individuals might choose to invest in other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, leading to an increase in their value.\n\n2. Ethereum ETFs\n\nIncreased attention from institutional investors and major companies in Ethereum may bring stability and boost the price. The potential launch of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May, 2024 could lead to a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value, similar to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs. However, analysts are concerned about the SEC approval process, with the likelihood decreasing from 70% to 30% due to a lack of communication from regulators. Investors should be cautious about expectations surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\n3. General Cryptocurrency Market Recovery\n\nA recovery in the cryptocurrency market can result in Ethereum\u2019s price bounce due to various factors. Firstly, as investor confidence grows with the market\u2019s rebound, more individuals are likely to invest in Ethereum. Secondly, renewed capital inflows into cryptocurrencies typically include Ethereum due to its reputation and use cases. Additionally, Ethereum often follows Bitcoin\u2019s trends, so when Bitcoin\u2019s price rises during a market recovery, Ethereum\u2019s price also tends to increase. Moreover, market liquidity and trading volume can rise during a recovery, leading to smoother price movements and potential upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price. Furthermore, increased interest in blockchain technology and decentralized applications can drive further demand for Ethereum. Institutional investors may also be attracted to Ethereum during a recovery, contributing to its price growth.\n\n4. ETH\u2019s Price Forecast\n\nBoth the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) show that short-term periods of 10, 20, and 30 days are signaling a bearish trend based on technical indicators. The Ethereum price is below thes moving averages, showing the possibility of a price drop in the short-term.\n\nSimilarly the EMA and SMA for extended durations like 50, 100, and 200 days are also indicating a downward trend. indicating a bearish direction. The current price of ETH is below these moving averages, showing that the overall price movement of Ethereum remains bearish.\n\nThe MACD with 12 and 26 periods is giving a Buy signal, suggesting a possible short-term turnaround.\n\nThe MACD, which is a momentum indicator, calculates the variance between two moving averages, and the Buy signal could indicate a slight move towards an upward trend for ETH.\n\nHowever, there is a Sell signal shown by the EMA across different time periods, ranging from 10 days to 200 days. This indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price might keep experiencing downward pressure in the near to medium future. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 37.6 is in the neutral range. It indicates that ETH\u2019s price is neither overbought or oversold, suggesting there may be potential for a price reversal if the RSI moves further towards either extreme.\n\nOn the downside, should the price of ETH, it will find support at $2698.5. Should the decline further past the level, it will find another key level at $2698.5. Any more losses might see the price drop further to $2361.2\n\nIf the bulls fail to protect the $2698.5 support, the price might decline toward $2361.2.\n\nOn the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $3581.4 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the 3789.7 level. A clear move above this level of resistance could send the price toward $4127.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite facing hurdles and declines, Ethereum price shows indications of potential recovery and opportunities for a comeback. The future Bitcoin halving and possible introduction of Ethereum ETFs may have a positive effect on the price of Ethereum. Moreover, the collective rebound of the crypto market could help reverse the direction of Ethereum\u2019s price movement. Investors need to monitor important support and resistance levels, alongside changes in technical indicators like RSI, EMA, and MACD, to detect any shifts in momentum. Ultimately, Ethereum\u2019s future success will be influenced by various factors, making it crucial for investors to remain informed and prudent."

Stuck in the lower section of the market range between $61,970 and $73,122, where selling pressure climaxed and buying pressure peaked, respectively, the odds favor the bears.\n\nFor starters, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the \u201850\u2019 mean level with an overall southbound inclination. This, coupled with the position of both the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in negative territory reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nWhile a retest of the $61,970 base is likely, the dire case could see Bitcoin price go as low as the $60,000 psychological level before a pullback.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a show of strength by BTC bulls could see Bitcoin price reclaim above the bullish trendline, confirmed by a flip of the 50% Fibonacci placeholder into support above $67,546. This could draw more bulls to the scene, sending BTC price above the $69,000 threshold. In a highly bullish case, BTC could reclaim the $73,777 all-time high before an attempt at further upside.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price unable to tag $67K despite Hong Kong BTC and ETH spot ETF approvals\n\nEthereum price works out a bullish reversal, but BTC won\u2019t let it happen\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal pattern. Contingent on whether BTC shows strength or crashes further, ETH price could respond in kind. A show of strength could send Ethereum price higher. A breach of the upper boundary of the governing chart pattern above the $3,750 level would signal the opening of a long position.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with the broader market still in the red, Ethereum price could continue the fall below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $3,023. A candlestick close below $2,750 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales pushes its price up as Hong Kong approves spot ETH ETF\n\nRipple price next move hinges on RSI bounce\n\nRipple price could have more downside momentum to come amid growing overhead pressure due to the 50, 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) at $0.6094, $0.5754, and $0.5837, respectively.\n\nWith the RSI well below 50 and the MACD and AO in negative territory, XRP price could slide to $0.4500. Even worse, it could establish a lower low below the April 13 bottom, tagging the $0.4000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, traders buying the correction could bode well for Ripple price. While a move above the $0.6000 psychological level would be ideal, the bearish thesis would only be invalidated upon a candlestick close above $0.6685. Traders should watch for the RSI bouncing above the 30 threshold for possible entry.\n\nAlso Read: XRP recovers from weekend massive decline after developers propose native lending on XRP Ledger"

        "content": "Solowin Holdings\n\nHONG KONG, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SOLOWIN HOLDINGS (Nasdaq: SWIN) (\u201cSOLOWIN\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a securities brokerage company that offers comprehensive financial services primarily to Chinese investors, today announced that Solomon JFZ (Asia) Holdings Limited, its operating subsidiary, has been selected as one of the three participating dealers for Harvest Global\u2019s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Hong Kong.

        "content": "GM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nThe restaking rush continues with EigenLayer and Karak launches.\n\nUpgradable code costs Blast DeFi users $26 million.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d says Vitalik Buterin after using Tornado Cash alternative Railgun.\n\nKarak challenges EigenLayer in restaking race\n\nEigenLayer just hit a new milestone on its restaking road map, letting those who have deposited tokens to the protocol delegate them to node operators.\n\nNode operators are individuals or organizations that let users delegate their restaked Ether to them. They then opt in to provide actively validated services, which earn delegates a boosted yield on their restaked Ether.\n\nDelegated tokens will secure EigenDA, the first of many protocols expected to benefit from restaking on Ethereum. However, restakers will have to wait a few more weeks to start earning boosted yields.\n\nAnd EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only one. Karak, EigenLayer\u2019s main competitor, has launched private access, letting those with an invite start to restake on the protocol.\n\nSo far, Karak has drawn in $195 million in deposits \u2014 still far below EigenLayer\u2019s $12.6 billion.\n\nLike EigenLayer, Karak has launched its own points system, called Karak XP.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPoints systems usually indicate a DeFi protocol is planning to launch and airdrop a token.\n\nWith two restaking protocols offering potential airdrops, whichever one announces a token first should receive a big boost from the attention.\n\nPac Finance users lose $26 million in seconds\n\nA sudden, unexpected code change at Blast lending protocol Pac Finance cost users $26 million, highlighting the risks of upgradable smart contract code.\n\n\u201cThis was a result of the liquidation threshold being altered unexpectedly without prior notification to our team,\u201d Pac Finance said on X.\n\nPac Finance is a fork of Aave, the biggest lending protocol in DeFi.\n\nA fork is where a developer team uses the open-source code from an existing DeFi protocol to launch a similar protocol \u2014 often on a different blockchain or with minor changes.\n\n\u201cFundamental problem with forking code is the lack of in-depth knowledge of the software and the parameters,\u201d Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Avara, the company behind the Aave protocol, said in an X post.\n\nThe incident highlights the risk of upgradable code in DeFi protocols. If a protocol chooses to keep its code upgradable, those with permission can change the rules that govern the protocol at any time \u2014 often without warning.\n\nNot all DeFi protocols allow for code upgrades. Uniswap, Curve Finance, and many other protocols make their code immutable, meaning once it\u2019s deployed on a blockchain, it cannot be retroactively changed.\n\nVitalik on privacy protocol Railgun\n\n\u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in an X post on Monday, responding to the fact that he had just transferred 100 ETH \u2014 worth about $310,000 \u2014 through privacy protocol Railgun.\n\nPrivacy is normal.\n\n\n\nRailgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.https://t.co/MG0huDzpAu \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 15, 2024\n\nPrivacy is normal.\n\n\n\nRailgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.https://t.co/MG0huDzpAu \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 15, 2024\n\nRailgun is similar to sanctioned protocol Tornado Cash in that both allow users to break the chain of traceability between blockchain transactions.\n\nHowever, Railgun uses the Privacy Pool protocol, an idea put forward in an academic paper co-authored by Buterin in September.\n\nPrivacy Pools tries to solve the issues with Tornado Cash \u2014 namely that it has facilitated an estimated $1.2 billion worth of illicit transactions for criminal organisations such as North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group.\n\nIt lets honest users create a cryptographic proof that shows the money they put into the protocol didn\u2019t come from wallets associated with stolen funds or illicit activity, while at the same time keeping the origin of the money secret.\n\nThe hope is that if all honest users generate these proofs, bad actors attempting to launder money through the protocol will be the only ones left without them, letting crypto exchanges and law enforcement identify and exclude these users.\n\nData of the week \u2014 Railgun overview\n\nPrivacy protocol Railgun\u2019s popularity has grown, even before Buterin mentioned it in his X post.\n\nRailgun has facilitated almost $1 billion in transaction volume since its launch in May 2022.\n\nrailgun Railgun is processing more transaction volume in recent months.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano has witnessed a substantial drop to the $0.4 region, suppressing the price by over 20%. Despite the dip, the ascent suggests a potential rally through the 200 EMA, challenging the downtrend with limited volatility and apathetic trade volume.\n\nCardano's price action has been a roller coaster, with its recent plunge to the $0.4 support level and a subsequent bounce back. At the time of writing, ADA has seen its value soar above $0.48, instilling a fresh wave of inflows into the market.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the descent has not influenced the coin\u2019s longer-term trend, which has been bearish with an absence of significant volume \u2014 a hint that the market is still in search of a solid direction. However, the surge above the 200 EMA will push the coin into the bullish zone once again.\n\nIf ADA fails, the $0.4 level remains a crucial bastion of support, and its endurance will be critical in preventing further declines. However, if the marketwide recovery continues, there is a good possibility of a prolonged continuation of the rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu takes hit\n\nShiba Inu has seen a sharp 30% decline. But one way or another, the only question in most holders' minds is: \"Will Shiba Inu really recover?\"\n\nThe token's dip to the $0.00002165 mark has been met with a mixture of concern and anticipation. A rebound from this level could signal a strong support base, potentially pivoting SHIB back into an uptrend.\n\nAs for the chart, the Bollinger Bands have been preceding the drop as their narrowing was a strong signal of an upcoming price surge. Now, with SHIB having slipped below the crucial 50-day moving average, the only thing left is to wait for a return above this aforementioned level.\n\nThe trading activity is pretty quiet, which shows that people are not too confident about SHIB right now. The RSI is suggesting that selling pressure prevailed over buys on the market, pushing the value of the token down.\n\nSHIB will face its first big test at the $0.00002880 level. If it can go beyond that, we might see the price move up toward $0.00003.\n\nAs for what's next for SHIB, it is really tough to say, considering the lack of fundamental development around Shiba Inu. However, there is always the possibility of a further price reversal and the return of the buying power on the market in general, which is going to push the value of tokens like Shiba Inu further up - especially if the risk appetite among investors returns.\n\nEthereum's comeback\n\nEthereum has made a strong and sufficient comeback, easily returning above the $3,000 threshold. The pivot suggests that Ethereum could continue its path upward despite this minor setback.\n\nFollowing the dip that moved the market, the price action has been affirmative, reclaiming the $3,000 mark with conviction. This level now forms a bedrock of support, cementing the current price range.\n\nSpecifically, the key support at approximately $2,700 is highlighted, a level where the asset has previously beaten the substantial buying pressure. The resistance can be found around the $3,600 zone.\n\nAs the price started rising, the volume started moving up, showing a lot of interest on the market. This rise in trading, along with the clear increase in price, has helped the upward trend to gain strength.\n\nThe intersection of technical indicators with market sentiment heralds a bullish scenario, where the previous peak at approximately $3,950 is not unreal.\n\nHowever, the most recent surge of volatility on the market might not go unnoticed, and it is important to avoid any risky moves that might drastically affect your portfolio."

        "content": "The past week witnessed a significant downturn in Bitcoin\u2019s weekly inflow, which dwindled to $126 million amidst heightened market volatility. This decline was largely influenced by the prevailing uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin halving and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. These factors collectively exerted notable selling pressure, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to plummet to a low plummet to a low of $61,600. The ripple effect extended to major altcoins, exacerbating the correction across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 latest report provided insights into the evolving landscape, particularly highlighting Bitcoin\u2019s cooling inflow compared to previous weeks. This contrast indicates a subtle retreat in investor participation, reflecting a degree of apprehension in the market. Conversely, Ethereum continued to face challenges, marking its 5th consecutive week of outflows, with $29 million exiting the market. These trends underscore the volatility and uncertainty prevailing within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, necessitating caution and strategic decision-making among investors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRegional Disparities and Investment Trends\n\nRegional disparities were evident in cryptocurrency investment trends, with the US witnessing the largest outflows totaling $145 million, followed closely by Switzerland and Canada. Despite these outflows, Germany emerged as a notable exception, capitalizing on recent price weakness as an opportunity for investment, with $29 million in inflows. This divergence highlights varying investor sentiments and strategies across different regions in response to market conditions.\n\nDespite Bitcoin experiencing outflows amounting to $110 million last week, it maintained positive inflows month-to-date, showcasing resilience amidst market turbulence. Furthermore, while altcoins, excluding Solana, exhibited positive performance, with lesser-known names like Decentraland, Basic Attention Token, and LIDO attracting inflows, suggesting diversification strategies among investors seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Ordinals Hints At Comeback Amid Bitcoin Halving And Runes Protocol Launch\n\nDigital Asset Investment Products and Investor Sentiment\n\nDigital asset investment products faced minor outflows totaling $126 million last week, indicating a degree of caution prevailing among investors amid stalled positive price momentum. This cautious sentiment was further reflected in the drop in ETF activity relative to the overall market, underscoring investor hesitancy in committing to cryptocurrency assets.\n\nHowever, amidst this cautious sentiment, short-bitcoin broke its 3-week spell of outflows, garnering minor inflows of $1.7 million. This move suggests a strategic response from investors possibly seeking to capitalize on recent price weakness and market fluctuations.\n\nAlso Read: Germany\u2019s Biggest Federal Bank Partners Bitpanda To Offer Crypto Custody\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Hong Kong has approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) applications. The region is the second to do so in 2024, following the SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) historic decision to approve 11 spot BTC ETFs in the US. However, although the US has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, the country has yet to greenlight an Ethereum ETF. According to some analysts, a spot ETH ETF could be approved in the US later this year.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 Hong Kong approves spot #Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF application. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 15, 2024\n\nAlso Read: 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Before They Hit the Big Post Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe approval of spot ETH and BTC ETFs may lead to another rally for the cryptocurrency markets. The US spot BTC ETFs played a significant role in BTC hitting a new all-time high earlier this year. BTC hit $73,737 in early March with a rally fuelled by increased inflows into spot BTC ETFs.\n\nWill Bitcoin and Ethereum rally after the ETF approval in Hong Kong?\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nGiven that the US spot BTC ETFs were responsible for BTC hitting a new all-time high, there is a high probability that a similar pattern will unfold after the Hong Kong approvals.\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, Bitcoin (BTC) will reclaim its all-time high later this month. Moreover, the platform anticipates BTC to continue on a bullish trajectory for the next few weeks, predicting it to hit $85,906 on May 13, 2024. Hitting $85,906 from current levels would translate to a growth of about 32%.\n\nOn the other hand, CoinCodex anticipates Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price to consolidate at around current levels, predicting it to trade at $3242.95 on May 1, 2024.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) halving just around the corner, we may witness another massive rally in the crypto market. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit new all-time highs, fuelled by the Hong Kong spot ETFs and BTC\u2019s halving later this month."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has fallen following recent crypto liquidations this week. While most outflows can be attributed to the general market sentiment, institutional funds play a major role in the asset\u2019s wider acceptance.\n\nThis year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs which saw an inflow of traditional investors in the market. Spot ETFs also gave the asset more legitimacy amid initial fears and uncertain regulation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpot ETFs rallied the market pushing the price of the asset to an all-time high above $72,000 with bulls making higher projections. These inflows to Bitcoin and crypto assets turned institutional investors to Ethereum.\n\nReduced Institutional Flows\n\nThe clamor for a spot in Ethereum ETF garnered steam this year after multiple filings to the SEC. Institutional investors see the staking feature of Ethereum as a bullish driver for the asset price. Secondly, being the largest smart contract network, on-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) activities will surge the asset\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, the price of the assets has plummeted in recent weeks and its existing institutional products have seen sharp outflows. On April 15, a report from CoinShares showed a $22 million outflow from Ethereum last week. These flows bring total monthly exits to $51.3 million. However year-to-date flows stand at $23 million.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Last week, investors were hesitant as the positive price momentum stalled. Digital asset investment products experienced minor outflows, totalling US$126m.

Bitcoin\u2019s AUM soared with its price in Q4 2023 while Ethereum\u2019s products are at $13.8 billion despite widespread anticipations.\n\nEthereum Price To Recover?\n\nThe price of Ethereum is down due to macroeconomic factors and reduced sentiment but institutional flows have contributed to the status quo. At press time, Ethereum price is at $3,052, a 13% drop this week and 15% this month.\n\nBulls maintain optimism of a possible run should spot Ethereum ETF get approval in the United States. Similarly, a general market uptrend will boost institutional inflows in Ethereum because of a ripple effect in decentralized finance activities.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Wins The Bear War, Enters In Top 5 Cryptocurrencies: What\u2019s Next?\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "The token\u2019s value increased, and so did ETH.\n\nRNDR\u2019s popularity grew among traders, suggesting a significant price hike in the long term.\n\nRender [RNDR], the native token of the distributed GPU network built on Ethereum [ETH] jumped by an incredible 18.85% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis performance made RNDR one of the top assets with the best recovery rate after the broader market experienced a drawdown. Interestingly, the bounce happened as ETH itself was able to reclaim $3,000 and rise above it.\n\nHowever, there were other reasons the price of RNDR increased. The first thing AMBCrypto noticed was the increase in social dominance.\n\nDid ETH \u201cRender\u201d help?\n\nAnalyzing data from LunarCrush, we observed that Render\u2019s social dominance increased by a mind-blowing 116% within the same timeframe the value skyrocketed.\n\nThe increase in social dominance implied that the project\u2019s popularity among traders surged. From our findings, traders were attracted to RNDR because of its fundamentals.\n\nAnyone conversant with the market would have observed that many market participants are bullish on projects with the DePIN narrative. DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.\n\nIn the crypto space, projects built around this narrative like Render, use tokens to incentivize holders who utilize the protocol.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto observed another proof of the interest in RNDR. This time, it was the trading volume. According to Santiment, Render\u2019s trading volume rose to 556.65 million on the 14th of April.\n\nThis increase represented a 37.72% jump from the value on the 13th. However, the volume decreased slightly at press time, indicating that RNDR might not have a solid backing to continue its upswing.\n\nSentiment stays the same\n\nDespite RNDR\u2019s potential, it seemed traders were not yet convinced about its short-term performance. This was evident from the Weighted Sentiment analyzed on-chain.\n\nThe metric tracks the average positive or negative comment about a project. If the reading is positive, it means most market participants have a bullish view. On the other hand, a negative reading suggests a bearish perception.\n\nAt press time, Render\u2019s Weighted Sentiment was -0.45. With this position, demand for RNDR might decrease in the short term. Should this be the case, the price of the token might fall below $9.\n\nBut that does invalidate the long-term optimism around the project. AMBCrypto concluded this after checking the amount of holders.\n\nOn the 25th of March, the total amount of RNDR holders was less than 80,000. However, that figure had increased to 85,600 at press time.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s RNDR\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nAn increase in the number of holders was a sign of traction on the network and adoption of the token. If this continues, RNDR\u2019s price could head to new highs.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there might be corrections in the process. But as long as the DePIN narrative remains relevant in the market, the token might be destined for a higher value."

        "content": "Solana has rapidly gained attention in the crypto market due to its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability, setting it apart from Ethereum and other blockchains. These attributes make Solana a promising alternative for developers and users looking for a low-cost and fast trading experience.\n\nSolana and its community members are optimistic about the future trajectory of the project due to network developments. Ethereum has also undergone several updates in recent weeks. This article will discuss the current developments in the Solana and Ethereum networks and their market performance to access the next leading token in the upcoming bull market.\n\nSolana rolls out v1.17.31 update to solve congestion issues\n\nSolana (SOL) has been among the list of top-performing cryptocurrencies recently. With massive on-chain activity and transactions, the Solana blockchain has witnessed network outages several times indicating its expanding user base and market traction. With the launch of new meme coins, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has surged to $1B again.\n\nTo overcome the congestion issues to hold large transactional activity on the Solana blockchain, Solana developers rolled out a network upgrade, version 1.18.11 on the devnet. After this initial step, on April 15, Solana announced the deployment of version 1.17.31 on the mainnet affirming improvements aimed at eliminating existing congestion issues until the official release of version 1.18 on the mainnet.\n\n.@Solana MainnetBeta validators: the v1.17.31 release is now recommended for general use. This patch contains enhancements which will help alleviate some of the ongoing network congestion, and will be followed by further enhancements in v1.18.

With the potential to surpass $8000 in the upcoming bull market, investors show optimism toward Ethereum\u2019s trajectory. According to reports, whale transactions recorded $278 million worth of ETH tokens across various wallets.\n\nDespite the recent 8% correction in the $ETH price (24H), whales are still buying $ETH! 1.

Moreover, Puffer Finance, a liquid staking project built on Ethereum\u2019s restaking protocol has secured $18 million in funding to launch its mainnet. This technology allows Ethereum validators to reduce their capital requirement to just 1 ETH, significantly lower than the previous 32 ETH requirement.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum\n\nWhile both Ethereum and Solana are leading figures in the DeFi space, Solana has the potential to outperform Ethereum in the upcoming bull run. This is not historically impossible as Solana surpassed Ethereum in DEX volume amid the recent meme rally, a significant milestone for its ecosystem and community.\n\nWhile Both these legacy projects compete for the leading position, market analysts project another emerging deFi project which can outpace Ethereum due to massive potential much faster than Solana. DTX Exchange is a hybrid platform currently in its presale which is set to moonshot once it goes live in the main market.\n\nDTX Exchange is ready to lead the deFi space with $230k raised in presale\n\nThe emerging 1000x leverage platform, DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to revolutionize trading and investment with unprecedented trading features. The platform maximizes the profit margins and provides accessible trading to empower early traders.\n\nThe platform offers distributive liquidity pools to reduce slippage so investors can mitigate risks associated with concentrated liquidity, allowing trading across diverse markets including forex, crypto, equities, and CFDs.\n\nWith a robust infrastructure and unmatched security features, DTX Exchange provides an exceptional trading experience with no KYC fuss and non-custodial wallets so holders can trade freely with their digital assets across any exchange without the fear of security breach.\n\nThe crypto community eyes DTX as the next leading project in the deFi space after it raised expectations by raising $230k in public presale stage 1 within a few days.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s price saw a notable recovery on Monday after a steep decline over the past seven days. This was supported by positive developments in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets, which came alongside the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong.\n\nAdditionally, Solana addressed its ongoing network congestion issues with a new update, aiming to rectify transaction failures and outages.\n\nNew Update Tackling Implementation Bug\n\nAccording to Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, Solana\u2019s recent network congestion issues were attributed to an implementation bug rather than a fundamental design flaw. Mumtaz clarified that Solana\u2019s current predicament results from a flaw in implementing a specific protocol.\n\nAccording to Anza, a spin-off of Solana Labs, Solana has released a new update to its validator client software to combat this. The update, v1.17.31, aims to reduce network congestion and will be followed by further improvements in v1.18.\n\nAnza emphasized the update\u2019s significance, urging MainnetBeta validators to adopt it. The enhancements introduced in the update are expected to mitigate Solana\u2019s ongoing network congestion issues.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Goes Pro: UFC Winner Wants $300,000 Bonus Paid In BTC 5 months ago\n\nFurthermore, validators were advised to upgrade their systems when there is less than 5% delinquent stake, ensuring they have sufficient time to monitor the node after the upgrade.\n\nAny issues encountered during the upgrade were to be reported to \u2060mb-validators. Solana Status, a trusted source, corroborated the announcement, recommending the v1.17.31 release for general use.\n\nTrent.sol, Solana\u2019s developer and operations manager, emphasized that the effectiveness of the update would be proportional to its adoption across the network.\n\nWhile the improvements primarily target Solana\u2019s Stake Weighted Quality of Service (SWQOS) and may not result in significant changes to the reliability of unstacked Tensor processing units (TPU) traffic, Solana users were advised to keep delinquency below 5% during the upgrade process.\n\nFurthermore, Anza hinted at additional enhancements in the pipeline, urging users to stay tuned for further updates.\n\nSolana Price Rebounds With 7% Surge\n\nAfter unveiling updates to enhance network efficiency, the Solana price has surged by over 7%. This surge has helped offset the ongoing downtrend experienced by Solana, which amounted to nearly 21% over the past month.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong SFC has officially approved several spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including asset managers such as China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, HashKey Capital Limited, and an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments.\n\nThis regulatory approval has not only positively impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum but has also instilled a sense of positivity in the overall cryptocurrency market. As a result, the top 10 cryptocurrencies have witnessed significant uptrends, riding on the wave of these developments.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDespite the recent surge in Solana\u2019s price, SOL\u2019s trading volume has decreased by -44.70% in the last 24 hours, indicating a recent decline in market activity, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nSolana\u2019s current trading price of $151.40 presents the first obstacle in the cryptocurrency\u2019s path toward further price gains. If this hurdle is surpassed, the next significant resistance lies at $170, which would signify a recovery of SOL\u2019s gains recorded over the past month.\n\nOn the other hand, the $130 mark has proven to be a strong support level for Solana, representing the foundation of SOL\u2019s one-month bullish structure, which propelled its price rally to nearly three-year highs of $210 on March 18.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in Trouble: What\u2019s Going On?\n\nStory Highlights Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are down significantly, likely due to recent geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite typical pre-halving surges, the market is tumbling instead, causing investor panic and selloffs.\n\nWhile investors flee, traders are jumping in, but this doesn't indicate overall bullish sentiment.\n\nThe crypto world is once again engulfed in a downward spiral, with major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing significant losses. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 5% in the past day, while Ethereum\u2019s decrease exceeds 5%. Even BNB and Solana haven\u2019t escaped unscathed, experiencing declines of 7% and 10% respectively.\n\nThe Pre-Halving Frenzy\n\nWith investors scratching their heads over the market\u2019s turmoil, it\u2019s essential to delve into the factors driving this dramatic downturn.\n\nThe much-anticipated Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, set to happen in about four days. Historically, halving events have been met with excitement, leading to significant price surges before, during, and after. At the start of 2024, Bitcoin broke not one but two all-time highs, sparking optimistic predictions from industry experts and outsiders alike. FOMO was rampant, driving market activity into a frenzy. It seemed like smooth sailing for cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut It Was a Bust!\n\nThe party didn\u2019t last long. Corrections, a typical occurrence before halving events, soon kicked in. Experts reassured investors, but over the weekend, the market witnessed a plunge reminiscent of the early-year volatility.\n\nGlobal Turmoil Meets Crypto Chaos\n\nThe brewing geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel spilled over into the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies became the go-to assets during the crisis. Investors panicked and swiftly sold off their holdings, triggering a market-wide downturn.\n\nThis sparked a flurry of sell-offs, with hundreds of millions of dollars being dumped in just two days. Interestingly, this chaos led to a surge in trading activity on major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit.\n\nAn Opportunity for Investors?\n\nWhile investors fled, savvy traders seized the moment. It\u2019s a common trend; when markets go haywire, opportunities for traders abound. However, it\u2019s important to note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily signal bullish sentiment. Recent data from Coinglass highlights a significant increase in Bitcoin derivatives trading, with volumes soaring by over 10% in a single day, reaching a staggering $99 billion. The prevailing long/short ratio suggests a predominantly bearish sentiment among traders.\n\nDespite the turbulence, experts remain optimistic, maintaining their predictions of Bitcoin soaring to $100k, Ethereum reaching $10k, and BNB hitting $5k."

One may not call me a crypto \u201cEnthusiast\u201d but trust me I'm getting there.\n\nCrypto analyst Crypto Kid delivered a mixed message to the cryptocurrency community, sounding the alarm on a potential Bitcoin downturn.\n\nWhile acknowledging the short-term dip, Crypto Kid delved into the analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price action, highlighting the formation of a double top pattern and the significance of key support levels. He outlined potential scenarios, indicating that if Bitcoin fails to find support at critical levels, a further decline to $66.7k could signal a bearish trend reversal.\n\nHe talked about how history often repeats itself in the cryptocurrency market. Back in 2020, Bitcoin followed a pattern where it formed a bullish pennant, took some time to consolidate, and then surged. He compared this to his current analysis, suggesting that Bitcoin could follow a similar path, possibly hitting $90k-$92k or even $100k.\n\n\n\nHe also mentioned a potential rise in altcoins. Regarding Ethereum, he noted that it hasn\u2019t reached a new all-time high yet, but he predicted it could reach $6,800 based on its current trend.\n\nHowever, amidst the cautionary tone, Crypto Kid shifted gears to discuss the potentially game-changing news of Hong Kong spot ETF approvals. He stressed the significance of these approvals, noting that they could unlock billions of dollars in capital inflow into Bitcoin.\n\nRead Also : Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Will Bears Dominate Halving Spree?\n\nWith Bloomberg expecting an approval announcement as early as Monday, Crypto Kid painted a bullish picture of the potential influx of institutional and retail investment into Bitcoin.\n\nDrawing parallels to previous market trends, Crypto Kid predicted a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price following the approval of spot ETFs, fueled by FOMO from Asian investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through regulated investment vehicles. He cited the success of other ETFs and the massive inflows they attracted, indicating the potential for similar, if not greater, enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDid You Know : MicroStrategy Doubles Bitcoin Profits as BTC Price Soars 463%"
