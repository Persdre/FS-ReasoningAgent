        "title": "Will Ethereum Reach $10,000 After Bitcoin Halving 2024? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ahead of the Bitcoin Halving 2024 event, the spotlight is on Bitcoin, the hottest cryptocurrency, even as it appears that Ethereum has been quietly sidelined in the market trend. However, trade analysts, pundits and anybody with little-over technical understanding in crypto know that Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency, holds strong potential and could emerge as a major player in future.\n\nAs the halving date is approaching, the chatter among the crypto community grows louder regarding Ethereum\u2019s potential to cross the $10,000 barrier post the event. There are several predictions that Ethereum\u2019s price will rise exponentially in the upcoming crypto cycle.\n\nHowever, these predictions lack any concrete data or evidence to explain the exact trajectory of Ethereum unlike the prediction of Bitcoin price reaching $150,000 post the 22024 halving.\n\nIn this article, we discuss if Ethereum price could really break the $10,000 barrier and what are the factors that could lead to it after the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nFactors That Could Send ETH Above $10,000\n\nThere are several major factors supporting Ethereum\u2019s rise to $10,000 and some of them are as below.\n\nEthereum-Bitcoin (ETH-BTC) Price Correlation\n\nIt is historically proven that ETH price closely follows gain in BTC price due to Bitcoin\u2019s major dominance in the cryptocurrency space. As both these crypto assets are largely fueled by speculations rather than actual use, the gain in Bitcoin price pushes Ethereum price upward because of the shared ecosystem.\n\nThere is also another major factor where both these assets are bought and sold using one another. For instance, ETH becomes cheaper in the ETH-BTC market when BTC price rises and vise-versa, ETH becomes expensive against BTC when its price decreases. This cycle is a major driver of the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin prices.\n\nBTC-USD vs ETH-USD \u2013 PortfoliosLab\n\nHowever, this case has been found unsteady due to major technical differences between both blockchain networks. Over the past year, Ethereum price has only gained 87% while Bitcoin has recorded a gain of over 133% \u2013 according to data from PortfoliosLab. This above chart shows that Ethereum has broken its price correlation during the past few months while lagging behind amid aggressive moves from Bitcoin.\n\nThe Pump Followed By Bitcoin Breakout\n\nAs mentioned above ETH prices tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s moves, the rapid increase in Bitcoin price could lead ETH to new highs. While there are speculations about Bitcoin price hitting $150,000 \u2013 which is a surge of 160% from its current market price \u2013 the ETH price is also likely to reach $10,000 due to the market correlation, which will be a surge of over 200% as it is currently placed at $3400-$3700.\n\nLiquidity rotation also plays a major role at the cycle peak where profits in one major asset usually flows into other assets. In such a case, the massive amount of realized profit in Bitcoin could directly flow into Ethereum that might lead ETH price to shoot up beyond $10,000.\n\nPotential Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nAfter the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto community was much optimistic about the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. However, the sentiment around ETH ETF has turned gloomy after the VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed doubts on it in a recent CNBC interview. He said that the Ethereum ETF will likely face rejection from the regulatory agency. A statement like this coming from one of the first Bitcoin ETF issuers holds much significance.\n\nTo counter this statement, analysts from Bitwise believe that there are 50 to 60% chances for ETH ETF to be approved by the SEC as it will happen \u201csooner or later.\u201d The approval will bring billions of inflow from traditional investors as traditional finance players sees Ethereum as a more convenient option due to its smart contract functionality and massive adaptability in real world use cases.\n\nAmid all the bullish speculations for 2024 bullrun, few reports also suggested that ETH will outperform BTC in 2024. There are supportive studies giving solid baking to the claim, so would it really happen?\n\nWill ETH Outperform BTC in 2024\n\nIn the highly volatile and unpredictable cryptocurency market, various possibilities exist including Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in gain. As witnessed in 2021, ETH outperformed BTC, gaining nearly 400% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 66%.\n\nIt is also acknowledged by exporters that Ethereum has a promising future due to several use cases and its unique functionality than Bitcoin. There are slight chances it may perform against Bitcoin in the upcoming rally in 2024. However, it could only outperform in periodic price gains rather than Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and price which is currently far beyond Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin halving is considered a kick starter for bullrun and it majorly impacts the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem besides Bitcoin. As the second largest blockchain and crypto asset, Ethereum has the potential to unlock the most benefits out of this. While there are speculations about crypto market reaching record highs in the next months, Ethereum price will surely hit a new all-time high while possibly breaking the $10,000 target.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Ethereum's Pectra upgrade slated for Q4 2024, bringing smart contract features and improved UX for wallets - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The name \"Pectra\" is derived from \"Prague\" and \"Electra\" \u2014 a combination of two simultaneous upgrades occurring on different layers of Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming Pectra upgrade, expected to be implemented by late 2024 or early 2025, is set to introduce significant improvements to cryptocurrency wallets, including the addition of smart contract capabilities to standard externally owned accounts (EOAs).\n\nThe inclusion of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074 in the Pectra upgrade will bring a range of new features and enhancements to the user experience.\n\nThe Pectra upgrade follows the recent Dencun update, which focused on lowering transaction fees on layer-2 solutions. The name \u201cPectra\u201d is derived from the combination of two simultaneous upgrades occurring on different layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, responsible for enforcing protocol rules, will undergo the \u201cPrague\u201d upgrade, while the consensus layer, which ensures the validation of blocks, will go through the \u201cElectra\u201d upgrade. This naming convention follows the Ethereum developers\u2019 tradition of combining the names of the upgrades, as seen in previous instances like \u201cDencun\u201d and \u201cShapella.\u201d\n\nOne of the key benefits of EIP-3074 is the ability for regular wallets, such as those created using MetaMask, to function similarly to smart contracts. This upgrade will enable features like transaction bundling, allowing users to sign multiple transactions at once, and sponsored transactions, where a wallet can delegate funds to be used by another entity. These functionalities are reminiscent of the account abstraction introduced in ERC-4337.\n\nEIP-3074 introduces two new operating instructions: AUTH and AUTHCALL. As explained by anonymous Web3 adviser Cygaar, AUTH verifies signatures and actions, while AUTHCALL calls the target contract(s) with the originator address as the caller instead of the message sender. These instructions work together to enable the smart contract-like behavior of EOAs.\n\nIn addition to the features mentioned above, EIP-3074 also includes a social recovery feature that eliminates the need for the traditional 12-to-24-word seed phrase, further simplifying the user experience and potentially reducing the risk of lost or stolen funds.\n\nAnother significant change expected to be included in Pectra is an increase in the staking limit for validators, from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH \u2013 a substantial 64-fold increase. This proposal, known as EIP 7251, would allow large staking providers, such as Coinbase or Lido, to consolidate their validators operating the Ethereum blockchain. By doing so, these providers can avoid the need to constantly create new validators each time they have an additional 32 ETH to stake, thereby reducing the operational load and resources required for staking and validating.\n\nThe need for this change has become apparent as the number of validators on the Ethereum network has surpassed 1 million, raising concerns about excessive latency. EIP 2751 is seen as a potential solution to slow the rate at which new validators enter the system, preventing performance issues and ensuring the blockchain\u2019s smooth operation.\n\nOther EIPs under consideration for Pectra include enabling validator withdrawals from smart contracts, incorporating a code change known as BLS precompile, and removing the deposit window. These relatively minor changes will allow developers to work on smaller improvements while focusing on more significant upgrades in the future.\n\nLooking beyond Pectra, the subsequent upgrade will introduce the highly anticipated \u201cverkle trees\u201d \u2013 a novel data system designed to help Ethereum nodes efficiently store large amounts of data. Tim Beiko mentioned that the Pectra upgrade is expected to be released sometime in late 2024 or early 2025, allowing developers to work on two forks in parallel and deliver small wins while preparing for the more complex verkle trees transition.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and improve, the Pectra upgrade represents another step forward in enhancing the network\u2019s performance, user experience, and overall functionality. By addressing key issues such as wallet UX and staking limits, developers aim to ensure that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain technology, providing a solid foundation for the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and services."

        "title": "5 Charts That Highlight How Ethereum Has Changed One Year After Shapella - Unchained",
        "content": "As Ethereum celebrates its one-year Shapella anniversary, here\u2019s a breakdown of how the network has changed.\n\nStaking activity on Ethereum has been on the rise over the last year.\n\nEthereum on Friday reached its one-year Shapella upgrade anniversary, which transitioned the blockchain from a proof-of-work validation system to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake.\n\nThe upgrade occurred on April 12, 2023, which allowed stakers to withdraw ether (ETH) that had been securing and validating the second-largest blockchain network.\n\nOne year later, Ethereum has changed in several ways, from fluctuations in staked ETH to the number of validators in its ecosystem. Here are five charts to illustrate how Ethereum has progressed since Shapella:\n\n1. Total Staked ETH Securing Ethereum\n\nStaked ether has grown considerably in the past year to 32.2 million ETH, up from 20 million, Nansen data shows.\n\nDespite the slight decrease in staked ETH from centralized exchanges initiating withdrawals following the rollout of Shapella, staked ETH has since ballooned 61%, marking a $42 billion influx into Ethereum\u2019s staking infrastructure, based on recent pricing.\n\nBefore Shapella, would-be validators had one option: depositing ETH into Ethereum\u2019s staking contract. Withdrawing assets was not possible.\n\n\u201cBased on how the total amount of ETH staked on Ethereum grew dramatically since the Shanghai [or the Shapella] upgrade, it\u2019s clear that the activation of staked ETH withdrawals on the network was a major de-risking event for the activity of staking,\u201d said Christine Kim, Galaxy\u2019s vice president of research, in an email.\n\nShapella helped de-risk Ethereum, because stakers gained an exit window \u2014 without suffering slashing penalties for ditching duties. As of publication, staked ETH represented 26.94% of the 120 million total supply.\n\nMike Neuder of the Ethereum Foundation outlined in a March blog factors set to fuel demand for staked ETH. Those include ETH appreciation, increased demand for restaking, lower interest rates that may lead institutions to look for alternative yield, the popularity of liquid staking and the potential of exchange-traded fund providers pushing for staked ETH.\n\nEthereum developers, however, are concerned regarding increased demand causing staked ETH supply to rise \u201ctoo much and too quickly,\u201d Kim noted.\n\nRead More: Why the Ethereum Community Is Up in Arms Against a Proposal to Change the Monetary Policy\n\n2. Number of Validators\n\nValidators have grown substantially since Shapella, easing \u201csome fear in the Ethereum community that the ability to withdraw ETH from the Beacon Chain would lead to a mass exodus of validators,\u201d Austin Blackerby, EVM analytics manager at Flipside Crypto, told Unchained via Telegram.\n\nNearly 563,000 validators secured Ethereum as of April 12, 2023. The figure has since jumped over 74% to roughly 981,000 validators.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, interest to join the active validator set has shown a thorough increase over the past 30 days, with the current queue time for new validators sitting over 9 days,\u201d Blackerby said. \u201cConversely, there is practically no queue to exit the validator set. This means there is a lot more demand to be a validator than there is demand to leave the network.\u201d\n\nContinued validator growth has raised additional concerns among protocol developers and researchers. Galaxy\u2019s Kim noted two main reasons in a September 2023 report.\n\n\u201cFirst, a large validator set size creates strains on peer-to-peer networking and messaging that may cause node failures from high computational load and bandwidth requirements,\u201d Kim wrote. A large validator set also makes future upgrades \u201charder and riskier to achieve,\u201d she added.\n\nThe next upgrade, \u201cElectra,\u201d is expected to address the rising validator set. Electra includes EIP-7251, an improvement proposal to reduce validators by increasing the maximum ETH a validator can stake. EIP-7251 aims to allow validators a maximum of 2,048 staked ETH, instead of the current limit of 32 ETH.\n\nRead More: What is EIP-7251 (MaxEB) in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\n3. Total Value Locked (TVL)\n\nEthereum\u2019s TVL surged after withdrawal activations. On April 12, 2023, users locked $54.69 billion on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, with 54% from liquid staking. Since, TVL has grown over 131% to $126.75 billion, with liquid staking comprising about 42%.\n\nEthereum maintains its top TVL position, followed by Tron, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana, according to DefiLlama. One factor driving growth is ETH appreciation, which surged 79% from $1,920 during the Shapella rollout to about $3,440 as of publication.\n\n4. Lido Leading the Pack\n\nETH holders have two ways to stake: solo home staking or using a third party.\n\nSmart contract protocol Lido, widely known for its liquid staking techniques, commands nearly 9.4 million staked ETH, representing about $33 billion \u2014 or 29% of all staked ETH.\n\nLiquid staking refers to staking ETH and receiving a \u201creceipt\u201d token, which represents a principal deposit, as well as rewards. While the ETH is locked, a staker can use their \u201creceipt\u201d token as liquidity on DeFi applications.\n\nLido led the pack in terms of staked ETH at the time of Shapella, boasting a lead of 2.97 million ETH over Coinbase. Lido has grown its lead over the past year. At publication, Lido\u2019s staked ETH stood at almost 9.4 million.\n\nLiquid staking competition has been heating up. Consider that protocols Renzo, Stader, Mantle and Ether.Fi did not have any ETH staked when ETH withdrawals went live, but are now responsible for 2.16 million staked ETH.\n\n5. Unstaked ETH\n\nWhile staking withdrawals haven\u2019t exceeded deposits, withdrawal patterns have changed since Shapella.\n\nCentralized exchanges were the primary withdrawers of staked ETH in the 2023 aftermath of Shapella. Exchanges that week withdrew 138,912 ETH that had secured the blockchain, dwarfing the collective 72,792 ETH withdrawn from all other categories, per the Dune dashboard.\n\nA year later, staked ETH withdrawals were largely activated by liquid staking protocols. Since Monday, centralized exchanges withdrew 84,128 staked ETH, while liquid staking protocols were responsible for 121,472 staked ETH withdrawals. Lido, which withdrew staked ETH Thursday, has seen its staked ETH decrease 1% in the past week and 4% over the past month."

        "content": "Ethereum developers are currently deliberating the Pectra upgrade, which is poised to enhance various facets of the blockchain\u2019s functionality.\n\nTim Beiko, the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s protocol support lead, confirmed the development, revealing that the developers have agreed to include Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) 3074 in the network\u2019s slated overhaul.\n\nEIP 3074\n\nEIP 3074 is a pivotal advancement within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and was introduced by Lightclients in 2020. The proposal has garnered widespread support from the crypto community as it aims to enhance the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets.\n\nFundamentally, EIP 3074 enables conventional crypto wallets like MetaMask to function akin to smart contracts.\n\nThis upgrade facilitates various functionalities, including transaction bundling, streamlining the signing process to a single step, and sponsored transactions. The latter feature empowers wallets to delegate funds for others to utilize, offering a more versatile and efficient transaction framework.\n\nTrading a new token on a DEX such as Uniswap will now only require one signature from a user\u2019s wallet as opposed to having to approve the new token and then sign the transaction to purchase.\n\nCrypto community reacts\n\nThe announcement of the impending upgrade has sparked various reactions within the crypto community.\n\nGeorgios Konstantopoulous, Paradigm\u2019s CTO, highlighted the update\u2019s potential to enhance wallet usability tenfold, noting Reth\u2019s successful implementation and testing.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Hayden Adams, the mind behind Uniswap, lauded the upgrade as a significant boost to Ethereum\u2019s user experience. He added:\n\n\u201cIndustry should make an effort to create compatibility for 4337 wallets to interact with 3074 contracts (much like eip1271 has created compatibility between safes and EOAs today).\u201d\n\nHowever, EVM developer Alex Watts cautioned against solely focusing on user experience improvements, emphasizing the broader implications for application and mechanism design.\n\nDespite the optimism, concerns linger among some community members regarding the EIP 3074 upgrade.\n\nAnsgar Dietrich, an Ethereum Researcher involved in the proposal\u2019s inception, expressed ambivalence, reflecting on the lengthy journey to its impending mainnet integration and questioning its alignment with the evolving account abstraction roadmap.\n\nSimilarly, 0xngmi, the pseudonymous developer of DeFiLlama, raised apprehensions about the upgrade potentially enabling the complete depletion of addresses, encompassing tokens, NFTs, and other DeFi assets.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "While EIP-3074 offers a potential leap in the Ethereum wallet user experience by enabling batch transactions and smart contract-like features, some experts have concerns about its security and long-term impact.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074 will go live during Ethereum\u2019s next hard fork, dubbed \u2018Pectra,\u2019 and many in the Ethereum community are very excited that it\u2019s finally coming to fruition.\n\nInitially proposed by Ethereum researchers Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, Matt Garnett, and Micah Zoltu in October 2020, EIP-3074 will be included in the next fork, as decided on Thursday on Ethereum All Core Developers call, and is designed to improve Ethereum wallet usability. It proposes a new set of code changes that would allow users to batch multiple transactions together and confirm them in a single action, unlike now where users usually have to sign at least two transactions to, for example, swap an asset on a decentralized exchange.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal. Wallet [user experience] will 10x,\u201d wrote Georgios Konstantopoulos, research partner at crypto VC Paradigm, on X.\n\nEIP-3074 suggests a novel way to extend the functionalities of externally owned accounts (EOAs) by delegating control to a smart contract.

Unlike account abstraction (ERC-4337), which focuses on transaction sponsoring and relaying, EIP-3074 lays the foundation for these new features to be possibly added in future proposals.\n\nBy enabling EOAs to interact like smart contract wallets, EIP-3074 could redefine how wallets operate, easing the transition to advanced wallet systems without requiring users to undertake complex migrations. \u201cThis is huge, because it allows EOAs to be magically converted to Smart Accounts,\u201d wrote Ivo Georgiev, CEO of Ambire, on social media.\n\nLearn more: What Are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) in Ethereum?\n\nThe proposal also aligns with the broader goal of ensuring a smoother user experience across multiple EVM-compatible chains, maintaining consistency as users navigate different platforms.\n\nThe community\u2019s support for EIP-3074 reflects its potential to simplify transaction processes and enhance the Ethereum network\u2019s usability, making it a significant upgrade anticipated by both developers and users alike. Hayden Adams, founder of prominent DEX Uniswap, posted on X: \u201cEIP-3074 inclusion will be a monumental upgrade to Ethereum UX.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Finlay, MetaMask\u2019s cofounder, said: \u201c3074 couldn\u2019t come at a better time: There\u2019s momentum to define an onchain permissions system for smart contract accounts, and 3074 can allow EOAs to still enjoy some of its benefits.\u201d\n\nNot Everyone Agrees\n\nWhile there is significant excitement around EIP-3074, not everyone in the Ethereum community is equally enthusiastic.\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann from Gnosis voiced his concerns, saying that the EIP \u201cbrings us in a weird state with EOAs getting some of the benefits but not all, such as no option for key rotation.\u201d He explained that instead of moving towards a unified and improved future, EIP-3074 could solidify the division between two different types of wallet technologies\u2014smart contracts and traditional EOAs.\n\nMoreover, K\u00f6ppelmann criticized its revocation capabilities, arguing that they provide only a \u201cfake sense of security.\u201d He wrote: \u201cAfter 3074, an EOA will always have the danger that signing one wrong message can mean you lose anything this account controls.\u201d\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann\u2019s criticism was echoed by 0xngmi from DefiLlama, who pointed out that with EIP-3074, \u201cit\u2019ll be possible to fully drain an address (all tokens, all nfts, all defi positions\u2026) with only one bad signature.\u201d"

        "title": "Navigating High ROI in Cryptocurrency: Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Furrever Token (FURR) - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amidst the turbulent seas of the crypto markets, Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) find themselves navigating stormy waters, facing challenges in their quest for a new rally. Despite efforts to regain solid footing, both ETH and SHIB encounter obstacles that hinder their upward momentum. In stark contrast, Furrever Token (FURR) emerges as a beacon of success, surpassing the impressive milestone of $770,000 in fundraising within just one month. While ETH and SHIB grapple with market dynamics, FURR's rapid ascent highlights its growing appeal and investor confidence in its promising trajectory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Could See $4,000 Again Soon\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,502.22, marking a nearly 1% increase since yesterday. Despite recent fluctuations, Ethereum's price chart suggests signs of potential recovery, with indicators like the 30-day moving average stabilizing and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbing from 30 to approximately 45, indicating momentum.\n\nThe recent bounce-back of Ethereum's support level is also a positive indicator, alongside a doubling of trading volume, indicating heightened market activity. This surge in volume, potentially due to large investors' selling pressure, is encouraging as it hasn't significantly impacted Ethereum's price.\n\nConsidering the broader crypto market conditions, Ethereum seems poised for positive performance in the near and long term. It's expected to benefit from potential rallies following Bitcoin's upcoming halving event. Additionally, the potential approval of spot-based Ethereum ETFs could be a significant development, similar to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs on BTC's price.\n\nEthereum's robust fundamentals, particularly its significant share in the total value locked (TVL) aspect of the market, suggest it's primed for a substantial uptrend. This could see Ethereum reaching levels around $4,000 in the coming weeks and potentially $5,000 in the second half of the year.\n\nDespite experiencing a 5% increase over the past week, Ethereum saw a 12.5% decline last month. However, it's important to note that Ethereum saw an 89% increase over the past year.\n\nAnalyzing Shiba Inu (SHIB): Consolidation, Potential Opportunities, and Market Indicators\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at around $0.00002737, reflecting a 1% decrease since yesterday. The popular meme token has been in a phase of retreat and consolidation over the past six weeks. However, the cryptocurrency's price movement chart hasn't shown any reasons for investors to panic. On the contrary, experts suggest that a further 15% drop in SHIB's price could present a good buying opportunity.\n\nA recent report on Shibarium revealed a decline in transaction fees on the network, which could raise concerns about diminishing user activity and a potential decrease in demand. The 12-hour price chart for the meme token has highlighted the significance of the $0.00003 level since March 15. Bulls briefly turned to support in the last week of March but failed to hold, with the latest bounce also stopping just below this level at $0.00000295.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) underscores the indecision with a reading of 47, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains similarly uncertain. Notably, the cryptocurrency's price action and indicators indicate that SHIB is in a consolidation phase. CMF movement could potentially signal increasing buying (or selling) pressure and an imminent SHIB movement in that direction.\n\nThe 30-day MVRV ratio dipped into negative territory earlier this month, suggesting the token may be undervalued. Conversely, the average cryptocurrency age has shown a strong upward trend since early March, particularly signaling a robust buying signal due to strengthening under resistance levels.\n\nOpen positions have also significantly decreased in the last ten days. While the average cryptocurrency age rapidly declined in early March, stagnant circulation has largely increased since then. This quietness in stagnant circulation may signal a lack of significant selling pressure and token movement in recent weeks.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Soars: How it Amassed $770,000 in a Month with Up to 15X Returns\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) surged to amass over $730,000 in just one month, propelled by a strategic blend of captivating marketing, unique tokenomics, and a robust community-driven ethos. With an enticing offer of up to 15X returns and a current price of $0.00048, FURR's presale phase garnered significant attention and investment.\n\nThe token's allure stems from its innovative vision to inject the crypto sphere with an irresistible dose of cuteness, providing users with a delightful and charming experience distinct from conventional blockchain ventures. FURR's presale strategy strategically allocated 65% of tokens to early investors, incentivizing participation and capitalizing on the potential for substantial returns. Additionally, the dedication to lock 10% of tokens for a year underscored a steadfast commitment to project longevity, instilling confidence and stability within the community.\n\nFURR's engagement initiatives, including regular challenges, launch events, and growth endeavors, fostered a vibrant and inclusive community atmosphere. The integration of adorable cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals into the ecosystem further enhanced user engagement, attracting a diverse audience beyond traditional crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe absence of buy and sell taxes during trading streamlined transactions, while the active presence of admins and moderators on platforms like Telegram ensured prompt resolution of queries and issues, bolstering trust and credibility.\n\nOverall, Furrever Token's captivating concept, strategic tokenomics, stringent security measures, and active community involvement propelled its rapid fundraising success, positioning it as a promising contender in the crypto landscape.\n\n\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Robert Smith support(at)furrevertoken.com https://furrevertoken.com/\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "The Latest in Crypto: A Spotlight on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve with significant movements in key digital currencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the emerging Furrever Token (FURR) . This article provides a detailed analysis of these cryptocurrencies, highlighting their current market positions, underlying value propositions, and potential future directions.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's Market Value: A Comparative Analysis\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the value of a single bitcoin reached an impressive milestone, exceeding $70,000, with a specific value of $70,665. The total circulation of bitcoin at this time was over 19.68 million, culminating in a market capitalization exceeding $1.39 trillion. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, where the market cap was around $472 billion with approximately 19.35 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nTo understand the proportion of global wealth represented by bitcoin, it's crucial to consider the overall monetary wealth. According to calculations by Credit Suisse, global wealth was estimated at $454.4 trillion by the end of 2022. Assuming a steady growth rate, the total global wealth by 2024 would be around $469.8 trillion, placing bitcoin at 0.3% of this figure.\n\nGold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset. With an estimated 244,000 tons of gold discovered to date and a price per ounce of $2,334.90 as of April 10, 2024, the total value of all gold amounted to approximately $18.23 trillion. In this context, bitcoin's total value represented about 7.6% of the total value of all gold.\n\nWhile bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it is far from the only one. Including other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies was around $2.6 trillion as of April 10, 2024. This constituted roughly 0.56% of the total global money supply.\n\nCryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are known for their volatility, liquidity issues, and susceptibility to price manipulation. Potential investors are advised to thoroughly understand the risks associated with these digital assets.\n\nBitcoin, as a pioneering cryptocurrency, occupies a unique position in the global financial ecosystem. Its comparison to traditional assets like gold highlights its growing relevance and potential as a store of value, despite constituting a small fraction of the world's total monetary wealth. As the digital currency landscape evolves, bitcoin continues to be a significant player, reflecting broader trends in the move towards virtual assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's Price Recovery: A Path to $3,600\n\nEthereum has shown resilience by holding above the crucial $3,400 support zone, indicating a possible recovery from recent losses. However, to sustain an upward trajectory in the near term, it must breach the $3,600 mark.\n\nThe digital currency witnessed a downturn, dipping below the $3,500 threshold and momentarily breaching the $3,450 support level. Ethereum found its lowest point at $3,408 before initiating a recovery, paralleling Bitcoin's upward movement. This recovery saw Ethereum surpass the $3,500 resistance, reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from its previous high of $3,726 to its low of $3,408. Additionally, Ethereum managed to break through a downward trend line on the ETH/USD hourly chart, signaling a potential reversal of the bearish trend.\n\nEthereum currently hovers around the $3,500 mark, closely aligned with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a balanced market sentiment. Immediate resistance is identified near $3,600, correlating with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high to low swing.\n\nShould Ethereum overcome the $3,650 resistance, it might target the $3,725 level, setting the stage for a possible move towards $3,780. A decisive break above $3,800 could catalyze a bullish momentum, possibly propelling the price to the $3,880 zone and, in an optimistic scenario, to the $4,000 mark.\n\nConversely, failure to surpass the $3,600 resistance could trigger a new round of selling. Immediate support is found near $3,520, with significant support at the $3,500 and $3,400 levels. A breach below $3,400 might lead to a decline towards $3,320, and further losses could potentially push the price down to $3,240.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: A Charming Alternative in the Cryptocurrency World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves as an innovative alternative to the more traditional altcoins. Standing out with a unique blend of charm and community spirit, FURR is distinguishing itself amidst giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat sets Furrever Token apart is its commitment to adding a touch of charisma to the crypto industry. Moving beyond mere transactions and functionalities, FURR captures the hearts of its users with enchanting digital cat imagery, offering an enjoyable and lighthearted experience. This not only differentiates FURR from its counterparts but also fosters a sense of community and collective enjoyment among its enthusiasts.\n\nAt its heart, Furrever Token prioritizes creating a welcoming and inclusive community. The introduction of cat-themed visuals, stickers, and emojis into its platform not only enhances user engagement but also promotes a sense of unity and camaraderie among its members. This focus on community building is a cornerstone of FURR's strategy, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a shared experience.\n\nFurrever Token's approach to token distribution is equally impressive, with about 9 billion tokens in total supply. A significant 65% of these tokens are allocated for a presale, aimed at ensuring a broad and fair distribution. Additionally, locking 10% of the total supply for a year underscores the team's dedication to the project's longevity and the trust of its community.\n\nThe market has responded favorably to Furrever Token, with over $720,000 raised within a month of its launch. This remarkable feat underscores FURR's growing appeal and its viability as an investment in the crypto market. With its price currently at $0.00048, Furrever Token demonstrates a steadily increasing value, attracting the attention of investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) presents a compelling case for those looking for an alternative in the cryptocurrency space. Through its unique charm, strong community focus, and thoughtful tokenomics, FURR is carving out a niche for itself against competitors like Solana and Ethereum. As it continues to build momentum, Furrever Token stands as a testament to the potential of innovative and engaging approaches in the world of digital currencies.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and complex ecosystem, with Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate the landscape, while new entrants like Furrever Token offer fresh perspectives and opportunities. As these digital currencies evolve, they reflect broader trends towards virtual assets and the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. Investors and enthusiasts alike are advised to stay informed and consider the unique characteristics and potential of each cryptocurrency. The future of the cryptocurrency market holds both challenges and opportunities, with innovation and community engagement at the heart of its growth and sustainability.\n\nDiscover one of the exclusive opportunities in the 2024 pre-sale stage now:\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\nMedia Contact: Robert Smith support(at)furrevertoken.com https://furrevertoken.com/\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Hong Kong is reportedly nearing a significant milestone on the cryptocurrency market, with indications suggesting the imminent approval of spot exchange-traded funds directly investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Bloomberg's sources have suggested that regulatory approval could be granted as soon as Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the anticipated issuers are the international arm of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital. These entities intend to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs pending approval from the SFC and finalizing listing details with Hong Kong Exchange.\n\nThe potential approval of crypto-oriented ETFs in Hong Kong mirrors recent developments in the United States, where the introduction of spot Bitcoin solutions earlier this year has garnered significant attention and market activity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Ethereum ETF in US?\n\nInterestingly however, while Bitcoin ETFs have been approved in the US, solutions for Ethereum are still very much a question there. In Hong Kong, however, neither of these instruments is available yet, but if rumors become facts, both solutions will be presented on this market at once.\n\nThe situation with Ethereum ETFs in America is in an unclear state. It is known that the deadline for the SEC to make a decision on the applications is set for May 23. However, not only does the regulator not comment on the whole situation, but it also initiates investigations against the Ethereum Foundation - a key nonprofit organization associated with the altcoin.\n\nIn the absence of specifics, the discussion field is full of the opinions and assessments of various experts from the banking sector. If we gather some consensus from them, the picture for Ethereum ETFs on the U.S. market does not look favorable so far."

        "content": "For the \u201ccrypto hack 2024\u201d column, it seems that Ethereum is the most violated chain so far, with 33 hacking incidents, scams, and more. Currently, the estimated total losses amount to 437 million dollars.\n\nCrypto hack 2024: the most targeted blockchain at the moment is Ethereum with 33 incidents\n\nAccording to a research conducted by experts from Smart Betting Guide on crypto hack 2024, it seems that Ethereum is the blockchain most targeted by scams and hacker attacks.\n\nAnd in fact, Ethereum seems to already have 33 incidents. Following that, there is BNB Chain with 14 incidents, Arbitrum with 6, Solana and Bitcoin both with 2 attacks each.\n\nIn general, experts also point out that the most vulnerable crypto sector for this 2024 remains DeFi, due to all the incidents that have occurred.\n\nAnyway, making an estimate on the total, Smart Betting Guide reveals that this year\u2019s crypto hacks have already caused losses of over 437 million dollars.\n\n\u201cCrypto hack 2024\u201d: Ethereum and DeFi remain the most vulnerable\n\nLast month, even MarketWaves analyzed reports on crypto hacks in the DeFi and Web3 world, sharing the De.Fi REKT report.\n\nAnd in fact, the latter had reported that the losses for the month of February 2024 alone were already 82 million dollars.\n\nBasically, during the month in question, the DeFi sector would have experienced a significant increase in security-related incidents. Specifically, the total lost due to various exploits on different chains and platforms was $82,287,101.\n\nHowever, it seems that efforts to mitigate these losses have led to the recovery of $1,325,932, highlighting the ongoing battle between hacking and security in the crypto sector.\n\nOnly in the month of February 2024, there have been several significant events with the platforms PlayDapp, Fixed Float, and Jeffrey Zirlin among the most affected.\n\nSome tips on how to keep your crypto safe\n\nExperts from Smart Betting Guide, in light of the already significant presence of crypto hacks in this 2024, wanted to share a guide on how to keep your crypto safe.\n\nFirst of all, the most useful advice of all, concerns the storage of the password and seed phrase of the various crypto wallets or exchanges where you hold your cryptocurrencies, which should absolutely not be stored on the Cloud.\n\nDespite the convenience, the Cloud could be violated, therefore the best way is to save them in writing or have them engraved on a metal card (to protect them from water damage or fire) to be kept in a safe place.\n\nGoing forward, Smart Betting Guide recommends not using exchanges but hardware wallets to store your crypto in a safer way.\n\nIt is important to always stay updated through DYOR \u2013 Do Your Own Research (Do your own research). In fact, it is only in this way that you can understand any crypto hack techniques such as rug pull, before falling into the scam.\n\nNot only, for the experts at Smart Betting Guide, when you want to invest in new blockchains or crypto projects, users should consider who the team and developers are, read and verify the quality of the Whitepaper.\n\nIn DeFi, it is also important to verify that the new project has a Total Value Locked (TVL) and that this value should be between 80% and 100%, as well as complying with standard practices of external audit."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPseudonymous founders with bear-themed names have raised $100 million in funding for Berachain\u2014a layer-1 blockchain built with Cosmos tech.\n\nAnnounced Friday, the Series B funding round was co-led by Brevan Howard Digital, an investment management platform, along with crypto-native VC firm, Framework Ventures. Additional backers include Polychain Capital, Samsung Next, Hack VC, and Hashkey Capital, with angel investors such as Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal and Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu.\n\nInvestors signed a SAFT agreement, which exchanges current funds for future tokens. The move comes just days after Monad Labs announced its own $225 million raise to build a layer-1 chain to rival giants like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe see this raise as a major validation of our approach to building a blockchain that\u2019s built on feedback from real users and developers, and driving value to those groups who are actually contributing to the network\u2019s growth,\u201d Berachain co-founder Smokey the Bera said in a press release.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBerachain plans to use the $100 million raised to strengthen its \u201ceconomic growth initiatives and engineering resources,\u201d as well as expand its global presence into Hong Kong, Singapore, South East Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\nPlenty of capital, plans to expand, and confidence from big investors\u2014but what is Berachain?\n\nWhat is Berachain?\n\nFounded by Smokey the Bear, Homme Bera, and Dev Bear, the EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain Berachain aims to align incentives for security and liquidity at the network level.\n\nBuilt on the Cosmos SDK, the layer-1 chain uses the proof-of-liquidity consensus mechanism. This model builds on what proof-of-stake created and attempts to address its limitations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy providing liquidity to pools, using the network\u2019s native BERA tokens, users earn Bera Governance Tokens (BGT). You can then delegate these tokens to validator(s) who will produce blocks based on the amount of BGT delegated to them. Then, validators vote on future BGT inflation across liquidity pools and distribute block rewards (called bribes) to delegators.\n\nBerachain argues that this model \u201cincreases security by increasing liquidity,\u201d decentralizes inflation, and aligns all parties involved in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe Berachain team has essentially built a blockchain that allows users to play a direct role in incentivizing certain apps and even industries to build on their chain, which is a fascinating model for ecosystem growth that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, said in the funding announcement.\n\n\u201cThe Berachain community is one of the most energized I\u2019ve seen in all of crypto,\u201d Spencer continued, \u201cand I\u2019m excited to see what they will do once they\u2019ve been given the ability to directly shape the future of their chain.\u201d\n\nThe project was originally an NFT project called Bit Bears, which the Berachain website says was simply started for a bit of fun. It saw great success, however, leading to a \u201cmassive cult community.\u201d This was when the founders saw the vision for what Berachain has become today.\n\nTwo months ago, the Berachain testnet was launched, which the press release claims was the \u201cmost utilized testnet in blockchain history\u201d with over 300,000 users and 1 million transactions processed in its first 48 hours. Berachain plans to launch its mainnet sometime this quarter.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "5 Reasons Ethereum is Losing Ground to Bitcoin - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has frequently been recognized as the foundation of smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, it has recently faced challenges in preserving its status in comparison to Bitcon. Despite the fact that ETH started the year strongly even hitting new highs, it has slowed down in its progress, compared to BTC. In this articles, we will delve into reasons why Ethereum, the top altcoin, is losing ground, and finding it difficult to compete with Bitcoin.\n\nReasons Ethereum Is Loosing Ground Against Bitcoin\n\n1. Performance Disparity\n\nEthereum experienced a drop of 12.2% in its value over the past month, however Bitcoin has only decreased 1.5% over the same period. This is a big difference, demonstrating that ETH is struggling to match BTC\u2019s bullish performance.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, Ethereum is also underperforming its layer 1 competitors. Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB) have shown significant performance, increasing in prices by 14.2% and 17.1% respectively. This shows that Ethereum is also struggling to hold on to its dominance position amid increasing competition within the crypto market. Moreover, Polkadot, Cardano and Solana are increasingly becoming popular by handling issues of scalability, offering new features that attract users and developers. As they innovate and gain market share in NFTs and DeFi, there is no longer market dominance assurance for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\n2. Declining On-Chain Activity\n\nAn essential part of Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness is found in its lively ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps). Yet, recent information indicates a troubling decrease in Ethereum\u2019s activity on the blockchain, indicating a drop in user participation and transaction rates. . Core indicators like active addresses and transaction volumes have seen significant declines in the last month, showing a decrease in interest in the Ethereum network.\n\nThe decrease in transaction volume of Ethereum DApps, especially in platforms such as Uniswap and MetaMask Swap, highlights a larger pattern of decreased interest in Ethereum services. According to Glassnode, the number of active addresses on Ethereum decreased from 622,963 to 499,448, over the pasat 30 days. Although the top altcoin according to CoinMarketCap remains dominant in the DeFi industry, rivals such as Solana are starting to gain market share thanks to the surge in activity caused by meme coin craze and stablecoin transactions.\n\n3. Uncertainty Surrounding Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nOne major reason Ethereum is struggling against Bitcoin is the unknown approval status of an ETF for ETH. Hopes for the ETF have decreased in recent weeks, as it could bring in institutional investment and improve liquidity. The creators of the initial U.S. spot bitcoin ETF, like VanEck and CoinShares, do not believe the SEC will give approval for ether applications. Regulatory issues and postponements have raised uncertainty regarding the approval of an Ethereum ETF, leading to decreased investor confidence in Ethereum.\n\nThe doubts about the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF arise due to the limited communication by regulatory agencies, specifically the SEC in the United States. Even though they were initially hopeful, analysts and industry experts have now adjusted their expectations, with some foreseeing a slim chance of approval by the May deadlines.\n\nNice scoop from @joelight. Def interesting but no change our odds. As we've said, need SEC to give comments on the filing documents (the \"critical feedback\" he mentions) and that still ain't happening, even in person they offering nothing. Silence is violence. https://t.co/z76KTtdmHU \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2024\n\n4. Upcoming Bitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin halving has been the center of attraction in the cryptocurrency industry since the year began. Approaching in less than 10 days, the event has shifted the focus of investors and finances towards BTC. Usually, the crypto community eagerly waits for halving, an event that results in the reduced supply of Bitcoin, and higher values for the coin. This change in focus and funding could result in Ethereum and other alternative coins not performing well.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Bitcoin before the halving event, causing them to adjust their portfolios in favor of Bitcoin instead of assets like ETH. After the halving, market cycles typically become more optimistic, as investors focus on acquiring Bitcoin and pay less attention to Ethereum. With the growing interest in Bitcoin, its market dominance is expanding and impacting the performance of altcoins like Ethereum. Rumors surrounding the halving event may lead to increased volatility and a shift of capital towards Bitcoin, causing a larger performance difference between BTC and ETH.\n\n5. Regulatory Hurdles\n\nThe regulatory landscape for Ethereum presents obstacles for its expansion and acceptance. Bitcoin has achieved regulatory clarity, while Ethereum\u2019s status is still uncertain, especially regarding its classification as a security. Ambiguous regulations hinder institutional involvement and investor trust in Ethereum, which limits its competitiveness with Bitcoin as a value store and investment option.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading at $3,519.61, down 2.15%, while Bitcoin price is trading at $70.783 , up 0.21% over the last day.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe competition between Ethereum and Bitcoin is complex, arising from differences in performance, a decrease in on-chain transactions, upcoming Bitcoin halving, regulatory ambiguities, and a competitive environment. Although Ethereum continues to be a fundamental component of the cryptocurrency landscape, it is essential to tackle these obstacles in order to ensure its sustainability and importance in the future. As investors explore the changing crypto world, it is crucial to remain attentive and well-informed to spot potential opportunities and manage risks linked to Ethereum\u2019s uncertain path."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe conversations around Ethereum (ETH) and its data storage for optimal functionality have made it to crypto X with Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic and Vitalik Buterin debating the possibilities. The conversation started with Bjelic posting a question in which he sought to know if developers are sure it is right to switch Ethereum to Verkle trees, given that its zk-fication is quite likely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWading into the conversation, Vitalik Buterin said, \"ZK-ifying keccak merkle patricia trees with worst case 300 MB witness sizes is a non-starter.\" Notably, the Merkle Patricia trees form the current or primary data structure that is being used within the Ethereum blockchain. This data storage structure has its limits, and the plan soon is to replace it with Verkle trees with shorter proofs and increased bandwidth.\n\nTo Bjelic, the current structure, according to the capacity of Polygon zkEVM, can handle the 300 MB benchmark noted by Buterin. The Polygon founder noted that the protocol could even do this easily with a total block time of 12 seconds. He, however, acknowledged that for this to work, it would need approximately 10 server-class CPUs.\n\nButerin's lasting solution\n\nPer the presentation made by Vitalik Buterin, Merkle trees were not designed to be compatible with ZK technology. However, he noted that Verkle trees with a vector element are designed to help achieve this goal ultimately.\n\nZK-ifying keccak merkle patricia trees with worst case 300 MB witness sizes is a non-starter.\n\n\n\nThe verkle tree spec is designed to be zk friendly (eg. choice of curve, using pedersen as the hash)\n\n\n\nSo switching to verkle helps with ZKing the L1. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 12, 2024\n\nPer the design of the entire Ethereum architecture, ZK protocols are mostly embodied as Layer-2 scaling solutions. While these L2s have better throughput, scalability, gas fees and data storage, Ethereum still battles to keep up with scaling up amid the demand.\n\nTo convert Ethereum to a ZK-tech compatible network, Vitalik Buterin highlighted how this can only be achievable using Verkle trees. If this is achieved, ultimately, Ethereum may also benefit from the impacts of the Dencun upgrade in the long term."

        "title": "Cardano (ADA): What It Is, How It Differs From Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be more efficient than blockchains that rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW). Similar to Ethereum, Cardano's PoS consensus mechanism uses and rewards cryptocurrency for work done to review and expand the historical blockchain record.\n\nCardano is intended to evolve into a system for decentralized applications (dApps) with multiple use cases governed by stakers. The blockchain's cryptocurrency token is named ADA after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, an English aristocrat commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. ADA can also be purchased on most major cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nKey Takeaways Cardano is a blockchain platform that was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. It was launched in 2017.\n\nCardano aims to be a decentralized application (dApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.\n\nCardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol using its native token, Ada.\n\nHistory of Cardano (ADA)\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder who left the project due to disagreements with the direction of Ethereum, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the blockchain network with the first mined block in 2017.\n\nCardano considers itself an updated version of and has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum, anointing itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. Cardano has a self-proclaimed goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked.\n\nAn eponymous non-profit foundation, the Cardano Foundation, was established in 2017 to oversee the development of the Cardano blockchain and to promote its adoption. Prior to that, IOHK, an engineering company, was the primary developer of the Cardano blockchain. Throughout its history, the Cardano blockchain has undergone four notable hard forks in its history: the Shelley, Alonzo, Vasil, and Valentine hard forks.\n\nThe Shelley hard fork transitioned Cardano from a federated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (fBFT) consensus mechanism to a more decentralized PoS consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. The Alonzo hard fork enabled smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain for the first time, opening up the possibility for a wide range of dApps to be built on Cardano. The Vasil hard fork brought scalability upgrades to further improve dApp functionality, such as increased block size, improved transaction processing, and new scripting capabilities.\n\nIn February 2023, the Valentine upgrade occurred, causing another (planned) hard fork. The purpose of this update was to allow more efficient cross-chain applications to be built and add support for other protocols.\n\n\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum\n\nBoth the Cardano and Ethereum blockchain platforms are used for responsive applications and aim to build a connected system similar to the Apple and Android store, but decentralized. The most prominent features offered by Cardano and Ethereum to support dApps are their use of smart contracts and a PoS blockchain algorithm. Cardano had a staking mechanism long before Ethereum did, but it only recently supported smart contracts.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nCardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This update took place on Cardano's test network, a beta version of the blockchain, and was the first iteration of bringing promised scalability and interoperability to users.\n\nSmart contracts allowed Cardano developers to create dApps such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple cryptocurrency assets associated with these dApps. Future releases and forks of Cardano are expected to formally bring smart contract capabilities to the main network, the official version of the blockchain.\n\nCryptocurrency Staking\n\nCardano uses a PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \"stake\" the blockchain's cryptocurrency for the opportunity to become a validator. A stake is a pledge of a certain amount of ADA cryptocurrency to represent and secure validator rights in the Cardano network. ADA cannot be used or spent while it is staked because it must be held as collateral to incentivize honest validation behavior.\n\nValidators open and finalize blocks of transactions and are rewarded with ADA from other validators based on the number of tokens they have staked. Users can participate in the validation process by creating or joining a pool, which can be public or private.\n\nStaking pools consist of one or more trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions, updating the ledger, opening new blocks, and earning rewards. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to their sole owners.\n\nA Cardano staking pool must be run by an operator with the technical knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks.\n\nCardano vs. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was developed as a peer-to-peer payment system, while Cardano is focused on fostering a general blockchain ecosystem that allows developers to create other tokens, dApps, or any uses a scalable blockchain network can host.\n\nThe Cardano platform's PoS consensus mechanism relies on staking to validate transactions and reward cryptocurrency to validators, whereas Bitcoin's PoW relies on cryptocurrency mining. Cardano's PoS expends drastically less energy than Bitcoin's PoW by removing the need to have computers gobbling up large amounts of electricity to power complex mining calculations.\n\nCardano's PoS consensus mechanism also makes its validation process more accessible to the average user than Bitcoin's PoW. Cardano staking can be done simply by installing compatible wallet software on computers or devices\u2014Bitcoin mining can also be done this way, but it is not very efficient, even if it is done through a pool, which is the least commitment-intensive option for mining.\n\n\n\nFuture of Cardano\n\nCardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho, Cardano's current era, is focused on bringing scaling and optimization capabilities to Cardano. As of April 2024, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.\n\nVoltaire, Cardano's final era of development, is intended to bring voting and treasury management to the blockchain network through particular smart contract functionalities and system improvements.\n\n\n\nDoes Cardano Have a Future? As with all blockchains and cryptocurrency projects, it is difficult to say how long they will last. Cardano is still being developed and maintained, so it appears that it still has potential, at least in the short term.\n\nIs Cardano a Hold or a Sell? It depends on your outlook, risk tolerance, and investing strategy.\n\nWhat Is the All-time High Price for Cardano? Cardano's all time high was about $3.16 on Sep. 2, 2021.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable.\n\nThe plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Rootstock\u2019s Blockchain Revolution Aims to Bridge the Bitcoin-Ethereum Gap - Block Telegraph",
        "content": "Blockchain technology is redefining technology, from security to decentralization and financial autonomy. Among the platforms pushing the boundaries is Rootstock (RSK), which is integrating the strengths of the two titans of the crypto world: Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nTori Madison, the host of BlockTelegraph\u2019s CryptoCurrents podcast, sat down with Daniel Fogg, CEO at RootstockLabs, to shed light on how Rootstock is enhancing the blockchain ecosystem and setting a new standard for what blockchain platforms can achieve.\n\nFogg eloquently articulates the mission, challenges, and groundbreaking achievements of Rootstock, offering listeners a comprehensive overview of a platform that\u2019s bridging the gap between Bitcoin\u2019s robust value transfer system and Ethereum\u2019s programmable flexibility.\n\nRootstock\u2019s Foundation Combines Security and Smart Contracts\n\nRootstock ingeniously blends two titans, taking Bitcoin\u2019s secure storage and transfer of value with Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities. In short, Fogg explains that \u201cRootstock combines the security and store of value of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe integration facilitates the use of Bitcoin for computational services and secures transactions with Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic mechanisms. It is an innovation that makes Rootstock highly secure, highlighted by Madison pointing out its position as the \u201cmost secure and decentralized smart contract platform globally.\u201d\n\nThe platform\u2019s security, backed by over 60% of Bitcoin\u2019s hashing power, solidifies Rootstock\u2019s role in the DeFi arena on Bitcoin. It showcases an astounding harmonization of Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s strengths, with over 300 million in total native value locked on the platform.\n\nBridging Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nDuring the discussion, Fogg brought up Rootstock\u2019s two-way peg mechanism, a cornerstone of its robust bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He explained, \u201cIt allows you to essentially take the asset, the biggest, most widely held, most trusted cryptocurrency the world has ever seen, which is Bitcoin, and do stuff with it,\u201d rather than just storing it in a wallet.\n\nThe seamless integration maintains Bitcoin\u2019s value integrity while enabling its active participation in smart contract applications. By transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active, working asset, Rootstock opens up a realm of possibilities for Bitcoin holders to engage in advanced DeFi applications.\n\nThe real-world implications of this integration are vast, ranging from basic financial transactions to lending and borrowing in advanced DeFi applications. Rootstock\u2019s vision goes beyond DeFi, aiming to activate dormant Bitcoin assets and invigorate the global economy. This initiative makes Bitcoin a secure foundation for a wide range of economic activities, offering financial stability and independence to the underbanked and unbanked populations globally.\n\nOvercoming Developmental Challenges\n\n\u201cLaunching a blockchain in itself is a huge effort,\u201d Fogg states, acknowledging the underestimated complexity and collaborative effort needed to bring Rootstock to life. It was an effort that required the collective effort of hundreds of contributors for the RSK network.\n\nMoreover, the DeFi boom on Ethereum presented both a challenge and an opportunity for RSK, initially perceived as niche within the Bitcoin-based DeFi sector. However, RSK\u2019s resilience and innovation eventually positioned it at the heart of the expanding Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.\n\nDecentralization and Security\n\nIn the RSK ecosystem, decentralization and security have a symbiotic relationship where they reinforce each other, creating a robust and scalable blockchain network. \u201cThe decentralization journey, why decentralization and centralization initiatives matter, is that centralization points are points of attack,\u201d Fogg remarks, underlining the intrinsic link between decentralization and security crucial for blockchain scalability.\n\nAs RSK grows, its reliance on Rootstock Labs diminishes, showcasing a transition toward community-driven governance. This model for future blockchain technologies achieves scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization, fostering innovation and participation from a global community.\n\nThe Rootstock Grants Program\n\nWorth mentioning is the Rootstock Grants Program, with its $2.5 million fund. \u201cWe use this essentially as an incentive to encourage developers who are interested in Rootstock and they\u2019ve got an idea or they\u2019ve got a protocol from one network to try and bring it to Rootstock,\u201d Fogg explains.\n\nBy encouraging developers to bring their ideas to Rootstock, the program has catalyzed the launch of significant projects, enhancing the blockchain ecosystem. This initiative reflects Rootstock\u2019s dedication to expanding its ecosystem, promoting a diverse and vibrant blockchain community based on Bitcoin.\n\nThe strategic focus on supporting advanced and everyday DeFi projects aligns with Rootstock\u2019s vision of making financial tools and services inclusive and efficient.\n\n\u201cRight now in 2024, we\u2019re just laser-focused on getting as many DEXs, as many swap mechanisms, as many exchanges, as many wallets onto the network so that we can get the economy spinning,\u201d Fogg emphasizes. These foundational economic protocols lay the groundwork for a decentralized economy where blockchain tech can serve everyday financial activities, promoting global financial inclusivity and independence."

It aims to be the endgame solution for data availability on Ethereum.\n\nRollups can onboard to EigenDA mainnet after the operator set and delegations stabilize, it said.\n\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, we expect high operator turnover in the top 200 active set as new operators, delegations, and AVSs come online.\u201d\n\nIn-protocol payments from AVSs to operators and slashing mechanisms are not included yet, but will be added later in 2023, the announcement noted.\n\nAn AVS is essentially a middleware or service that runs on top of the EigenLayer protocol to provide specific functionality. AVSs act as a layer between Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and the various rollups, blockchains, and networks built on top of the L1 network.\n\nEigenLayer total value locked is currently $13.3 billion, having skyrocketed 1,100% since the beginning of this year, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nEthereum Staking Outlook\n\nThe Ethereum staking ecosystem is extremely healthy, with around 27% of the total circulating supply currently staked.\n\nThis works out at 32.2 million ETH, according to Dune Analytics, worth around $112 billion at current spot prices. Ethereum also has just over a million validators, making it one of the most secure blockchains in the crypto space.\n\nLido remains the dominant liquid staking provider, with 29% of the total amount staked, or $33.2 billion worth of ETH."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe current meme coin hype on Solana (SOL) might be shifting ground to its originator, the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain ecosystem. According to a trade spotlighted by crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a trader made a 69,300% gain on a trade, igniting a feeling of profit return in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the trade highlighted, the whale converted $9,000 into $6.27 million on Ethereum in only one month, making a gain of 693x. The traded meme coin is called $APU, and the traded acquired exactly 2.385 ETH to acquire 8.36 billion APU from March 11 to March 24. Within this time, the price of the meme coin jumped remarkably, giving the trader an unprecedented gain.\n\nPer the on-chain data, the whale is still HODLing a large portion of the token, showing confidence in the meme coin.\n\nIs #MEME season on #Ethereum coming again?\n\n\n\nThis trader turned $9K into $6.27M on #Ethereum in only 1 month, a gain of 693x!\n\n\n\nHe spent 2.385 $ETH($9K) to buy 8.36B $APU from Mar 11 to Mar 24.\n\n\n\nThe 8.36B $APU is now worth $6.27M!https://t.co/hcpCnTWxL1 pic.twitter.com/LXlB5dVSWY \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 11, 2024\n\nOver the past year, the higher gas fee on Ethereum has pushed many traders away, with Solana becoming the preferred destination. With the Solana protocol now experiencing congestion due to heavy traffic, the appeal of Ethereum as the legacy meme coin option is growing across the board. Whether or not this trend will go mainstream soon remains a growing subject of speculation in the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum L2s may appear attractive\n\nWhile the APU trader hit the jackpot with his bet, there is no guarantee that such related trades can be recorded by a majority of traders in the community. Ethereum still has its problem with high transaction fees; however, the recently launched Dencun Upgrade has made its layer-2 scaling solutions more affordable to use, based on trading fees.\n\nThis advantage has positioned Ethereum L2 protocols like Polygon (MATIC), zkSync, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and Base as the preferred destination for meme coin resurgence. With Solana still exploring solutions to correct its outage menace, the Ethereum ecosystem has what it takes to take over meme coin culture."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana prices crashed to trigger $950M liquidations - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana fell significant on the price charts\n\nAlmost $1 billion worth of positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours\n\nFollowing a surge in its price over the past week, Bitcoin [BTC] recorded a significant correction over the last 24 hours. Over the said period, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price fell by 4.95%, with BTC trading at $67,829.94 at the time of writing. Bitcoin fell on the back of traditional markets tanking owing to the geopolitical uncertainty associated with Iran possibly attacking Israel. Accordingly, both the S&P500 and Nasdaq fell, with the value of traditional safe havens like gold appreciating.\n\nThe decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price had a cascading effect, leading to other cryptocurrencies depreciating on the charts too as well.\n\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nDue to the high correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL]\u2018s prices also fell dramatically and suffered a worse fate. SOL fell by 11.93% over the last 24 hours and ETH declined by 8.33% over the same period. Thanks to the same, both SOL and ETH broke past their previously established higher lows, disrupting their ongoing bullish trend on the charts.\n\nIn fact, the price of ETH fell all the way to $3099 during this drawdown. However, after testing this level, it managed to climb back up to $3256.96, at the time of writing.\n\nPreviously, Ethereum had tested this level on 20 March. If Ethereum follows a similar trajectory going forward, it may attain the $3384-level soon.\n\nSolana traced a similar trajectory. Even though the correction was fairly recent, the price movement of Solana since 1 April hinted at a potential decline in price. Since the beginning of the month, SOL had exhibited multiple lower lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.\n\nIn order to rally, a massive resurgence in bullish momentum would be required for both ETH and SOL.\n\nAre whales to blame?\n\nDespite these price corrections, however, interest in BTC and ETH remains high. In fact, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding BTC and ETH grew materially over the last few weeks.\n\nThis indicated that the recent decline in prices could have been caused by the behavior of a few whales who were indulging in profit-taking.\n\nHow are traders holding up?\n\nIn the last 24 hours, $947 million worth of positions were liquidated. Out of this, $824.94 million were long positions. Traders that were bullish on BTC, ETH and SOL lost the most amount of money. At this point in time, however, it\u2019s too soon to say which direction BTC will head in, especially with the halving just over the horizon."

        "content": "Security concerns around Ethereum were explored by analysts.\n\nActivity on the Ethereum network remained high, and interest in NFTs fell.\n\nEthereum [ETH] is known for its reliability and hasn\u2019t faced any major issues. However, questions were raised about the network\u2019s security recently.\n\nLooking into the security aspect\n\nAccording to the findings of crypto analyst Christine Kim, Ethereum\u2019s security model poses certain vulnerabilities. Her analysis delves into potential exploits that attackers might employ against Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\n\nIt examines scenarios such as reorganizations and finality delays, particularly concerning attackers with varying proportions of the total staked ether.\n\nA key insight is that attackers with more significant stakes wield greater influence, as their stake translates into voting power, enabling them to sway the contents of future blocks.\n\nAs the attacker\u2019s stake reaches certain thresholds, their power escalates, leading to outcomes like finality delays, double finality, censorship, and control over both the blockchain\u2019s past and future.\n\nHowever, attacks involving 34%, 51%, or 66% of staked ether might necessitate out-of-band social coordination for resolution. While this could pose challenges for the community, the Ethereum social layer serves as a robust defense mechanism.\n\nAny technically successful attack could potentially be neutralized by the community\u2019s agreement to adopt an honest fork.\n\nThis dynamic creates a race between the attacker and the Ethereum community, where swift social coordination could render the attacker\u2019s investment futile.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nDespite these security concerns, it was business as usual on the Ethereum network. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained consistent over the last month.\n\nThis indicated that activity on the network had remained the same. However, interest in the NFT sector declined significantly during this period.\n\nThe declining NFT trades on the network suggested that the rising activity on the Ethereum network wasn\u2019t driven by interest in NFTs on the network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nComing to ETH\u2019s price, it was trading at $3,522.12 and its price had declined by 1.92% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, the network growth of ETH had also plummeted indicating that new addresses had started to lose interest in the token.\n\nAdditionally, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen, implying that the trading frequency of ETH had decreased."

        "content": "A recent report showed that Hong Kong is forwarding with its plan to potentially allow exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum as early as the coming Monday. This move, as reported by Bloomberg, has bolstered the sentiment of the crypto market enthusiasts, especially following the remarkable success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\n\nIn addition, the update underscores Hong Kong\u2019s ambition to solidify its position as a leading hub for digital assets.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHong Kong To Green-light Bitcoin & Ether ETF\n\nA recent report from Bloomberg suggests that Hong Kong may soon approve Spot ETFs directly investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies. If the speculation holds true, international entities like Harvest Fund Management Co. and a collaboration between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital are expected to receive the green light to launch spot-crypto ETFs.\n\nNotably, these ETFs in Hong Kong are planned to be launched by the end of the month pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and finalization of listing details with the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.\n\nMeanwhile, the reported approval comes on the heels of earlier indications that Harvest Fund Management Co. was on track to secure permission to introduce a Spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong. However, neither the SFC nor Harvest has offered any official comments on the matter.\n\nIn addition, despite the anticipation surrounding the approvals, it\u2019s worth noting that the timeline remains subject to potential last-minute changes, according to sources familiar with the matter. Besides, a previous report from CoinGape showed that Hong Kong previously planned to launch the Ethereum ETF before the U.S.\n\nAlso Read: XRP & BTC Could Bounce After Bitcoin Halving\n\nPotential Implications Of The Approval In Crypto Market\n\nThe imminent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong could have far-reaching implications for the global crypto market. Notably, the advent of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year has already been instrumental in revitalizing the market, with assets under management for such ETFs reaching approximately $59 billion.\n\nThis influx of institutional investment has played a pivotal role in driving the price of Bitcoin to new highs, recently hitting over $73,700 mark in mid-March. Considering that Hong Kong\u2019s move to embrace crypto ETFs also underscores its ongoing competition with cities like Singapore and Dubai to establish itself as a premier destination for digital asset firms.\n\nHowever, despite the positive update, the Bitcoin price traded near the flatline at $70,762.75 during writing. Its trading volume over the last 24 hours dropped by 20.76% to $29.64 billion at the same time.\n\nAlso Read: Messari CEO Eager To Join SEC Investor Advisor Committee, A Pro-Crypto Move?\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is consolidating around $3,500 after several weeks of sideways movement. Despite the recent lull, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, citing upcoming upgrades and potential tailwinds from the approaching Bitcoin halving.\n\nEthereum Pectra Upgrade to Enhance User Experience\n\nThe highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, promises to bring significant improvements to Ethereum wallets and user experience. A key feature of Pectra is EIP-3074, which grants standard crypto wallets smart contract-like capabilities. This allows functionalities like transaction bundling (reducing signing frequency) and sponsored transactions (similar to account abstraction).\n\nHowever, some experts warn of potential security risks associated with EIP-3074, emphasizing the importance of responsible wallet management. Another exciting feature of Pectra is the social recovery option, eliminating the need for complex seed phrases for wallet recovery.\n\nEthereum ETF Approval Remains Uncertain\n\nJP Morgan analysts expressed doubt regarding a spot Ethereum ETF getting approval from the SEC next month. The SEC\u2019s recent investigations into Ethereum-related entities contribute to this pessimism.\n\nIf the ETF is not approved by the May deadline, applicants might challenge the SEC\u2019s decision, potentially leading to legal battles similar to those involving Grayscale and Ripple. While a future approval is likely, it may not happen as soon as May.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strong Fundamentals\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has benefited from the mass adoption of web3 projects and digital assets. It remains the dominant tokenization blockchain despite competition from other Layer-1 solutions.\n\nHigh demand for Ether persists, particularly among institutional investors seeking to diversify their crypto holdings. The potential ETF approval further fuels bullish sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift to a deflationary model through EIP-1559 burn mechanisms adds another layer of value proposition.\n\nPost-Halving FOMO Rally Anticipated\n\nWith the fourth Bitcoin halving event approaching, some analysts predict a surge in Ethereum\u2019s price due to fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Popular crypto analyst Captain Faibik believes Ether has the potential to reach $5,000 in the coming weeks on the back of this post-halving sentiment.\n\nETH/USD Technical Analysis Suggests Potential Breakout\n\nEthereum\u2019s current price action indicates a possible breakout from its consolidation phase. A clear break above $3,550 is seen as a bullish signal."

The volume of all stablecoins is now $72.24 billion, which is 91.65% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, rose to $1.396 trillion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.97%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours fell 26% to $30.3 billion.Technical indicators such as the 30-day moving average and relative strength index suggest increasing momentum without entering overbought territory. Converging resistance and support levels indicate a significant move forward, potentially fueled by a halving.Analysts anticipate a short-term sell-off after the halving but expect long-term price appreciation due to reduced supply. With BTC only 4% off its all-time high, projections suggest it could reach $75,000 by May and $80,000 to $90,000 by Q3 2024."

        "content": "Octoblock recently made waves in the crypto market as its investors collected their first airdrop rewards. This led to a surge of interest from Ethereum (ETH) users seeking innovative and potentially lucrative opportunities.\n\nWhat is a crypto airdrop?\n\nA crypto airdrop refers to the distribution of new coins or tokens to existing cryptocurrency holders or users who perform specific tasks. These tasks could include actions like joining a social media channel, participating in a project's community, or completing certain activities outlined by the project team. Airdrops are commonly used by blockchain projects as a marketing strategy to increase awareness, attract new users, and incentivize engagement within their ecosystem. The tokens awarded can be held or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges to earn profits.\n\nEthereum price exhibits significant strength\n\nAmid the broader market recovery, the Ethereum price has exhibited significant strength, surging by over 7% on April 9. An analysis of the daily chart shows Ethereum\u2019s resilience against heightened selling pressure, with ETH finding robust support around the $3,200 level. This zone aligns with pivotal Fibonacci retracement levels ranging from 0.5 at $3190 to 0.618 at $2972, bolstered further by the 100-day moving average at $2972. Nonetheless, ETH is presently in a phase of sideways consolidation, with many market participants anticipating a bullish resurgence to reclaim the yearly high of $4,100 in the medium term.\n\nWhat is Octoblock?\n\nOctoblock is a revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol the Binance Smart Chain looking to build an ecosystem with a variety of features and services that cater to a wide array of financial needs.\n\nThe Octoblock cFyF (Crowd Funded Yield Farming) mechanism will enable DeFi participants to collectively participate in yield farming activities by contributing funds to a communal yield pool. The pooled funds will enable cFyF participants to access higher-yield farming opportunities than they would individually, leading to better returns.\n\nAdditionally, OCTO holders will get 45% of the profits made by Octoblock's revenue-generating system, the Nautilus Trove. Octoblock also has an enticing sweepstake known as Saltwater, designed not just for entertainment but also to offer tangible rewards. The sweepstake will share 5% of the proceeds with randomly selected addresses within the community.\n\nMoreover, Octoblock, through its Tentacle Trust, will aid organizations involved in the conservation of our oceans and marine life. The OCTO holders will vote monthly to choose the trust\u2019s beneficiaries, contributing effectively to the fight for environmental sustainability.\n\nGoing further, Octoblock will introduce a comprehensive one-stop platform meticulously designed to facilitate seamless bridging and swapping of assets across blockchain networks. This will eliminate the need to navigate through multiple platforms, paving the way for unprecedented ease and functionality in the crypto space.\n\nThe Octoblock ICO airdrop\n\nThe Octoblock Initial Coin Offering (ICO) entered Phase 3 on April 10, selling OCTO at $0.037 with a 13% bonus. As part of its commitment to community engagement, Octoblock initiated a staking mechanism that will immediately incorporate any tokens bought during the ICO. The mechanism is designed to release weekly payouts to investors, with APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) calculated based on the price of OCTO at that particular phase of the offering.\n\nOctoblock announced their first airdrop on April 9 2024. $100 of OCTO would be worth $124 at the time of allocation, meaning an APY of 185.5%. Notably, the project is set to include USDC in the very next airdrop alongside the OCTO token, further enhancing incentives for participation.\n\nMoreover, each token bought in the ICO is regarded as an entry to Octoblock's exclusive giveaway, where one lucky participant will get a new, full-option 2024 Tesla.\n\nFor more information on Octoblock:\n\nWebsite: https://octoblock.io/\n\nBuy OCTO: https://reef.octoblock.io/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.
