        "title": "Cryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.\n\nA defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nKey Takeaways A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.\n\nSome experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.\n\nThe advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.\n\nThe disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.\n\nInvestopedia / Tara Anand\n\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.\n\nCentral to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network.\n\nEvery new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.\n\nExperts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.\n\nTypes of Cryptocurrency\n\nMany cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies.\n\nBecause there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it's important to understand the types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in\u2014a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use.\n\nMost of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category:\n\nUtility : XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.\n\n: XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains. Transactional : Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.\n\n: Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.

Security tokens: Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire.\n\nIf you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate.\n\nHow to Buy Cryptocurrency\n\nIf you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency exchange. These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins.\n\nIf you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your brokerage. For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold Bitcoin futures ETF shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares.\n\n\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Legal?\n\nFiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\"\n\nBut cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure.\n\nIn the U.S.\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets\u2014either as capital gains or ordinary income\u2014depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.\n\nIn the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.\n\nEnthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry.\n\nAs of June 2024, El Salvador is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions. In the rest of the world, cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction.\n\nIn Asia\n\nJapan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.\n\nChina has banned cryptocurrency exchanges, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nIndia was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn Europe\n\nCryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as \"financial instruments.\" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users.\n\nIn addition to the market risks associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks:\n\nUser risk : Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.\n\n: Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent.

An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment. Market Manipulation: Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.\n\nDespite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion. Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.\n\nAdvantages Removes single points of failure\n\nEasier to transfer funds between parties\n\nRemoves third parties\n\nCan be used to generate returns\n\nRemittances are streamlined Disadvantages Transactions are pseudonymous\n\nPseudonymity allows for criminal uses\n\nHave become highly centralized\n\nExpensive to participate in a network and earn\n\nOff-chain security issues\n\nPrices are very volatile\n\n\n\nAdvantages Explained\n\nCryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure\u2014such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S.\n\nCryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake.\n\nBecause they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading.\n\nThe remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement.\n\nDisadvantages Explained\n\nThough they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.\n\nIn theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds.\n\nOne of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars.\n\nOnly 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools.\n\nThough cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments require accurate price monitoring. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble.\n\nIs Crypto Actually a Good Investment? Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.\n\nIs Crypto Real Money? One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money.\n\nHow Does Crypto Make You Money? There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

At this peak, the trader's holdings were valued at $1.94 million, presenting a potential profit of $670,000, or 50% gains. Despite the substantial gain, the trader chose not to sell, possibly holding onto the tokens in anticipation of further price increases, which proved costly.\n\nHowever, the market took an unfavorable turn as PEPE's price began to decline. The downward trend continued, and the value of PEPE fell below the trader's breakeven point of $0.000011.\n\nFacing the sustained drop in PEPE's price, the trader ultimately decided to sell all 114.7 billion tokens. The sale was made at a breakeven price, yielding 366.5 ETH, nearly equivalent to his initial investment of $1.27 million.\n\nAlthough the trader did not incur a financial loss, the missed opportunity for a substantial profit underscores the significance of timing the market perfectly. More often than not, market timing has been found to significantly impact trading outcomes.\n\nAt the time of writing, PEPE had dropped 0.79% in the previous 24 hours to $0.00001204. The frog-themed cryptocurrency has slowly decreased since reaching an all-time high of $0.0000171 on May 27. PEPE struck a low of $0.00001057 in yesterday's trading session as profit-taking continued and the market saw a slump before rebounding rapidly."

        "title": "Ethereum's Tailwind: How the SEC ETF approval boosted Memecoin mania - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Why the Ethereum ETF Effect?\n\nA Look at Key Ethereum Memecoins\n\nLong-Term Impact: A Speculative Future\n\n\n\nInstitutional Interest: A Long Road?\n\n\n\nMemecoins: Flavour of the season\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF, particularly BlackRock 's IBIT, has been the fastest-growing ETF to date, reaching $20 billion in just 137 days. In comparison, the next closest, JEPI, took nearly 1,000 days to achieve the same milestone. Now that the money men have tasted blood, and Ethereum spot ETFs to be listed, there are some interesting developments in the crypto market.While the primary impact is directly on Ethereum, there's been a fascinating secondary effect \u2013 a surge in the valuations of memecoins built on the Ethereum blockchain. Let's understand how this development is impacting the memecoin landscape and what it means for the future.Memecoins, often known for their viral appeal and sometimes questionable utility, have seen significant price boosts following the Ethereum ETF announcement. Notable memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced double-digit percentage gains, while lesser-known tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Dogelon Mars (ELON) skyrocketed by even higher margins.Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. The approval of an Ethereum ETF signifies growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This is also a major development in the industry after the Bitcoin ETF approval which witnessed large volumes of institutional money inflows. This can attract new investors, particularly those with a risk appetite who might explore memecoins as a volatile yet potentially high-reward entry point into the Ethereum ecosystem.The ETF reinforces confidence in Ethereum as a blockchain among users which partially translates to interest and enthusiasm in memecoins built on Ethereum. Compared to memecoins on alternative blockchains like Solana, Ethereum's established developer community, network security, and scalability efforts (like Ethereum 2.0) provide a perceived edge.: One of the OG memecoins, thanks to Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement, DOGE has seen renewed interest. While its utility remains debatable, its brand recognition and loyal community stand to benefit from the Ethereum ETF tailwind.: Known as the \"Dogecoin Killer,\" SHIB has also enjoyed a price increase. Its efforts to build a decentralised ecosystem with its SHIB token, Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain and LEASH governance token might attract investors seeking a more feature-rich memecoin experience within the Ethereum network.: Inspired by Elon Musk's dog of the same name, FLOKI positions itself as a memecoin supporting various charitable causes. The Ethereum ETF effect, coupled with FLOKI's community based initiatives, could attract impact-driven investors seeking memecoin exposure.: This space-themed memecoin, referencing Elon Musk's Mars ambitions, has seen significant gains. While its long-term viability remains to be seen, current market sentiment favours this token as a part of the overall market gains.The long-term impact of the Ethereum ETF on memecoins remains a grey area. While the current surge suggests renewed interest, memecoins are inherently volatile and prone to market corrections. Their long-term success hinges on developing real utility beyond mere hype, something that could be achieved by clear community guidelines and consensus, and of course a concrete regulatory framework.The Ethereum ETF approval gives Ethereum-based memecoins a temporary advantage over those on Solana. While Solana offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees, Ethereum's established reputation and developer base currently hold more sway in market sentiment. However, as market dynamics evolve and Solana continues to develop, this advantage could shift.Apart from reputation risk and uncertainty, institutional interest in memecoins isn't completely unfathomable. Despite their volatility, some memecoins boast massive market capitalizations and active communities. Institutions might see a potential for controlled exposure to capture some of this growth. A small allocation of memecoins could serve as a diversification tool in their broader portfolio. Some memecoins are exploring ways to develop utility, such as integrating with decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols or play-to-earn gaming platforms. This could attract institutions seeking exposure to these emerging trends. If memecoins gain wider mainstream acceptance like in the gaming community or other metaverse projects, and demonstrate long-term stability, institutional attitudes could shift.In May alone, 455,000 tokens were launched on Solana. During the same month, 177,000 tokens were introduced on Base, while Optimism and Arbitrum each saw the launch of 20,000 new tokens. Most of them were memecoins. Virtually everyone understands that investing in meme coins is gambling. In a casino, one is gambling against the house, everyone knows the house always wins. Many people view the stock market in a similar light, which is why GameStop and 'Roaring Kitty' gained traction\u2014because it felt like someone was sticking it to the house. However, people recognize that the house always wins. Meme coins, on the other hand, offer a different dynamic. They provide a sense of peer-to-peer competition rather than betting against the house. It's more about competing with fellow enthusiasts, which is a more exciting and less disheartening game. The PVP (player versus player) nature of it gives people a sense of having a chance. These activities are not controlled by Wall Street suits, which adds to their appeal. It's a way of rebelling against a system perceived as rigged against the average investor.The SEC 's approval of the Ethereum ETF has had an unexpected but fascinating consequence \u2013 a resurgence in Ethereum-based memecoins. While the long-term viability of these tokens is uncertain, the current market sentiment favours established blockchains like Ethereum. This, along with the potential influx of new investors, has created a short-term boost for these memecoins. However, for the enthusiasm to continue, these tokens will need to evolve beyond mere internet hype and demonstrate tangible utility."

        "content": "Sat 15 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nThe world of traditional finance is in the midst of a transformation with BlackRock\u2019s decision to favor public blockchains, especially Ethereum, for its blockchain-based financial products. This major shift marks a turning point in the adoption of public blockchains. It also opens the door to a deeper integration of this technology into the workings of financial markets.\n\nPublic blockchains, particularly Ethereum, represent the future (Source: Twitter)\n\nBlackRock and public blockchains: a new direction\n\nUntil now, BlackRock tended to favor private blockchains. However, experience has shown that public blockchains, like Ethereum, offer significant advantages in terms of transparency, accessibility, and governance.\n\nTransparency on Ethereum\n\nTransactions on Ethereum are visible to everyone, allowing investors to track capital flows in real-time and ensure the proper execution of operations. This increased transparency is essential for:\n\nstrengthening trust in blockchain-based financial products,\n\nattracting a broader audience of investors.\n\nAccessibility\n\nPublic blockchains (like Ethereum) are open to everyone. This allows anyone to participate in the network and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) built on them. This open accessibility fosters innovation and the creation of new financial products.\n\nGovernance\n\nEthereum and all other public blockchains are managed in a decentralized manner.\n\nExplanation: users have a say in the development and evolution of the platform. This participatory governance promotes accountability.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s first tokenization project on Ethereum\n\nTo solidify its commitment to public blockchains, BlackRock launched its first tokenization project on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis project involves converting a traditional investment fund, \u201cInstitutional Digital Liquidity,\u201d into digital tokens based on Ethereum. These digital tokens, denominated in USD Coin (USDC), provide investors with transparent and secure access to portfolio diversification.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to adopt Ethereum is a strong signal of the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum and Uniswap prices have grabbed the crypto community\u2019s attention with slight recoveries driven by significant accumulation from a wallet linked to Amber Group. Notably, the wallet\u2019s substantial buy-up, totaling around $20 million, has sparked optimism about potential price movements and the broader implications for the market amid current volatility.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the recent accumulation pattern and see the potential reasons that might keep the momentum consistent.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum & Uniswap Price Soars Anticipation Amid $20M Accumulation\n\nA wallet related to Amber Group made waves in the cryptocurrency world by amassing $20 million worth of Ethereum and Uniswap. According to the on-chain transaction tracking platform Lookonchain, the wallet withdrew 987,053 UNI, valued at $10.6 million, and 2,638 ETH, worth $9.2 million, from Binance within just three hours today.\n\nMeanwhile, this large-scale accumulation has fueled a slight recovery in both Ethereum and Uniswap prices. Notably, the news has generated significant buzz among investors, eager to see if this momentum will be sustained in the face of a fluctuating market.\n\nMarket analysts suggest that this substantial purchase by a major player like Amber Group could indicate strong confidence in these assets\u2019 future prospects. However, some caution that while such accumulation can trigger short-term price increases, the challenge lies in maintaining this upward trajectory.\n\nNotably, the broader market dynamics and ongoing volatility play a crucial role in determining whether these gains will hold.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Ethereum Exchange Reserve Plunges, Price To Recover?\n\nWill The Rally Sustain?\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price recovery has been buoyed by expectations surrounding the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF approval. The SEC has already accepted the 19b-4 filings for Ether ETF as of May 23. Besides, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has recently hinted that the approval for Ethereum Spot ETF could come by the end of summer, adding to market optimism.\n\nIn addition, a senior Bloomberg ETF analyst anticipates that the Spot Ethereum ETF might get approved around July 2. This potential timeline projection has further boosted Ethereum\u2019s market confidence, making it a focal point for investors betting on its sustained growth.\n\nSuch regulatory advances are crucial, as they enhance Ethereum\u2019s appeal to institutional investors, driving potential price support and long-term growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Uniswap has shown significant growth in its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. According to a recent X post from Uniswap Labs, the protocol\u2019s all-time L2 volume has reached $300 billion.\n\nNotably, the timeline to reach each $100 billion milestone has accelerated dramatically:\n\n22 months for $100 billion.\n\n10 months for $200 billion.\n\n3 months to achieve $300 billion.\n\nThis rapid growth underscores increasing user adoption and heightened transaction volumes on Layer 2 (L2) platforms, reflecting a robust uptrend. Besides, this impressive growth trajectory has strengthened investor confidence in Uniswap\u2019s continued expansion and the potential rise in demand for UNI tokens.\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum price soared 0.50% and exchanged hands at $3,533.98, with its trading volume soaring 13% to $16.13 billion. On the other hand, Uniswap price noted a surge of 1.91% to $10.96, while its volume soared more than 34% to $360.5 million.\n\nNotably, as of writing, Ethereum Futures Open Interest rose 2.59% to $15.80 billion, while Ethereum Options Open Interest surged 1.63% to $6.38 billion. Simultaneously, Uniswap Futures Open Interest rose 3.61% to $122.17 million.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "title": "3 Ethereum Crypto Losers of the Week: Should You Buy, Sell, or HODL? - CoinGape",
        "content": "With the global cryptocurrency market going through a volatile week with major price changes, investors must decide whether to buy, sell or hold (hodl). This article analyses three Ethereum tokens, Wormhole (W), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Worldcoin (WLD), which have all seen significant losses during the week. This article will delve deep into details about these top Ethereum crypto losers.\n\n1. Wormhole (W)\n\nLosses: 34.74%\n\nadvertisement\n\nWormhole (W) has recorded 34.74% in losses for its investors in the past week, to trade at $0.4585 today. This price performance has resulted in a market cap of $826.01 million.\n\nExamining the EMA indicators shows a dominant selling sentiment, as both the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicate a downward trend in different time frames.\n\nThe bearish trend is supported by the MACD Level, which shows selling pressure with a negative value. Moreover, the RSI value indicates a neutral sentiment, suggest that W is neither overbought or oversold.\n\nFibonacci pivot points indicate that there is a level of support at $0.3116 and a level of resistance at $0.7879. Based on the current price, there is a notable gap to the closest support level, indicating possible additional decreases prior to a change in direction.\n\n2. Floki Inu (FLOKI)\n\nLosses: 28.52%\n\nRecording a market cap of $1.97 billion, Floki Inu (FLOKI) has experienced significant price fluctuations during the week. The value of FLOKI declined by 28.52% over the past week, to appear on the list of Ethereum crypto losers today, with a price of $0.0002061.\n\nThe technical analysis of the meme coin mainly a bearish sentiment, as both EMA and SMA indicators signal a downward trend.\n\nThe negative value of the MACD Level supports this belief by showing selling pressure. Additionally, the RSI reading indicates an oversold condition, potentially presenting a chance for investors to buy.\n\nFibonacci support level is at $0.0001608803 while the resistance level is at $0.0003310183. FLOKI is nearing its support level, indicating that it could potentially stabilize in the near future.\n\n3. Worldcoin (WLD)\n\nLosses: 21.77%\n\nWorldcoin (WLD) finalises the list of the top Ethereum crypto losers, trading at $3.49. This demonstrates a decline of 21.77% in its price over the past week, resulting into a market cap of $838.78 million .\n\nThe technical analysis shows mostly bearish sentiment, as both EMA and SMA indicators are signaling a downward trend.\n\nThe negative MACD Level reinforces this view by showing selling pressure. Moreover, the RSI value indicates that a potential buying opportunity could be nearing as the token nears oversold territory.\n\nFibonacci support can be seen at $0.3116 while resistance is located at $0.7879. A price closer to the support level indicates potential stabilization or recovery.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe recent market crash has resulted in significant opportunities and challenges in the crypto market, including these Ethereum crypto losers of the week. The strong bearish signals for Wormhole (W) indicate a recommendation to sell. Floki Inu (FLOKI) warrants a hold until more clearer signals become apparent due to its mixed indicators.

        "title": "Altcoins: Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Ethereum Exchange Reserve Plunges, Price To Recover? - CoinGape",
        "content": "In latest developments, the top 10 exchange wallets for altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and Ethereum (ETH) have seen a significant decrease in their holdings since May 27, 2024. To be specific, Shiba Inu\u2019s exchange supply has shrunk by 2.4%, Chainlink by 2.9%, and Ethereum by 8.6%.\n\nMoreover, such reductions in exchange reserves are generally interpreted as bullish indicators by traders. Hence, a potential for price recovery could be witnessed for SHIB, ETH, and LINK. Currently, all these cryptocurrencies are grappling with a downtrend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, the SHIB price was $0.00002175, up by 0.38% on Friday, June 14. This price movement places Shiba Inu at a pivotal point, encountering a significant barrier at $0.000022. If Shiba Inu can surpass this resistance, it may climb to $0.000025, with the possibility of reaching $0.00003.\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could push Shiba Inu down to $0.000021, and it might fall further to $0.00002 if market sentiment deteriorates. Whilst, technical analysis indicates that SHIB might be entering a consolidation phase. The MACD indicator reveals a convergence towards the signal line, hinting at a possible slowdown or reversal in momentum.\n\nWith the MACD line currently beneath the signal line, it signifies weak bullish momentum. Currently, the Shiba Inu RSI is at 37, suggesting a neutral market stance, as SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. However, the RSI is nearing 30, which signals a oversold condition is looming. In the aftermath of such conditions, the price generally rebounds.\n\nMoreover, the reduction in Shiba Inu supply due to decreasing exchange reserve and frequent burns could also catalyze a rebound. On the flip side, most oscillators and moving averages on the daily chart are issuing sell signals. The 50-EMA being above the 20-EMA suggests a potential downward trend.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Coin Bull Run Ahead As SHIB Burn Rate Spikes Further\n\nChainlink (LINK) Outlook\n\nAt press time, Chainlink is traded at $15.32, down by 0.90%. This decline has triggered long liquidations, which account for over 95% of total liquidations, signaling a short-term price decline. However, the diminishing exchange reserve could lead to a rebound in the long term due to a reduced supply.\n\nAs exchange supplies decrease, it often points to accumulation by investors, which can drive prices up as supply dwindles. Moreover, the Chainlink price has sustained a profit of over 14% in the last 30 days despite the recent bearish turn. Hence, it could mirror the momentum for a reversal as the LINK open interest has also surged.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Prospect Following ETF Approval\n\nAccording to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply has seen the most significant reduction among the three cryptocurrencies, dropping by 8.6%. This substantial decrease is viewed positively by bullish traders as it may indicate strong accumulation and potential for future price increases.\n\nRecently, Ethereum\u2019s market narrative is also being shaped by regulatory developments. Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe highlighted a statement from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF might be listed during the summer. This anticipation signals a final correction before a substantial price surge, according to Poppe.\n\nThe approval of Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings is expected to have a profound impact on ETH\u2019s price. It could potentially push the ETH price above $4,000 immediately after the ETF listing. Furthermore, Standard Chartered has projected that this development could even drive Ether\u2019s price to exceed $8,000 by the end of the year. Such optimistic forecasts are underpinned by the expected influx of institutional investment following the ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nAlso Read: Whale Heavily Bags SHIB, ETH, CRV, & Others, What\u2019s Next?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTelegram-based clicker game Notcoin (NOT) is the top gainer out of the top 100 crypto tokens, after leaping 10% in the past 24 hours. This comes amid The Open Network (TON), the blockchain that Notcoin uses, matching Ethereum for daily active wallets.\n\nNotcoin has racked up a player base of 35 million users, hitting a peak of five million daily active users back in March. But it wasn\u2019t enough for TON to flip Ethereum\u2019s daily active wallets. It wasn\u2019t until May 17 when TON flipped Ethereum for the first time.\n\nThe two networks traded places a couple of times until June 2 when TON led the charge for nine consecutive days, according to Artemis Terminal. Since June 10, the pair have been neck and neck. At the time of writing, TON is currently trailing by only 4,000 daily active addresses.\n\nIn turn, TON is up 5% in the past 24 hours and 5.5% over the past week, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Open Network has had a good 2024. After the success of Notcoin, a slew of new Telegram-based games launched. And the team has said it has plans of releasing a token on the network.\n\nRecently the clicker game Hamster Kombat hit 100 million players, claiming the crown for the single largest Telegram channel. Now the game is planning a tentative token launch in July, which will see players convert in-game points to crypto tokens.\n\nTapswap and Yescoin are two new Telegram games looking to launch tokens on TON. The former, which claims 50 million players, previously offered Solana wallet integration but is now looking to launch its token on TON. While the former, Yescoin, is looking to bring its 18 million users to The Open Network, with over 6 million already connecting their wallets.\n\nThis explosion of new games launching with tokens on the horizon has led to TON becoming the 10th largest crypto token by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, beating out Cardano for the spot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Aethir has launched its decentralized cloud computing network on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe value of its ATH token may plunge in the short term.\n\nAethir, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) provider, launched its decentralized cloud computing network on the Ethereum [ETH] mainnet on 12th June.\n\nThe protocol allows users to rent high-performance computing resources needed for training artificial intelligence (AI) and rendering digital content.\n\nThis service is crucial for organizations that require significant computational power as it offers flexibility and scalability for their operations.\n\nAethir\u2019s mainnet launch comes with a native token, ATH.\n\nATH is required for governance and security within the Aethir ecosystem, staking on the Ethereum network, and payment to compute providers through Arbitrum [ARB].\n\nThis mainnet launch comes seven months after its testnet launch on 7th November 2023 on Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nIn its announcement, Aethir confirmed that its user base exceeded 500,000 on its testnet, and it completed a $146 million node sale.\n\nATH pursues new lows\n\nFollowing ATH\u2019s launch, its price skyrocketed by almost 100% before correcting. At press time, ATH exchanged hands at $0.073. According to CoinGecko, its price has declined by 14% in the past 24 hours.\n\nIts daily trading volume totaled $261 million during that period, rising by 38%. The opposite movements of ATH\u2019s price and trading volume indicated the presence of significant bearish sentiment in the token\u2019s market.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s price declines while its trading volume surges within the same period, it signals a spike in selling pressure. This means that most token holders are looking to sell their positions, hence the downtrend in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nAn assessment of ATH\u2019s key technical indicators on an hourly chart confirmed the steady decline in the demand for the altcoin.\n\nFor example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 44.88 and 34.85 at press time.\n\nThese indicators measure an asset\u2019s overbought and oversold conditions by tracking its price momentum and changes. At these values, ATH\u2019s RSI and MFI suggest that market participants prefer to sell their holdings rather than accumulate new tokens.\n\nThis trend was confirmed by ATH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of money into and out of its market. As of this writing, this indicator\u2019s value was -0.23.\n\nA negative CMF value is a sign of market weakness. It signals liquidity exit from the market, a precursor to further price decline.\n\nIf ATH\u2019s selling pressure continues to increase, its price might decline toward $0.048.\n\nHowever, if the bulls re-emerge and token accumulation begins to climb, ATH\u2019s value might rally toward $0.078."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 7% in the last seven days.\n\nMost metrics and market indicators hinted at a trend reversal.\n\nThe end of May for Ethereum [ETH] was bullish as the token\u2019s daily chart showed a massive green candlestick. But last week wasn\u2019t in investors\u2019 interest as the token dropped substantially.\n\nHowever, the declining price trend might change soon, which might allow ETH to retest its March highs.\n\nEthereum enters a bullish pattern\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 7% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,516.89 with a market capitalization of over $422 billion.\n\nInvestors\u2019 shouldn\u2019t get disheartened as a bullish pattern emerged on the token\u2019s daily chart. AMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s price has been consolidating inside a bullish flag pattern.\n\nThe token entered the pattern after reaching its May high. At press time, the token\u2019s price was testing the support near the lower limit of the bullish flag pattern.\n\nA successful test could initiate a bull rally. If that happens, then it would be surprising to see Ethereum retest its March highs of $4k in the coming weeks.\n\nWill ETH test the pattern?\n\nIt will be crucial for ETH to register a few green candlesticks in the coming days in order for ETH to test the bullish flag pattern. To see whether that\u2019s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed CryptoQuant\u2019s data.\n\nAs per our analysis, ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was dropping, meaning that buying pressure on the token was high. Additionally, the total number of coins transferred has increased by 13.93% over the last 24 hours, which can be inferred as a bullish signal.\n\nThings in the derivatives market also looked optimistic as ETH\u2019s funding rate rose. This meant that long-position traders are dominant and are willing to pay short-position traders.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data pointed out that ETH\u2019s NVT ratio dropped last week. Whenever the metric drops, it means that an asset is undervalued, which usually results in price upticks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price touched the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands, hinting at a rebound. Moreover, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark.\n\nNonetheless, the MACD displayed a bearish advantage in the market, which could cause trouble for ETH\u2019s recovery.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap to look for possible support and resistance levels. We found that if ETH turns bullish in the coming days, investors might witness ETH touch $3,675 in the coming days.\n\nHowever, if ETH fails to test the bullish flag pattern, then the token might drop to $3,500 in the short term."

        "content": "In addition to Solana, Altcoin Sherpa is known for offering insights into several other crypto trends. Recently, he highlighted Avalanche (AVAX) as a potential candidate for a significant rally.\n\nDespite AVAX dropping slightly from its recent highs to around $32.07, Sherpa remains optimistic. He has pointed out that AVAX has shown resilience by holding the $31.18 support level, which could signal a bullish continuation if market conditions stabilize.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) positions itself as a scalable blockchain platform capable of handling high throughput and supporting decentralized applications. It is a layer one blockchain that allows blockchain developers to develop and launch decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks.\n\nIt is one of Ethereum\u2019s rivals, aiming to unseat Ethereum as the most popular blockchain for smart contracts alongside Solana, which has also seen increased activity, especially with the launch of meme coins."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s network saw more NFT sales than Ethereum\u2019s over the past week.\n\nFloor prices of BAYC and CryptoPunks fell to multi-month lows too\n\nThe sales volumes of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin [BTC] network surged last week, exceeding that of Ethereum [ETH], according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nOver the aforementioned period, Bitcoin\u2019s NFT sales volume totalled $43 million, rising by 26%. Although Ethereum\u2019s weekly NFT sales volume also rose by 17%, it amounted to \u201cjust\u201d $40 million.\n\nThis, notwithstanding the fact that 99,297 NFT transactions were completed on Ethereum last week. Bitcoin, on the other hand, recorded 55,351 NFT transactions.\n\nOver the last 14 days, the total value of all NFTs sold on the Bitcoin network was $77.02 million. According to CryptoSlam, Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales volume over the same period was $71 million.\n\nState of the NFT market\n\nThe previous week was marked by a decline in the general cryptocurrency market. In fact, global cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by 4% in just 7 days.\n\nThis decline affected the NFT ecosystem, which also fell in value. According to NFTGo, last week\u2019s NFT trading volume amounted to $85.39 million, dropping by 3% on the charts.\n\nThis led to a fall in NFT market capitalization \u2013 worth $7 billion at press time \u2013 after depreciating by 11% in the last seven days.\n\nFloor prices hit new lows\n\nA look at the leading NFT collection, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), revealed a decline in its floor price over the past few weeks.\n\nAfter peaking at 13.7 ETH on 31 May, the floor price of an NFT in the BAYC collection has since declined by 25%, as per NFTPriceFloor.\n\nThe last time BAYC\u2019s floor price was this low was on 15 April.\n\nOver the past month, BAYC has seen a decline in sales volume as the daily count of traders buying and selling NFT pieces from the collection decreased. In the last 30 days, BAYC\u2019s sales volume totalled $12 million, having plummeted by 34%.\n\nAs far as the CryptoPunks NFT collection is concerned, its floor price was 27.42 ETH at press time, representing its year-to-date lowest.\n\nAfter peaking at 63 ETH on 24 January, the average price of an NFT in the collection has since fallen by a massive 57%."

        "content": "The Open Network (TON), originally developed as Telegram Open Network to enhance the popular messaging app, has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) in daily active addresses throughout June.\n\nDespite Telegram stepping back due to regulatory issues, an independent community has driven TON\u2019s growth, leveraging Telegram\u2019s 900 million users and integrated crypto wallet.\n\nDelphi Digital highlighted TON\u2019s impressive growth in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), noting that TON\u2019s daily active addresses have surpassed Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Flippening CT ignores \ud83d\udd0d\n\n\n\nTON's quiet growth, fueled by Telegram's 900M user base, has driven its daily active addresses above Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAt its core, TON is a bet on Telegram's distribution. Though the ecosystem is nascent, its early growth is promising. But is it enough? pic.twitter.com/k2b2SMiQJD \u2014 Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) June 10, 2024\n\nThey attributed this achievement to Telegram\u2019s massive user base but questioned whether TON\u2019s growth could be sustained long-term to permanently surpass Ethereum.\n\nTON and Ethereum compete in active addresses\n\nDaily active addresses (DAA) are defined by Artemis as the number of unique wallets engaging in transactions on a blockchain each day.\n\nDaily active addresses and daily transactions in Ton and Ethereum networks. Source: Artemis\n\n\n\nSince May 17, TON and Ethereum have been closely matched. However, TON gained an edge at the beginning of June, surpassing Ethereum on 10 out of the first 11 days.\n\nOn June 3, TON reached a record 568,300 DAAs, a level Ethereum hasn\u2019t seen since September 13, 2023.\n\nDespite these impressive figures, Ethereum has been actively pushing transactions to layer 2 scaling solutions, which have attracted significant user activity.\n\nOn June 11 alone, three of Ethereum\u2019s top layer 2 solutions\u2014Arbitrum (ARB), Base, and Optimism (OP)\u2014boasted a combined 1.3 million daily active addresses.\n\nFactors driving TON\u2019s surge\n\nThe recent surge in activity on TON is driven by an ecosystem of mini-applications, including chatbots and games.\n\nNotcoin, a free game on Telegram with over 35 million users, launched its cryptocurrency NOT in May, reaching a market cap of $2.1 billion. Other popular games like Hamster Kombat and Catizen have nearly 33.6 million and 3.6 million users, respectively.\n\nTelegram also hosts TON-native trading bots like sTONks, which are expected to enhance the user experience for traders. Additionally, the introduction of Telegram Stars, an in-app currency for digital purchases, has further enhanced user interaction.\n\nThe future of TON and web3\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) in TON has grown dramatically from $22.9 million to over $500 million since March, marking an impressive increase within just three months.\n\nBREAKING: $500M Total Value Locked (TVL) \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nThe GDP of a small country is in use across #TON's apps. This incredible achievement is yours, TON Community!\n\n\n\nFrom $22.9M TVL in March 2024 to more than half a billion today \u2013 over 2,000% increase. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still only the beginning.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bE3xqohACG \u2014 TON \ud83d\udc8e (@ton_blockchain) June 13, 2024\n\nThe number of active Toncoin wallets has surged from 1.28 million at the start of 2024 to over 8 million. This growth reflects the network\u2019s expanding user base and the increasing adoption of Toncoin for various financial activities.\n\nIf you are starting on crypto, I will strongly recommend you to have a look at $TON / @ton_blockchain\n\n\n\nSuper early. Super quick. Easy to build.\n\n\n\nMoreover, run by @telegram .\n\n\n\nFew more weeks, you will see $TON over 10$ \ud83d\udd2e pic.twitter.com/ONRBCFKsmc \u2014 Crypto King\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc8e.eth.sol (@cryptosanthoshK) June 11, 2024\n\nCrypto influencer Crypto King recently recommended Toncoin to new investors, emphasizing its fast and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. He noted the credibility of the development team, which also developed Telegram, suggesting that this could lead to a significant price spike for Toncoin, potentially reaching $10 in the near future.\n\nIn a technical analysis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified a potential 40% breakout for Toncoin, targeting an ambitious price point of $11.\n\nAt press time, Toncoin is trading at $8.03, reflecting a 6.63% increase over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe rise of TON reflects broader trends in the crypto ecosystem, where platforms that successfully integrate blockchain technology with existing user bases can achieve rapid growth.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to be a major player with its layer 2 solutions, TON\u2019s success illustrates the dynamic and competitive nature of the crypto market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
