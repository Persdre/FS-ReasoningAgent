        "title": "Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that following the Dencun hard fork, scaling on Ethereum is no longer a \u201czero-to-one\u201d problem but rather a \u201cone-to-N\u201d problem.\n\nInitially, Ethereum\u2019s development was centered around building its foundational infrastructure, effectively going from non-existence (zero) to establishing the baseline of a functional ecosystem (one). This phase was marked by significant challenges, like limited scalability and high transaction fees. These issues constrained Ethereum\u2019s ability to support widespread adoption of dapps and maintain operational efficiency.\n\nFollowing the Dencun update, Ethereum has pivoted to a more scalable infrastructure, highlighted by innovations such as proto-danksharding and, importantly, \u201cblobs\u201d for more efficient data handling and notably lower transaction costs. These advancements mark a transition from laying down the network\u2019s foundational framework to enhancing and broadening its capabilities. Developers will now work to scale from a solid baseline (one) to new, undefined heights (represented as N; an indefinite, but foreseeably large number).\n\nRead more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live on Ethereum on March 13. It featured EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which introduced \u201cblob\u201d transactions or sharded data. These transactions are designed to place data into \u201cblobs\u201d and guarantee data availability, subsequently reducing transaction costs on rollups.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, Buterin notes that important scaling work still needs to be done, like improving rollups\u2019 ability to optimize each blob, though the fundamental problems around scaling have already been addressed.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been slowly shifting from becoming a layer-1 ecosystem to a layer-2-centric ecosystem, with many applications moving towards building on layer-2s.\n\nWith this in mind, Buterin remarks that the next stage of Ethereum development will likely focus on bringing data availability sampling (DAS) to life, specifically PeerDAS.\n\nPeerDAS is designed to reuse battle-tested peer-to-peer components to enhance Ethereum data availability scaling beyond EIP-4844 while minimizing the amount of work that honest nodes need to do.\n\nRead more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone\n\n\u201cIn PeerDAS, each node stores a significant fraction (e.g. 1/8) of all blob data, and nodes maintain connections to many peers in the p2p network. When a node needs to sample for a particular piece of data, it asks one of the peers that it knows is responsible for storing that piece,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nUsing PeerDAS, more solo stakers can also participate in securing the network. They can download 1/8th of the data instead of a full blob, which helps decentralize the network.\n\nBesides DAS, Buterin also highlights four key areas of improvement for layer-2s. First, he notes that layer-2s can explore data compression techniques to decrease byte size for transactions. Secondly, it is worthwhile exploring Plasma as a technique, which will mean that data is only posted on layer-1s in exceptional circumstances.\n\nRead more: What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again?\n\nAdditionally, he remarks that layer-2s should investigate improving execution-related constraints and security as well as code reliability, noting that existing ecosystem standards are too lenient.\n\n\u201cEthereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem. It\u2019s a full-stack replacement for large parts of \u2018centralized tech,\u2019 and even provides some things that centralized tech does not. And we need to build with this broader ecosystem in mind,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Asset Manager Says Ethereum ETFs Could Be Even Bigger Than Bitcoin ETFs: Where Investors Are Placing Their Bets - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a catalyst for Bitcoin. They brought in billions of dollars and helped propel Bitcoin to new highs before its upcoming halving. These ETFs were the first of their kind, allowing equity investors to gain direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. Their approval has sparked significant discussions revolving around spot ETFs of some of the other top tokens, with Ethereum ETFs at the forefront.\n\nThe second-largest token by market cap, Ethereum focuses on providing a platform for and access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The blockchain hosts some of the top projects in crypto, ranging from AI tokens to meme coins and everything in between.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nAbout 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nTalks of an Ethereum ETF have been heating up. While applications were submitted throughout 2023, Bitcoin ETFs overshadowed them in discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Bitcoin ETFs released, regulators and potential sponsors are ramping up ETH ETF discussions.\n\nMost analysts believe that Ethereum ETFs will be approved because Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent and demand from investors exists. Ethereum ETFs are more a question of when rather than if.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has unique characteristics that could make it a great fit for investors. Specifically, Ethereum's consensus mechanism allows users to stake tokens in exchange for fees. In practice, it works similarly to stock lending, which can allow you to earn extra cash on assets you are holding.\n\n\"The world of investors who are looking for cash-producing assets is massive and ETH obviously generates fees that go to the token holders,\" said VanEck Portfolio Manager Pranav Kanade.\n\nVanEck is one of the companies that released a Bitcoin ETF in January and has applied for an Ethereum ETF. Kanade added that \"from a market perspective, part of me believes that the market size for a spot ETH ETF is potentially as big if not bigger than the spot Bitcoin ETFs,\" showing that he is confident in ETH's ability to attract investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful ETFs in history, attracting more investment than any other ETF in its first months of launch.\n\nMarkets seem to agree with Kanade. Ethereum is up over 100% in the past six months. Additionally, tokens that focus on staking, which is one of the major appealing aspects of ETH, have seen solid price increases recently: Avalanche (AVAX) is up nearly 500% in the past six months, and EigenLayer has attracted more than $11 billion in investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shown interest in staking outside of Ethereum and for Ethereum in general. Spot Ethereum ETFs would combine the two, potentially creating an ETF sector larger than that of Bitcoin.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Asset Manager Says Ethereum ETFs Could Be Even Bigger Than Bitcoin ETFs: Where Investors Are Placing Their Bets originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Litecoin Price Spikes After CFTC Calls It Commodity Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMeme coin lovers may be having a great month, but Litecoin (LTC) hodlers are celebrating today with their coin taking the spot as the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a bullish performance in the last 24 hours that saw its price spike nearly 11%.\n\nThis comes on the fifth day of relatively slow markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting by less than 2% in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today sits at $2.79 trillion, marking a mere -0.1% change in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe most significant non-technical event contributing to Litecoin's spike is a recent statement by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, the CFTC declared Litecoin a commodity. This statement is crucial as it places Litecoin outside the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities and imposes stricter responsibilities on coin issuers.\n\n\u201cKuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing declared a commodity potentially opens the door for more comfortable endorsements and further integrations for Litecoin, with less fear of the SEC attempting enforcement actions.\n\nLitecoin started the day at $94.80 and traded sideways until 6am UTC, when bulls took over the markets and spiked the coin to its daily high of $106 before correcting slightly to its current mark of $104.99. The coin is up 11.56% in the last 24 hours and 21.71% in the last week, plus 27.5% in the last 30 days. Friday marks the second best performing day of the year for LTC, only behind an 18.7% spike on March 11.\n\nOn the technical side, Litecoin was trading sideways during January and February, bouncing in a horizontal channel between $63 and $77. The coin broke its channel on February 29 and started a bullish trend on March 1. Most of the positive performance registered in 2024 has been due to March's positive results. Since the bottom of the channel to today's high, there has been a roughly 63% spike.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nPast data shows that many of the unusually large candlesticks are followed by a correction of many small-bodied candlesticks in the days after. Litecoin failed to break past the resistance set by March 11's spike, which could point to a possible cup-and-handle pattern: A big spike followed by a symmetrical period of a correction, and a recovery that cancels all the losses almost in a semi-circle shape. If this is the case, there should be a smaller correction followed by a similar recovery before a bullish breakout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, the coin looks bullish and healthy in a longer timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the coin is slightly overbought with a 66% dominance of bulls over bears, with Litecoin proving its bullishness after bouncing from its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 55 and going back again to trade on top of the EMA 10.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nGiven that the coin is bullish in charts set at 24 hour candlesticks and in weekly candlesticks for the first time since June of 2023, an immediate resistance could be around $115 for a 10% gain. If it remains strongly bullish, the next one appears to be near $135 for a nearly 29% gain. However, if it fails to meet expectations and corrects down, it could drop somewhere near the $80 price line for a -22.5% loss.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin pushes for anti-correlation incentives in Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller players.\n\nVitalik Buterin writing a proposal to improve decentralization for Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new framework to incentivize Ethereum decentralization by penalizing correlated failures among validators.\n\nAccording to the research proposal submitted by Buterin, large-scale staking groups, and organizations have an undue advantage over smaller players, creating an imbalance in the decentralized staking sector.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that if you are a single large actor, any mistakes that you make would be more likely to be replicated across all \u201cidentities\u201d that you control, even if you split your coins up among many nominally-separate accounts,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder said.\n\nButerin suggests that validators controlled by the same entity should receive a higher penalty if they fail together, compared to failing independently. The theory behind this approach is that mistakes made by a single large actor are more likely to be replicated across all the \u201cidentities\u201d they control.\n\nStaking pools and liquid staking services such as Lido remain popular among users, given how their platform allows for the participation of more stakers due to the lower amount of entry (in ETH). To date, Lido currently has an estimated $34 billion worth of ETH staked, representing around 30% of the total supply. Advocates and developers pushing for Ethereum decentralization have previously cautioned against Lido\u2019s dominance and the potential for \u201ccartelization,\u201d where outsized profits can be extracted compared to non-pooled capital.\n\nButerin\u2019s analysis of recent attestation data revealed that validators within the same cluster, such as a staking pool, are more likely to experience correlated failures, likely due to shared infrastructure. To address this issue, he proposed penalizing validators proportionally to the deviation from the average failure rate. If many validators fail in a given slot, the penalty for each failure would be higher.\n\nBased on simulations of this scenario, such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller ones, as large entities are more likely to cause spikes in the failure rate due to correlated failures.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s potential benefits include incentivizing Ethereum decentralization by encouraging separate infrastructure for each validator and making solo staking more economically competitive relative to staking pools. Buterin notes that other options could be subjected to further analysis. This includes variations on the penalty schemes in order to minimize the average \u201cbig\u201d validator\u2019s advantage over smaller validators.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it\u2019s also worth examining the impact of such a framework in terms of geographic and client decentralization. However, he did not mention the possibility of reducing the solo staking amount from the current 32 Ether (ETH) or approximately $111,000 based on Ether\u2019s current price at roughly $3,500."

        "content": "Despite having little to no purpose, some memecoins have valuations in the billions.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin suggested tying them to charity or finding other ways to tap taders' desire for fun and profit.\n\nEvery day, crypto traders swap billions of dollars of memecoins \u2014 defiantly useless tokens with tickers that often point to internet memes like Pepe the Frog.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks there\u2019s a better way.\n\nMemecoin creators should set aside a large chunk of tokens for charitable causes \u2014 or, better yet, create crypto-based video games designed to help low-income players, he said on his blog Friday.\n\n\u201cI have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1,\u201d he wrote, referencing a rash of offensive memecoins on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I value people\u2019s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\u201d\n\nMemecoin mania\n\nDogecoin is the original meme coin. It was made as a joke in 2015, poking fun at the speculative frenzy that often overtook the crypto economy.\n\nIt was not meant to be digital cash or digital gold, a la bitcoin. It did not represent governance rights in a digital cooperative, like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB. It had no built-in yield, no peg to some other stable asset.\n\nBut Dogecoin\u2019s market capitalisation surged to more than $88 billion during the 2021 bull market. And paved the way for other similarly silly, useless tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLast year, PEPE took Ethereum by storm. This year, Dogwifhat surged on Solana. Both now have market capitalizations above $3 billion.\n\nMost have no intrinsic value, and their values are determined entirely by hype and an investors\u2019 gain (or loss) by the timing of his or her exit.\n\nMemecoins have accounted for roughly 5% of Ethereum transaction fees over the past month, according to data gathered by data analyst James Tolan.\n\nAnd they have made up a similar percent of trade volume on Ethereum\u2019s decentralised exchanges, according to SixDegree Lab.\n\nOn Thursday, meme coin trade volume topped $113 million on Ethereum.\n\nPositive-sum tokens\n\n\u201cIf people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHis first idea is rather straightforward: some percent of a newly-issued memecoin, or the transaction fees it generates, should be set aside for charity.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the most successful example of this might be Dogelon Mars, an Elon Musk-themed token.\n\nIn 2021, he transferred $145 million worth of Dogelon to the Methuselah Foundation, a space travel and anti-aging nonprofit dedicated to \u201cmaking 90 the new 50,\u201d according to its website.\n\nIt was 43% of Dogelon\u2019s circulating supply, spurring panic among other investors, who feared a fire sale that would destroy the token\u2019s value. But the nonprofit promised to be a good steward of the token.\n\n\u201cWe will take the same nurturing approach with our Dogelon Mars holdings because we understand that the cryptocurrency\u2019s value depends on maintaining the public\u2019s confidence and capturing its imagination, much like baseball cards or other collectibles,\u201d David Gobel, the foundation\u2019s co-founder and CEO said in a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cWe want the $ELON to keep accruing value over the long term.\u201d\n\nLater that year, Dogelon holders voted to fund a Methuselah-led experiment.\n\n\u201cThe community has donated funds to send prize-winning vascular tissue science to the International Space Station (ISS), where experiments can continue beyond Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d the nonprofit said on its blog.\n\n\u201cThe ability to grow human organs will be important for crews who will eventually be involved in deep-space travel.\u201d\n\nWhile the token\u2019s value has cratered since the heady days of 2021, Vitalik believes the foundation has made good on its promise.\n\n\u201cThe two Methuselah Foundation and the Dogelon Mars community seemed to develop a positive-sum relationship with each other, retroactively converting $ELON into a charity coin,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nOther charity-related coins have been less successful.\n\nGiveWell Inu \u2014 named after a Shiba Inu, like most dog-themed memecoins \u2014 donated its proceeds to GiveWell, Buterin noted. But it\u2019s borderline defunct, with only one or two transfers a day, on average.\n\nVideogames\n\nButerin is more optimistic about the impact of crypto-based video games.\n\nWhile some have criticised the so-called play-to-earn model employed by crypto-based games such as Axie Infinity, Buterin hopes to see \u201cRobin Hood games\u201d \u2014 new crypto-based games designed to benefit low-income players.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to satisfy people\u2019s desire to have fun, we should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMoreover, \u201cgames that leave lower-income players in particular economically better off are more likely to leave their communities better than they came in.\u201d\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has praised Worldcoin\u2019s effort to enhance data privacy amid recent global regulatory challenges.\n\nIn a March 29 post on social media platform X, Buterin acknowledged Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to addressing privacy concerns by significantly reducing the data required in its system.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201c[Worldcoin] actually has been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.\u201d\n\nNotably, Buterin was one of the earliest critics of the project when it launched last year. At the time, the Ethereum co-founder identified several flaws with the project\u2019s design, including the risk of data leaks and the collection of sensitive information such as gender, ethnicity, and health conditions.\n\nSince then, the Sam Altman-related project has faced several privacy-related controversies in various jurisdictions. Recently, regulatory authorities in Portugal and Spain imposed a temporary ban on Worldcoin\u2019s data collection activities for three months due to concerns over inadequate disclosure and unauthorized data collection from minors.\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s transparency and security\n\nAlex Blania, Worldcoin\u2019s co-founder, revealed that the crypto project has made significant strides in the transparency and security of its technology.\n\nBlania, in a March 28 post on X, detailed how the firm has made its ORB technology\u2019s core software components open-source while introducing new features that give people control over how their data is used.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cAdditional steps have been taken to ensure only individuals over the age of 18 are able to verify at an Orb. This includes redundant age confirmations in the app, verbal confirmation from Operators, and signage at locations. More technical solutions will follow.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Blania pointed out Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to collaborating with regulators to drive advancements across its operations. He remarked:\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is already the most private, open, and secure system of its kind and has never been more important.\u201d\n\nThese developments have translated into an increasing user base for the project, as nearly 5 million people across 120 countries have registered on its platform.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum News: Navigating The Latest Developments In The Ethereum Ecosystem - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, with each day bringing fresh developments that promise to enhance its functionality, security, and scalability. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, especially with its transition to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at addressing some of the network\u2019s longstanding challenges. The latest Ethereum news encompasses a broad spectrum of updates, from technical upgrades to strategic partnerships, all of which are crucial for both developers and investors within the crypto community.\n\nTechnical Upgrades and Ethereum 2.0\n\nOne of the most anticipated pieces of Ethereum news is the progress of Ethereum 2.0, especially the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition is expected to drastically reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption, making Ethereum a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain. Furthermore, the introduction of sharding as part of Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability by splitting the database to spread the load, potentially solving the high gas fees and slow transaction times that have plagued the network during periods of high demand.\n\nStrategic Partnerships for Broader Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap is not solely focused on technical upgrades. Strategic partnerships play a vital role in its ecosystem expansion. Recent Ethereum news features collaborations with major companies and industries, aiming to integrate Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology into various sectors such as finance, supply chain management, and entertainment. These partnerships not only validate Ethereum\u2019s utility beyond mere cryptocurrency transactions but also pave the way for broader adoption of its technology.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT Boom on Ethereum\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have seen explosive growth on the Ethereum network. Ethereum news frequently covers the launch of innovative DeFi projects and platforms that offer a wide range of financial services without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Similarly, the NFT market has thrived on Ethereum, with artists, creators, and collectors engaging in the purchase, sale, and trading of digital assets verified on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. This boom has significantly increased Ethereum\u2019s visibility and utility, attracting even more developers and investors to its ecosystem.\n\nThe Impact on Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nEthereum news often correlates with fluctuations in its price. Announcements related to upgrades, partnerships, or new project launches can have immediate effects on Ethereum\u2019s market value. Investors closely follow Ethereum news to gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions. With the ongoing developments in Ethereum 2.0 and increasing adoption in various sectors, many analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term price outlook.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, its community eagerly anticipates further news and updates that will shape its future. The transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with increasing adoption and innovative applications, positions Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform that could redefine how we think about digital transactions, contracts, and asset ownership. For developers, investors, and users alike, staying informed with the latest Ethereum news is essential for navigating the opportunities and challenges in the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum stands at the brink of significant transformation. Its commitment to innovation, sustainability, and broad adoption continues to drive interest and enthusiasm across the crypto space. As we look to the future, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives are set to further cement its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, promising a more efficient, secure, and accessible digital future."

        "content": "The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH-USD), reached a pivotal milestone by surpassing one million validators and securing approximately 32 million Ether, valued at around $114 billion. The amount of Ether staked represents roughly 26% of the total Ether supply. By monitoring and validating transactions, the validators are the linchpins in protecting Ethereum against threats like double-spending.\n\nLido (LIDO-USD) is the single largest validator on Ethereum\u2019s network, accounting for 30% of the staked Ether. Lido\u2019s service democratizes the staking process, enabling those with smaller amounts of Ether to participate collectively. While the expanding validator base is generally seen as a boon for network security, concerns have been raised about potential challenges associated with managing many validators.\n\nValidator Concerns and Solutions\n\nThere are rising concerns over the possibility of having too much staked Ether and a probable increase in failed transactions due to an overabundance of validators. Despite these worries, solutions have been proposed to address the network\u2019s efficiency and decentralization. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently outlined a penalty mechanism to balance the scale between large and small ETH stakes by penalizing validators based on their failure rates.\n\nThe regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the SEC delaying decisions on Ether ETFs from financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity until May 2024. Despite the optimistic case for Ether ETFs, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement on Ethereum specifics has led to a more cautious stance regarding immediate approvals.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Technical Analysis\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum\u2019s current indicators give a mixed outlook. The weekly Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a Selling stance, while the significant disparity between Ethereum\u2019s price and its exponential moving averages points toward Buying signals. However, because the gap between ETH\u2019s price and the EMAs is so large, and momentum has slowed as it moves higher, there are concerns that a deeper retracement may occur.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a \"positive-sum\" vision for meme coins, arguing that the current crop of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies do little more than \"go up and down in price and contribute nothing of value in their wake.\"\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin argued that \"many people feel uneasy\" about the current crop of meme coins, and outlined how the \"financialized games\" that underpin them can be made to support public goods and charities.\n\nHe took aim at a recent wave of \"openly super-racist\" meme coins on blockchains such as Solana, adding that, \"I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin seemed to be referring to a rash of blatantly racist tokens that appeared on exchanges last week, many that used the n-word, a token called \"Jews did 9/11,\" and \"NAZI,\" which appears on exchanges with a swastika as its trading symbol.\n\n\"One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity,\" Buterin said. A more productive step, he argued, is to create a \"more positive-sum version\" of the whole concept of meme coins.\n\nButerin envisions meme coins being more like GiveWell Inu (which is no longer active), which promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to the Give Well organization.\n\nBack in 2021, after Buterin had been gifted half the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply he swapped them for Ethereum. After he'd done that, he sent $53 million worth of the ETH to Give Well. But the project seems to no longer be maintained.\n\nAnticipating that his ideas might steal the fun of degens who enjoy taking a gamble on new meme coins, he suggested that developers build better Web3 games. He specifically put the spotlight on the 0xPARC organization, which has been responsible for games Dark Forest and FrogCrypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I value people's desire to have fun,\" Buterin said, adding that, \"I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\"\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading Flat While Dogecoin Dominates the Market - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe cryptocurrency market saw a mixed performance early Wednesday, with Bitcoin and Ethereum remaining largely flat and all coins in the top 10 moving less than 3%\u2014except for the resurgent Dogecoin.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been trading sideways for the third day in a row after gaining a major bullish impulse in early 2024. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has gone up 2%, rising from $69,056 to its current price of $70,715.\n\nThe coin has been testing a resistance barrier at the $71,000 zone, which has kept prices on hold for the week. Every time Bitcoin broke that barrier during this week, prices corrected all the way back below $70,000. As a result, Bitcoin hasn't made any significant moves since surging on Monday.\n\nHowever, the body of today's daily candlestick appears to be filling what was all wicks in the previous days, meaning that Bitcoin could be heading towards a bullish breakout in the immediate future if prices don\u2019t retrace as they did in the last two days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which tries to estimate the market phase of a specific asset, shows that prices are not particularly bullish or bearish\u2014and hints to a possible a possible switch in the trend, meaning the coin could correct in the upcoming days if today's candlestick fails to remain bullish and break past the $71,500. If that is the case, the strongest support is set at around $64,000.\n\nThere is still a bullish trend in play, especially considering other indicators and a longer time frame. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 61 shows that 61% of all traders are buying BTC. Although the indicator shows some bullish dominance, it doesn\u2019t mean that the coin is overbought. An RSI at this point shows that there could be still room to grow on a medium-term basis before buyers plan to realize their gains.\n\nThe gap between the EMA 10 and the EMA 55\u2014the average prices of the last 10 and 55 days, respectively\u2014stopped closing and is now somewhat in parallel, showing that there is still a bullish trend in play. However, the markets are still recovering from the past correction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is also flat, following Bitcoin's lead. The price of ETH has gone up less than 1% from $3,527 to $3,557 in the last 24 hours. This rise cancels the losses of yesterday's candlestick, but marks the fourth day of Ethereum trading sideways with prices swinging between $3,450 and $3,670.\n\nThe coin still has the bearish correction heavily influencing its price behavior. For almost two weeks, the token was trading below its median price of the last 10 days, so the ADX at 35 shows that there is still a bearish presence in the price performance for the immediate future.\n\nOn longer time frames, however, the coin looks bullish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows that there is a switch in the market cycle, and the coin is just starting its bullish upswing. This is a breath of fresh air for traders, especially considering that the coin appears to have finally broken past the resistance set by the EMA10 and is trading back above it, which is considered really bullish.\n\nSmaller coins surge\n\nHowever, other tokens in the crypto realm are beating the market's malaise and have experienced major gains in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a Bitcoin fork born in 2017 to promote bigger blocks and discourage layer-2 solutions, has been the second-best performer among the top 20 coins with a more than 5% price jump in the last 24 hours. The coin is now slightly correcting, but it was up 13% as of earlier today, which made it the second-best performing coin of the top 100.\n\nToday, the price of BCH went from $541 to $570. The coin\u2019s movement is extremely bullish, trading well over its EMA10 (which is currently at about $485) all thanks to a massive 12% pump yesterday when it went from $477 to $541. Right now, all indicators look bullish for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMeme coins are performing really well, too, with Dogecoin, BONK, and Floki Inu commanding the top 100 with gains of more than 12% each.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDogecoin jumped over the $0.20 mark late Wednesday for the first time since 2021 and has continued to rise since. It briefly popped over $0.22 earlier Thursday and is currently up 17% on the day at a price of $0.218. It's the largest gainer in the top 100 today.\n\nAlso notably, KuCoin's KCS token, which is recovering after the announcement of United States charges against the crypto exchange on Tuesday, is up 10.43% today. MakerDAO's MKR token, which spiked 11.81%, set a new ATH today at $3,549 to register its best-performing month ever.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

Discover SCENE\n\nParallel Studios, the startup behind Ethereum NFT card-battler Parallel, announced late Wednesday that it has raised $35 million in fresh funding from a bevy of major firms around the crypto world and numerous well-known angel investors.\n\nThe list includes investment management giant VanEck, Solana Ventures, the Base Ecosystem Fund, Collab + Currency, and The Spartan Group, while the list of angels features Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Pudgy Penguins owner and CEO Luca Netz, and Yield Guild Games co-founder Gabby Dizon, among others.\n\nParallel previously raised $50 million from Paradigm in 2021 at what the studio then said was a $500 million valuation. The company did not disclose an updated valuation or the format of the latest funding round.\n\nHowever, Parallel Studios did share some details with Decrypt\u2019s GG on how it plans to utilize the $35 million infusion, along with more clarity on what\u2019s ahead not only for Parallel\u2014GG\u2019s 2023 game of the year\u2014but also the recently unveiled AI-powered Colony game that it\u2019s building on Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$\ud835\udfef\ud835\udff1\ud835\udde0 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00 We are excited to announce our latest funding round! Our team is thrilled to expand the Parallel universe across new mediums and platforms. // pic.twitter.com/ZJLyFoahjH \u2014 Parallel (@ParallelTCG) March 28, 2024\n\nThe fundraise comes just weeks after Parallel opened up to the public in a free-to-play beta. A studio representative said that Parallel Studios aims to \u201cstart onboarding a ton more users\u201d by expanding its recent Parallel Ambassadors program and working more with influencers broadly, as well as through paid advertising in various markets worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, they aim to roll out some significant moves in the coming months, including launches on the Epic Games Store and Steam, and the impending in-game launch of the Planetfall expansion. They said that mobile versions are also on the roadmap and that it\u2019s a \u201ckey area of interest,\u201d but that no timeline has been finalized there.\n\nThe rep added that Parallel is already seeing 10 times the website signups recently than in January before the open beta debuted and that it just had its best-ever tally for daily active users. The team says it plans to share such data more openly in the near future once it can better validate the measured stats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the studio\u2019s other major focus, Colony. After plenty of teases, Parallel Studios recently launched an extensive whitepaper detailing the generative AI powered \u201csurvival simulation\u201d game, which will utilize the Solana blockchain\u2014instead of Ethereum and scaling network Base, as seen with Parallel.\n\nAs noted above, Solana Ventures took part in the latest funding round, and two of the network\u2019s prominent co-founders were counted among the backers too.\n\nParallel Studios aims to get a beta version out to the public by the end of the year, echoing the target noted in the whitepaper. Funding will also help further development on Wayfinder, the on-chain AI protocol that will power Colony and potential other apps and games ahead.\n\n\u201cWayfinder is a new artificial intelligence (AI) focused omni-chain tool enabling user-owned, autonomous AI agents to securely and efficiently navigate within and across blockchain ecosystems and applications while independently transacting assets they control via dedicated Web3 wallets,\u201d the protocol whitepaper reads.\n\nA pre-alpha version of Colony has already been tested, but the studio says that it will utilize investment funds to help ramp up the development of the game and launch additional tests beginning this summer. The representative said that Parallel Studios is \u201cmoving very, very quickly to hire more people on the Colony side\u201d to reach those goals.\n\nPRIME, the Ethereum-based token of Parallel that will also be bridged to Solana for use in Colony, is up 12% over the last day to a current price of about $23.30 since the funding news was announced. The token has been on a hot streak lately, up 63% over the last 30 days. It set a new all-time high price of $28.00 on March 18 following the latest Colony reveal.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Mining and Renewable Energy: Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum Lead Sustainability - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency mining has long faced scrutiny for its excessive energy consumption and subsequent environmental impact. In 2022, The White House discovered that crypto assets accounted for 0.4% to 0.9% of the total annual global electricity consumption, exceeding the energy usage of some individual countries.\n\nHowever, a recent study published in the journal PNAS has proposed a partnership between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, offering a potential avenue for accelerating the transition to cleaner energy while promoting broader adoption. In this article, we delve into the dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum mining, introduce BlockDAG Network mining, and explore how these projects' approach could contribute to democratizing the industry while supporting renewable energy initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study featured in PNAS underscores the synergistic potential between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, envisioning a scenario where profits from mining activities could be reinvested into clean hydrogen production and renewable energy businesses. This innovative solution involves utilizing crypto profits to drive the expansion of solar and wind energy indirectly through green hydrogen production.\n\nBitcoin:\n\nBitcoin, operating on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, traditionally relied on energy-intensive mining operations powered predominantly by fossil fuels. However, the PNAS study offers an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin's potential role in renewable energy expansion. It suggests a shift towards clean energy sources for Bitcoin mining, with energy companies or climate-focused groups undertaking mining activities instead of conventional individual miners. This shift aims to democratize the space, and ensures that earnings from mining are directed towards sustainable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network:\n\nBlockDAG Network presents a distinct departure from traditional blockchain consensus methods, offering a novel approach to transaction processing. Unlike linear blockchains like Bitcoin, which arrange transactions in sequential blocks, BlockDAG employs a graph-like structure, facilitated by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), enabling parallel processing and enhanced scalability. With the introduction of its mining solution, BlockDAG Network seeks to usher in a new era of accessibility and democratization within the passive income generation industry.\n\nBy harnessing the unique attributes of DAGs, BlockDAG Network pioneers a system where mining is no longer confined to large-scale operations that are not energy-efficient but instead, users can seamlessly integrate the machines into everyday households. Unlike conventional blockchain networks relying on Proof of Work (PoW) mechanisms and intensive computational power, BlockDAG eliminates the need for expensive, specialized mining hardware. Instead, it adopts a more inclusive approach, allowing individuals to participate in the mining process using affordable mining rigs available for purchase on the website, priced at $1,500 or less. This accessibility empowers anyone with a computer or smartphone connected to the internet to initiate mining activities promptly thereby generating passive income.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough its innovative home mining solutions, BlockDAG Network democratizes access to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and enables individuals worldwide to actively engage in block creation and validation while reshaping the landscape of digital currencies for the financial benefit of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum formerly operated on the same unsustainable proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism as Bitcoin. However, on September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent a transition, replacing its PoW mechanism with an alternative known as proof-of-stake (PoS). The transition of Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is known as the \"Merge\" and promised a drastic reduction in electricity consumption. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, projected that the transition to PoS would decrease global electricity usage by 0.2% and slash crypto carbon emissions by 99.992%. The Crypto Carbon Rating Institution reported a staggering 99.99% reduction in Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon footprint immediately after the Merge.\n\nThis change eliminated the network of energy-intensive mining devices that previously competed to create the next block for the underlying blockchain. Instead, wealth became a pivotal factor in the block creation process under PoS. Coins are staked as collateral, with the software randomly selecting a stakeholder to create the next block. Unlike PoW, where the chance of obtaining a reward depended on employing more energy-intensive devices, PoS incentivizes acquiring a higher stake to increase the odds of creating a new block.\n\nNow, Ethereum\u2019s PoS represents a significant improvement over PoW in terms of electricity consumption.\n\nWhile decentralization is crucial for blockchains to function effectively, it often comes with environmental costs. This appears to be about to change as Bitcoin and Ethereum mining together with BlockDAG Network mining hold the potential to drive a more sustainable and democratic future within the cryptocurrency industry. By embracing innovation, inclusion, and sustainability, these projects can pave the way for a greener, more resilient digital future.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "BlackRock: approval of the Ethereum ETF is possible - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, the founder and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, stated that he believes it is possible to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot even if the SEC manages to declare ETH a security.\n\nHe stated this during a live appearance on Fox Business.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has not only launched on the US stock exchanges what is set to become the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF, but a few months ago it also filed a request with the SEC to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot.\n\nAlthough BlackRock has a approval rating of over 99% for its ETF issuance requests, doubts are circulating about whether the SEC will approve it.\n\nYeah our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%. I get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time. Note: 35% isn't 0%, still\u2026 https://t.co/QWQOGZjDC5 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2024\n\nThe problem is that the SEC considers ETH an unregistered security, and therefore traded on US markets illegally.\n\nHowever, it is not the government agency that can decide whether an asset should be considered a security or not, so much so that a court last year ruled against the SEC itself, which claimed that XRP should be considered a security.\n\nActually, the issue on XRP does not seem to be completely closed yet, both because XRP has been declared not to be an investment contract if purchased on the secondary market, but nothing has been decided yet for sales on the primary market, and because the lawsuit against Ripple is not yet over. Furthermore, in other similar cases, other judges have ruled differently.\n\nHowever, so far no judge has yet expressed an opinion on whether ETH should be considered a commodity like Bitcoin, or an unregistered security.\n\nETH as security\n\nThe issue with securities is that in the USA they can only be legally sold after receiving approval from the SEC.\n\nETH has not yet received this approval, also because it has never been requested.\n\nUntil last year it was believed that Ethereum was a commodity like Bitcoin, but the switch to Proof-of-Stake with the introduction of staking has questioned this definition.\n\nIt is possible to imagine that in order to reach a final judgment from a judge, which is the only way to do it, the SEC will first have to reject the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot in the USA, leading to a court appeal by the applicants.\n\nFor Bitcoin, on the other hand, something similar happened, because despite being clearly a commodity, the SEC initially rejected requests for the issuance of spot BTC ETFs in the USA.\n\nAt that point Grayscale sued the SEC, and a judge ruled in favor of Grayscale and against the SEC, paving the way for the subsequent approval.\n\nBy the end of May, the EC will necessarily have to pronounce itself on the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot, and at this point it seems likely that it will opt for an initial rejection, pending a subsequent explicit pronouncement by a court that clarifies the nature of ETH as a commodity or security.\n\nThe role of BlackRock in approving the Ethereum ETF\n\nIt is worth noting that the situation regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs began to unlock as early as June of last year, just when BlackRock submitted its request. In fact, it was known that its approval rate for ETFs was over 99%.\n\nLater, the court ruled in favor of Grayscale at the end of August, finally resolving the issue.\n\nSo yesterday\u2019s words from Larry Fink seem like a way to anticipate the SEC\u2019s moves.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s as if they stated that their request to issue an ETF on ETH spot on US exchanges will proceed even if the SEC refuses to approve it, using the excuse of considering ETH an unregistered security.\n\nMoreover, surely even in BlackRock they know very well that the SEC, in the midst of the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, could opt for a rejection in May, but they also know perfectly well that the issue would only be resolved in front of a judge at that point.\n\nBlackRock has now thrown itself headlong into the crypto sector, even launching a tokenized fund on Ethereum.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that this is a real giant, a global giant that manages over $10 trillion in assets, making it the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nThe price of Ethereum\n\nIn fact, the price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum ecosystem, has not been particularly affected by the assumption that the SEC will likely reject the ETFs in May.\n\nShortly after mid-October, the price of ETH entered a bullrun phase, ending on March 13th.\n\nThe price went from less than $1,700 to over $2,400 by the end of 2023, then rose to $2,700 in January 2024, and later to almost $4,100 on March 12.\n\nThis is a remarkable -150% in less than five months, although there was a correction afterwards that brought it back to $3,000.\n\nCurrently it has risen to over $3,500, which is a value 115% higher than before the bullrun started.\n\nInterestingly, however, it has not yet managed to update the highs of 2021, when it reached nearly $4,900. On the other hand, the TFs are pushing mainly Bitcoin, and it will probably take a while before they can also push ETH."

        "title": "ETH To USD: Navigating The Volatile Path Of Ethereum To US Dollar Conversion - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, the exchange rate between Ethereum (ETH) and the US dollar (USD) is a critical piece of information for traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike. Known as the ETH to USD conversion rate, this figure not only reflects the current market value of Ethereum but also serves as a key indicator of the cryptocurrency\u2019s health and investor sentiment. As Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, understanding the ETH to USD rate is essential for navigating the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that the ETH to USD rate can fluctuate wildly within short periods. These fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, technological advancements within the Ethereum network, and broader economic indicators. For investors, these fluctuations present both opportunities for significant gains and risks of considerable losses, making it crucial to stay informed and adopt a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment.\n\nOne of the primary reasons investors monitor the ETH to USD conversion rate is to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding their Ethereum investments. For those looking to convert their ETH into USD, timing is everything. A high conversion rate means more dollars for each Ether sold, while a low rate can lead to losses if the investor purchased ETH when the dollar value was higher. Consequently, many investors engage in active market analysis, attempting to predict future movements in the ETH to USD rate based on current trends and news within the cryptocurrency and financial worlds.\n\nMoreover, the ETH to USD rate is not only important for individual investors but also plays a significant role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s value relative to the US dollar can impact the funding and viability of dApps and projects built on the Ethereum platform. A strong ETH to USD rate can encourage development and innovation within the ecosystem, while a weak rate may deter investment and development.\n\nGiven the importance of the ETH to USD conversion rate, several tools and platforms are available to help investors track and analyze these fluctuations. Cryptocurrency exchanges, financial news websites, and dedicated crypto analysis platforms offer real-time data and insights into the ETH to USD rate. Additionally, many of these services provide historical data, allowing investors to identify trends and patterns over time.\n\nTo navigate the volatility of the ETH to USD rate effectively, investors often employ a mix of strategies, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and staying updated on Ethereum network developments and global economic trends. Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, a long-term perspective and a tolerance for risk are also important traits for successful investors.\n\nIn conclusion, the ETH to USD conversion rate is a fundamental metric for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. Whether you\u2019re an experienced investor, a newcomer to the world of digital currencies, or a developer working on Ethereum-based projects, understanding and monitoring this exchange rate is key to making informed decisions. With careful analysis and strategic planning, investors can navigate the complexities of the ETH to USD rate and capitalize on the opportunities within the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency."

        "content": "With a crypto bull market in full swing, these cryptocurrencies stand above the rest.\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is constantly changing. Just because a cryptocurrency is here one day doesn't protect it from becoming worthless and losing relevance the next. In fact, it's so common for cryptocurrencies to fade to near worthlessness that the ones that maintain their value are often anomalies.\n\nWhile investing in whatever cryptocurrency is trendy and in the headlines can be alluring, investors are better off sticking with these five cryptocurrencies. Chances are exceedingly likely that they will be around for decades.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThis one's easy. Every superlative we could give a cryptocurrency could apply to Bitcoin (BTC -2.02%). The list goes on and on: most decentralized, most secure, most resilient, most valuable.\n\nThese features have put Bitcoin at the top of the cryptocurrency market, and it is doubtful that we'll ever see it fall from this position. The world's first cryptocurrency has become synonymous with the entire asset class and naturally attracts the most buy-in and attention from investors.\n\nWith recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) showcasing Wall Street's growing interest, Bitcoin belongs in every crypto investor's portfolio. It isn't going anywhere.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nWith its introduction of smart contracts in 2015, Ethereum (ETH -2.26%) became the first programmable blockchain in the world. As a result, developers could build innovative applications such as non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins, paving the way for the creation of a burgeoning digital economy known as decentralized finance, or DeFi.\n\nToday, the DeFi market is worth more than $93 billion, and nearly 60% of that value calls the Ethereum blockchain home.\n\nEthereum's dominance in DeFi makes it the ideal choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to this disruptive sector. With anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF looming on the horizon, the influx of institutional capital into Ethereum is poised to propel its longevity and prominence in the financial landscape for years to come.\n\n3. Polygon\n\nWhile Ethereum offers leading levels of decentralization and security for DeFi use cases, it does face challenges in terms of speed and high fees. These issues prompted the creation of Layer-2 blockchains designed to address these limitations. Layer-2 solutions process transactions in batches and then finalize them on the Ethereum blockchain, making them faster and cheaper to use.\n\nRecognizing the value of Layer-2 solutions, Ethereum plans to integrate them symbiotically into its ecosystem. Among the various Layer-2 blockchains, Polygon (MATIC -2.43%) has emerged as a standout performer due to its comprehensive functionality. It offers high levels of security, flexibility, and reliability.\n\nAlthough other Layer-2 solutions may offer faster transaction speeds, Polygon possesses robust features that make it the premiere pick in its class. With top rankings in metrics like total daily transaction volume and number of unique users, as well as an impending upgrade that will make it more secure and versatile, Polygon stands to benefit from Ethereum's growing popularity as its primary Layer-2 companion.\n\n4. Solana\n\nLaunched in 2019, Solana (SOL -0.30%) has rapidly ascended among the group of blockchain networks that some describe as \"Ethereum killers.\" Lauded for their swift transaction speeds and cheap fees, these blockchains aim to address Ethereum's sluggishness and high costs without needing a Layer-2 solution.\n\nWhile it may not boast Ethereum's stringent security measures or decentralization, Solana's remarkable throughput has positioned it as the preferred blockchain for individuals seeking cost-effective and speedy transactions.\n\nDespite the distinct differences between Solana and Ethereum, there is undoubtedly a niche for Solana within the crypto landscape. As is natural in any market, some users will be attracted to the more cost-friendly options, and Solana is rising as the go-to blockchain to fill that role.\n\nTo make a comparison, think of Ethereum as a retailer like Whole Foods, where customers anticipate higher costs but prefer to pay a premium for higher-quality goods. In contrast, Solana mirrors the appeal and accessibility of a local dollar store that caters to budget-conscious individuals seeking efficiency.\n\n5. Coinbase\n\nLast but not least, we have Coinbase Global (COIN 6.28%). Obviously, Coinbase isn't a cryptocurrency, but its crypto-centric business model provides investors with comprehensive exposure to the entire spectrum of cryptocurrencies. This eliminates the need to navigate through the thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, thereby mitigating risk. Essentially, owning shares in Coinbase would be like holding an ETF of cryptocurrencies, offering a diversified portfolio within a single investment option.\n\nAs crypto continues to mature and evolve as an asset class, Coinbase stands poised to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunities. With its embrace of innovation and unwavering focus on the user experience, Coinbase is well positioned to ride the waves of momentum driving the crypto market forward and reach its goal of onboarding 1 billion people to crypto."

        "content": "Fri 29 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nThe balance of validators on Ethereum has always been a major concern. The more validators there are, the more secure the blockchain becomes. However, an overabundance of validators can lead to issues such as failed transactions. Recently, this issue has been reignited within the crypto community. Here are the details!\n\nThe Million Validators on Ethereum: Security at Stake\n\nWhile October 2023 saw a decline in crypto enthusiasts\u2019 interest in becoming a \u2018validator\u2019 on Ethereum, this trend was short-lived. Apparently, the situation has changed: the number of validators on the blockchain has exploded.\n\nNr. of validator is issue (too many can ultimatively lead to failed transactions). But the max. effective staking amount (>32ETH) should mitigate that risk. \u2014 Gabriel Weide (@AlphapingG) March 27, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum network has just crossed a major milestone with one million validators now active, reports Cointelegraph. It\u2019s a significant milestone, demonstrating growing confidence in the blockchain. With 32 million ETH at stake, valued at over 114 billion dollars, securing the network has become a priority.\n\nThe tracking platform Dune Analytics reported this historic step on March 28th. The data shows that 26% of the total ETH supply is currently staked, providing a solid foundation for the network\u2019s security and resilience.\n\nStaking pools, particularly Ethereum Lido, are gaining in popularity. These platforms allow small ETH holders to participate in the staking process by pooling their resources, thereby reinforcing the decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in protecting the network against malicious activities such as double spending. By engaging in the proposal and validation of transactions, they contribute to the reliability and robustness of Ethereum.\n\nTo become a validator, a minimum stake of 32 ETH is required. In return for their commitment, validators receive a reward in the form of ETH, thus encouraging ongoing participation and maintaining the security of the network.\n\nToo Many Validators Kill Crypto Transactions!\n\nIn the world of Ethereum, security is an absolute priority. But with a million active validators, some experts are starting to worry. According to veteran investor Evan Van Ness, the current number of validators is already \u201ctoo high,\u201d a sentiment shared by stake pool manager Gabriel Weide, who fears \u201cmissed transactions,\u201d as stated in the tweet above.\n\nPeter Kim from Coinbase Wallet acknowledges that the impressive number of validators is partly due to the 32 ETH limit imposed. However, he suggests that changes may be on the horizon.\n\nVitalik Buterin Proposes Sanctions\n\nIn the race to decentralization, Ethereum visionary Vitalik Buterin has a new idea. On March 27th, he unveiled a plan to make the network fairer by penalizing validators based on their failure rates.\n\nAccording to his proposal, validators would face harsher penalties for repeated failures. Buterin hopes to reduce the advantage large ETH holders have over smaller ones.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time such an initiative has been advanced. In June 2023, researchers proposed capping the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE at 2,048 ETH, already sparking controversies within the crypto community.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum whale cashes out 17,000 ETH \u2013 Here\u2019s what it means for you - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "An Ethereum whale that has been holding ETH for a long period of time sells its holdings.\n\nPrice of ETH remains unaffected, however, activity on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem poses concerns.\n\nAfter seeing a massive rally over the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] started to get stagnant around the $3500 price level. Due to this stagnancy, many holders decided to indulge in profit-taking.\n\nWhale takes profit\n\nAccording to recent data, an initial holder of ETH exchanged 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at a rate of $3,503 per ETH.\n\nThis individual amassed 14,280 ETH, valued at approximately $2.6 million, at an average price of only around $182, spanning purchases made from Gemini and Bittrex between March 2017 and April 2021.\n\nWith a staggering gain of 23 times their initial investment, the profit amounts to $59 million.\n\nThis whale\u2019s sale of 17,770 ETH injects a large amount of the currency into the market. This can cause downward pressure on the price in the short term, especially if there aren\u2019t enough buyers to absorb all the ETH being sold.\n\nHowever, the overall impact depends on market sentiment. If the sale triggers panic selling, the price could drop further. But, if the market views it as a healthy correction or the whale is simply taking profits, the price could stabilize or even rebound as others see a buying opportunity.\n\nETH remains resilient\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,571.59, marking a 27% difference from its all-time high. The price of ETH had tested the $3674.23 levels twice over the last few weeks.\n\nIf ETH manages to break past this level, it will put an end to the bearish trend that was observed after its price fell from $4081.55. ETH could also possibly head in the direction of the $4081.55 resistance yet again.\n\nHowever, the coin\u2019s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) declined in the last few days, indicating that the money flow for ETH had fallen. This suggests that the price of ETH could see a period of sideways or downward movement before it starts to rally.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nState of the Ethereum network\n\nThe popularity of the Ethereum ecosystem will also aid ETH positively in the future. The gas usage on the Ethereum network remained consistent over the past month, suggesting a highly active ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the overall number of NFTs being traded on the network fell significantly over the last few days, indicating that the interest in NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem fell. This could hurt the activity on the Ethereum network in the long run."

        "title": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Ethereum ETFs Feasible Regardless of Security Status, Remains Bullish on BTC - Crypto News Australia",
        "content": "Larry Fink believes Ethereum ETFs could work even if ETH is deemed a security, challenging conventional wisdom.\n\nFink remains bullish on Bitcoin, citing the rapid growth of BlackRock\u2019s IBIT as the fastest growing ETF in history.\n\nDespite typical advice, Fink reveals he\u2019s 100% invested in equities at age 71, demonstrating his strong belief in the market\u2019s potential.\n\nWe know that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is generally positive about markets and stocks, and more recently this is also true for Bitcoin. But what about Ethereum? Asked by Charlie Gasparino on Fox Business about the applications for Spot Ethereum ETFs, Fink said he wasn\u2019t in the position to comment.\n\nRelated: Judge Sides With SEC, Advancing Case Against Coinbase in Setback for Crypto Industry\n\nBut, pressed on the recent discussions about Ethereum potentially being a security, Fink said he doesn\u2019t believe this to \u201cbe that deteriorous [sic].\u201d\n\nGasparino answered: \u201cSo even if it\u2019s a security, you can start an ETH ETF?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich Fink, without giving reasons countered with: \u201cI think so, yes.\u201d\n\nThe Fox Business reporter was surprised by that response\u2014but in reality, ETFs often contain various types of investments, like securities such as stocks and bonds. The key point here is that the regulatory classification of an asset as a \u201csecurity\u201d does not preclude its inclusion in an ETF per se.\n\nSource: Fox Business via YouTube\n\nHence, if Ethereum were classified as a security, it would not automatically disqualify it from being included in an ETF. Instead, the structure and operation of the ETF would need to adhere to the regulatory frameworks that apply to securities.\n\nFink Remains Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nThe other topic at the tip of the tongue of hosts Gasparino and Liz Claman was of course Bitcoin and the Spot ETFs. These ETFs, approved only less than three months ago, are among the fastest growing ETFs in history. In fact, IBIT, which is BlackRock\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF, is the fastest growing ETF ever, according to Fink himself.\n\n\u201cIBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs, nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.\u201d Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nSo naturally Fink, who is overall bullish on the markets is very bullish on Bitcoin.\n\nLook, I\u2019m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. That surprised me how much that\u2019s gone up. I mean, look, we\u2019re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency\u2014and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nNews Flash: Larry Fink is 100% in Equities At 71\n\nTowards the end of the segment Fink\u2019s own allocation in the markets came up. Despite BlackRock\u2019s (non-financial advice) advice to ease out of equities as one gets older and only hold 40% of equities in a portfolio close to retirement, Fink made the astonishing revelation that he himself is still 100% in equities.\n\nFink said he is a strong believer in capitalism and that humans work hard on improving things\u2014and of course in the effects of compounding.\n\nFocusing on the compounding, believing in having hope that the future is better than today. And that has been my whole notion that we as human beings, we solve solutions [sic]. We make things better over time. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nGasparino couldn\u2019t believe it when Fink revealed he is 100% in on equities at his age, jokingly saying that it makes for a great headline.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong To Debut BTC ETF, London To List BTC And ETH ETNs\n\nSo that\u2019s a headline. Larry Fink is 100% in equities at 71. Charlie Gasparino, Fox Business Charlie Gasparino, Fox Business\n\nThis is of course not investment advice."
