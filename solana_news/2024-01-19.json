        "title": "Why Experts Foresee Solana (SOL) Outshining Ethereum (ETH) By 500% In the Next Bull Run - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe co-founders of leading crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, foresee Solana (SOL) outperforming Ethereum (ETH) by a staggering 500% in the next bull run.\n\nThe duo who operate under the X account \u201cNegentropic\u201d recently shared their optimistic outlook on Solana\u2019s potential ascent. Notably, their perspective was inspired by a recent interview featuring macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, where the discussion centered around the potential for a remarkable rally in the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nNotably, the interview host asked Pal and Zeberg about their crypto preferences for a $10,000 investment over a 12-month period, specifically focusing on Ethereum and Solana in terms of risk-adjusted returns.\n\nPal and Zeberg, examining Solana\u2019s recent performance trend, expressed strong confidence in its significant momentum. They anticipated Solana maintaining its upward trajectory, surpassing Ethereum, as indicated by the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nThat said, Glassnode\u2019s co-founders delved into Pal and Zeberg\u2019s analysis to answer the intriguing question of how much Solana could potentially outperform Ethereum. According to insights from Glassnode\u2019s analytics, the current SOL/ETH ratio stands at around 0.14, and the co-founders anticipate a substantial increase in the ratio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all watched Zebergand and Paul talking about SOL-ETH ratio. They both agreed it looks BULLISH. But \u2013 just how much could the ratio rally? This chart suggests, that the SOL/ETH ratio could rise to ~0.76 from current level of ~0.14. In other words, SOL may outperform ETH by 4-5X into the Crypto top.\u201d Negentropic remarked.\n\nContrary to an isolated rally for SOL, the market experts also anticipated a significant bullish rally for Ethereum.\n\nThat said, following a remarkable surge last month that propelled it to reach an impressive $126, SOL has experienced a subsequent retracement attributed to profit-taking by investors and the broader market downturn, particularly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance after the spot BTF approval.\n\nHowever, despite this setback, bullish sentiments surrounding Solana remain notably high. In a Friday tweet, analyst \u201cCrypto Simon\u201d noted that the SOL/USDT price chart is signalling a potential breakout from its descending channel, suggesting a shift towards an upward trend. He further highlighted a high probability of a bullish movement originating from the support level around $98, with SOL poised to target resistance levels near $128.\n\nAt press time of the latest update, Solana was trading at $89.31, reflecting a 6.36 % decline over the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $2,438 after experiencing a similar 3.8% decrease during the same timeframe. Despite this decline, Solana\u2019s one-year trajectory remains notably robust at 340.43%, surging from around $20. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s one-year trajectory is comparatively lower at 60.72%, indicating growth from $1,500."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLittle over a week since the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), and the crypto markets are suffering.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has shed more than 10% of its value, according to CoinGecko. The biggest digital coin by market cap is now priced at $41,002.\n\nLast week, it was closing in on $49,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs have been a roaring success\u2014with BlackRock's iShares ETF collecting over $1 billion in assets under management.\n\nSo, why the dip in price? It probably has something to do with investors cashing out their gains from the initial ETF hype.\n\nSome analysts said that ETF approval had already been \"priced in.\" This likely means that traders and investors were unlikely to continue buying after the approval was made official.\n\nThe rest of the crypto market has been hit hard over the past week, too. Solana (SOL) has shed over 7% of its value in the past week and is priced at $92.38.\n\nWhile Avalanche (AVAX) is down by more than 14%, trading hands for $32.82. Both assets had done very well in December as they attracted institutional investor interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-biggest digital coin, has lost 8% of its value in the past week. It's now priced at $2,466.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 10 spot BTC ETFs, the crypto sphere is now awaiting spot ETH ETFs to drop.\n\nWall Street's top regulator on Thursday pushed back its deadline for a decision on Fidelity's proposed spot Ethereum ETF to March 5, leading to a price dip in the asset.\n\nThe entire crypto market now stands at $1.7 trillion, having dropped by 2.8% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "What you'll learn Most of the $370 million liquidity outflow from Ethereum via Wormhole in the last month has gone to Sui and Solana.\n\nOutflows are possibly driven by memecoin and airdrop speculation.\n\nSui\u2019s TVL has spiked 10-fold since October.\n\nSui and Solana have sucked a lot of liquidity from Ethereum over the past month.\n\nThat\u2019s according to data from crypto bridge protocol Wormhole that shows $370 million in liquidity has moved from Ethereum to other blockchains, with almost 90% going to Sui and Solana.\n\nWormhole\u2019s operations head Dan Reecer told DL News that part of the appeal can be explained by Sui\u2019s incentive programme within its ecosystem that is \u201cdriving a lot of DeFi activity.\u201d\n\nAs for Solana\u2019s popularity, he said it may be \u201crelated to people looking to earn points on different apps after seeing the recent community rewards from apps like Jito.\u201d\n\nSui and Solana dominate Ethereum bridge withdrawals via Wormhole (Wormholescan)\n\nLiquidity rotation\n\nCrypto liquidity rotators are known for keeping in touch with the latest \u201cmeta,\u201d or trend, to position themselves for possible rewards. They do so by quickly shifting liquidity to avenues likely to offer rewards for user deposits.\n\nOne of the recent metas is \u201cpoints\u201d \u2014 a system for acknowledging user participation in DeFi protocols that may qualify them for future airdrops.\n\nNFT marketplace giant Blur popularised the points airdrop system and used it to great effect in capturing significant market share from OpenSea, the previous dominant player.\n\nNow, the trend has spread across platforms, protocols, and blockchains, becoming even more commonplace on Solana.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nSeveral Solana DeFi protocols including Kamino, MarginFi, Parcl, and Solend, have announced points systems of their own.\n\nSui TVL has surged 10-fold in the last three months\n\nSui announced a $50 million incentive programme in October. Such programmes are used to attract interest from developers and investors by funding grants for the former and user rewards for the latter.\n\nSince the programme\u2019s announcement, Sui\u2019s total value locked, a measure of investor deposits, has risen 10-fold to $320 million, DefiLlama data shows.\n\nSolend, Solana\u2019s biggest DeFi lending app with $160 million in deposits, may further boost Sui\u2019s total value following its expansion to Sui.\n\nDespite the significant transfer of liquidity from Ethereum to both Solana and Sui, their combined TVL of $1.65 billion still falls far short of Ethereum\u2019s $32.6 billion.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\n\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\n\nThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\n\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nSolana paints reversal pattern\n\nSolana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\n\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\n\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nEthereum momentum decreasing\n\nEthereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\n\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\n\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been on the rise over the last few months, breaking through resistance levels one by one. Yet, the cryptocurrency might have reached a potential turning point.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the market has been acting very bullish since breaking the 200-day moving average to the upside. It has been making consistently higher highs and lows, with the Relative Strength Index showing values above 50% the whole time.\n\nYet, the $2,700 resistance level decisively rejected the price to the downside last week. The market is currently consolidating below the mentioned level. Meanwhile, considering the availability of several support levels, investors can still be optimistic about the short-term trend.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chat paints a more clear picture of the recent price action. The cryptocurrency has been forming a falling wedge pattern since failing to break above the $2,700 resistance area.\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge can result in a retest of the $2,700 level, while a breakdown would be catastrophic, as the price could drop toward the $2,100 level in no time.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rates\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has been gaining momentum on the upside, market participants have become more optimistic that ETH will eventually make a new all-time high this year. Yet, too much optimism might be a worrying factor.\n\nThis chart presents the funding rates, one of the key metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Positive values indicate that buyers are more aggressive on aggregate, while negative values demonstrate that short sellers are executing their orders more aggressively.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, it is evident that the funding rates have been very positive for a while, showing values comparable to what was previously seen during the $69K all-time high range. As a result, the probability of a long liquidation cascade is very high at the moment. These potential liquidations could lead to a significant drop in the coming weeks."
