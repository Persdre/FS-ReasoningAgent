        "title": "Is Ethereum Still a Millionaire-Maker Crypto? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, focus on future growth potential, not historical track record.\n\nSince its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH 0.10%) has skyrocketed in price from just $0.31 to $3,000 today. That's a nearly 10,000-fold return on your investment! If you had invested just a few hundred dollars in Ethereum a decade ago, you'd likely be a millionaire today.\n\nBut does Ethereum still have the power to make you a millionaire? While it's hard to argue with Ethereum's historical track record, things get a bit dicier when you consider its future prospects.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nWhen Ethereum launched back in 2015, it stood alone as the only smart contract blockchain platform. And, as such, it had an incredible first-mover advantage. Arguably, it was not until 2020, when blockchain upstart Solana (SOL -1.47%) appeared, that Ethereum saw its first legitimate rival.\n\nTo put that into perspective, imagine if your favorite Silicon Valley tech company had an incredible five-year head start on the competition. After that time period, it would probably appear to have an insurmountable lead when it comes to market share, intellectual property, and customer lock-in. Quite frankly, it would look unstoppable.\n\nThat's why I think Ethereum's ability to replicate its historical track record is limited at best. There's simply too much competition now, and Ethereum is no longer the only major Layer-1 blockchain. Check for yourself -- three of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap are direct Ethereum rivals. That type of competition simply did not exist back in 2015.\n\nIncremental vs. disruptive innovation\n\nMoreover, I've soured a bit on Ethereum's endless blockchain upgrades. Yes, the 2022 blockchain upgrade known as The Merge was impressive. People have compared that technical feat to changing the engine of an airplane while in mid-flight. The Merge resulted in a total transformation of Ethereum. In the process, Ethereum became faster, cheaper to use, and more efficient in processing transactions.\n\nHowever, Ethereum originally promised us 1 million transactions per second, and we're nowhere close to that. Of even more concern, Ethereum now relies on a complicated mix of Layer 2 blockchains for scalability and functionality. The core Ethereum blockchain (i.e., the Layer 1) just isn't fast or efficient enough to handle current transaction volumes. So, we have several more upgrade cycles to go, each filled with new tweaks and upgrades.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with incremental innovation, of course. But there's a big difference between incremental innovation and truly disruptive innovation. And that's what has me concerned about Ethereum -- we may have witnessed the end of disruptive innovation with The Merge. And that's going to open up the door for fast, nimble competitors to challenge Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC and regulatory risk\n\nFinally, there's the pesky little matter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ever since The Merge, the SEC hasn't quite made up its mind about whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security. When Ethereum converted into a proof-of-stake blockchain as part of The Merge, it changed the way that people interact with the blockchain, with possible regulatory consequences.\n\nFor example, the process of staking crypto could be interpreted by some as \"the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\" According to the SEC, that would make Ethereum a security.\n\nThis might sound incredibly wonky from a legal perspective, but it matters for investors. There are some Bitcoin maximalists delighting right now in Ethereum's potential regulatory quandary, and there is a very real risk that the SEC could deem Ethereum to be a security. If that happens, all bets are off. I don't think it would pose an existential risk for Ethereum, but it would certainly scare away a lot of investors.\n\nThe myth of the 1,000x crypto\n\nIf you have $1,000 to invest in crypto today, you would need a 1,000-fold return on your investment to become a millionaire. So, let's reframe the original question of Ethereum being a millionaire-maker crypto in the following way: Can Ethereum increase 1,000 times in value from its current price of $3,000?\n\nThat would suggest a stratospherically high $3 million price tag for a single Ethereum coin sometime in the near future. Given Ethereum's circulating supply of 120 million coins, that would imply a total market cap of $360 trillion! By comparison, the total market cap of the S&P 500 these days is about $50 trillion.\n\nAt the end of the day, investing based only on past performance is like driving a car by only looking in the rearview mirror. So stop focusing so much on Ethereum's historical track record, and focus more on how it's going to create value in the future."

        "content": "Crypto strategist Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that Ethereum (ETH) is close to witnessing a big trend shift.\n\nVan de Poppe tells his 717,600 followers on the social media platform X that he doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve pending applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming weeks.\n\nThe SEC is slated to approve, delay or deny the ETH ETF applications by financial giants Hashdex and Ark 21Shares on May 30th after postponing it in March.\n\nVan de Poppe predicts that the SEC\u2019s decision will end up being a pivotal point for the top altcoin by market cap.\n\n\u201cThis is a very likely scenario with Ethereum, through which the delay/denial in two weeks is the big moment of reversal for ETH and the markets.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will plunge below $2,700 before reversing and rallying to $3,800.\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is worth $2,920.\n\nNext up is the layer-1 crypto project AIOZ (AIOZ). According to the analyst, he expects AIOZ to sustain its bullish momentum as long as it continues to trade above $0.65.\n\n\u201cThis one looks very promising and is one of the strongest trending assets.\n\nIn-trend level to hold: $0.65-0.68.\n\nIf that\u2019s lost, then the long-term investment region comes into play.\n\nIf we hold, I expect $1.35-1.45 might seem next.\n\nVery strong one.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, AIOZ is trading for $0.795.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s list is the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Van de Poppe thinks that ARB is very close to carving a bottom.\n\n\u201cThis one has a full correction and is at the end stage of the correction. Massive cascade in the past weeks, through which the markets often fill that wick in the weeks after. In that regard, markets are close to the end of the correction.\u201d\n\nBased on the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that ARB will bottom out at around $0.90.\n\nThe last altcoin on Van de Poppe\u2019s radar is the native asset of the video-sharing blockchain Verasity (VRA). According to the analyst, VRA is in a full-blown downtrend and may find support at $0.004\n\n\u201cA full retracement is happening, which is relatively common for altcoins in this stage of the cycle.\n\nAn important area of support, and I think most of the pain is already in.\n\nThis support has held in the past, and I expect to do the same here.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, VRA is worth $0.0051.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Will Reach $5,000 by the End of 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Ethereum is going to hit a new all-time high of $5,000 in 2025, here's what needs to happen.\n\nIt's been a strange year for Ethereum (ETH 0.02%). The world's second-largest crypto exploded out of the gate early, soaring from $2,200 in January to $4,000 by mid-March. It looked like Ethereum was easily going to reach the $5,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut that's not what happened. Ethereum fell in value after hitting its high-water mark of $4,000, and now sits right at the $3,000 level. The good news, though, is that there are two key catalysts that could help Ethereum reach the $5,000 level by the end of 2025.\n\nThe arrival of altcoin season\n\nFirst and most importantly, there's the arrival of \"altcoin season.\" This refers to the period of the crypto bull market cycle when lesser-known altcoins explode in value. This typically happens during the early stages of a Bitcoin halving cycle, when investors start to diversify their holdings in search of higher returns.\n\nConsider what happened during the previous altcoin season, which lined up nicely with the start of the previous Bitcoin halving cycle in May 2020. On the date of the halving, Ethereum was trading under $200. One year later, it was trading for $3,800. It eventually went on to hit an all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that this same pattern will happen again in 2024, it's clear that investors are starting to look around for other places to invest their money beyond just Bitcoin. Thus far, meme coins and AI crypto tokens have gotten all the attention, but the time could be coming soon for larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe other big factor would be SEC approval of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) similar to the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. Admittedly, these spot Ethereum ETFs would likely not see the same types of inflows as the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, but the influx of new money would still be significant. And that new influx of money would presumably help to push the price of Ethereum higher over the next 18 months.\n\nAs in the case of the Bitcoin ETFs, there are a number of influential Wall Street players fighting to make them a reality. These include the likes of Ark Invest and BlackRock, both of which now have extraordinarily successful spot Bitcoin ETFs. Approval for these new spot Ethereum ETFs was supposed to come in May, but it now looks like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will push off approval for these ETFs until the end of the summer.\n\nThe impact of these new spot Ethereum ETFs could be huge. Arguably, the primary reason why Ethereum soared in price from $2,200 to $4,000 earlier this year was the expectation that the new spot Ethereum ETFs were coming soon. Wall Street got a bit ahead of itself, and was already starting to price in their impact. So, it's not out of the range of possibility that Ethereum could soar from its current price of $3,000 to $4,000 once these new investment products are approved.\n\nBeware the SEC\n\nThe only problem, of course, is that there's something about Ethereum that the SEC does not like. Ever since Ethereum transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain in September 2022 as part of The Merge, the SEC has been looking for reasons to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nRecently, the concerns about potential SEC oversight have returned, and that has had a chilling effect on Ethereum's price. That's why I don't think Ethereum will reach the $5,000 mark this year -- investors need to have absolute clarity about regulatory risk before Ethereum can skyrocket in price.\n\nThe good news here is that the regulatory climate appears to be shifting in Washington, D.C., in favor of pro-crypto legislation. And some lawmakers have spoken out publicly about the potential overreach of the SEC and the need to change crypto's regulatory framework after the 2024 election.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nThe future price trajectory of Ethereum will depend, to a considerable degree, on the price trajectory of Bitcoin. If you assume that Bitcoin can hit a price of $150,000 by the end of 2025, as many crypto investors now do, then Ethereum has the potential to soar in value to $7,500.\n\nUsing just a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, it's easy to see why this is possible. A $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin implies a $3 trillion market cap. If you then multiply that figure by 0.3 (which is the ratio of Ethereum's current market cap to Bitcoin's current market cap), you arrive at a market cap figure of $900 billion for Ethereum by the end of 2025. Given Ethereum's circulating coin supply of 120 million, that implies a price of $7,500.\n\nSo, while $5,000 might sound at first like a pie-in-the-sky price forecast, it's really not. In fact, it's a bit conservative. As long as the SEC doesn't get involved, Ethereum has a real chance to hit $5,000 by the end of 2025."

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Ethereum Like There's No Tomorrow - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The world's second-largest cryptocurrency still has a lot of upside potential.\n\nEther (ETH 0.02%), the largest cryptocurrency of the open-source Ethereum network, has rallied nearly 70% over the past 12 months. However, it's still trading about 35% below its all-time high of $4,815, which it reached during the apex of the buying frenzy in cryptocurrencies in November 2021.\n\nSome bullish investors believe Ether's price could soar even higher. VanEck's Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush expect its price to reach $11,800 by 2030, while Ark Invest's Cathie Wood believes it could be worth $166,000 by 2032. Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but I believe Ether could still head much higher for four simple reasons.\n\n1. Interest rates are stabilizing\n\nEther, Bitcoin (BTC -1.65%), and many other cryptocurrencies were crushed in 2022 as rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments. However, the Federal Reserve recently left its rates unchanged and won't likely raise them again this year. That stability -- and expectations for lower rates after inflation cools off -- should drive more investors back toward cryptocurrencies and riskier plays.\n\n2. Its supply is declining\n\nIn August 2021, the Ethereum Network implemented two major changes with its \"London\" upgrade. First, it changed the calculations of transaction fees -- also known as \"gas fees\" -- from a manual bidding system instead of an automated one. That change simplified and streamlined the process by setting prices based on the congestion in the network.\n\nSecond, it started to \"burn\" -- or remove from circulation -- the base fee of every transaction on its network. That burning process ensured that only Ether could be used to pay for transactions across the Ethereum Network (which solidifies its economic value) while gradually reducing its supply to stabilize its market price.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum Network switched from the energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method (used by Bitcoin) to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, known as \"The Merge,\" reduced its total mining energy consumption by about 99.95%.\n\nIt also made the Ethereum Network deflationary -- so more Ether was being burned than being issued. As a result, about $12.7 billion in Ether has been burned since the London upgrade. That's equivalent to 3% of its current market cap of $378 billion. While that burn rate might gradually cool off, the ongoing process should limit the crypto's downside potential.\n\n3. Possible ETF approvals in the future\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot price Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year. However, the SEC has been reluctant to approve the first spot price ETFs for Ether because it believes Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be considered an asset instead of a security.\n\nThe SEC believes that Bitcoin's PoW process is more similar to the physical process of mining precious metals, so it can be assigned a market-driven spot price like gold and silver. But it says the PoS process that Ethereum uses makes it more similar to a security, which is subject to tighter regulations than commodities.\n\nThe SEC doesn't seem eager to approve the first \"spot price\" Ether ETFs anytime soon, but ETF issuers -- including VanEck, Ark Invest, and seven other companies -- could file litigation against the agency to accelerate the process. The recent approvals of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong could also force the SEC to stop dragging its feet.\n\n4. The growth of decentralized apps\n\nThe main thing that sets Ether apart from Bitcoin is its open-source network. Bitcoin's blockchain can only be used to mine the cryptocurrency, but developers can build decentralized apps, tokens, and other crypto assets on the Ethereum Network.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the decentralized apps market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% from 2023 to 2030 as more companies roll out decentralized investing, lending, and crypto services that aren't tethered to centralized financial institutions. That expansion could drive more companies and consumers to adopt Ether as a mainstream digital currency.\n\nInvestors should brace for lots of volatility\n\nEther, like Bitcoin, is a volatile asset that could easily lose half its value before it doubles again. Therefore, investors shouldn't use any cash they need over the next five to 10 years to buy Ether. That said, Ether could still generate massive long-term gains for investors who can stomach all the near-term volatility."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up $0.82 to trade at $2935 currently. This uptick signals another reversal from the support region around $2875-$2850, projecting a fourth reversal within a month. This active demand zone has prevented a prolonged correction in Ethereum and shifted the price trend sideways. How far will this consolidation continue?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Liquidates ETH Portfolio At $6.5M Loss, Price Dip Ahead?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Is ETH Price Ready to Hit $4100?\n\nThe Ethereum price has traded sideways for nearly a month, resonating within two horizontal levels of $3300 and $2850. The coin price rebounded several times from both these levels indicating indecision among market participants.\n\nHowever, if the consolidation continues, the ETH price hits the downsloping trendline of a falling wedge pattern which has carried the current correction trend for over two months.\n\nIf the overhead supply at this resistance is intact, the potential retest will accelerate supply liquidity in the market, bolstering Ether for prolonged downfall. The bearish thesis will get better traction if sellers break $2850 support.\n\nThe potential breakdown will plunge the Ethereum price to $2700, followed by $2600.\n\nFurthermore, in a recent Twitter conversation, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, responded to developments regarding the ARK Invest/21Shares application to remove staking from its Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF. Balchunas noted that while this adjustment might appear to be aligning the ETF proposal more closely with SEC guidelines\u2014a potentially positive sign\u2014there has not been any specific feedback from the SEC yet.\n\nHmmmm. Interesting. While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn\u2019t been any comments. So its prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet) https://t.co/CeQwj5ktPn \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 10, 2024\n\nHe expressed uncertainty about whether this change was a strategic move to avoid potential grounds for rejection by the SEC or simply a last-ditch effort to gain approval, describing the situation as either \u201ca Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection.\u201d\n\nAs the market is uncertain about the approval of U.S Sec for ETH ETFs, the technical analysis hints a breakout above the wedge pattern could spark recovery sentiment.\n\nA potential breakout from the overhead trendline will accelerate the bullish momentum and lead a recovery rally to $4100.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBB Indicator: The ETH price pressuring the lower boundary of Bollinger Band on the downside indicates the selling pressure is active.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: Multiple crossovers between the MACD (blue) and signal (orange) lines accentuate the uncertain market sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could reverse current market structure if bulls manage a stable candlestick close above $65,500.\n\nEthereum price\u2019s 26% upside potential under threat as ETH tests $2,900 support.\n\nXRP provides another buying opportunity at $0.50 as Ripple price plunges almost 10% in a week.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to conceal its hand on higher time frames with the stance compelling altcoins to pick a side. Altcoins with bullish fundamentals continue to show short-term strength, whereas those devoid of any continue to bleed. The fate of altcoins hinges on BTC with a show of stability likely to kickstart a rally for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto market eyes a bullish turnaround\n\nBitcoin price attempts market structure reversal\n\nBitcoin price is trading with a bullish bias on the H4 time frame, consolidating along an ascending trendline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has managed a few higher highs, suggesting a growing bullish trend.\n\nHowever, for the current market structure to change, the bulls must manage to push BTC beyond $65,500 and maintain a stable candlestick above it on the four-hour chart. Such a move would pave the way for an extension to the $72,797 threshold, beyond which the $73,777 all-time high would be ripe for retaking.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nConversely, if the bears have their way, Bitcoin price could drop, slipping below the support confluence between the ascending trendline and the horizontal line at $60,630. In a dire case where BTC rolls below the $60,000 psychological level, it would trigger panic selling. This could send Bitcoin price all the way to the $56,552 support level before a potential recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price attempts recovery after weeklong downtrend as mainland China wants in on Hong Kong spot BTC ETF\n\nEthereum price\u2019s 26% target objective could fall through\n\nEthereum price consolidation within a falling wedge pattern continues as the bullish reversal technical formation signals a possible 26% target objective. However, with BTC concealing its directional bias, this potential weakens.\n\nNotably, Ethereum price has slipped below the ascending trendline, worsened by the equal lows on the RSI. If the RSI support breaks, ETH could fall through, recording a lower low and extending the downtrend below the $2,900 threshold.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, enhanced buyer momentum above current levels could see Ethereum price break above the $3,212 resistance level. A stable close above this level on the one-day time frame would activate the breakout, potentially sending ETH 26% north to $4,083.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum could see slight increase, institutional whales make hefty deposits on Coinbase.\n\nXRP bulls have another buying opportunity\n\nRipple price has tested the 50% Fibonacci placeholder for yet another time. But not all hope is lost as XRP tests the support due to the 50% Fibonacci placeholder at $0.4952. If this support level holds, the XRP price could climb 12% to take back the $0.5703 resistance level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the $0.4952 support breaks, Ripple price could extend the fall to $0.4500, or in a dire case extend a leg south to $0.4188, levels last tested on April 13.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit update: All related parties to file letters to seal motions and evidence"

        "title": "Bitcoin Navigates 0.65% Gain in Danger Zone, Ethereum Drops 0.25% Amid Market Pressures, Furrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Boost Presale - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, major tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing significant fluctuations, presenting both challenges and opportunities for investors. Amidst this dynamic environment, the Furrever Token (FURR) emerges with an innovative marketing strategy aimed at attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, further diversifying the crypto ecosystem with its unique thematic focus and competitive initiatives.\n\nNavigating Bitcoin's \"Danger Zone\": Market Dynamics and Speculations\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing considerable volatility, currently trading at approximately $61,229.50, marking a slight increase of 0.65% from the previous day. This instability is particularly evident as BTC recently tested the critical $60,000 support level, a move that has heightened caution among investors. This phase is often described as the \"danger zone,\" a term used to denote the turbulent period following Bitcoin's halving events.\n\nDuring trading on May 10, Bitcoin's price momentarily dipped to an intraday low of $60,190 on Bitstamp, down from attempts to stabilize around $63,000. This sudden decrease has sparked widespread speculation among traders and analysts. Many believe that large-volume institutional actions, coupled with the temporary closure of the BTC ETF market, might have driven the drop.\n\nDespite this recent dip, market experts like Rekt Capital remain optimistic, suggesting that the end of this challenging \"danger zone\" could be in sight. Historically, such periods have been marked by sharp downturns followed by eventual stabilizations. The current market scenario of BTC demonstrates the complex interplay between market sentiment and institutional influences, which continues to dictate the cryptocurrency's price movements. As Bitcoin navigates through these fluctuations, the broader crypto community watches closely, anticipating the cryptocurrency's next moves in this unpredictable market landscape.\n\nEthereum Faces Market Headwinds and Analyst Scrutiny\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently been trading at $2,927.63, marking a slight decrease of 0.25% from the previous day. This modest drop is part of a broader trend of challenges that have caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.\n\nA significant event stirring the market was a major sell-off by an Ethereum whale who liquidated 6,714 ETH at a price of $2,903 each, culminating in a loss of approximately $6.5 million. This large-scale transaction has intensified concerns over Ethereum's future price direction. Market indicators are not promising, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a decrease in investor interest and key averages indicating a bearish outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Ethereum's substantial trading volume of $10.1 billion over the last 24 hours, the price has declined by 4.07%, fluctuating between $2,935.95 and $2,894.15. Analysts have pinpointed the $3,017 level as a crucial resistance point; surpassing this could potentially shift the momentum to a bullish trend and help Ethereum break out of its current descending channel pattern.\n\nHowever, several factors are complicating this outlook. The cryptocurrency has been in a descending channel since mid-March, and the delayed approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added to the bearish sentiment. Moreover, the recent Dencun hard fork, which was intended to enhance Ethereum's scalability, did not have the expected positive impact on its price, leading to further speculation about its effectiveness and future impact on Ethereum's market performance.\n\nThese developments paint a complex picture for Ethereum as it navigates through ongoing market challenges and investor scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Attract Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors\n\nThe Furrever Token (FURR) has introduced an exciting $20,000 competition, targeting holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to diversify into its presale phase, which prominently features cat-themed imagery and an engaging, playful ecosystem. Operating on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token is currently offering 65% of its approximately 9 billion token supply to early investors, signaling a strong start with over $1 million raised in just two months.\n\nAs the presale progresses, Furrever Token continues to captivate the community's interest, with its current price set at a modest $0.000648. A notable aspect of this token is its absence of buy and sell taxes, which enhances its accessibility and affordability, appealing especially to new entrants in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe centerpiece of Furrever Token's promotional activities is the \"Furrever Token $20,000 Highest Total Buys Competition.\" This contest is designed to spur enthusiasm and investment by rewarding the top 10 participants who purchase the most FURR tokens during an 18-day period from May 9, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, to May 27, 2024, at 12:00 UTC. The top purchaser will be awarded $5,000, with descending prize amounts for the other top buyers.\n\nThis initiative not only underscores Furrever Token's commitment to building a robust and engaged community but also positions the token as a potentially lucrative opportunity for investors in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, looking to leverage their holdings into new and promising digital assets.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nJoin $20,000 Furrever Token Giveaway\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Ethereum has a slightly more bullish bias for the coming week.\n\nThe Bitcoin consolidation phase was still ongoing, and a revisit to $60k was growing more likely.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] traders were going through a relatively tough period after the easy, straightforward rallies that have been the norm since last October.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been more complicated, but BTC\u2019s halving event last month has changed the market conditions to chop and range formations all over the market.\n\nAMBCrypto investigated what the market sentiment was looking like over the weekend, and where this week\u2019s price action could go.\n\nOne of the two has speculators expectant of bullish returns in the near term\n\nThe 10th of May saw an increase in the Bitcoin Open Interest, but the OI has been trending downward since the price spike on the 6th of May.\n\nMeanwhile, the price also formed a series of lower highs over the past week, descending from $64k to $61.1k at press time.\n\nThe Funding Rate was negative at the start of May when Bitcoin plummeted to $56k. Since then, the Funding Rate has recovered.\n\nHowever, in the past few days, it has been barely above zero, which indicated the sentiment was not strongly bullish.\n\nEthereum also saw Funding Rates slip into the negative territory in early May but has since recovered. The past week\u2019s downtrend saw the funding rate hover around the baseline +0.01 mark.\n\nA slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on the 9th of May saw the Open Interest and the funding rate jump higher.\n\nThis did not repeat with Bitcoin despite a similar price bounce, which suggested that speculators were more eager to long ETH than BTC.\n\nWhat are the next liquidity pockets that could attract prices?\n\nThe 7-day liquidation heatmap of Bitcoin showed a bright cluster of liquidations at the $60k area. To the north, $61.8k and $63k are the next bullish targets.\n\nOn the 5th of May, we saw prices jump above the $64k mark to collect liquidity before a brutal short-term reversal.\n\nSimilarly, we might see a downward plunge on Monday to collect the liquidity at $60k before rebounding higher. Hence, BTC traders would want to buy the dip to the $50.6k-$60k region.\n\nHowever, traders must also be prepared for a move below $59.4k for BTC, and set their stop-losses accordingly in the event of a dip to $60k.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has a cluster of liquidity nearby to the north at $2950. This was close to the current market price of $2928. A dip to the $2860 region would likely present a buying opportunity.\n\nThe liquidation levels around the $3.1k-$3.2k area present an attractive target. A drop below $2.8k would likely herald a strong short-term downtrend, and traders can cut their losses in this scenario."

But the emergence of new players is challenging this current order. This is the case for Solana (SOL), which has just overtaken Ethereum (ETH) in terms of DEX volume.\n\nSolana Surpasses Ethereum in Decentralized Exchange Volume https://t.co/JMiP2HmQL8\n\n\n\nFollow us and stay up to date with the latest developments for #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Ripple #cryptomarket #cryptocurrencynews \u2014 COINTURK NEWS (@Cointurknews) May 10, 2024 Crypto: Solana surpasses Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nSolana overtakes Ethereum in terms of DEX trading volume\n\nLaunched in 2020, the cryptocurrency platform Solana stands out for its transaction speed and low fees. This makes it particularly attractive to DeFi users. This crypto blockchain has experienced exponential growth in recent months, attracting many investors and developers.\n\nAccording to recent data, DEX trading volume on Solana has reached $1.3 billion. For the first time, this volume exceeds that of Ethereum, which is at $1.29 billion. This remarkable performance marks a turning point in the competition between the two crypto platforms. It indicates the potential of Solana to emerge as a promising alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana: a crypto ecosystem in full expansion\n\nIn addition to the DEX trading volume of Solana, its transaction fees have also increased. These have reached 50% of the fees generated on the Ethereum crypto network lately. Analysts also predict that soon, transaction fees on the Solana network could surpass those of Ethereum.\n\nSpeaking of increases, the price of SOL has also seen a rise of over 6% in 24 hours. This situation propels Solana to the rank of the most performing altcoins in the crypto market.\n\nA new order is emerging in the world of cryptocurrencies\n\nSolana\u2019s surpassing of Ethereum in DEX trading volume is a strong signal of its potential to become a major player in the DeFi space. Its speed, negligible fees, rapidly expanding ecosystem, and innovative technology make Solana an attractive alternative for users and developers.\n\nAlthough Ethereum maintains its dominance in terms of market capitalization, Solana is now positioning itself as a serious contender, ready to shake up the established crypto order.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
