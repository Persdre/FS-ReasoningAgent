        "content": "Kraken Head of Strategy Thomas Perfumo said spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs could help the crypto sector while commenting on political developments in the US.\n\nOn July 12, Perfumo told Bloomberg that spot Ethereum ETFs would attract capital flows while attracting attention to crypto, noting:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rising tide, lifts all boat story. \u201c\n\nPerfumo further explained that Ethereum\u2019s eventual value \u201chinges on the Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nHe said that the crypto market is \u201cpricing in\u201d $750 million to $1 billion of net inflows to Ethereum products on a monthly basis, which would imply that Ethereum could reach all-time highs between $4,000 and $5,000.\n\nPerfumo also compared expectations to Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in March, which he called a \u201cquiet peak\u201d that occurred without any evidence of millions of new investors entering the industry.\n\nPolitical developments\n\nPerfumo also commented on political developments. Early in the interview, he said US election outcomes will \u201cset the tone for policy making and the legislative agenda for the next four years.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of legislative action and clarity and noted that recent developments show bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nThe House recently decided to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and attempted to repeal the SEC\u2019s controversial accounting rules along with the Senate. However, President Joe Biden chose to veto the resolution.\n\nPerfumo said:\n\n\u201cEven though you\u2019ve hit barriers at the executive level, [there\u2019s] still good progress going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Republican party appears \u201cmore pro-crypto [and] more progressive\u201d on the matter, noting Donald Trump\u2019s plans to attend the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.\n\nTrump has also made numerous statements in favor of pro-crypto policy, including at recent campaign events in Wisconsin and San Francisco.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic is likely to face rejection at its former support zone\n\nOBV and Open Interest showed buyer enthusiasm was low\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] has retraced all of the gains it made during the rally from January to March. Back then, the altcoin\u2019s price had risen from $18.33 to $39.67 at the apex. Alas, the market\u2019s buyers have been underwhelming since then.\n\nThe fall below the $22.9-level meant that a new bearish move seemed more likely than a recovery. Here are the levels and scenarios that ETC swing traders need to watch out for.\n\nFormer support level is now the short-term bullish target\n\nIn April and again in June, the 78.6% retracement level at $22.9 was tested and defended as support. However, the Awesome Oscillator and the price action revealed that a strong downtrend was in play in June.\n\nSupport levels at the 50% and 61.8% retracement zones were lost quickly to sellers and in July, the bears marked another victory by forcing a descent below $22.9. The recent bounce from $18.3 doesn\u2019t mean the bulls are winning though.\n\nInstead, Ethereum Classic swing traders would want to take short positions around the $23.2-$24.1 zone. More conservative bears can wait for a bearish engulfing candle to go short. With the OBV just barely above its three-month support level and the AO resolutely below neutral zero, the bearish argument is very convincing.\n\nOpen Interest at its lowest since October 2023\n\nThe weakness of the bulls was captured by the Open Interest chart. Alongside the price, the OI has slid persistently and stood at $89.7 million at press time.\n\nDespite the 10.6% price hike over the past week, the speculators did not seem too keen to bid.\n\nAdditionally, the spot CVD halted its downtrend over the past week and was slowly climbing higher at press time. The funding rate was positive, underlining the presence of bullish sentiment.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe short liquidations on 8 July after the rejection from $21 suggested a liquidity hunt. Traders should be on the lookout for a price surge that takes out short positions, as that might warn of a liquidity hunt in the opposite direction during the move towards the $23 resistance zone.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "title": "Exploring the effect of PEPE whales\u2019 exit ahead of Ethereum ETF launch - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "PEPE\u2019s large holders sold off significant portions of their holdings in the last 30 days\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the memecoin was undervalued and could rally after the event\n\nMany investors in the market consider the upcoming Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF launch to be bullish. However, AMBCrypto found that large holders of Pepe [PEPE] seem not to share a similar sentiment.\n\nWe found this information after examining the addresses by holdings data. This indicator groups addresses into different segments and shows if they are accumulating or selling off their assets.\n\nIs the memecoin in chains?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto noticed that PEPE addresses holding tokens worth $100,000 to $10 million fell by double-digits. This decline implies that they have sold off some of their tokens within the last 30 days.\n\nThis is a surprise, primarily because PEPE is the top memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it was expected that the big wigs of the memecoin sector would give the same bullish cues as the rest of the bullish market.\n\nIf this stays the same when the spot Ethereum ETFs go live, PEPE\u2019s price might hike as a result of the development. However, it could be challenging to sustain the hike unless buying pressure increases.\n\nAt press time, the value of PEPE was. $0.0000087. This price meant that it was down 49.27% from the all-time high it hit on 27 May.\n\nGoing by the analysis above, further distribution could drag the price, and the token could be 55% down for the highs. However, post-Ethereum ETF\u2019s launch, the token might perform well on the charts.\n\nHigher highs will come later\n\nThis was the signal the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio gave. This ratio provides insights into profitability in the market.\n\nWhen the ratio rises, it means that the market cap is outpacing the realized cap. In this instance, holders of a cryptocurrency have motive to sell. However, if the ratio falls, it means that the realized cap is much more than the market cap.\n\nMost of the time, this brings about unrealized losses and there is little to no motive to sell. At the time of writing, PEPE\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was -10.90%, indicating that it experienced a poor level of demand dynamics lately.\n\nHowever, the good part is that the negative ratio might force market participants to hold on to the token. Therefore, the memecoin could be termed undervalued relative to its current market conditions.\n\nAs such, if buying pressure intensifies much later, we could see the price attempt to revisit its May highs. Despite the bearish signs pre-ETF launch, some analysts believe that the memecoin would gain from the development.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s PEPE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nOne of them is Donny Dicey, an analyst on X. The quote below is what Dicey thinks of the token\u2019s reaction to the Ethereum ETF launch."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is keeping issuers of spot Ethereum ETFs in suspense with extended delays. Additionally, Ethereum bulls are eagerly anticipating a significant price rally once the approval process concludes.\n\nNate Geraci Predicts Timeline for Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nETF Store President Nate Geraci recently shared his observations of the SEC\u2019s approach towards the spot Ethereum ETFs review process. Geraci stated that the US SEC seems to be treating the spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings in a manner similar to the 19b-4 forms, thereby maintaining a high level of secrecy in the matter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the silence, Geraci believes that the approval shall happen by the next week. \u201cI still think approval is likely next week. There is absolutely no reason for delay,\u201d he said.\n\nIt appears the SEC is playing the spot eth ETF S-1s similar to the 19b-4s\u2026 *Extremely* tight-lipped. Still think approval next week. Absolutely no reason for delay. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 12, 2024\n\nThe SEC is repeating the same mistake this time as it did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said Geraci while quoting SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce. Back then Pierce said: \u201cHad these products come to market in the way other comparable products typically have, we would have avoided the circus atmosphere in which we now find ourselves.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas also commented on the SEC\u2019s lack of action regarding the Ethereum ETFs. He said that there\u2019s been no communication throughout this week after the issuers submitted S-1 forms on Monday. This leaves the issuers puzzled over the delay.\n\n\u201cEvery issuer is ready. Docs are ready. It\u2019s like a rain delay in baseball. Gotta just wait,\u201d Balchunas remarked. He expressed hope that the situation might progress quickly next week, but uncertainty remains. As per the market sentiment, the issuers are expecting one more filing submission before the final approval by the SEC.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Gas Fee Flashes Inactivity Concerns Before Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nTop Players Accumulate ETH Before the ETF Approval\n\nOver the last few weeks, some of the top market market players and Ethereum whales have been accumulating ETH in preparation for the ETF approval.\n\nThomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken showed that the US Ethereum ETFs can see inflows to the tune of $1 billion every month following the approval. Additionally, big market players like Tron founder Justin Sun have accumulated $1.1 billion worth of Ethereum gearing up for a big rally ahead.\n\nAs of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.25% up trading at $3,123 with a market cap of $375 billion. Ethereum bulls should take the price past $3,200 in order to trigger the bull run up to $4,000 and beyond.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Executive Says Ethereum ETF Is Close to the Finish Line\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "A significant Ethereum whale has made a substantial purchase, investing millions into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This notable transaction occurred at a crucial time, as the crypto community anxiously awaits potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe timing of this large-scale acquisition, combined with the ongoing regulatory uncertainty, has ignited intense interest among investors and analysts. Many view this as a possible indicator of shifting market dynamics for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDetails Of The Whale Purchase & Market Context\n\nA significant Ethereum transaction has caught the attention of the crypto community, highlighting growing interest in the cryptocurrency as speculation about ETF approval intensifies. An Ethereum wallet, identified by the address 0x517\u20267aF15, has made a substantial purchase of 10,545 ETH coins.\n\nThis acquisition occurred over a brief three-hour period, indicating a rapid and decisive move by the buyer. The total value of this purchase amounts to approximately $33.29 million, with each ETH coin acquired at an average price of $3,156. Interestingly, the buyer executed this large purchase through five separate transfers. Each transfer involved an identical amount of ETH, suggesting a strategic and possibly automated buying approach.\n\nOver recent weeks, there has been a noticeable trend of accumulation among top market players and Ethereum whales. Thomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken, has provided valuable insight into the potential impact of spot Ethereum ETF approval. According to Perfumo, U.S. Ethereum ETFs could see substantial inflows, potentially reaching $1 billion every month following approval.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, other high-profile figures in the crypto space have been making significant moves. For instance, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has reportedly accumulated Ethereum worth $1.1 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Hong Kong & Australia Bitcoin ETF Inflows Hit Record High\n\nCurrent Ethereum Market Status & Regulatory Outlook\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum price is trading at $3,153.88, with a 24-hour trading volume of $8.9 billion. This represents a 1.30% price increase over the last 24 hours and a 4.60% increase over the past week. The current circulating supply stands at 120 million ETH.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has been delaying its decision, creating uncertainty for ETF issuers and investors. Market analysts remain optimistic about an imminent approval, with some predicting it could happen as soon as next week.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the SEC might be repeating its approach from the Bitcoin ETF approval process, potentially causing unnecessary delays. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas noted a lack of communication from the SEC this week, despite ETF issuers submitting their S-1 forms on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, just before the final decision on ETF approval, Ethereum gas fees dropped to a two-month low, suggesting major inactivity on the Ethereum network. This development adds another layer of complexity to the current market situation and regulatory expectations.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Co-founder Highlights US Govt\u2019s Crypto \u2018Mess\u2019\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off phase. This has led to a notable rebound, suggesting the potential for a continued uptrend.\n\nOver the past two months, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC), with analysts predicting a significant price increase in the coming days due to the anticipated launch of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nThis event is expected to strengthen ETH against BTC, particularly given the bearish divergence on the BTC weekly chart.\n\nDespite the optimism, there is no clear timeline for the launch of the much-anticipated spot Ethereum ETF, causing confusion among issuers about the delay.\n\nNevertheless, major market participants and Ethereum whales have been accumulating ETH in preparation for ETF approval, anticipating a substantial price increase once the approval is granted.\n\nIn a TradingView post on July 13, analyst RLinda pointed out that the daily chart of ETHUSDT shows that bulls are actively maintaining the price above a crucial support line.\n\nTechnical analysis and market outlook\n\nAccording to the analysis, the area above the 200-day moving average (MA) indicates consolidation, which is a positive sign for a bullish structure.\n\nETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/RLinda\n\nThe current resistance level is around $3,200, and a breakout could lead to significant upward movement, potentially targeting the $4,000 to $4,800 range.\n\nOn a shorter, four-hour timeframe, the price movement is characterized by consolidation. A large player appears to be actively purchasing ETH, anticipating important news and reinforcing the intermediate bottom zone.\n\nThis period of consolidation, supported by increased volume, indicates strong buying interest and a likely continuation of the uptrend. The key support levels here are around $3,056 to $3,152, which have consistently held firm.\n\nETH weekly price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/RLinda\n\nThe weekly chart supports this bullish outlook, showing a pattern of higher lows indicative of a long-term bullish trend. The key support level at approximately $2,852 has proven resilient, with buyers preventing further declines.\n\nA breakout above current resistance levels on the weekly chart could lead to a significant rally, targeting the $4,000 to $4,800 range.\n\nTimeline for reaching $4000\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the anticipated approval of ETH-ETFs, Ethereum could reach the $4000 mark within the next 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nThis projection is based on the expected approval of ETH-ETFs within the next 1-2 weeks, technical indicators suggesting a strong uptrend, and positive market sentiment with strong buying interest.\n\nAs of the latest update, Ethereum is trading at $3,201.78, reflecting a 2% increase on the daily chart.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThis upward momentum is bolstered by both fundamental and technical indicators pointing towards a bullish future.\n\nIn the short term, maintaining consolidation above MA-200 and breaking through key resistance levels are crucial.\n\nIn the longer term, sustaining the support levels and continuing the bullish trend could see Ethereum reaching new highs.\n\nThe alignment of both fundamental and technical factors suggests that Ethereum could reach the $4000 mark soon, particularly if the anticipated ETF approval materializes.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
