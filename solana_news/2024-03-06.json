        "content": "Bitcoin's all-time high cranks up pressure on Ether to follow suit.\n\nInvestors are counting on Ether ETFs to spur gains.\n\nAn Ethereum upgrade is on the way.\n\nBitcoin just hit a new high, and the wider crypto market is now worth more than $2.6 trillion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s not been lost in the bullish run-up, rallying more than 65% since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s impressive, but sitting at $3,809 in late afternoon trading UK time Wednesday, Ether is still 21% below its all-time high of $4,800.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nIn a word, time.\n\nSzymon Sypniewicz, CEO of crypto onboarding solution Ramp, said it may simply take longer for the market to understand Ethereum\u2019s complexity, especially \u201ccompared to the much simpler idea of Bitcoin as digital gold.\u201d\n\nNew financial system\n\nEthereum lovers have long argued the second most valuable blockchain network will be the infrastructure of an entirely new financial system.\n\nThrough smart contracts, supporters point to a future with more transparent markets, tokenised versions of popular funds, and faster settlement times.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOthers say it\u2019s only a matter of time before institutional investors take bigger positions in Ether. And the advent of Bitcoin ETFs may be increasing their appetite.\n\n\u201cETH hasn\u2019t hit its institutionalised hype cycle yet,\u201d like Bitcoin has, Robby Greenfield, co-founder and CEO of payments protocol Umoja Labs, told DL News. \u201cThus, the vast majority of new inflows from the BTC ETF will naturally lead toward greater buy pressure, along with the upcoming BTC halving,\u201d\n\nGreenfield predicted that Ethereum will close the gap with Bitcoin in terms of its gains.\n\nHe told DL News the cryptocurrency should \u201cclear $10,000 this year.\u201d\n\nGreenfield added that an Ethereum ETF approval would undoubtedly help drive up its value. He joins a host of industry players counting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to follow up its January approval of Bitcoin ETFs with a green light for Ether.\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u2019 \u2014 Eugene Cheung, Bybit\n\n\u201cAn ETH ETF should naturally be approved,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH \u2014 one of the world\u2019s premier risk assets \u2014 in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but the SEC, and especially its hard-charging chair, Gary Gensler, may take a different approach to an Ether ETF.\n\nGensler acknowledged reluctantly clearing the way for Bitcoin after the commission lost a court ruling in its effort to stop Grayscale from converting its BTC trust into an ETF.\n\nThere is no such court case driving decision-making on an ETH ETF.\n\nThe SEC is expected to weigh in on a slew of different Ethereum ETF applicants, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, in May.\n\nCrypto prediction market Polymarket puts the odds of approval at 43%. JPMorgan\u2019s latest analysis gives it a 50% chance.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called an Ethereum ETF \u201csmall potatoes,\u201d characterising it as \u201cthe opening act coming on after the headliner.\u201d\n\nEthereum upgrade\n\nJPMorgan does, however, point to another catalyst for Ethereum: the Dencun upgrade, which is designed to help the network scale up by cutting costs for various rollup solutions on the market.\n\nRollups batch crypto transactions, be they simple swaps or borrowing activity, into much smaller chunks of data.\n\nThese small chunks are then settled on Ethereum, reducing the overall data footprint on the network.\n\nBybit\u2019s Cheung says this is good news for Ethereum supporters.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d he told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nUnlike Bitcoin\u2019s automated halving event, Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade does not regulate the cryptocurrency\u2019s scarcity. In contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s pre-programmed 21 million token cap, Ethereum\u2019s supply is infinite.\n\nNot a sure thing\n\nStill, the upgrade\u2019s success isn\u2019t a sure thing for the asset\u2019s price performance.\n\nThe layer 1 competition is heating up, and one exec says Ethereum may even be overtaken this cycle.\n\n\u201cGiven the network\u2019s poor performance during periods of high activity and the proliferation of alternative layer 1 protocols that have optimised for Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings, Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-ranked cryptocurrency is not necessarily guaranteed this cycle,\u201d CMO of crypto exchange VALR, Ben Caselin, told DL News.\n\nLiam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

The upcoming Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Hard Fork and the SEC\u2019s decision on the Spot Ethereum ETF are the two catalysts for the altcoin.\n\nThe ETH price continues to increase as investors appear to be pricing in the positive effects of the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the possibility that the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) approves exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Ether before the year is out.\n\nThe next in line for a potential all-time high test is #Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n- Dencun upgrade.\n\n- Potential Spot ETH ETF approval.\n\n\n\nCrucial resistance is approaching, but the $BTC pair has barely moved.\n\n\n\nWe'll likely see more strength coming from this asset. pic.twitter.com/LyWh8ht9ow \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 6, 2024\n\nWith these two fundamentals at play, Ethereum betas are likely to benefit, potentially becoming the next sector category to explode.

It was followed by the keynote speech by Luis Buenaventura, Head of GCrypto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuenaventura discussed the importance of understanding market narratives, emphasizing their role in making informed decisions, particularly in bullish markets. He underscored the significance of educating investors to avoid buying cryptocurrencies at their all-time highs and encouraged active participation in the Ethereum ecosystem rather than mere speculation.\n\nHe also called for community efforts to promote usage and understanding of cryptocurrencies beyond mere investment.\n\nRead: GCrypto Head Advocates for Market Narrative Awareness\n\nPhoto from Paolo Dioquino\n\nIn addition, there was also a panel discussion including QZ from Eth Singapore, Ken Arthur Bassig from Taiko and Magnus Capital, Diederik Van Wersch from Chainalysis, and Jiro Reyes from Bitskwela; it was moderated by Paolo Dioquino. Topics covered a wide range of Ethereum-related subjects, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), scaling solutions, blockchain security, community building, and advancing Ethereum education locally.\n\n\u201cThere are so many Filipinos who value decentralization, who value open access, and who are excited to learn and build within the Ethereum ecosystem. And Ethereum is not just an evolving piece of technology, it\u2019s also a philosophy.\u201d Tin Erispe, Core Member, ETH63\n\nShe reflected on the event\u2019s success by highlighting Ethereum\u2019s profound impact on the Filipino community reiterating the community\u2019s dedication to advocating for decentralization and open access, and envisioning Ethereum as a catalyst for positive change in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will be the community whose focus is on bringing great impact with less centralization by making it fun, by sparking curiosity, by giving away the control and being a source of support for anyone who is interested in Ethereum.\u201d Tin Erispe, Core Member, ETH63\n\nDevcon Southeast Asia\n\nThis year, the Ethereum Developer Conference (Devcon) 7 seeks to encompass the entirety of the Southeast Asia region and address its burgeoning Ethereum community. Accordingly, the Ethereum Foundation rebranded Devcon 7 as \u201cDevcon Southeast Asia\u201d which signifies a shift toward greater inclusivity and regional attention. This is set to happen in Bangkok on November 12-15, 2024.\n\nBefore the main event, the Ethereum Foundation initiated the Road To Devcon (RTD) Grants round to support projects, grassroots communities, and educational endeavors in Southeast Asia.\n\nAs part of this initiative, ETH63 received support to host Ethereum-focused events, demonstrating the Foundation\u2019s commitment to fostering growth and development within the region.\n\nWhat is ETH63?\n\nIt is a community for Ethereum enthusiasts in the Philippines, it is the organizer of the recent event Ethereum Meetup Manila 2024.\n\nIn an interview, the core members expressed that moving forward, ETH63 plans to leverage partnerships for broader exposure, collaborate with educational platforms for crypto-related education, and evolve into a decentralized community supporting Ethereum\u2019s growth in the Philippines. Their vision is to cultivate widespread interest and engagement in the Ethereum ecosystem across the country.\n\nThis article is published on BitPinas: [Event Recap] Ethereum Meetup Manila: Boost ETH Local Awareness\n\nDisclaimer:"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction After Bitcoin Halving 2024 - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum is comfortably positioned as the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, and it looks like ETH will only solidify its spot over time. Of course, the most important crypto event in the next year will be Bitcoin halving, and it\u2019s expected to have a significant impact on the markets for all cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll share our Ethereum price prediction after the halving, and explore whether Ethereum is likely to be a good long-term investment or not. First, let\u2019s take a look at how Ethereum has performed during previous Bitcoin halvings.\n\nKey takeaways: Historical trends show Ethereum's varied performance around Bitcoin halvings, with notable differences between the second and third halvings.\n\nSpeculating on Ethereum's price after the fourth Bitcoin halving in 2024 remains uncertain. While Bitcoin halvings generally create a bullish sentiment, their specific impact on Ethereum's price is unpredictable.\n\nOur projections suggest a potential price dip for Ethereum to around $3,900 by April 2024, 25% below its all-time high but a significant 75% rise from its current value.\n\nLonger-term forecasts indicate a surge to over $6,300 by late July 2024, followed by a dip to $3,700 before rallying to peak above $7,300 in March 2025.\n\nEthereum's long-term potential as an investment looks promising due to the Ethereum triple halving concept. Factors such as reduced ETH issuance, EIP-1559's ETH burning, and staking contribute to deflationary pressure on its supply.\n\nHow has Ethereum performed before and after Bitcoin halvings?\n\nFirst off, we need to keep in mind that Ethereum didn\u2019t even exist yet when the first Bitcoin halving happened back in 2012. ETH has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the sample size of Ethereum\u2019s price action before and after Bitcoin halvings is extremely small.\n\nDate ETH Price 1M before Halv. ETH Price at Halv. ETH Price 1M after Halv. ETH Price 3M after Halv. 2nd BTC Halving Jul 9, 2016 $14.7 $11 $11.7 (+6.3%) $11.2 (+1.8%) 3rd BTC Halving May 11, 2020 $160 $211 $249 (+18%) $398 (+88.6%)\n\nBrackets show ETH performance relative to the BTC price at the time of each respective halving.\n\nAs we can see, the ETH price action around Bitcoin halvings has been quite different if we compare ETH\u2019s performance amidst the second Bitcoin halving and its performance amidst the third Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe Ether market was relatively quiet during the second Bitcoin halving, which happened in July 2016. In fact, ETH saw a 25% price decline in the month leading up to the second Bitcoin halving. Following the halving, it showed a modest recovery, although ETH\u2019s price three months after the halving was only about 1.8% higher than it was at the time of the halving.\n\nThe situation amidst the third BTC halving in May 2020 was much more favorable for Ethereum. ETH increased by 31.8% in the month leading up to the third halving. Three months after the halving, Ether was up a whopping 88.6% compared to its price at the time of the halving.\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s difficult to tell what will happen to the Ethereum price as the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches. Generally, Bitcoin halvings are seen as bullish events and improve the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So, it might be worth considering increasing your ETH stack a bit before the halving.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum price prediction after the Bitcoin halving in 2024-2025?\n\nCurrently, most estimates are suggesting that we should expect the next Bitcoin halving to happen in mid-April 2024. At the moment, the Ethereum price prediction on CoinCodex is forecasting Ethereum to trade at roughly $3,660 on April 15, 2024. This would be about -24.7% below Ethereum\u2019s current all-time high but a 24.9% increase compared to the Ethereum price at the time of writing.\n\nAs far as the Ethereum price prediction for 2024 and 2025 is concerned, the forecast is expecting the ETH price to accelerate sharply soon after the Bitcoin halving, hitting new all-time highs just above $6,600 in September of 2024.\n\nThe prediction is expecting that ETH will then drop and find support at roughly $4,070, before gathering momentum for a new rally that\u2019s forecasted to reach its peak above $7,000 in April 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a good long-term buy?\n\nEthereum appears to be quite promising as a long-term buy thanks to a concept known as the Ethereum triple halving. Even though the Ethereum protocol does not have a halving mechanism, it does have features that provide deflationary pressure to its supply:\n\nReduced ETH issuance under Proof-of-Stake consensus\n\nETH burning via the EIP-1559 upgrade\n\nEthereum staking lowers the amount of ETH that is effectively in circulation\n\nThese three factors have already contributed to reducing the ETH supply, and will continue to make ETH deflationary so long as demand for transacting on the Ethereum market remains high. Based on Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory and status as the undisputed king of the smart contracts space, the future is looking bright for ETH holders.\n\nEver since Ethereum moved from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, ETH has turned deflationary. Since the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the ETH supply has been dropping by 0.23% per year on average. In that time period, 1.08 million ETH has been issued, while 1.49 million coins have been burned.\n\nETH issuance and burns since the Ethereum network transitioned to Proof-of-Stake. Image source: ultrasound.money\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that it's not guaranteed that ETH will remain deflationary forever. This is because the EIP-1559 mechanism burns the base ETH transaction fees paid by users. This means that the amount of ETH that's being burned depends on the demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. If demand for transactions saw a significant drop, it's possible that ETH could become inflationary again at some point in the future.\n\nAnother way to get a unique perspective on the Ethereum price from a long-term perspective is the Ethereum rainbow chart. This chart uses a concept known as logarithmic regression and features 9 different colored bands. Depending on which band the Ethereum price currently resides in, it can be interpreted as signaling overbought, underbought, or neutral conditions.\n\nIn the video below, you can learn more about the Ethereum rainbow chart and how you can use it to gauge the current conditions in the Ethereum market, as well as its long-term prospects.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF\n\nIn January of 2024, the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by securities regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enter the U.S. market. Before that, the only Bitcoin ETFs which were allowed were Bitcoin futures ETFs, which held Bitcoin futures contract and not actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe logical next step for crypto investing products in the U.S. seem to be ETFs that would allow investor to easily gain access to Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization. Several asset management companies including the likes of Franklin Templeton and VanEck have already applied to list spot Ethereum ETFs, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said that he sees value in an Ethereum ETF.\n\nTo be sure, it might take a long time for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 after all, getting the first spot Bitcoin ETFs was a multi-year effort even though several large asset management firms were pushing to get these products on the market. Still, the narrative that an Ethereum ETF is likely to come in the future will likely serve as a tailwind for ETH.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade\n\nAnother bullish factor for Ethereum is the Dencun upgrade, which will introduce several EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The most notable EIP that will be included in the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, also dubbed \"Proto-Danksharding\".\n\nEIP-4844 aims to significantly improve performance for applications that depend on the use of extensive datasets, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and layer-2 scaling solutions developed on Ethereum. By dividing tasks between the consensus and \"database\" layers, the upgrade is an important step towards the ultimate goal of completely fragmenting the Ethereum blockchain into shards to achieve massive scalability.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade will also introduce other EIPs such as EIP-6780, EIP-5656 and EIP-1153.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSo far, there hasn\u2019t been a clear trend of how Ethereum tends to perform in anticipation and immediate aftermath of Bitcoin halvings. Of course, Ethereum has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the historical data is very limited. Overall, it might be a good idea to purchase some ETH as the halving approaches since the crypto markets tend to be optimistic in the lead-up to Bitcoin halvings.\n\nETH appears to be positioned well over the long term, thanks to its tokenomics. After transitioning to Proof-of-Stake, the protocol needs to issue much fewer new ETH coins, and EIP-1559 is constantly burning the ETH that\u2019s being spent to pay for transaction fees.

The increase suggests a growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum are experiencing exponential growth, reflected in the total locked value (TVL), which exceeds $36.7 billion. This value represents the amount of assets staked or deposited on leading platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.\n\nIn particular, Arbitrum One, one of the first Layer 2 solutions for ETH, has emerged as a leader with a TVL of $15.7 billion, almost double that of its closest competitor, Optimism. This dominance is attributed to its advantage as a pioneer in the market and its perceived greater security.\n\nThe growth in TVL suggests a growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network, especially amid rising cryptocurrency prices and ETH in particular. This increase in adoption and use of Layer 2 platforms reflects the search for solutions to scalability and cost issues on the Ethereum network.\n\nIn addition to the value of ETH, other assets have also experienced significant growth. For example, native tokens like ARB and OP, associated with Arbitrum and Optimism respectively, have seen increases in their value and market capitalization in recent weeks. An indicator of the growing interest in these platforms and their associated projects.\n\nEthereum Will Leap in Efficiency and Cost Reduction with the Arrival of Dencun\n\nThe preference for Layer 2 solutions is due to their greater scalability and lower fees compared to direct transactions on the main ETH network. Additionally, these platforms offer a level of security derived from Ethereum, increasing the confidence of users and protocols that use them.\n\nThese solutions are playing a crucial role in the expansion and continuous development of the network, opening up new possibilities and opportunities for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and transactions on the ETH blockchain.\n\nWith the upcoming hard fork Dencun, transaction fees are expected to be even lower and network efficiency to improve, paving the way for greater adoption and growth in the Layer 2 space."

        "title": "Blast- Launch Brings Billions in Staked Crypto to Ethereum\u2019s L2 - News Welcome",
        "content": "The recent launch of Blast\u2019s Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) mainnet has generated considerable interest in the cryptocurrency space. This development offers users faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network while unlocking billions of dollars in previously locked-up crypto. However, the launch has not been without controversy, and it has raised questions about the project\u2019s approach and sustainability.\n\nA Treasure Trove of Crypto Opens\n\nBlast\u2019s mainnet launch marked a significant milestone for the project. Over 180,000 users gained access to and could potentially withdraw approximately $2.3 billion worth of crypto previously locked on the network. These funds were initially deposited during the Early Access phase, where users earned yields on their holdings, likely reaching a combined sum of $85 million annually. This attractive yield system, combined with features like auto-rebasing and staking, aimed to attract users looking for opportunities to grow their crypto portfolios.\n\nControversy Surrounds the Launch\n\nDespite the potential benefits, Blast\u2019s launch has faced significant criticism on multiple fronts. One major point of contention revolves around the pre-launch bridge. Critics argued that launching the bridge before the L2 itself was operational created a situation where users could not withdraw funds for several months. This may likely set a negative precedent for other projects and raise concerns about user protection and flexibility.\n\nAdditionally, some found Blast\u2019s marketing tactics to be exaggerated and misleading, which may be undermining the project\u2019s credibility and creating distrust amongst potential users. To further add fuel to the fire, a venture capital firm involved in Blast\u2019s funding publicly disagreed with the launch strategy and marketing approach and highlighted concerns about the project\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nAddressing Concerns and Building Trust\n\nBlast\u2019s team has taken steps to address some of the criticism. They have reiterated their commitment to transparency and open communication, acknowledged the concerns raised, and offered explanations to alleviate user anxieties. The team has also explained the origin of the yields offered, stressing their reliance on established and trusted protocols like Lido and MakerDAO to ensure the sustainability of these returns. While some users have chosen to withdraw their funds, others remain invested in the network and are likely looking for benefits from the launch of new decentralized applications (Dapps) and the likelihood for airdrops in the future.\n\nConsiderations for the L2 Landscape\n\nBlast enters a competitive landscape that is already occupied by other Ethereum L2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. Its unique incentive model, similar to the one employed by the founder\u2019s previous successful venture, has generated significant interest. However, the project needs to address concerns, build trust, and establish long-term sustainability to ensure successful user adoption and carve out a niche in the ever-evolving L2 ecosystem.\n\nMoving forward, the success of Blast\u2019s L2 network will depend on its ability to cater to a myriad of factors: user expectations, investor scrutiny, and fierce competition within the Ethereum scaling solutions sphere. Only time will tell if Blast can overcome the initial hurdles, build trust, and establish its position as a viable contender in this rapidly evolving technological frontier."
