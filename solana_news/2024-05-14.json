        "title": "Two Reasons Why Ethereum ($ETH) Is Underperforming Bitcoin ($BTC) As an Asset - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has long faced issues with scalability, particularly during high activity periods that lead to network congestion, slow transaction times, and high gas fees. These challenges affect user experience and limit the network\u2019s capacity to support a diverse range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, introduced in March 2024, represents a significant advancement towards resolving these issues by laying the groundwork for future scalability improvements.\n\nDencun, which combines elements from the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, does not provide an immediate solution to all scalability problems. However, it is a crucial milestone in Ethereum\u2019s development. Central to the Dencun upgrade is the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which sets the stage for future sharding implementations. Sharding involves partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This parallel processing is expected to substantially increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput in the future. While Dencun does not implement sharding directly, it establishes the necessary technical foundation for its eventual deployment.\n\nThe primary focus of Dencun is not directly reducing transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead, it aims to optimize fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions function on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aggregating transactions off-chain before submitting them back to the mainnet. This process helps mitigate congestion on the main network and can potentially lower fees for users.\n\nA significant feature of Dencun is EIP-4844, which lowers the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. This improvement is expected to enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions, potentially reducing fees for their users. However, the actual fee reductions observed may not be as substantial as initially projected, and the long-term effects on fees will need further monitoring.\n\nOne unintended consequence of the Dencun upgrade has been its impact on the Ethereum supply. The reduction in transaction fees led to a decrease in the amount of ETH burned. Previously, higher network activity and fees resulted in more ETH being burned, contributing to a deflationary effect on its total supply. Following the Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this deflationary mechanism was an anticipated benefit. However, with fewer fees being burned and the natural increase in supply, the total supply of ETH has started to grow at a faster rate, shifting back towards an inflationary model.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum\u2019s progression towards becoming an \u201cultra sound money\u201d \u2013 a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.\n\nSee our full analysis \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/6KYAcn0KQ8 \u2014 Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) May 13, 2024\n\nThe other problem for Ethereum is that once the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, many people thought that probably within a few months, the SEC would start approving some, if not all, of the several pending spot Ethereum ETF proposals. Unfortunately, with the SEC\u2019s recent crackdown against the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. Uniswap receiving a Wells notice last month), it seems that SEC Chair Gary Gensler sees Ether (ETH) as a security (which is what Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin suspects) and therefore the expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved in the U.S. sometime in 2024 have been dramatically lowered. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do not see an approval until 2025.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the U.S. SEC may reject Ethereum spot ETF on May 23, and approval may not be until the end of 2025. If Trump wins, the SEC will likely face a change in leadership that may be friendlier than Gary Gensler's.

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > 2 arrested for $25 million exploit of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake validators\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s already wobbly foundation looks even shakier following the arrest of two brothers who exploited the network\u2019s vulnerabilities to steal $25 million from transaction validators.\n\nOn May 15, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the arrest of two brothers\u2014Anton and James Peraire-Bueno\u2014on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, the brothers face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe MIT-educated pair are accused of netting around $25 million worth of tokens in a 12-second span\u2014the duration of a block validation \u2018slot\u2019 on Ethereum\u2014by manipulating vulnerabilities in the process by which Ethereum verifies transactions. Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the \u201cnovel\u201d scheme \u201ccalls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\u201d\n\nThe scheme involved Ethereum\u2019s so-called \u2018maximal extractable value\u2019 (MEV), the process by which Ethereum\u2019s transaction validators can preview and reorder pending transactions. MEV allows validators to personally profit from this advance knowledge by front-running significant or large transactions. European regulators recently flagged MEV for its potential for market abuse.\n\nThe DOJ says the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole funds that would otherwise have gone to a group of Ethereum validators using MEV-Boost. This open-source software outsources the creation of new Ethereum blocks to a network of \u2018searchers,\u2019 \u2018builders,\u2019 and \u2018relays.\u2019\n\nSearchers utilize automated bots to scan the Ethereum mempool for profitable arbitrage opportunities, then forward a bundle of preferred transactions to the builder. This bundle prioritizes the searcher\u2019s \u2018frontrun\u2019 transaction, aka buying a token on the expectation that the transactions that follow will boost the value of said token. The searcher also includes a \u2018sell\u2019 transaction further back in the bundle to cash out this expected spike in token value.\n\nBuilders sent these bundles to a relay, which initially submits only the blockheader to a validator. Only after the validator accepts the block for publishing to the chain does the validator see the complete ordered transaction list.\n\nTaking the bait\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the brothers began plotting their heist around December 2022, just months after Ethereum made its transition from a consensus mechanism based around proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe brothers established 16 validators, then engaged in a series of \u2018bait transactions\u2019 to figure out what motivated MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The brothers thus identified three \u2018victim traders\u2019 that specialized in crypto arbitrage trades.\n\nThe brothers then initiated \u201cat least eight\u201d transactions (the \u2018Lure transactions\u2019) they knew would cause the victim traders\u2019 MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The bundles also included the victim traders\u2019 own \u2018buy\u2019 transactions in which they paid $25 million in stablecoins and other tokens to acquire \u201csubstantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies\u201d (aka shitcoins of little or no utility).\n\nThe victim traders also included their \u2018sell\u2019 transactions after the Lure transactions, but with coded conditions that the frontrun transactions couldn\u2019t be executed unless the Lure transactions \u201ctook place immediately after the frontrun trades\u201d and the sell transactions occurred immediately after the Lure transactions.\n\nBut the brothers had identified a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that prematurely exposed the full content of proposed blocks. This allowed the brothers to tamper with the victim traders\u2019 proposed blocks when one of the brothers\u2019 16 validators was selected to approve the next block.\n\nOnce the victim traders\u2019 $25 million buy transactions had gone through, the brothers \u201creplaced the Lure transactions with Tampered transactions. In the Tampered transactions, the defendants sold the same illiquid cryptocurrencies that the victim traders had recently purchased as a result of the Lure transactions and, for which the defendants already held as a result of information gathered through the bait transactions. In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.\u201d\n\nThe net result was that the victim traders\u2019 sell orders couldn\u2019t go through, leaving them with worthless shitcoins while the brothers collected around $25 million in stablecoins and more liquid tokens. The brothers then published the re-ordered block to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe victim traders eventually caught on to what had occurred and reached out to the brothers, as did \u201ca representative from Ethereum.\u201d The brothers ignored these pleas and set about laundering their stolen loot through exchanges with minimal \u2018know your customer\u2019 controls as well as some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nWhile the brothers may have graduated from MIT, they failed OpSec 101 by googling phrases such as \u2018money laundering\u2019 and \u2018does the United States extradite to [insert country here]\u2019 ahead of their heist.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the brothers\u2019 high-tech antics \u201cwere no match for DOJ prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme.\u201d IRS Criminal Investigation unit special agent Thomas Fattorusso added that his office had \u201csimply followed the money\u201d using \u201ccutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWhile the company behind MEV-Boost released an update to prevent future exploits of this kind, the reputational hit that Ethereum has taken since its shift to PoS shows no sign of ending. In fact, PoS is considered one of the primary reasons why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is (allegedly) preparing to designate ETH as an unregistered security.\n\nA significant chunk of ETH was already concentrated in relatively few hands, most of them belonging to Ethereum insiders who were the primary beneficiaries of 2014\u2019s controversial crowdsale. PoS was guaranteed to further concentrate control of the network, trigging more planks of the Howey test. Regulatory blowback was/is inevitable.\n\n\u2018Compromised and partially drained\u2019\n\nStill more \u2018crypto\u2019 bro-on-bro violence made the news this week courtesy of a hack of the BlockTower blockchain-focused institutional investment firm.\n\nOn May 14, Bloomberg reported that BlockTower\u2019s main hedge fund had been \u201ccompromised and partially drained by fraudsters,\u201d citing sources familiar with the situation who didn\u2019t want to be identified. The total amount of the stolen assets, as well as the nature of the hack went unspecified, but BlockTower has reportedly hired blockchain forensics experts to get to the bottom of this mess.\n\nAs a private company beholden only to its well-heeled investors, BlockTower has so far offered no official statement about the report. The company\u2019s main fund held around $1.7 billion worth of assets under management prior to the hack.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlockTower has suffered losses via exploits, having lost $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens after hackers targeted its wallet on the Dexibel decentralized exchange in 2023.\n\nBlockTower describes its Flagship fund\u2019s M.O. as \u201cfocused on liquid crypto assets via a multi-strategy approach analyzing both top-down market regimes and bottom-up asset selection (beta augmented with alpha), and incorporating market neutral strategies where appropriate to the opportunity set.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, BlockTower launched a dedicated venture capital fund that has taken stakes in numerous \u2018crypto\u2019 entities, including memecoin-factory Solana, struggling NFT-focused Dapper Labs, Sky Mavis (parent of the Axie Infinity game, which suffered a nine-figure hack of its Ronin Bridge network in 2022) and fraudulent \u2018algorithmic stablecoin\u2019 issuer Terraform Labs.\n\nHonestly, given that stellar track record, we\u2019re a little surprised there was anything left to steal.\n\nMake it stop\n\nBlockTower wasn\u2019t the end of this week\u2019s hackery. The Sonne Finance \u2018decentralized non-custodial lending protocol\u2019 was taken for $20 million worth of \u2018wrapped\u2019 ETH and USDC tokens. Sonne Finance said it\u2019s prepared to offer the hacker a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 that would allow him/her/they to keep 10% of their loot as payment for pointing out the gaping security flaws if they return the other 90%.\n\nBut the hacker has reportedly already swapped some of their ill-gotten gains for nearly 1,200 ETH and 183,000 DAI (an Ethereum-based stablecoin maintained by the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization). From there, the ETH will almost certainly tread the well-trodden path to Tornado Cash, the ETH-based coin mixer that helps obfuscate a digital asset\u2019s digital trail.\n\nWe say that with some confidence because on May 14, Reuters revealed a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee report that found Tornado Cash helped launder $147.5 million worth of ETH that was stolen from Justin Sun\u2019s HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange last year by North Korea\u2019s hackers.\n\nThat nine-figure sum was funneled through Tornado Cash in the month of March alone. A further $66.3 million worth of ETH that was stolen from the Sun-linked Poloniex exchange has been similarly washed. With apologies to ancient Rome, when it comes to stolen tokens, all roads lead to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe UN report, based on data provided by PeckShield and Elliptic analysts, also found that North Korea was the likely culprit behind 97 suspected attacks on \u2018crypto\u2019 firms that netted the Hermit Kingdom some $3.6 billion between 2017 and 2024. The same report indicates that North Korea may have been responsible for 11 \u2018crypto\u2019 heists so far this year that netted nearly $55 million.\n\nIronically, many of the victims of these heists were likely among the legions of \u2018crypto bros\u2019 loudly denouncing this week\u2019s sentencing of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in a Dutch prison for money laundering. Code is law, after all\u2026 that is, until it\u2019s your bits of code that have been stolen and laundered. Still, man up and take one for the team, right?\n\nOne imagines that, within crypto crook circles, it\u2019s hard to get angry when they get caught thieving from each other. After all, it\u2019s the dominant ethos of this game, in which the much-ballyhooed notion of \u2018building\u2019 doesn\u2019t so much take a backseat to \u2018grifting,\u2019 it gets relegated to a rickety trailer haphazardly hitched to the back of this out-of-control 18-wheeler.\n\nFor those of you who crave a more productive, utilitarian and (ta-da!) legally- and regulatory-compliant worldview, there\u2019s a little shindig going on in London next week that might be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nWatch: Teranode & the Web3 world with edge-to-edge electronic value system"

        "content": "As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has attracted the attention of investors and industry experts. With advancements in blockchain technology and the increasing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps), the future of Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a subject of widespread debate.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Ethereum hit an all-time high of $4,600, fuelled by the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Yet, what causes the price of Ethereum to continue to fluctuate wildly? Could Ethereum one day witness a value overflow of this cryptocurrency at a higher growth rate?\n\nIn this article, we bring you a detailed review regarding the factors that could influence the economic predictions of ETH in the coming years. We will also give you the anticipated costs in 2024, 2025, and 2026.\n\nEthereum Overview\n\nEthereum is an innovative cryptocurrency that takes the shape of a decentralized, open-source blockchain. It first emerged in 2015 and came alive via people looking for a network that encourages smart contracts and decentralized apps to be developed and used without manipulating, hacking, or being influenced by fraud.\n\nThis platform further aids creators in planning goods and performing contracts quickly without any negative consequences. Indeed, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a wider scope that includes cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. For this type of machines like those that are required to reach a new level of these apps, the \u2018Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2018 (EVM) lies in the epicenter of Ethereum.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis\n\nEver since 2015, prices of Ethereum have seen quite some lows and some highs at the same time; thus, it\u2019s been quite a volatile ride for the fintech asset. Ethereum prices had been determined and influenced by a lot of things such as the overall market sentiment, advances in technology and how well they were adopted within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA particular craze worth mentioning about 2017 was the ICO, and the buying using ETH alone brought about a surge in the demand for ETH. About $8 was its initial price at the beginning of 2017, and its price has reached an all-time high of over $1300 before 2018 ended. From there, a bear market showed continuous decline of ETH prices through months. ETH\u2019s price had leveled at around $130 at the end of the year.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic catalyzed the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and a lot of mainstream interest and recognition which it didn\u2019t have before. The rise of decentralized finance of the DEFI was primarily seen as very bullish for the evolution of the Ethereum Network, and subsequently, the price of ETH lifted from then. Each ETH was priced at $4600 at the end of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022.\n\nBy the end of 2022, Ethereum saw another dip which continued through all of 2023 with the fintech asset priced as low as 1100$. The market came back by the end of 2023 at a ranging price of around $4000. And in May 2024, the price of Ethereum is currently around $3080.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions for 2024, 2025, and 2026\n\nPrice Prediction 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum network grows and expands, the demand for its native cryptocurrency will also grow in 2024. More sharding and scaling solutions will strengthen the network\u2019s capacities and speed and draw more users into the system. Henceforth, the bull run is likely and the currency will hit the $3,500 \u2013 $4,000 mark, by mid-2024.\n\nBy the end of 2024, ETH\u2019s integration into traditional finance and major corporation adoption could cause the predictions to increase to $4,000 \u2013 $5,000 if foreign exchange and other layer-2 scaling solutions tonight volumes.\n\nPrice Prediction 2025\n\nBy 2025, the Ethereum ecosystem might further mature and absorb into various fields. By solving all the scaling issues (if there are any) and introducing new layer-2 solutions, it will become far more efficient and will attract even more users and developers. So, the price might rise in the years to come.\n\nSlowly, when more real-world uses are implemented, and Ethereum-based app usage increases, the use could potentially even make the demand rise up. Since it can be noted from many experts that big investors and traditional finance sectors have also increased their interest in Ethereum. It might also make a profit to much extent as it is considered that Ethereum will become a dominant blockchain platform.\n\nIf this continues, the price predicted might reach within the range of $6000-$7000 by the end of the year 2025. The cryptocurrency market is notorious and high volatility is one of the aspects preventing it since unexpected events happen in the market frequently, which might increase or decrease the prices. Any legislative shift can also increase or decrease the prices of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice Prediction 2026\n\nIn 2026, Ethereum may prove to be unbeatable and may have shown much progress. The powerful Ethereum ecosystem and scaling solutions may probably absorb almost all industries. By not having any stress to adapt and evolve as it is upgraded or updated regularly, it can potentially cause several organizations or even governments to adopt blockchain technology.\n\nThe price for Ethereum (according to experts\u2019 speculation) might reach a range of $8000-$10000 by the end of 2026 if significant developments occur.\n\nForecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024-2026\n\nYear Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024 $3,500 \u2013 $5,000 2025 $6,000 \u2013 $7,000 2026 $8,000 \u2013 $10,000 Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH)\n\nInvestment Strategies\n\nEthereum is no different than any other investments and it is important to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. Here are some effective tips for people looking to invest in Ethereum:\n\nTechnical Analysis: Some of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on. These pinpoint the price areas where one should sell and buy.\n\nSome of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on.

The upcoming years do have anticipated short-term volatility. However, the price growth potential it has is huge and is expected to grow significantly. Technological developments, scalability solutions, and increasing interest from institutions are driving such a surge. Investors are advised to do comprehensive research, frame proper strategies, and be cautious while playing around in the ever-volatile cryptocurrencies market.\n\nRead Also: Is Vanguard Charting a New Path with the Appointment of Outsider CEO Salim Ramji?"

        "title": "Ethereum Scaling With L2s Has Damaged Its Tokenomics. Is It Possible to Fix It? - Unchained",
        "content": "While Ethereum layer 2s are at an all-time high in terms of active addresses and transactions, the mainnet may not be doing as well.\n\nEthereum, often celebrated for being \u201cultrasound money\u201d owing to its deflationary bent, has turned inflationary again over the past month, challenging the foundational principles that its community thought drove its value. A recent report from CryptoQuant has declared the ultrasound money narrative dead, sparking debates and concerns about the tokenomics of ETH.\n\nLearn more: What Is Tokenomics? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the balance between Ethereum\u2019s main chain and its Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s). While L2s have successfully improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability by handling transactions off the main chain, they have inadvertently reduced the demand for Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, on the main chain. This reduction in demand has led to lower transaction fees, measured in gwei, and subsequently, less burning of ETH. Currently, gwei sits at around 8, significantly lower than in previous times, indicating that at this level, ETH is far from being deflationary.\n\nRead more: Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020\n\nEthereum can shift from deflationary to inflationary due to changes in network activity and the balance of Ether burned versus issued. Under EIP-1559, when transaction volumes are low and the burned base fees are less than the Ether issued in block rewards, the total supply of Ether increases, making Ethereum inflationary. This dynamic demonstrates how Ethereum\u2019s supply is not fixed but responsive to network usage, potentially impacting its value and scarcity when shifts from a deflationary to an inflationary state occur.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum L2s are ripping, processing 10 times more transactions than the main chain, while reaching an all-time high in weekly active addresses.\n\nGiven these levels of gas fees, the question arises: how much activity needs to happen in the L2s for ETH to become deflationary again?\n\nRead more: Horizontal Scalability Is the Solution to L2 Fragmentation\n\nA Complex System\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, told Unchained that the deflationary mechanism of ETH is directly tied to its market cap and the balance between revenue and expenses. At low prices, the burning mechanism can exceed the issuance, making ETH deflationary. However, as the market cap grows and if revenues don\u2019t keep up proportionally, ETH can become inflationary.\n\nThis bidirectional influence means that the market cap not only affects the deflationary or inflationary nature of ETH, but also that this nature, in turn, affects the market cap through investor perceptions and behaviors.\n\nTo reverse this trend and restore the deflationary status of ETH, a significant increase in activity on L2s is required. This means that more transactions and fees need to be funneled back to the Ethereum main chain to increase the burning of ETH. However, according to Dietrichs, research has not been done to assess exactly how much activity it would take. Neither the Ethereum Foundation nor researcher Justin Drake responded to several emails requesting additional information on how much L2 activity is needed to keep ETH supply deflationary.\n\nIn addition, Dietrichs pointed out that for any given revenue and issuance level, with constant investor preferences, there is essentially one specific equilibrium market cap that the market would trend towards. Any change in these factors\u2014revenue, issuance, or investor preferences\u2014shifts this equilibrium market cap point. This dynamic feedback loop suggests that addressing the deflationary challenge is not just about tweaking a few parameters, but about understanding and influencing a complex system of interrelated factors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, the question remains: Can the foundational promise of ultrasound money be restored, or will Ethereum have to adapt to a new economic reality?\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "title": "Why A Drop In The Price Of Ethereum Will Be Bullish Long Term - Investing Haven",
        "content": "There is a lot of fear for a decline in the Ethereum price. While the expectation of a drop is justified, confirmed by our latest Ethereum outlook research, it would not be a bad thing. Here is why an Ethereum price drop could be very bullish, long term that is.\n\nRelated \u2013 Can Ethereum Hit $100,000? An In-depth Analysis.\n\nThe way to think of financial markets, Ethereum being no exception, is in terms of structures. Particularly, chart structures with areas defined by support and resistance is the most simplified way to approach financial market analysis.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2024 support and resistance\n\nWe highly recommend not getting lost in the wild wild west of social media. Check this, it\u2019s pure noise.\n\nEveryone has an opinion nowadays. Those who are able to collect lots of likes seem to be the smartest in the room. Very often it\u2019s the exact opposite.\n\nIn order to understand the investment opportunity for Ethereum, we do the simplest possible thing, i.e. zoom out and remove all annotations.\n\nBelow is the weekly chart, no trendlines nor annotations.\n\nWhat do you see? How does it compare to the pattern in 2019?\n\nThere is tons of resistance even if ETH would rise to $4400. There is amazing support right above $1750, arguably in the $2200 area.\n\nIn case ETH drops in the coming months, it could be setting a gigantic cup and handle pattern. That\u2019s not bullish, that\u2019s a very bullish pattern!\n\nFrom our ETH predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s Ethereum price forecast for 2024 is based on the bullish cup and handle chart formation. ETH should drop to its 50% Fibonacci level $2,250 in order to be bullish. A drop to $2,250 should offer an epic buy opportunity in 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2025 chart pattern\n\nAs explained above, the $2250 area is a key Fibonacci level.\n\nNow, what follows may be counterintuitive to most, but it\u2019s a reality \u2013 a drop may not feel good, but a drop to specific levels may be very good!\n\nProvided Ethereum respects $2250, on an 8 to 13 day closing basis, it will come with a very bullish outcome in 2025.\n\nA bullish cup and handle formation, which is what we forecast will be the outcome in case of an Ethereum price drop, has the intention to move much higher than resistance. For ETH, we expect a breakout to ATH, with targets well above former highs.\n\nFrom our Ethereum predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s top analyst has a very bullish ETH forecast 2025. If the area $2,050 to $2,300 holds strong on a 3-week closing basis, ETH will resolve higher in 2025. The current long term bullish chart pattern has bullish targets in the $5,000 to $9,000 area provided support is respected.\n\nInvalidation considerations\n\nNow, there is always the possibility of an invalidation. In the case of ETH, what if it continues to rise to $5000 in 2024?\n\nWe don\u2019t see this happening, there is not enough momentum in markets.\n\nMoreover, a rise to $5000 would qualify as a breakout, so the targets in that scenario would be much higher.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rise to $5000, it\u2019s another thing to continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nA rise to $5000 will be confusing for investors and traders alike \u2013 which decision do you take at $5000 in 2024?\n\nHowever, with a cup and handle formation, a rise to $5000 (which we anticipate will occur in 2025) will be very bullish. The take-away: it will continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nWhen does our bullish cup and handle forecast invalidate? If ETH will have risen well above $5000 by Sept of 2024. Unlikely to happen, also not good, long term, if it would happen.\n\n10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OFFER: Go to our anniversary deals >> InvestingHaven.com celebrates 10 years.

One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation."

        "content": "Expectations for an Ethereum spot ETF has gotten significantly low in the community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market performance continues to lag behind the majority of its peers.\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s SEC is known for playing power games with the cryptocurrency industry, like taking their time to approve any kind of application for crypto products.\n\nThey eased up a bit this year with the approval of eleven spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF, when?\n\nNow, all eyes have turned to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate sibling, Ethereum [ETH]. Applications have been filed quite some time ago for what the community sees as Gensler\u2019s only preferred crypto to have its own spot ETF.\n\nNone has been approved, and the SEC has been noticeably quiet about it all. Just a few days ago, Grayscale withdrew their application for the ETH ETF., and didn\u2019t reveal their reasons for it either.\n\nThe lack of engagement from the SEC with applications from ETF issuers plus Grayscale\u2019s withdrawal have fueled speculation in the community that approval is not on the horizon.\n\nThis sentiment is mirrored in the market, with outflows totaling $14 million last week, according to data by CoinShares.\n\nFurthermore, ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, removing plans to engage in staking.\n\nIn the latest filing, submitted on Friday, the previous clause that allowed 21Shares to stake a portion of the fund\u2019s assets through third-party providers was omitted.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that this update could be an attempt to refine the application based on possible feedback from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/\n\nHowever, there have been no official statements.\n\nBalchunas also proposed that this amendment might be a strategy to minimize the details the SEC could use to potentially deny the application.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market movements\n\nTurning our attention to Ethereum\u2019s market, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world is not having a good time at the moment.\n\nThough all the other cryptos in the top ten have seen modest rises in the past twenty-four hours, Ether hardly budged. At press time, it is still way below its critical support level of $3,000.\n\nData from Santiment reveals that there is a lot of bearishness among Ethereum traders.\n\nTrading volumes have gone down, liquidations are low, but not because investors are staying put, but likely because they\u2019re bored.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn\u2019t made any kind of major price movements this year. And the bulls are now unimpressed.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at the ETH/USDt pair on TradingView and discovered extreme volatility with multiple ups and downs.\n\nThe highest peak approaches the $3,340 level, indicating strong buying interest, while the lowest nears $2,840, where selling pressure intensifies.\n\nThe price repeatedly tested support around $2,900 this past month, as indicated by multiple touches on this line but without actually breaking it, showing resilience at this level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nRecently, the price shows a slight upward movement around $2,968, suggesting a tentative recovery or consolidation phase. But still, it failed. Ethereum was worth $2,958 at press time.\n\nGiven this context, the short-term prediction for Ethereum would lean towards a continuation of bearish trends."

        "content": "Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, two brothers who operate Ethereum validators, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe charges related to a scheme that has been described as exploiting the \u2018very integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million.\u2019\n\nThe brothers allegedly worked together on a complex exploit that allowed them to take advantage of traders searching for \u2018maximum extractable value\u2019 (MEV) on Ethereum.\n\nBy operating multiple Ethereum validators, the brothers were allegedly able to submit blocks that included exploited transactions.\n\nAllegedly, once the brothers were aware that their validators would soon have opportunities to submit blocks, they would create \u2018bait\u2019 transactions that seemed to have significant upside for the MEV traders and wait for those traders to attempt to \u2018sandwich\u2019 their trades.\n\nThese sandwich bots will often look for transactions with the potential for arbitrage and place transactions that buy shortly before and sell shortly after.\n\nWhen the traders were baited into submitting these \u2018bundles\u2019 of transactions, the brothers allegedly submitted a fake signature to MEV-Boost Relay, which at the time resulted in the relays prematurely releasing the whole proposed block.\n\nThey then allegedly took advantage of the fact that they were operating validators to disassemble the block and allow the traders to still front-run. However, instead of buying the asset the MEV trader believes they are interested in, they actually sold that asset at the higher price.\n\nA rogue validator on Flashbot seems to be exploiting MEV bots. Over 25m USD already stolen.\n\n\n\nThe validator takes a sandwich bundle from the MEV bot and replaces the victim transaction with it's own that exploits the MEV bot instead.\n\n\n\nHere's how it works \u2013 pic.twitter.com/il3o9r41J1 \u2014 Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) April 3, 2023\n\nRead more: How Flashbots is taking over Ethereum block proposals\n\nThis technique did potentially put their validators at risk of slashing, but the $25 million they were able to take outweighed the economic costs.\n\nThe indictment additionally details some of the steps the brothers allegedly took to plan for the exploit and to launder the funds once received. This allegedly included creating an \u2018exploit plan\u2019 that broke down the exploit into four steps:\n\nThe bait Unblinding the block The search The propagation\n\nAfter the exploit, the brothers turned to internet searches to manage the risk of their decisions, allegedly searching for:\n\n\u2018Top crypto lawyers\u2019\n\n\u2018How long is US statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Wire fraud statute/wire fraud statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Money laundering statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Computer fraud abuse act\u2019\n\n\u2018Does the United States extradite to\u2019\n\nIn order to help clean the funds they received from this exploit, the brothers allegedly transferred some to a \u2018second-layer exploit address,\u2019 which was subsequently frozen. Much of the remainder, totaling approximately $22 million, was converted to Dai, a stablecoin.\n\nAfter going through a lending protocol, this Dai was allegedly exchanged for Circle\u2019s stablecoin USDC. These funds were then allegedly transferred to an exchange account controlled by Pine Needle Inc., the company set up by the brothers, before being transferred again to a bank account associated with their business.\n\nThis indictment represents the first time that anybody has been indicted in the United States on fraud charges related to changing the expected ordering of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, U.K., May 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency is a growing interest for the world's financial institutions and massive investment establishments. Digital finance is no longer just about testing the waters and gaining a broader presence on online portfolios, they are an everyday reality for the majority of the world\u2019s individuals and businesses.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the digital asset class has evolved into a global phenomenon. What started as an experimental concept has now become a burgeoning industry, with a market capitalization surpassing trillions of dollars. The proliferation of cryptocurrencies has sparked a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, offering decentralized solutions and disrupting conventional models of banking and commerce.\n\nCryptocurrency and the Mass Institutional Adoption\n\nIn recent years, the industry has witnessed a significant uptick in institutional adoption, signaling a seismic shift in mainstream acceptance. Institutions, ranging from hedge funds to multinational corporations, are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles and store of value.\n\nThis mass institutional adoption is driven by several factors, including growing confidence in the technology, hedging against inflationary pressures, and diversification of investment portfolios. Moreover, regulatory clarity and enhanced infrastructure have bolstered both institutional and individual confidence, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network have seen a surge in value this year, driven by recent developments in the financial sector.\n\nIn a notable move, some of Wall Street's biggest banks are collaborating with Visa and Mastercard to experiment with tokenizing their assets. This initiative, predicted by Citi analysts to grow into a $5 trillion market by 2030, involves banks like JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, alongside Visa, Mastercard, and Swift. This could mean a significant step toward mass institutional adoption.\n\nTokenization of assets is considered the \"next generation for markets\" by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who has embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the past year. BlackRock has quietly begun the second stage of its plan for a crypto-based \"revolution in financial markets\" by launching a tokenized private equity fund. Sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in digital currencies, with potential trading activity expected in the coming months, according to BlackRock executives.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin: Leading the Way\n\n\n\nAt the forefront of this cryptocurrency revolution stands Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency that ignited the spark of decentralization. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, becoming synonymous with the concept of digital gold. With its finite supply, decentralized nature, and immutable ledger, Bitcoin has emerged as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nIn March 2024 Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching around $73,000 per BTC, boosting the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies to approximately $2.5 trillion. Analysts speculate that former U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve could trigger a massive price boom for Bitcoin.\n\nBlockDAG Network: A Promising Contender\n\nAmong the emerging contenders in the cryptocurrency space, BlockDAG Network has garnered attention for its innovative approach to blockchain scalability and efficiency and real-world use. Leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG Network aims to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional blockchain architectures, offering high throughput and low latency solutions for decentralized applications. With recent funding of up to $25 million and a growing community of supporters, BlockDAG Network is poised to challenge existing digital projects and reshape the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum: The Surge in Value\n\nAnother key player in the cryptocurrency market experiencing a surge in value is Ethereum, the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.

        "content": "ETH faces immense odds as the ETF deadline approaches\n\nAnalysts predict BTC or SOL as potential beneficiaries of ETH woes\n\nEthereum [ETH] could face a bumpy ride and even a massive bloodbath if recent analysts\u2019 outlook comes true.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst James Van Straten, ETH could lose more ground against Bitcoin [BTC] if the SEC rejects spot ETH ETF applications at the end of May.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks like it\u2019s going to the grave. A rejection of the spot ETF sends the ETHBTC ratio lower from 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decisions on most ETH ETF filings are due between late May and August. VanEck and Hashdex\u2019s decisions are due on the 23rd and the 30th of May, respectively.\n\nThese are the immediate dates the markets are tracking from next week. Straten projects that an ETF rejection could further lower the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nThe ratio tracks the value of ETH against BTC. If the ratio is 0.047, it means ETH is worth 0.047 BTC.\n\nIn an ETF rejection scenario, negative market sentiment and sell pressure could make ETH worth less in BTC terms.\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflationary \u2018state\u2019 could worsen price prospects\n\nEthereum is currently \u201cissuing\u201d more ETH than it \u201cburns,\u201d making it inflationary. This is the complete opposite of BTC\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million coins.\n\nStraten added that ETH\u2019s inflationary nature and a dip in transaction fees after the Dencun upgrade tipped Bitcoin to lead on the fees front,\n\n\u201cBitcoin fees continue to outpace ETH, with very little activity occurring on BTC. ETH has now transitioned into an inflationary state (lol). Dencun upgrade reduces transaction fees, and the ETH burn rate increases the supply.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto evaluated ETH\u2019s inflationary state using Ultra Sound data. It showed that 4.2K ETH was burnt in the past seven days, but 17.6K ETH was issued over the same period.\n\nThat means Ethereum issued four times the token burnt last week, a massive surge in supply that could drag ETH prices down.\n\nBitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger shared the same sentiment. Krueger stated that ETH was \u201cheaded lower\u201d after Solana [SOL] outcompeted it through lower fees.\n\n\u201cBut then, they (Ethereum) get clobbered by Solana with the low fees. So, enter Phase 2. The new upgrade lowers fees and makes ETH inflationary again.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas maintained a pessimistic view on May approval for ETH ETF filings.\n\nIf rejection plays out, ETH could witness a massive bloodbath on the price charts and affect its long-term holders, who are yet to book profit.\n\nIt remains to be seen how BTC or SOL will benefit from ETH woes if the SEC rejects the ETFs starting next week."

        "content": "Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin (BTC) and a certain breed of altcoins will be beneficiaries of artificial intelligence\u2019s (AI) rise to prominence.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 16,200 followers on the social media platform X that AI will need a money system, and that BTC may be the best available form.\n\nHowever, Coutts says that stablecoins and the native tokens of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NEAR, are also well-suited.\n\n\u201cAI needs a money.\n\nBitcoin is the best form factor, but it won\u2019t be the only one. Stablecoins and native tokens for smart contract platforms will also see widespread use.\n\nSOL ETH NEAR.\u201d\n\nCoutts recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) technology could send the total market cap of the layer-1 crypto sector soaring from the current $1.9 trillion valuation to as high as $25 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe analyst shares an excerpt from his firm\u2019s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services.\n\nThe report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.\n\n\u201cBy incorporating an \u2018AI growth factor\u2019 starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Cryptocurrency assets moved higher, which means the data release was a much-needed catalyst.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price restores early May highs as US CPI surprises to downside\n\nBitcoin price is a fraction away from market structure change\n\nBitcoin price is trading with a bullish bias, gliding along an ascending trendline with higher highs. After a sequence of lower highs, BTC could change the market structure if it manages a stable close above the $65,500 resistance level.\n\nThis is likely, provided BTC holders keep their profit appetite in check and buyer momentum increases. The higher lows on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show a growing bullish trend. Traders looking to enter long positions for BTC may consider waiting for a higher reading on the RSI.\n\nA stable close above $65,500 on the one-day time frame would encourage more buy orders, with the ensuing buying pressure sending Bitcoin price to $70,000. Beyond this level, BTC would have a chance at taking back the $73,777 peak. Notably, the DXY Compare indicator is also dropping, which has often displayed a countercurrent flow against BTC price.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders book profits for the Wednesday god candle, Bitcoin price could drop. A slip below $63,354 would spook panic sellers like it did on two recent occasions, May 9 and 13, where BTC was rejected from the aforementioned level.\n\nIn a dire case, Bitcoin price could descend below the ascending trendline and ultimately fall below the $60,630 support level. Below this level, BTC could roll over to $58,000, or worse, $56,552, levels last tested on May 1.\n\nAlso Read: Will GameStop stock resurgence have downstream effect on BTC and alts?\n\n$3,212 level is critical for Ethereum price\u2019s upside potential\n\nEthereum price is attempting to reclaim ground above the ascending trendline after a slip below on Tuesday. The governing chart pattern is a falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal technical formation. For the 26% target objective to be realized, however, ETH must manage a candlestick close above $3,212.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased seller momentum could see Ethereum price drop. If the slump extends to close below $2,781, it would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nNotably, the RSI continues to chop sideways with equal lows as it remains subdued below the mean level of 50. This shows the bears still have the upper hand.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum faces key resistance in attempt at short-term bull run, Solana flips ETH Mainnet in terms of revenue\n\nXRP bulls sitting on their hands\n\nRipple price remains range-bound as XRP bulls continue to sit on their hands. This is seen with the RSI stuck below the mean level of 50 since April 11. If the RSI records a higher high within the upper segment of the range, Ripple price could extend the climb.\n\nIn the meantime, Ripple price is likely to consolidate along the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $0.4952, with the horizontal chop likely to continue.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, enhanced profit-booking could see Ripple price wipe out the ground covered, slipping below $0.4952. In a dire case, XRP price could extend the fall to $0.4500, or worse, extend a leg down to $0.4188, levels last tested on April 13.\n\nAlso Read: XRP holds gains as attorneys debate relevance of discounts offered to Ripple\u2019s institutional clients"

How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?\n\nEthereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months.\n\nFrom November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH\u2019s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.\n\nHowever, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum\u2019s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.\n\nAn examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March.\n\nDuring this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum\u2019s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics.\n\nAlso, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.\n\nEthereum sees a decline in overall fees\n\nThe recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions.\n\nData from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.\n\nThis fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times.\n\nAs of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million.\n\nThis downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges climbs\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances.\n\nThe increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.\n\nAs of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.\n\nDespite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.\n\nFurthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.\n\nETH continues to trend below $3,000\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nBoth the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line.\n\nHowever, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick."

        "content": "Wed 15 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nConsensys, leader in the Ethereum ecosystem, has just announced the launch of Smart Transactions, a new optional feature on MetaMask that promises users safer, faster, and cheaper transactions. This major innovation aims to solve recurring issues faced by crypto users.\n\nA New Era for Ethereum Transactions\n\nMetaMask users now have the option to enable Smart Transactions, a revolutionary feature offered by Consensys.\n\nAvailable as an option for users worldwide, this solution aims to optimize the user experience by improving transaction success rates, reducing gas fees, and protecting against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks such as front-running and sandwich trading.\n\nAccording to the analysis by EigenPhi, these forms of MEV have cost Ethereum users the astronomical sum of 124,000 ETH, or more than 350 million dollars, in the year 2023 alone. With Smart Transactions, users\u2019 transactions remain confidential until their on-chain confirmation, making it impossible for malicious bots to exploit them.\n\nFurthermore, users benefit from higher success rates and reduced gas costs thanks to the presimulation of each Smart Transaction via MetaMask\u2019s just-in-time simulation service. The real-time status of the transaction is also directly displayed in the MetaMask wallet, offering increased visibility and peace of mind.\n\nThese improvements build on a new mempool virtualization technology developed by Special Mechanisms Group, Consensys\u2019 advanced research division. The whole package offers users more privacy, control, and visibility over their crypto transactions.\n\nConcrete Benefits for Users\n\nIn beta tests, Smart Transactions achieved a success rate of 99.5%, significantly higher than industry standards. Users save money by avoiding costly frontrunnings and failed transactions. They can also track the status of transactions in real-time directly in MetaMask.\n\nJason Linehan, director of SMG, emphasizes the importance for users to better manage their transactions sent to the blockchain. In 2023 alone, more than 52,000 ETH (153 million dollars) were wasted in failed transactions, while sophisticated bots profited from transactions after their submission.\n\nGal Eldar, executive director of products at MetaMask, acknowledges the complexity and frustration associated with submitting transactions on a distributed network. Smart Transactions aims to address these issues head-on.\n\nIn summary, with the launch of Smart Transactions, Consensys is taking a major step in its quest for a more efficient and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. By offering MetaMask users safer, cheaper, and more transparent transactions, this innovation could mark a turning point in the mass adoption of cryptos. It remains to be seen how its gradual deployment and impact on the market will unfold in the coming days.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
