        "title": "Optimism execs are optimistic for Ethereum\u2019s future amid its ongoing scaling battle - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As the layer-1 blockchain Ethereum continues to grow and evolve, layer-2 blockchains like Optimism are working to alleviate issues of scaling, speed and costs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the same thing since 2017,\u201d Jing Wang, Optimism\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been trying to solve the same problem for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe mission to scale Ethereum is ongoing, said Ryan Wyatt, chief growth officer at Optimism. Before joining Optimism, Wyatt was the president of Polygon Labs, the entity building the layer-2 blockchain Polygon.\n\nAs it stands, using and transacting with Ethereum is still relatively clunky, slow and more expensive. That\u2019s why layer-2 (L2) blockchains like Optimism exist: to focus on scaling and speed, while also lowering costs for users. It helps users interact with Ethereum\u2019s chain for about 10x cheaper through its own network and also provides developers the ability to build decentralized applications (dApps) in a faster, scalable way.\n\n\u201cJust as Amazon is a serverless back end for web2 applications, Optimism is a decentralized serverless back end for web3 applications,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe wanted to scale Ethereum because I think Ethereum stays the most close to the original decentralization values and we wanted to give it a go staying close to those same values.\u201d\n\nBut with scaling also comes the importance of growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of facets to it, and I think one missing piece is how we continue to work with developers across the ecosystem,\u201d even if they\u2019re not a part of the Optimism family, Wyatt said.\n\nUsually when you think of scaling, you think of hiring big teams. But although Optimism wants to grow bigger, the ecosystem has to self-govern, and the best way to do that is to have developers across the space contribute.\n\nOptimism wants developers to build dApps using its technology, therefore pushing users to the network. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of similarities to blockchain infrastructure in the developer ecosystem,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cFor me, it seems incredibly similar.\u201d\n\nFor some, blockchains are like religious ecosystems, where there\u2019s only one way or the highway. \u201cIt\u2019s one chain versus the second chain,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOptimism\u2019s Superchain vision is trying to get us closer to a world where the chains are closer to containers for compute \u2026 and all these chains interoperate together in what we call the Superchain.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to help users forget which chain developers are building on, because it ultimately won\u2019t matter. \u201cIdeally in the future, there\u2019s applications that are so massive that they\u2019re probably running 100 concurrent chains. But for now, the amount of demand within the industry doesn\u2019t necessitate that, so we have something that looks closer to one application per chain.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to success stories, it \u201cshould really be about the developers that are building on top of this infrastructure,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cSo the day that we get away from talking about L2s, I think is going to be a big day because now the story will be about the great apps and experiences that are being built on top of the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Safeguarding Your Bitcoin & Ethereum: Exploring Multi-Sig Wallets for Enhanced Security - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Storing crypto on an exchange or a hardware wallet is risky. Instead, you should use a multi-sig setup.\n\n\n\nI used to store mycrypto in hardware wallets like Ledger, but for large amounts, it is still risky. If somebody steals your ledger or its seed phrase, you are doomed. If a fire or earthquake destroys them, you are doomed. I used to keep two copies of seed phrases in different locations for this latter risk. But that poses another risk - what if somebody steals from my second location when I am not present, and I do not know until it\u2019s too late?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is to use a multi-signature wallet, which is a setup in which a threshold of devices must be confirmed to execute a transaction. I put this off for way too long but finally got around to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Multisig\n\nFor Bitcoin, there are two main providers I\u2019d suggest - Casa or Unchained Capital . Both are self-custody, meaning you are the holders of the keys. No FTX-like risk here. Both have also raised much in venture capital and have great customer experiences. I actually spoke to Unchained Capital four years ago when they were just getting started and raising their first round of seed capital. Now, they have raised $100M+.\n\nCasa vs Unchained\n\nCasa costs $250 a year (they also offer more expensive services, which I won\u2019t go into here), while Unchained Capital offers a free tier of service. However, the latter requires KYC while the former does not.\n\nHow It Works\n\nFor Casa, there is an app. You control two of the keys; Casa controls the third. You need 2 of 3 keys to send funds out. Your mobile serves as one key, and a hardware device like a ledger as the other. For the key that Casa controls, you answer security questions that you\u2019d re-enter if you want Casa to sign for you in the future. You would use this if one of your two keys was compromised. Casa would sign after a seven-day buffer. It is highly recommended you write down your answer to the security questions and put it somewhere safe.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also have the option to use two hardware devices instead of the mobile.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnchained Capital is mostly similar, but they only offer the two hardware wallet solutions, no mobile. Also, while they are free, they charge a $20 co-signature fee if you need to rely on their third key. Since they KYC, they don\u2019t require security questions; hence you don\u2019t need to worry about writing it down and storing it safely somewhere; instead, they can verify via a method like video call when you need them to sign. They have a 72-hour buffer period before signing.\n\nWhile KYC has this convenience, a downside is that if Unchained\u2019s data gets compromised, your identity and crypto holdings will be revealed. To be clear, your crypto would still be safe in such a scenario because you control two of the keys. Alternatively, the downside of Casa with no KYC is that you are responsible for storing the answers to your security questions safely.\n\nFinally, for a higher fee, you can do more complex options like 5 keys and white glove service with either Casa or Unchained.\n\nOne mobile & one hardware wallet or two hardware wallets?\n\nOne Mobile & One Hardware Wallet:\n\nWith mobile, it\u2019s almost always on you, so if somebody steals your hardware wallet, you\u2019ll still have your phone with you, which some may argue adds a degree of safety.\n\nIf you choose to keep one of the hardware wallets in your residence, you can conveniently transact anytime using it and your mobile device. Alternatively, if you choose to keep your hardware wallet separate from your primary residence, you\u2019d need to go there to transact, which is less convenient but arguably even safer.\n\nFinally, if a natural disaster destroys your hardware wallet and phone, you can get back your mobile key from a cloud backup (more later), and use this with Casa\u2019s key to recover your balance.\n\n\n\nTwo Hardware Wallets:\n\nWhile mobile can be convenient, the two-hardware wallet solution is a great option, too, and even more secure for those who don\u2019t expect to transact much if kept in different locations.\n\nIf kept in different locations, you\u2019ll need to bring your first hardware wallet to your second location whenever you need to transact.\n\nSee here by Unchained for different setup ideas for two hardware wallets. The maximum security setup would involve four locations that each have one of your two hardware wallets and two seed phrases. Very secure, but at the cost of inconvenience. A middle ground solution is keeping each pair of hardware wallet + seed phrase in two locations.\n\nIs mobile safe?\n\nYes. The mobile private key is literally on your device in a secure enclave that can\u2019t be accessed by anyone, not even your mobile device manufacturer. This means that even if somebody stole your Casa login credentials and logged in on their phone, they still can\u2019t sign because they need your exact mobile device.\n\nWhat if I change or lose phones?\n\nIt is backed up to iCloud for iPhone and Google Drive for Android and can be re-established on a new phone.\n\nRisk Scenarios:\n\nSomebody steals your two keys: If a thief somehow manages to steal two of your keys (whether it\u2019s two hardware or one mobile and one hardware) and get through the security needed to use those devices, they\u2019d still need to know your login to your multisig provider (Casa or Unchained). This is because signing a transaction requires two private keys, but also the three public keys (note: public key is different from your address; your address is derived from your public key through hashing). The three public keys are accessed automatically through your multisig provider when you log in to transact. Multisig provider goes down: You can send funds out using open-source software like Electrum or Spectrum. This process is called Sovereign Recovery. For Casa, you\u2019d basically export your mobile private key and seed phrase and re-establish your wallet on Electrum or Spectrum using your hardware device, mobile, and the Casa public key. For Unchained, you\u2019d do the same using your two hardware wallets. Both Casa and Unchained provide detailed instructions on their website if this is ever needed.\n\nEthereum Multisig\n\nFor Ethereum, Casa offers an ETH vault that basically uses Safe (rebranded from Gnosis Safe) under the hood and comes for free if you use their BTC vault. However, it does not allow altcoins beyond USDC and Tether yet. Unchained is Bitcoin only by philosophy (something that Bitcoin maxis appreciate) so it does not offer ETH multisig.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use Safe directly, as it\u2019s free to use, and you can hold any altcoin. It is the dominant DIY open-source multisig solution on Ethereum used by all decentralized orgs. They recently raised $100M on a $1B valuation. I got to be familiar with using it, as my most recent startup nestwallet.xyz was built on the Safe protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference to note between using Casa and Safe directly is that with Safe, you are responsible for safeguarding all your signer devices and their seed phrases, whereas with Casa, you can rely on them to hold one key (Casa key), while the mobile key will be held on your phone and accessed through their app without requiring you to write down a seed phrase (this mobile private key and seed phrase can be exported out, but you\u2019d only do so for Sovereign Recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Safe, you can set it up however you want, like 2/3 signers, 3/5, 2/2, etc. Safe also has a mobile app that can serve as a key, but as I mentioned above, you\u2019ll have to write down the seed phrase for it in a secure location if you choose to use it. The other signers can be hardware wallets, hot wallets (like Metamask), or a combination. The most important thing is to keep the seed phrases in separate geographic locations.\n\nLet me know what you think\n\nHopefully, this was helpful as you think about safeguarding your own crypto. It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve thought a lot about, and it is important to have a solution that is immune to all the major risks - theft of a single device, natural disaster, or an exchange going down (a la FTX or the multitude of others).\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this as a starting point, but I recommend doing your own research and choosing the setup that best fits your needs. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions, and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.\n\nAlso published here."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter cooling its November rally Solana has shot up again: it's right now the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing Solana (SOL) is trading for $60.16 per coin\u2014a 24-hour jump of over 7%, according to CoinGecko. Over the past seven days, SOL has gained 10% in value.\n\nSOL experienced a phenomenal rally throughout November. The Ethereum-competitor price soared past $50 for the first time since May 2022, beating most coins and tokens in performance.\n\nAccording to experts, the boom was likely down to a short squeeze caused by short sellers exiting their positions and renewed interest from institutions. But that was nearly a month ago and Solana is still pumping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL was the most oversold asset in the space after rumors swirled that collapsed crypto exchange FTX's new management was thinking about selling large amounts of SOL. But it shot up unexpectedly after short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) rapidly exited their positions.\n\nOver the past 30 days, SOL is up over 70%.\n\nElsewhere, the crypto market is relatively sleepy. Bitcoin has barely budged over a 24-hour period; the same goes for Ethereum. Other major players like Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP have also not moved by a percentage point.\n\nBitcoin yesterday did experience impressive price movements, breaking past $38,000 per coin for the second time in a week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same goes for most of the top digital assets\u2014except for Avalanche (AVAX), which is up in the past day, coming in at $20.87.\n\nAVAX\u2014like SOL\u2014is also a winner over the past 30 days: it has gained 80% in value. The cryptocurrency experienced a price bump earlier this month after banking giant J.P. Morgan said it had used the blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "What Is Block Time? What It Measures, Verification, and Example - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Block Time?\n\nBlock time measures the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain.\n\nBlockchains were first popularized by Bitcoin when it was introduced in 2009. The technology has grown as more cryptocurrencies are created, each of which can use a different or identical blockchain, validation methods, and techniques for creating new blocks.\n\nKey Takeaways Block time is the time it takes to process a block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is verified by miners, who compete against each other to verify the transactions and solve the hash, which creates another block.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, a block is validated by randomly selected nodes, which is must faster because there is no competition.\n\nOther chains might use different mechanisms, which would affect their block times.\n\nUnderstanding Block Time\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions within a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block within the database as a cell in a spreadsheet where transaction information is stored. Bitcoin miners verify the transactions, which takes time because finding the solution to the encryption problem requires the computers to make a vast number of trial-and-error attempts.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called hashing\u2014generating random hexadecimal numbers to try and find one that is less than or equal to one set by the network. When the block solution is found or otherwise validated, a new block is opened. The amount of time it takes to find the solution and create a new block is the block time.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key points to remember if you're trying to understand block time:\n\nA block is a record of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions, similar to a cell in a table of columns and rows.\n\nEach block contains the information from the block that preceded it in hashed form (that's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency).\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptocurrency \"miners\" race against each other to generate a random hash plus the nonce that is less than or equal to the target hash. The winner receives a reward.\n\nEthereum validators use a different consensus mechanism, which makes the block times shorter.\n\nBlockchains that use other mechanisms may have shorter or longer block times.\n\nWhy Block Times Differ\n\nConsensus mechanisms are what allow a network of participants to agree that a transaction is valid. Cryptocurrencies can use different consensus mechanisms, which, among other factors, affect the time it takes to verify transactions and create new blocks.\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that use different transaction verification methods. Each blockchain has a different block time because of the way their mechanisms work\u2014Bitcoin averages about 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 12 seconds.\n\nThe exact amount of time it takes for block generation on the Bitcoin proof-of-work blockchain is governed by the difficulty level, which changes with network traffic and the number of miners on the network to keep block times at 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake, which is much faster because there is no competition for a reward\u2014participants with staked ether are randomly selected to validate the transactions and receive network fees.\n\nBlock Time vs. Confirmation Time\n\nSometimes confused with each other, block times and confirmation times are two different measurements on a blockchain. Confirmation time is the amount of time it takes a blockchain to confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's often thought that a transaction needs six confirmations before it goes through; however, this is a misunderstanding. When a transaction makes it into a block, and the block is closed, the transaction has one confirmation and concludes. The number six comes from the belief that a transaction that was confirmed six times (included in six closed blocks) is secure from any network attacks.\n\nA block may be opened every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not all transactions that occur within that period can be sent to the current block to be mined and confirmed. Confirmation can take up to several hours on the Bitcoin blockchain because transactions are sent to a mempool, where they are queued in order of the amount of fees paid.\n\nUsers who want their transactions placed in front of others pay more than the average, while those who pay average or below-average fees must wait their turn to be sent to a block, verified, and confirmed at least once.\n\n\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created? Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins created yearly halves every four years. This slows down Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Will Ever Be Created? Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be created.\n\nHow Do I Get a Bitcoin Block? You never actually receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's framework. Instead, you receive a reward of bitcoin when your miner solves the hash and creates another block.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are one of the structures used in a blockchain that store information. The time it takes to open a new block on a chain is that chain's block time. Block times differ from confirmation times, which can take several hours or days to complete.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary crypto trader and investor Raoul Pal has waded into the supremacy debate between the two prominent proof-of-stake (PoS) Layer-1 networks Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). According to Pal, the use of Solana comes with a whole different feel that makes it a top contender as a relatively more user-friendly option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said once someone starts using Solana, it \"feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to pull off a major comeback in its price action post-FTX implosion.\n\nOnce you play around in the $SOL ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\n\n\n\nThe best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android.\n\n\n\nBoth win. Huge. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 29, 2023\n\nRaoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.\n\nSolana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems\n\nAlmost everything Ethereum can do, Solana can do as well. It appears that Raoul Pal has broad use of some of Solana's applications, as he attested to the ingenious designs of Phantom Wallet, the most popular unhosted Solana wallet. This he confirmed when an X user asked to know what his feedback is for Phantom Wallet and in his response, he said:\n\nAbsolutely love it. Super easy.\n\nSolana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal confirming he has been bullish all year. The coin soared to its 2023 high earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH top-down analysis hints upside is capped at $2,500 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price trades in a clear consolidative trend on the weekly time frame between $1,933 and $2,141 barriers.\n\nThe daily chart for ETH shows a sweep of Monday\u2019s high is likely to be followed by a sweep of Monday\u2019s low at $1,985.\n\nIf Bitcoin price undergoes a steep double-digit correction, Ether could also slide to $1,933 and $1,829 support levels.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows an ongoing consolidation with no directional bias. But a closer look at the daily chart shows that a potential correction might ensue, especially if Ether is influenced by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum price prediction thesis and short-term bias\n\nAccording to Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analysts, Bitcoin spot ETF is likely to be approved in January 2024. This development has caused FOMO among market participants, making the overall market outlook resoundingly bullish. Interestingly, this is one of the main drivers of the 2023 bull rally.\n\nRead more: Week Ahead: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nBut as the holiday season begins to kick in, liquidity in the market will diminish. Hence, cryptocurrency prices are likely to face manipulation. Additionally, Bitcoin price has already started to slow down its rally and has flashed multiple sell signals.\n\nIf Bitcoin price faces a minor correction, altcoins will shed double digits easily due to the nature of the connection between the two. Likewise, the Ethereum price will also see a correction to key support levels.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: ETF delay and weekly swing failure could crash BTC to $30,000\n\nThis top-down Ethereum price analysis takes a look at ETH from weekly and daily time frames and forecasts buy-the-dip levels.\n\nEthereum price at critical levels on the weekly chart\n\nEthereum price has been in a multi-month consolidative trend that has produced an ascending triangle setup. While the technical formation is inherently bullish, it is only after a successful breakout. So far, ETH has not produced any discernible breakouts, just failed attempts.\n\nThe ascending triangle setup contains equal highs and higher lows, connected via trend lines. This setup shows that investors are becoming increasingly bullish and buying dips at an increasing rate.\n\nA breakout above the $2,000 psychological level was the first sign of a bullish move, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth around this level. To be precise, ETH is hovering between the second quarter high at $2,141 and weekly support at $1,933. This has been happening for the fourth consecutive week.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s trend weakening and signaling a potential double-digit correction, Ethereum price might also catalyze a downside move to flush early longs. In such a case, ETH might eye a retest of the monthly open at $1,814 and a sweep of the monthly low at $1,782. This move would constitute a 9% to 12% move.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nETH bulls likely to take a backseat soon\n\nThe daily chart for Ethereum price shows more nuanced key levels, some of which coincide with the ones seen on the weekly.\n\nFor starters, this week\u2019s Monday range extends from $2,071 to $1,985. While the Monday high was swept on November 28, investors can expect a sweep of the Monday low in the coming days.\n\nA quick move to the downside with the intention of sweeping Monday\u2019s range could lead to a steep correction, especially if it is backed by BTC bears. In that case, investors need to take a look at the 40% Ethereum price rally witnessed between October 12 and November 10. This upswing created a local top at $2,138, and the midpoint of this move rests at $1,829, which coincides closely with the monthly open at $1,814 and monthly close of $1,782.\n\nAll in all, the $1,750 to $1,850 range seems like a good place to buy the dip if it ever comes to that.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the short-term bearish or correction outlook is logical, it is completely contingent on Bitcoin\u2019s sell signals. If BTC lures shorts via a minor correction and proceeds to blast through $40,000, it would obliterate short sellers and cause a massive liquidation event that could sustain a move beyond $40,000.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could overcome the $2,232 hurdle and eye a retest of the weekly resistance level at $2,521."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Throughout the major part of November, the Ethereum price remained within a sideways range, fluctuating between $2133 and $1917. Both of these horizontal levels were tested twice, signaling uncertainty among market participants. However, this consolidation has formed a bearish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential further downside for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why CBDCs Could Outshine BTC, Ethereum, and Other Private Cryptos\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill $ETH Consolidation Lead to Massive Leap?\n\nThe overhead supply at $2133 assists sellers in developing a bearish reversal pattern called double bottom\n\nThe $1917 level aligned with the 32.8% Fibonacci retracement level creates a strong support zone.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.\n\nAmid the past two weeks\u2019 consolidation, the Ethereum price retreated twice from the $2133 resistance, indicating substantial overhead supply. These reversals have emphasized the emergence of a bullish reversal pattern known as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart.\n\nTypically observed near market tops, this pattern signifies a decline in bullish momentum. At present, ETH trades at $2,025 and, with an intraday loss of 1.6%, is gradually approaching the neckline support at $1,970.\n\nA bearish breakdown below this neckline could intensify supply pressure, potentially causing ETH to drop to around the $1700 mark, marking a potential loss of 12%.\n\nHowever, the recent price rejections around the psychological support of $2,000 suggest buyers are attempting to counter the bearish setup. If this buying pressure persists, the ETH price might rebound to challenge the last swing high at $2133 and the upper trendline of a longstanding wedge pattern.\n\nETH Price Recovery to $3400\n\nOver the past 20 months, the ETH price has experienced a shallow recovery within a rising wedge pattern. Historically, the upper boundary of this trendline has resulted in increased supply pressure, leading to significant corrections. Therefore, the current upward movement towards this upper trendline necessitates a definitive breakout to confirm a bullish trend. A post-breakout rally could potentially drive prices up to $3400\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A sharp drop in the daily RSI slope suggests a bearish divergence with the Ethereum price, hinting at potential upcoming downturns.\n\nBollinger Bands: The converging boundaries of the Bollinger Bands indicate an uncertain market sentiment prevailing for Ethereum.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Optimistic Rollups vs. ZK Rollups: Which Is Better? - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Today, we\u2019ll differentiate between ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups, famous Ethereum Layer 2 protocols that help boost speed and lower costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first, let\u2019s define rollups.\n\nWhat are Blockchain Rollups?\n\nBlockchain rollups are scaling solutions designed to scale slow and expensive blockchains like Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRollups process transactions on another, faster blockchain called Layer 2, then bundle them up into groups or batches and submit them to the parent blockchain (Layer 1) instead of sending each one individually.\n\nThat way, the cost of that transaction is split across many users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, their time is saved because they don\u2019t have to wait and pay for each transaction to process independently on Ethereum.\n\nTherefore, users can benefit from the speed and cheapness of the roll-up while also benefiting from the security of the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it more transparent,\n\nEthereum processes around 15-30 transactions per second (TPS). That's like handling 54,000 - 108,000 transactions in an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, imagine this:\n\nWhen loads of people try to transact, only the top 54,000 - 108,000 transactions get through due to congestion, causing high fees and slow verification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we had an \"express lane\" for Ethereum transactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lane gathers up lots of transactions, say 10 thousand, and bundles them into a single package. Then, this package gets submitted onto the Ethereum network as one transaction.\n\nSo, one move represents a group of transactions, easing the congestion and boosting TPS.\n\nWith this, Ethereum could process over 10,000 transactions per second.\n\nThis is the ideology behind rollups.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we\u2019ll look at the two main types of rollups.\n\nTypes Of Rollups (Optimistic vs. Zero Knowledge)\n\nThe difference is how they verify transactions before posting them to the main blockchain.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Optimistic Rollup.\n\nFor Optimistic rollups, they assume that all the transactions contained within a rollup are valid unless proven otherwise using a fraud-proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransactions are grouped off-chain into a batch and processed off-chain by a set of validators, after which they are submitted to the main chain in a compressed format.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here is the exciting part:\n\nNetwork users can dispute fraudulent transactions before they are submitted to the main chain to ensure that this batch of transactions is not manipulated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is termed the \u201cchallenge period,\u201d during which anyone can submit evidence or fraud-proof to prove a transaction is invalid. This lasts for about a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no evidence is submitted, the batch is considered valid and is added to the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if evidence is submitted, the dispute is resolved through a dispute resolution process, and the batch is either accepted or rejected based on the procedure's outcome.\n\nNext is the Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollup.\n\nZK rollups do not assume the validity of the submitted transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they use a sophisticated cryptographic technique known as Zero-Knowledge proof to verify the legitimacy of transactions before submitting them to the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs are a type of cryptography that allows someone to prove that they know something without revealing what the thing is.\n\n\\In the case of ZK rollups, \u201cthe thing\u201d that is being proven is that the transactions in a rollup block are valid without showing all the transaction details.\n\nLike other rollup solutions, ZK Rollup begins by grouping multiple transactions into a batch or rollup block.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, it uses mathematical algorithms to generate validity proofs for each transaction within the batch.\n\nInstead of submitting all transaction details to the main blockchain, it submits only these validity proofs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese validity proofs indicate that the transactions have indeed occurred and are valid.\n\nIn addition, the validity proof allows anyone to confirm that the transactions within a rollup block are valid without revealing any information about those transactions.\n\nBut Which is Better of These Two?\n\nLet\u2019s look at their strength and weaknesses under these four categories.\n\nTransaction Validity time Security and Privacy Gas Fees and Implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Delay in Transaction Validity\n\nOptimistic rollup transaction verification can take a week because of how fraud-proof works.\n\nThis means that users' funds take up to a week to be reversed during the challenge period if the transaction's validity is questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, ZK rollups eliminate the need for a challenge period.\n\nThis enables users to withdraw their funds promptly and without any waiting period.\n\n2. Security and Privacy\n\nCompared to Optimistic rollups, ZK rollups offer improved security and privacy by verifying transactions through validity proofs.\n\n3. Gas Fees\n\nZK rollups typically have higher gas fees as they require more computational power than Optimistic rollups to generate validity proofs.\n\n4. Implementation\n\nZK rollups are generally more complex to implement than Optimistic rollups.\n\nThis is primarily due to the cryptographic techniques and computations in generating and verifying Zero-Knowledge proofs.\n\nIn addition, ZK rollups are limited to supporting specific use cases, such as swapping NFTs or transferring coins.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a new type of ZK rollup called zkEVMs.\n\nzkEVMs are a new type of ZK rollup that is EVM-compatible\n\nThis means that they can be used to run Ethereum applications.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBoth Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups are promising scaling solutions for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, they have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimistic rollups lead the way regarding reduced complexity and lower gas fees.\n\nTwo of the leading layer 2 blockchains that use optimistic rollups are Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to security, scalability, and privacy, Zk rollups take the lead.\n\nSome of the most prominent layer 2 blockchains using ZK rollups are Polygon zkEVM and zkSync.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Discover the exciting world of Ethereum sports betting in 2023. Learn how to place bets using cryptocurrency, understand the benefits, and explore expert tips and tricks for successful betting. Dive into the future of sports gambling with Ethereum.\n\nThe Beginner's Playbook to Ethereum Sports Betting: How to Wager Crypto on Games\n\nEthereum and sports betting go hand-in-hand. If you're new to crypto wagering on games, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. Learn how Ethereum sportsbooks work, find the top sites to bet at, and get tips to do it safely. More about experiences in crypto betting read in our guide.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Sports Betting Work\n\nEthereum Sports Betting\n\nEthereum sports betting refers to the act of wagering on sporting events using Ethereum and its blockchain technology. With Ethereum sports betting, bettors can place bets on games and matches using Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. The bettor deposits Ether into a sportsbook or betting exchange and can use the Ether to place bets. The transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which is transparent, permanent, and verifiable. Once the outcome of the event is determined, winnings are paid out in Ether back to the bettor's wallet. Ethereum brings the key benefits of blockchain technology to sports betting - decentralized, transparent, and secure transactions with fast settlement times. Bets can be placed pseudo-anonymously, with no central authority controlling the flow of funds.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in Sports Betting\n\nEthereum plays several key roles in enabling trustless, peer-to-peer sports betting:\n\nBet Settlement - The Ethereum blockchain allows for fast, secure, and verifiable settlement of sports bets. Outcomes can be determined objectively based on data feeds or other oracles, and winnings automatically distributed per the smart contract terms.\n\nTransparency - All bets and payouts are visible on the public Ethereum ledger, enabling independent verification of sportsbook activities. This prevents fraudulent behavior.\n\nSecurity - Cryptographic signatures enabled by Ethereum prevent unauthorized withdrawals or changes to bets. User funds are secured through private keys and are not controlled by sportsbooks.\n\nSpeed - Ethereum processes transactions quickly, allowing bettors to swiftly place wagers and cash out winnings. Bets can be made right up to the start of an event.\n\nAccessibility - Ethereum sports betting is accessible to anyone globally with an internet connection. Geographic restrictions are removed through blockchain technology.\n\nBy integrating these technical advantages, Ethereum unlocks provably fair, quick, and globally accessible sports betting.\n\nHow to Bet with Ethereum\n\nBetting with Ethereum consists of three key steps:\n\nObtain an Ethereum Wallet - To transact on Ethereum, you'll need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask. This will allow you to securely store Ether and interact with betting platforms.\n\nFund Your Wallet - Transfer Ether into your wallet by purchasing it from an exchange or requesting a transfer from an existing Ethereum account. Popular exchanges to buy Ether include Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.\n\nPlace Your Bets - Connect your wallet to a sports betting platform that accepts Ether. Review the available betting markets and odds, select your wagers, and submit the Ethereum transaction. If your bet wins, profits will be sent back to your wallet.\n\nIt's important to exercise caution when choosing a sports betting platform and only deposit what you can afford to lose, as with any form of gambling. But by following these steps, you can enjoy trustless and efficient Ethereum sports betting.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum Sports Betting\n\nUsing Ethereum as a means to bet on sporting events brings important advantages compared to traditional online sportsbooks:\n\nSpeed and Efficiency\n\nOne major benefit is the speed and efficiency enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions on Ethereum take 15 seconds or less to complete, compared to 3-5 days for bank transfers or credit cards. This allows bettors to swiftly deposit funds, place last-minute wagers before an event begins, and instantly withdraw winnings. Ethereum cuts out delays from middlemen payment processors - bets are peer-to-peer. The efficiency of smart contracts also allows for complex betting scenarios like parlays, prop bets, and live in-game wagering to be executed seamlessly on Ethereum.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nEthereum sports betting also enhances privacy and security compared to traditional sportsbooks. All transactions are pseudo-anonymous - bettors transact using Ethereum addresses rather than real identities. Funds are secured through cryptographic private keys as opposed to passwords. Ethereum's distributed network makes it virtually immune to hacks, offering rock-solid security of user funds. Smart contracts act as trustless escrow accounts, only distributing winnings automatically once bet conditions are met. This prevents sportsbooks from withholding funds or changing odds retroactively.\n\nChallenges in Ethereum Sports Betting\n\nHowever, there are some challenges to evaluate with Ethereum sports betting:\n\nVolatility of Ethereum\n\nAs a cryptocurrency, the value of Ether can fluctuate dramatically. The stakes of bets made in Ether may change quickly. This introduces some unpredictability compared to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Sudden crashes in Ether price right before major sporting events could cause issues for betting platforms. Users may lose funds simply from Ether volatility rather than losing bets.\n\nLegal Considerations\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrency sports betting varies widely across different countries and jurisdictions. While decentralized, blockchain betting removes geographic restrictions, local laws still apply. Bettors should research if sports betting is permitted where they live, regardless of whether Ether or fiat currencies are used to place wagers. Know your rights and obligations.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum in Sports Betting\n\nBased on its current trajectory, Ethereum appears poised to continue disrupting the online sports betting industry in the future:\n\nIncreased adoption of Ethereum by major sportsbooks will streamline crypto betting and provide on-ramps for new bettors.\n\nFurther development of smart contract capabilities will support sophisticated betting markets and oracle data feeds.\n\nThe scalability improvements coming to Ethereum will allow higher transaction throughput at lower costs.\n\nMainstream interest in cryptocurrencies will drive new bettors to explore Ethereum sports betting.\n\nDecentralized sports betting exchanges will remove counterparty risk inherent with sportsbooks.\n\nAs Ethereum technology progresses and gains mainstream traction, the advantages and applications for sports betting will only expand further. Ethereum has the potential to fundamentally transform sports betting by opening up true peer-to-peer, global markets backed by the transparency and security of blockchain technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum sports betting presents an exciting new paradigm through which to engage with sports. It provides bettors with a transparent, fast, secure, and decentralized way to wager on sporting events and outcomes. By leveraging Ethereum's native cryptocurrency and blockchain, bettors can place trustless peer-to-peer bets without centralized authority. This unlocks powerful advantages like speed, efficiency, enhanced privacy, and global accessibility compared to traditional sportsbooks. While challenges around volatility and legality exist, Ethereum sports betting is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of provably fair outcomes, liquid betting markets, and instant payouts. As the technology matures, Ethereum has the capacity to fundamentally transform sports betting for bettors and sportsbooks alike. Understanding the inner workings of Ethereum sports betting is key to appreciate this emerging innovation.\n\nThis article was written in cooperation with SafeHamsters"

        "title": "Top 10 ERC Token Standards You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Learning about the top 10 ERC token standards can help you succeed. The Ethereum ecosystem is the largest and most popular blockchain community in the world. Ethereum has always been a strong contender in the market due to its pioneering efforts and proprietary technology.\n\nWhen you review the rise of this mighty crypto community, you can't help but realize the prominent role that token standards have had on its journey. Token standards can be seen as one of the most influential developments in the industry.\n\nPrior to token standards, you had multiple developers working on projects that may or may not be able to communicate and interact with other protocols. The introduction of standards to the crypto market, as any, helped to drive innovation and has led to a constant expansion of the most popular networks. Here are the top 10 ERC-20 token standards in use today.\n\nERC\n\nERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is a set of guidelines to ensure interoperability between new and old dApps and platforms. The original goal of the project was to streamline the creation of digital assets in-house. However, it quickly became popular for regular users and startups to expedite token creation.\n\nThe ERC token standardization movement has seen considerable growth alongside the rising number of formats available. Each of these token standards serves a unique purpose that makes it ideal for its tasks. From compliance to scalability, there's a token standard to meet your needs.\n\n1. ERC-20\n\nThe first token standard to hit the market was the ERC-20 standard. This standard emerged in the middle of 2017 after Vitalik Buterin and the rest of the Ethereum team realized that people wanted a simplistic way to launch tokens. The results of making the ERC-20 token available to everyone were immediate.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard has helped thousands of startups and developers create tokens and platforms that seamlessly merge with the Ethereum community. Notably, the standard is still widely used today, even though the competition has increased and new standards offer more specialized functions.\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard is a capable solution enabling developers to create fungible and non-fungible assets. This standard is capable of tokenizing real-world assets as well. This flexibility and its role as the first and most popular standard has made ERC-20 the top option in the market today for many. It's mostly found in stablecoins, governance tokens, and project launches such as ICOs.\n\n2. ERC-721\n\nThe ERC-721 token format was created to serve the growing NFT community. NFTs are digital assets that can represent individual assets. As such, they are best used for gaming, collectibles, and tokenization. The ERC-721 standard was made famous by the collectible game CryptoKitties.\n\nERC-721 was first proposed by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs in January 2018. The standard differs from its predecessor in some key ways. For one, it leverages an API for tokens built directly into smart contracts. This structure adds more functionality, such as the ability to approve third-party transfers. All of these factors make ERC-721 a smart option for game and collectible developers.\n\n3. ERC-1155\n\nThe continued expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem led to the eventual creation of the ERC-115 protocol. This token standard was first introduced by Enjin CEO Witek Radomski. The goal of this standard was to make a more inclusive option for developers. As such, it combines many of the features of the previous two standards.\n\nThis token standard leverages a robust interface that enables developers to fulfill deployment requirements and correct any issues that arise from one location. ERC-1155 can represent all types of digital assets, including non, semi, and fully fungible assets. Today, the token serves a crucial role as a go-to option for NFT game developers. It's also used in ICOs, digital ID systems, and gaming applications.\n\nERC-115 provides added functionality without reducing security. Developers have found that this standard is a bit more programmable than its predecessors and can scale more efficiently. Consequently, many developers have turned to ERC-1155 to solve their issues and launch their platforms.\n\n4. ERC-777\n\nThe ERC-777 protocol improves token management services for developers. The system allows creators to add more specifications on how and to whom their tokens can be transferred. This added logic makes it better suited to certain applications, such as dealing with regulated tokens and fixed assets.\n\nThe ERC-777 protocol has many benefits that make it stand out against the other options. For one, it supports unique options such as automatic swaps and send-and-receive hooks. Additionally, all ERC-777 tokens are backward compatible with ERC-20 token standards, adding to their interoperability and ease of use.\n\n5. ERC-1400\n\nThe rise of security tokens led to the creation of the ERC-14000 tokens standard. This standard emerged as a viable way to help solve some of the regulatory issues that ICOs had encountered the years prior. Security tokens are unique in that they have all regulatory compliance tasks built directly into their core coding.\n\nThis structure means that these tokens can be used to tokenize regulated assets such as real estate. The system enables developers to meet all regulatory criteria without exception. Additionally, since all the security token requirements are baked into the token itself, the asset remains compliant throughout its life cycle.\n\nERC-1400 is a popular token standard that is in use across a variety of industries. Today, you can find developments in tokenizing equity, property, debt, and much more using this standard. This standard has also found a home in the art sector where its features can help to demonstrate ownership and validate projects.\n\n6. ERC-4337\n\nOne of the safest ways to use crypto is via a multi-sig wallet. These wallets require multiple people to sign off to transfer. The same concept now goes for tokens. The ERC-4337 standard supports multi-signature wallets on Ethereum. This structure makes it easier to solve complex ownership issues and create more innovative structures around assets.\n\nERC-4337 tokens are a great way to ensure that all parties approve of the token's actions. Additionally, these tokens have found some use in governance mechanisms. Here they can ensure that only after the signers approve changes do the upgrades occur. ERC-4337 offers security, scalability, and transparency to the market.\n\n7. ERC-512\n\nNFT technology is often seen as the best option for representing digital assets. However, many people overlook its use as an identifying token. Decentralized identity management systems are on the rise, and for good reasons. They lower costs, increase efficiency, and provide high security.\n\nThanks to this token standard, implementing these digital ID systems is now easier than ever. This standard was built from the ground up to handle verification tasks such as verifying claims and credentials. Additionally, the standard is the first to support ID management systems. These systems help to protect your ID and the systems they operate within.\n\n8. ERC-6551\n\nThe ERC-6551 tokens standard was created to help reduce gas prices for transaction-intensive Dapps. The Ethereum gas price concerns have been an issue for years. The network has implemented many updates to lower these fees, but many still desire a token standard that makes this process easy.\n\nThe ERC-6551 tokens standard helps resource-intensive dApps and blockchain networks remain responsive. To accomplish this task, the protocol enables the batch processing of transactions. This feature lowers the gas prices significantly for these dApps. It also reduces network congestion.\n\n9. ERC-4626\n\nThe ERC-4626 tokens standard is the evolution of the space. This next-generation standard improves the communication between network nodes and smart contracts significantly. These tokens are designed to reduce complexity by integrating self-describing smart contracts.\n\nThese smart contracts make it easier to build complex dApps from scratch. They enable creators to offer more features and track their assets with more clarity. Additionally, their versatile nature makes them a smart option for many of the tasks that traditional ERC-20 tokens would handle.\n\n10. ERC-998\n\nThe latest trend in the NFT race is composable tokens. These are NFTs that can be created on top of each other. They are often used in gaming scenarios where users can customize their avatars or other items. This feature enables developers to create and manage complex token structures across vast networks.\n\nCurrently, the ERC-998 tokens standard is used to create collectible and gaming tokens that can be upgraded via other token add-ons. They are often used in DAOs to improve transparency. Lastly, the standard provides a reliable and effective way to tokenize real-world assets quickly.\n\nTop 10 erc-20 token standards \u2013 Just the tip of the Iceberg\n\nIt's exciting to see how the Ethereum community has continued to keep up with the changing market by expanding these token standards. Today, developers have more tools and options to consider when creating. Understanding the different token types and their purpose can help you create better dApps that cost you and the user less. As such, the Ethereum token standard movement can be seen as a pioneering force in the market that will remain a strong contender for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou can learn more about exciting blockchain projects here."

        "title": "Aragon Expands DAO Ecosystem with Deployment on Arbitrum - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "Aragon, a pioneer in DAO technology, has deployed its modular Aragon OSx DAO framework and no-code Aragon App on Arbitrum, Ethereum\u2019s leading Layer 2 (L2) solution. This integration unlocks new possibilities for DAOs by providing them access to a thriving ecosystem of protocols, applications, and assets.\n\nArbitrum, known for its rollup technology, has established itself as the industry\u2019s most popular L2 solution with over $7 billion total value locked and 55% of the L2 market share. By choosing to launch on Arbitrum, DAOs stand to benefit from several advantages that can potentially revolutionize their operations.\n\nReduced Gas Costs and Increased Voter Turnout\n\nOne of the most immediate benefits of operating on Arbitrum is the substantial reduction in gas costs. Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have long been a concern for DAOs, as they can significantly erode resources. By transitioning to Arbitrum, DAOs can conserve valuable resources while simultaneously incentivizing increased voter turnout, as lower transaction costs make participation more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nSimplified Custom DAO Deployment\n\nBuilding custom DAOs on Arbitrum is made remarkably straightforward, thanks to the platform\u2019s full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. This feature streamlines the deployment of custom integrations and allows developers to harness Ethereum\u2019s extensive developer ecosystem to tailor DAOs to their specific needs.\n\nEnhanced Security and Speed\n\nArbitrum\u2019s close association with Ethereum ensures that DAOs launching on this L2 solution inherit the robust security features for which Ethereum is renowned. This not only guarantees a safer experience for users but also provides a seamless transition for DAOs seeking to establish themselves in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, Arbitrum offers faster transaction speeds, significantly reducing the time required for DAO administration and governance activities. This acceleration in transaction processing can contribute to more efficient decision-making and overall DAO operations.\n\nIvan Fartunov, Head of Ecosystem at Aragon, said: \u201cArbitrum is by far the most adopted rollup in the EVM ecosystem, both in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and protocols launched on the network. In addition to being home to impactful multichain projects like Stargate, Arbitrum has spurred many exciting native projects like GMX, Tenderize, and Plutus. We are excited to join such a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAragon\u2019s commitment to accessibility is evident in its no-code solutions, which have already facilitated the launch of over 7,000 DAOs across Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) and L2 networks. Now, with Aragon available on Arbitrum, communities can create a DAO in under 10 minutes and manage their assets transparently through a user-friendly app.\n\nThe secure and modular design of Aragon OSx opens doors for protocols deployed on Arbitrum to customize their governance with plugins, including multichain governance and optimistic dual governance. This flexibility enhances the potential use cases for DAOs and underscores the growing synergy between Aragon and Arbitrum in their mission to bring more participants into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nRead Also: Introducing Dark Fusion: The Future of Smart Contracts and Tokens on Bitcoin"

        "content": "The truce between Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson and members of the XRP Community is currently being threatened following the recent spat on X over the role of Ethereum\u2019s core developer Joseph Lubin in the regulatory crackdown on Ripple Labs Inc. by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nCardano Founder and XRP Community Truce Broken\n\nThe root of the current spat stems from a recent interview granted by Hoskinson in which he tasked leaders in the community to stop spreading \u201cconspiracy\u201d theories over the alleged bribery of SEC officials to go after XRP through Ripple Labs while giving Ethereum and Bitcoin a free pass.\n\nadvertisement\n\nXRP Community member Mr Huber (@Leerzeit) called out Hoskinson for painting the community in a way that makes them look ridiculous and embarrassing to the public. Hr Huber said the Cardano Founder has done this over the past 2 years despite his offering of peace.\n\nResponding, Hoskinson maintained his position saying that irrespective of the social volume of posts shared on this matter, it does not negate the fact that there is no evidence to substantiate the claims that Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys founder sold out XRP as the community claims.\n\nFor the argument that Joe bribed the SEC to go after XRP that is the conclusion. That is the entire point of calling it a grand conspiracy. The free pass has nothing to do with the case against Ripple. They are unrelated events. Two years now and you haven't provided any evidence\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2023\n\nCharles Hoskinson said while waiting for evidence from the XRP community, he will maintain his position that the claims Ethereum was favored at the expense of XRP remain untrue.\n\nConflict of Interest at the SEC?\n\nConnecting the odds between XRP, Ethereum, and the SEC relationship at the time the SEC lawsuit was filed is a strong debate in the crypto ecosystem today, with many pro-crypto lawyers sharing their takes on the matter. The conflict of interest that John Deaton has pointed out now stems from the relationship between Jay Clayton\u2019s law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and ConsenSys, whose fortune rests entirely on Ethereum.\n\nWith Jay Clayton stepping away from his role at the SEC days after the historic Ripple Lawsuit was filed to join One River Asset Management, a firm with deep stakes in Bitcoin (BTC) also lends credence to the assumption that the crackdown on XRP at the time had more to do than just matters of the law.\n\nIronically, Cardano (ADA) has also been marked by the SEC as an investment contract, a positive that places Charles Hoskinson in the same position that Brad Garlinghouse was back in December 2020.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.
