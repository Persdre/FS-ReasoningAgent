        "title": "Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETFs: The Race Is On - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThe bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race is on for 2024.\n\nA 24% performance differential divides the popular crypto investments, as futures-based Ethereum ETFs are up nearly 15% and the new spot bitcoin ETFs are down 9% in their first three days of trading through Jan. 16.\n\nOver that brief period, $1.2 billion has flowed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while $740 million has flowed into new spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), meaning that almost $2billion has gone into the non-GBTC spot bitcoin ETFs this year. The heavy flows and trading volume partially explain the negative performance for spot bitcoin ETFs thus far.\n\nInvestors Eye SEC Approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be gaining a similar kind of investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin did in 2023, as multiple issuers, including the ETF behemoth BlackRock, Inc., have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The timetable for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Ethereum ETF takes us to May 2024, which could lead to the bidding up of Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the 2024 spot bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race has only just begun, the story is setting up as the more established cryptocurrency versus the rising outsider.\n\nGBTC Outflows Impact Spot Bitcoin ETF Pricing\n\nDigging a bit deeper into spot bitcoin\u2019s poor start, $1.2 billion flowing out of GBTC pumped significant liquidity into the bitcoin ecosystem. The higher supply offset the early demand; thus, the price did not leap higher as many expected. The SEC announcement also appeared to become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nBTC\u2019s price rose more than 21% from late November through Jan. 8, peaking near $47,000 according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko data, as signs suggested increasingly that the SEC would approve at least a few of the filings (the agency approved all 11 applications). A primary reason for GBTC\u2019s huge outflows is likely its expense ratio of 1.50%, which is more than 100 basis points higher than any of the other 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on the market. Another reason is that GBTC had previously been a closed-end bitcoin trust with $29 billion in assets, and the SEC allowed it to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF last week as the new spot ETFs launched.\n\nGBTC\u2019s conversion enabled investors to sell shares. They had likely been waiting to exit the closed-end fund once they were longer locked in. Many investors bought GBTC at a discount in 2023, which was as low as 50%. and sold at par to capture gains after the conversion.\n\nClosed-end funds can be less liquid than ETFs, which are open-ended funds. The limited number of shares outstanding can result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for CEFs. If there aren't enough buyers, a closed-end fund can trade at a discount.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETF Race?\n\nInvestors will likely be eyeing the bitcoin halving in April. The halving will cut the reward for bitcoin miners from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the number of tokens entering the system. Observers of the digital asset space widely expect the event to boost BTC\u2019s price and bring more assets into spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin miners are lynchpins of the blockchain, helping to ensure its integrity. A month later, the SEC will decide on multiple applications for Ethereum ETFs, which could increase the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "title": "Arbitrum Commands Nearly Half of Total Market Share in Ethereum Rollups: Nansen - Unchained",
        "content": "Arbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d according to a Nansen analyst, but investors are concerned about its upcoming $2 billion token unlock.\n\nArbitrum, the leading scaling solution for Ethereum, has captured roughly half of the entire rollup market share, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen in a research report published Thursday.\n\nRollups are designed to help users transact faster and more inexpensively on the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain and batching a collection of transactions before posting them to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nWith $11.47 billion in locked value in its smart contracts, Arbitrum has captured about 48% of the entire rollup market share.\n\nArbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d Nansen research analyst Sandra Leow said in the research report. Notably, growth in daily transactions and monthly revenue has been impressive. Despite Ethereum surpassing it in daily transactions, Arbitrum averages 600,000 to 900,000 transactions per day, outpacing its rollup rival, Optimism, the second largest rollup with over $5.5 billion in locked value, per L2Beat.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue trajectory has been consistently upward since Sept. 2023, Leow noted. Last month, Arbitrum generated revenue of $11.9 million, its highest monthly earnings to date.\n\nConcerns About Upcoming Token Unlock\n\nThe outlook is not all sunny for Arbitrum, however. Some crypto investors see risks in Arbitrum due to its upcoming token unlocks which will free up a massive amount of ARB.\n\nToken unlocks refer to the release of frozen or locked cryptocurrencies. Ideally, token unlocks are gradual to prevent large-scale sell-offs by early investors. But Arbitrum is about to have a \u201cheavy unlock,\u201d explained Charles Storry, co-founder of crypto index platform Phuture, to Unchained on Telegram.\n\nRight now, Arbitrum has a very small circulating supply of 1.275 billion ARB, only 12.75% of its total token supply. However, in about two months, 1.11 billion ARB \u2014 87% of its circulating supply \u2014 will be unlocked.\n\nAfter the March unlock, which is valued at over $2 billion, Arbitrum will begin monthly unlocks for the next three years, according to its governance documents.\n\nPositive Catalysts\n\nSeveral catalysts may increase positive sentiment among the Arbitrum community, however, according to Nansen\u2019s Leow. The first is a recently passed proposal about the implementation of a staking mechanism, which would let token holders lock their ARB in exchange for rewards.\n\nThe second is Arbitrum\u2019s short-term incentive program (STIP), which allows protocols such as GMX and Camelot to apply and receive grants as a means to boost on-chain activity.\n\nThe third is EIP-4844, which \u201cis a big step forward in Ethereum\u2019s Rollup-centric roadmap,\u201d because it reduces the cost of rollups by 10-20x, wrote Leow. While investors have expressed bearish remarks about ARB\u2019s price, \u201cgenerally people are more closely monitoring EIP-4844 (blobs) in the Ethereum Dencun upgrade,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, said to Unchained over Telegram.\n\nRead More: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Live on Testnet After Bug Delays Finalization\n\nThe last catalyst revolves around Arbitrum Orbit, which allows developers to create new chains atop Arbitrum\u2019s layer 2 rollup. According to Leow, the main benefit of Arbitrum Orbit is that it allows the use of tokens native to the chains atop Arbitrum as compensation for gas, which would \u201climit sell pressure of the said token.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite investor concerns over imminent token unlocks and the ARB token\u2019s underperformance, ARB is strategically positioned as a frontrunner in the optimistic rollup sector, commanding nearly half of the total market share in rollups,\u201d Leow said.\n\nARB, the governance token for Arbitrum, is currently trading at $1.91, down roughly 14% in the past seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor for Unchained."

        "content": "A recent conversation with Vitalik Buterin on X platform sheds light on a few important topics regarding L2 networks \u2013 the main scalability tool for the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, an L2 solution is a secondary framework or protocol built atop the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase transaction capacity and speed without compromising the security provided by the main chain, known as layer 1 (L1). This conversation is vital because it helps users understand the types of solutions available and their respective tradeoffs.\n\nYeah I agree with this. I called them \"security-favoring\" vs \"scale-favoring\" here, but we can probably come up with better terms (\"strong L2\" vs \"light L2\" perhaps?)https://t.co/oSPZkB3Xo3 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin participated in a discussion clarifying that \"L2s\" encompass both rollups and validiums. The distinction is important for users to grasp the different security and scalability features. Rollups are \"security-favoring\" solutions that bundle or \"roll up\" transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain.\n\nThis process allows for high security, as the L1 blockchain directly secures them. In contrast, validiums are \"scale-favoring,\" designed to boost capacity by storing data off-chain but with proofs still on-chain, offering slightly less security for much greater scalability.\n\nThe distinction is nuanced but significant. While rollups are more expensive due to the data being posted on-chain, they offer higher security. Validiums, on the other hand, provide a cheaper alternative, with a slight tradeoff in security. Buterin suggests that the terminology should reflect these differences without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he proposes terms like \"strong L2\" for rollups and \"light L2\" for validiums to help users navigate their choices better.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin also points out that the architecture of L2 solutions is not strictly about security levels. He previously attempted to categorize these layers but recognized that there is a significant \"intermediate space\" between rollups and validiums, further complicating the classification."

        "title": "What Is Immutable? The Ethereum Network for Crypto and NFT Games - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nImmutable X is a layer-2 scaling network built on top of Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Developed by the Web3 firm Immutable via tech created by StarkWare, Immutable X uses the native ERC-20 token IMX and hosts a number of different blockchain games on its network like Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Illuvium, and Ember Sword, to name a few.\n\nWhile Ethereum proponents argue that its mainnet is among the most decentralized and secure of all cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s also historically suffered from high gas fees and long waits to make transactions. This has long caused friction with NFT creators like those behind the CryptoKitties, who once clogged the mainnet with their digital cats and made it virtually unusable.\n\nBecause NFTs\u2014unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership\u2014are currently so essential to blockchain games, it\u2019s unfeasible for most game developers to build on the Ethereum mainnet. That\u2019s where layer-2 solutions like Immutable X come in, plus Immutable is expanding with another new zkEVM scaling network ahead. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Immutable platform.\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmutable X is a gaming-focused protocol that\u2019s built atop the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security, but with the speed and lower transaction costs of a layer-2 scaling network. In other words, it provides additional benefits on top of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Immutable X\u2019s whitepaper, the network allows users to make transactions with zero gas fees. This is partly possible due to Immutable X\u2019s use of StarkWare\u2019s ZK rollup technology which bundles transactions and can enable over 9,000 NFT transactions per second.\n\nWho created Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is the main Web3 firm behind the Immutable X protocol. The company is part blockchain developer and part game publisher, as Immutable developed the NFT card-battling game Gods Unchained and is publishing the action role-playing game Guild of Guardians.\n\nPer Crunchbase data, Immutable has raised nearly $280 million in funding from 32 investors as of January 2024, with firms like Tencent, GameStop Digital Ventures, King River Capital, and the now-defunct Alameda Research investing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nImmutable X supports all Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users can also create an Immutable Passport to transact on the network. Immutable Passport is designed to be a streamlined and more approachable crypto wallet for gamers, plus it provides a unified identity across games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protocol itself sits on top of the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for Immutable X to leverage the mainnet\u2019s decentralization and security for finalizing transactions. But because Immutable X uses ZK rollups, its transactions on its layer-2 network are still able to be fast and cost-effective.\n\nImmutable has built multiple REST application programming interfaces (APIs), meaning they are APIs that adhere to a specific set of architectural standards. Immutable\u2019s REST APIs mean that transactions can consist of an API call, which takes less time than engaging with a protocol directly via a smart contract.\n\nWho's using Immutable X?\n\nA number of different NFT marketplaces and game developers have chosen to offer their products and services on ImmutableX. In June 2022, Immutable Ventures established a massive $500 million fund to invest in Web3 gaming projects being built on Immutable X and to also provide various developers with grant-based funding.\n\nRarible, Mintable, NFTrade, TokenTrove, OKX, and Kinguin are NFT marketplaces that use Immutable X. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop also launched its NFT marketplace on Immutable X in 2022, but has since discontinued its own crypto wallet and has said that it will shut down its marketplace in February 2024.\n\nGames like IMVU, Guild of Guardians, Habbo, Cross the Ages, Undead Blocks, Ember Sword, Planet Quest, Gods Unchained, WAGMI Defense, and Tiny Colony are building their Web3 elements on Immutable X.\n\nAs the world of Web3 gaming heats up, Immutable X faces competition with other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum Nova, Sui, and Solana to offer a fast and seamless gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Immutable zkEVM?\n\nImmutable is developing more than just Immutable X as its Ethereum gaming platform expands. In March 2023, the firm announced that it is working with competitor Polygon to develop a new Immutable zkEVM scaling network that combines Polygon zkEVM technology with Immutable\u2019s gaming platform.\n\nA number of games have already announced that they\u2019ll be using the Immutable zkEVM, from MetalCore to Shardbound and Elemental Knights. According to an Immutable blog post, the zkEVM network provides native compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, potentially making it easier for developers to port over from EVM chains and utilize an array of third-party tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Immutable platform grows, the IMX token has become the most valuable gaming token as of this writing, with a market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. That makes it the 37th largest overall cryptocurrency by market cap according to data from CoinGecko, as of January 17, 2024.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Activated at 6:32 UTC, the upgrade\u2019s inability to reach consensus has injected uncertainty into the timeline for its deployment on the mainnet, prompting a detailed examination of the factors at play.\n\nEthereum Dencun Fails To Finalize \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthStaker, a prominent voice in the Ethereum staking community, shed light on the complexities underpinning the non-finalization issue. \u201cThe low participation on Goerli suggests a mix of potential client issues and a lack of updated validators. While not overly concerning in the short term, this does necessitate a deep dive into whether these issues stem from validators not upgrading their systems or more systemic client-side problems,\u201d EthStaker explained.\n\nAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates! \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 17, 2024\n\nTerence Tsao from Offchain Labs elaborated on the multifactorial aspects contributing to the testnet\u2019s challenges. \u201cWith a participation rate hovering around 80%, the key to losing finality often lies in approximately 10% of validators being offline,\u201d he stated.\n\nThis may be due to several factors, including failure to update software components or the presence of bugs. \u201cGiven Goerli\u2018s diverse validator composition, it\u2019s premature to conclusively determine the root cause of the issue at hand,\u201d Tsao remarked.\n\nHe advocated for a comprehensive and time-intensive analysis before making any definitive judgments about the Dencun upgrade\u2019s success or potential delays. Proto Lambda, an Ethereum scaling and R&D expert, pinpointed a specific technical mishap that exacerbated the situation. \u201cThe accidental removal of \u2018historical roots\u2019 from the beacon state by Prysm led to a network split. This highlights the intricate challenges in managing the beacon state, a pivotal component of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism,\u201d Proto Lambda highlighted.\n\nEthereum Goerli upgraded to Dencun / EIP-4844 \ud83c\udf89 And historicalRoots accidentally dropped from the beacon state by Prysm & a resulting network split \ud83d\ude05 pic.twitter.com/5jHU6pq2vX \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) January 17, 2024\n\nThe beacon state\u2019s evolution, especially with the implementation of SSZ tree hashing, was meant to streamline state management, including the handling of the HistoricalSummary container. This container plays a crucial role for light clients and in creating Merkle proofs against past states.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844)\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, deeply intertwined with EIP-4844, represents a cornerstone in Ethereum\u2019s strategy for scaling and enhancing network efficiency. EIP-4844\u2019s introduction of blob-carrying transactions is a groundbreaking step towards reducing gas costs by facilitating temporary data storage in beacon nodes. This move is expected to significantly enhance transaction throughput and lower fees, providing immediate relief and setting a foundation for future scalability solutions.\n\nProto-danksharding, a term coined from the contributions of researchers Protolambda and Dankrad Feist, underpins this process. It represents a simplified yet potent version of danksharding, aiming to radically cut down gas fees and improve transactional efficiency. This development is a crucial part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, ensuring compatibility and future readiness with the network\u2019s long-term strategic vision.\n\nImplications And Future Steps\n\nThe Ethereum community and developers are now racing against time to resolve these unforeseen challenges.\n\nTsao stated:\n\nPrysm encountered a bug right at Goerli\u2019s hard fork. The bug has been identified, and a fix is currently being merged. A hot patch image will be released within the next few hours. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience!\n\nThe transition from Goerli to Sepolia, and eventually to the Holesky testnet, signifies a cautious but strategic approach in Ethereum\u2019s upgrade rollout.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well with the testnets, my own personal estimate for Dencun on mainnet is mid-late March,\u201d Sassal.eth, founder of The Daily Gwei, noted prior to the Dencun testnet upgrade. Following the faulty start, it is uncertain whether this schedule is still tenable.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,546.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Telegram bots welcome a flood of new users from the memecoin trading community on Solana.\n\nTrading volumes through Unibot are now heavily dominated by Solana.\n\nThe success of Unibot\u2019s migration has caught the attention of competitors in this sector.\n\nDaily users on Unibot, the mega-popular Telegram trading bot, hit an all-time high after its Solana integration this month.\n\nOn January 11, Unibot\u2019s daily users soared to a record. Days later, daily users jumped another 43%, reaching a new all-time high of 3,151 on January 15.\n\nTelegram bots are designed to simplify on-chain trading by letting users buy and sell tokens on decentralised exchanges \u2014 or DEXs \u2014 through the popular messaging app.\n\nThese features were trendy among meme coin traders on Ethereum last summer, as six of the top 10 trading pairs of all time were meme coins.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Solana launch has helped turn its fortunes around after falling use on Ethereum, where it was initially launched. Solana users now account for 90% of Unibot\u2019s users, and over 79% of the total volume.\n\nSince its Solana launch on January 4, Unibot earned $275,000 in fees to add to the $534,000 it earned in fees on Ethereum.\n\nThis is an over 50% increase in total fees generated that Unibot would not have had without integrating Solana.\n\nTotal volume generated by Unibot daily. (Dune: @Whale_Hunter)\n\nThe episode shows that Solana, which prides itself on low transaction fees and its dApps\u2019 slick interfaces, is winning over the DeFi degens who make up Unibot\u2019s user base.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nA second start with Solana\n\nUnibot\u2019s expansion to Solana comes as trading on the blockchain has boomed throughout December.\n\nDecentralised exchanges on Solana are now the third-most active among traders behind those built on Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nLast summer, Ethereum also saw a similar memecoin mania to the one that just occurred on Solana, driven mainly by the advent of Telegram trading bots like Unibot and Maestro.\n\nAt its peak in August, Unibot facilitated over $8 million in daily trading volume through its Telegram trading interface, generating over 11,400 Ether worth $29.5 million in lifetime fees.\n\nBut with a significant portion of memecoin trading activity exiting Ethereum to other chains \u2014 most notably Solana \u2014 in recent months, Unibot\u2019s revenue has also dropped.\n\nNow, in what was a bid to boost revenues, trading bots popular among traders are following them to Solana. And it appears to be working.\n\nCompetitors follow suit\n\nOne of Unibot\u2019s main competitors, Banana Gun Bot, has also made the move to Solana.\n\nBanana Gun Bot saw similar success following its launch on Solana. The total fees generated on January 16 were the most since December 6, and the fourth highest all time.\n\nIn just three days, it has generated over 270 SOL in fees, worth approximately $27,000 at current prices.\n\nDaily active users also saw a bump, on January 16th 1,727 new users and 4,543 total users interacted with the bot. This is just below the previous all time high of 4,730 total users set on November 29.\n\nUNIBOT token\n\nThe price of Unibot\u2019s eponymous token has gone up by 85% over the past month, trading around $94.\n\nRevenues generated by Unibot are shared with token holders who hold at least 10 UNIBOT. Holders have received over 4,496 ETH in total rewards, valued at over $11.3 million at current prices.\n\nUnibot's token price\n\nToken holders can earn even more rewards by distributing their unique referral code to other users. Referrers earn 25% of the total fees generated by anyone who uses their referral code.\n\nHolders can expect to receive a 9.43% APR for staking."

        "title": "Best 7 Ethereum Layer 2 Networks - Crypto News Australia",
        "content": "Ethereum is powering the future of decentralised finance (known as \u201cDeFi\u201d). The blockchain hosts thousands of applications and millions of active users as it drives a new era of financial authority. But as DeFi\u2019s leading blockchain, it must be well-equipped to scale as an influx of apps and users join the network.\n\nCurrently, there are limitations with the Ethereum protocol due to its (relatively) slow speeds and high transaction fees. These issues have led to the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) projects \u2013 designed to improve network performance and enable the continued expansion of the DeFi revolution.\n\nRelated: How to buy Ethereum in Australia\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2s?\n\nAn Ethereum Layer 2 project is a network that operates on top of the main Ethereum blockchain (known as a \u201cLayer 1\u201d). Layer 2 projects allow decentralised applications (dApps) to funnel transactions and other processes off the main blockchain \u2013 which can reduce congestion, increase finality speeds and cheapen gas fees. Layer 2 chains make use of Ethereum\u2019s privacy and decentralised infrastructure while reducing the burden on its main network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow We Ranked Ethereum Layer 2s\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to determine which Ethereum Layer 2s maintain the healthiest ecosystem. A strong userbase, constant dApp development and high transaction volumes tend to indicate the long-term security and viability of a L2 project.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL). This is the dollar-amount of cryptocurrency locked up in smart contracts on a blockchain. It encompasses staking services, DeFi savings account and so on.\n\nThis is the dollar-amount of cryptocurrency locked up in smart contracts on a blockchain. It encompasses staking services, DeFi savings account and so on. Monthly transactions. Monthly transactions can suggest a certain L2 is ideal for traders due to its low gas fees and fast settlement times. This metric can also point toward the popularity of decentralised applications on the network.\n\nMonthly transactions can suggest a certain L2 is ideal for traders due to its low gas fees and fast settlement times. This metric can also point toward the popularity of decentralised applications on the network. Ecosystem and dApps. A huge reason for DeFi\u2019s success is dApps \u2013 so the more popular platforms within an ecosystem, the more likely it will maintain a healthy userbase over time. Usually, high-profile decentralised exchanges (DEXs), NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols and games will contribute to a thriving ecosystem.\n\nCheckout out our guide on analysing cryptocurrencies for more details.\n\nBest Layer 2 Networks\n\nArbitrum\n\nArbitrum is an L2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network with a focus on helping developers create new Ethereum Virtal Machine (EVM) dApps in just minutes. Arbitrum can do everything Ethereum does \u2013 but faster and cheaper.\n\nArbitrum dominates the Ethereum L2 world, capturing nearly 50% of the market share. It has by far the highest total value locked (TVL) and monthly transaction data of any EVM scaling solution. It boasts hundreds of the DeFi ecosystem\u2019s most popular applications, including Uniswap, 1inch and Beefy Finance.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, allows holders to vote on proposals and participate in economic/development decisions of the L2.\n\nView live ARB price.\n\nOptimism\n\nOptimism is a community-focused Layer 2 framework that offers DeFi projects lightning-fast transaction speeds and lower costs to transmit data to and from the base Ether blockchain. Optimism is an optimistic rollup chain, which means a large batch of transactions are \u201crolled\u201d together and then processed on the Layer 1 network.\n\nOptimism is a clear number two when it comes to on-chain metrics, trailing only Arbitrum in Total Value Locked and market share. It is also home to the vast majority of popular Ethereum dApps, like Slingshot, Aave and Sushiswap. The network\u2019s native governance token is OP.\n\nView live OP price\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon (MATIC), originally intended as a competitor to Ethereum, is now a scaling solution that intends to connect multiple blockchains to the network in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The L2 uses what\u2019s known as \u201csidechains\u201d, a web of independent networks that help decongest the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe network constantly jostles with Optimism as the L2 with the second-most total value locked and on any given day can boast more than USD $300m in transaction volume.\n\nThe Polygon team has also developed a separate zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) network that has a greater focus on security and superior transaction speeds to its counterpart.\n\nBASE\n\nBASE is a relatively new L2 solution developed by global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Like most other L2s, BASE uses rollups to bundle transactions together to optimise using EVM dApps.\n\nBASE is built atop Optimism\u2019s open-source stack, meaning it shares the same excellent scalability, interoperability and ease of development. Additionally, BASE is designed to be the blockchain for Coinbase use cases \u2013 allowing it to leverage the hundreds of millions in assets currently held on the exchange.\n\nBASE supports all of the main EVM apps you would want \u2013 AAVE, UniSwap and Banxa, along with some more unique offerings such as Friend.tech. And despite the L2\u2019s relative infancy, it still boasts excellent on-chain metrics, coming in the top five for TVL, market share and monthly transactions.\n\nLoopring\n\nLoopring is an Ethereum Layer 2 project that provides low fees and high speeds for trading, lending and engaging in other financial activities using ETH. The protocol uses zero-knowledge Rollups, allowing for near-instant finality.\n\nLoopring\u2019s key mission is to combine the benefits of centralised exchanges (liquidity and efficiency) and decentralised exchanges (greater freedom, cheaper transactions, no third-party) on Ethereum. The team also plans to improve the L2s interoperability by building support for chains other than Ether, such as Qtum and Neo.\n\nGiven its unique vision, Loopring lacks the same mass of dApps that some of its competitors do, but still offers impressive financial services (lending/borrowing, earning, NFT management and a trustless wallet). It ranks in the top 15 for total value locked.\n\nThe LRC token is native to Loopring\u2019s L2 for Ethereum. View LRC price live.\n\nImmutableX\n\nImmutableX is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution with one industry in mind \u2013 blockchain gaming. The demand for GameFi has increased over the years, and ImmutableX is the first L2 for NFTs. Like most other popular L2s, ImmutableX is built with zkRollups which has vastly improved the gaming experience for both developers and players.\n\nImmutableX is home to several highly-touted NFT marketplaces and GameFi platforms, including Gods Unchained, Illuvium and Guild of Guardians. The constant addition of new games has led to ImmutableX surging up the on-chain rankings, now sitting comfortably in the top ten for monthly transactions and TVL.\n\nView live IMX price.\n\nMetis\n\nMetisDAO is an Ethereum L2 with the goal of solving what many have called impossible \u2013 the blockchain trilemma. The Metis team wants to create a solution for Ethereum that\u2019s scalable, decentralised and secure. The protocol uses Optimistic Rollups to bundle transactions for faster procession on Ethereum, leading to lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput. The developers are also working on an evolution of these Rollups to further improve efficiency and on-chain privacy.\n\nMetis has an excellent list of supported dApps, including heavy-hitters OKX, Stargate and Metamask. It has the third-most total value locked of any Layer 2 network, thanks to its popularity surging in 2023. It also sits around the top 20 for monthly transaction volume.\n\nMETIS is the native token of the MetisDAO L2 and can be used to participate in governance.\n\nWhy Do People Use Layer 2 Networks?\n\nThe main Ethereum 1.0 blockchain currently has a low transaction speed of around 7-15 transactions per second (TPS). Layer 2 solutions can theoretically handle much faster speeds of up to 9,000 tps by pushing most of the hard processing \u201coff-chain\u201d \u2013 either through the use of sidechains or Rollups. Additionally, using the main Ethereum L1 can be quite a costly experience, which may turn away many potential adopters.\n\nThere are an increasing amount of layer 2 projects and sidechains in circulation, each working to improve the user experience for swapping coins and tokens, minting NFTs, reducing transaction fees and increasing the speed of transactions. This also makes it much cheaper for developers to host and improve their applications on Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy Layer 2 network tokens\n\nMost of the layer 2 networks listed above have native tokens that you can purchase to get exposure to these projects.\n\nSome tokens like ARB, OP and IMX are ranked in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market, which shows the relevance of layer 2 networks in the market today. You can buy several layer 2 tokens on Australian crypto exchange, Swyftx.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer 2s are the next frontier of Ethereum-based decentralised finance. The success of these protocols will have a big say in the adoption of EVM dApps over the next decade. As these projects work together to bring the next evolution of DeFi to the sector, it will be enthralling to watch if Ethereum can truly revolutionise the world of finance as we know it."

        "title": "Can Ethereum (ETH) Price Reach $2,700 as a $1B Trading Strategy Unfolds - crypto.news",
        "content": "ETH price has outperformed BTC since the Spot ETF approval on Jan. 11, but on-chain data suggest the gap could further widen in the days ahead.\n\nEthereum price continues to consolidate its lead over Bitcoin this week closing above the $2,500 mark in each of the last 4 trading days from Jan. 15.\n\n2 vital trading indicators highlight how the ETH bulls could further assert dominance in the days ahead.\n\nInvestors have shifted ETH Worth $1 billion from exchange-hosted wallets into long-term storage\n\nAs Ethereum price raced up the charts last week, there was widespread speculation that investors could book profits at the milestone $2,500 territory. But interestingly, at the time of writing on Jan. 18, ETH price has closed each of the last 3 trading days above $2,500 suggesting that the bulls are, instead, holding out for more gains.\n\nLooking beyond the price charts, the recent shift in ETH exchange reserves better projects the bulls holding stance. Cryptoquant\u2019s exchange reserves data provides a real time snapshot of the total units of a cryptocurrency that is currently held in wallets hosted on exchanges and trading platforms.\n\nAs of Jan. 11, investors held a total of 14.8 million ETH coins in exchange-hosted wallets. Interestingly, the figure is now down to 14.7 million ETH as of Jan 18.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs depicted above, investors have now shifted 133,271 ETH coins from exchange wallets into long-term storage in the last 7 days. exchange-hosted wallets into long-term, dispelling concerns of potential widespread profit-taking at the $2,500 milestone.\n\nTypically, a drop in exchange reserves is often bullish for a cryptocurrency\u2019s short-term price action. It essentially means that investors are moving their coins from trading wallets into long-term storage.\n\nPreference for long-term storage during a price rally signals investor confidence and intent to hold out for more gains. With the exchange supply in decline over the past week, it\u2019s unsurprising that ETH price has consolidated above the $2,500 support since Jan 15.\n\nImportantly, the historical trends show that periods of rapid decline in ETH exchange reserves have often been followed by a price uptrend. If the pattern recurs, Ethereum holders can anticipate an upswing toward $2,600 in the days ahead.\n\nWhile exchange supply drops, ETH is attracting more demand\n\nSecondly, as Ethereum exchange supply declined over the past week, the total number of active ETH sell orders has now dropped far below market demand. This current Ethereum spot market dynamics is another vital on-chain indicator pointing towards ETH stretching its lead over BTC in the days ahead.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s aggregate exchange order books chart captures a cryptocurrency\u2019s total active buy/sell orders across multiple exchanges.\n\nCurrently, there are active purchase orders for 357,490 ETH listed across 20 crypto exchanges including Binance and Coinbase. Meanwhile, the bears have put sell orders for only 250,750 ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Aggregate exchange order books | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe chart above depicts that the market supply for Ethereum has fallen short of demand by 106,740 ETH. Intuitively, when the demand for an asset outpaces supply by such a large margin, it signals a dominant bullish sentiment within the ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the prolonged decline in ETH exchange reserves has now led to excess demand in the spot markets. These two vital short-term indicators could accelerate Ethereum price rally and further widen its lead over BTC.\n\nETH Price Forecast: $2,700 Could be the next target\n\nBased on the 2 critical on-chain data points analyzed above, Ethereum price looks set to remain in upward trajectory towards $2,700 in the short-term.\n\nBut for the bulls to validate this bullish forecast, they must first scale the $44,000 resistance level. IntoTheBlock In/Out of the money data, which groups current Ethereum holders by their historical entry prices. also affirms this forecast.\n\nIt shows that 1.78 million existing investors had acquired 1.84 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,612. If those holders look to sell as ETH approaches their break-even point, it could inadvertently trigger a reversal.\n\nBut if the bulls can smash through the sell-wall at $2,612, the $2,700 area could be the next target for Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the downside if things take a bearish turn, the bulls can rely on the historically significant buy wall at $2,400 for initial support.\n\nThe chart above shows that 853,920 addresses acquired 4.5 million ETH at the average price of $2,414. If those holders make frantic efforts to cover their positions, Ethereum price can stage an instant rebound from that territory."

        "content": "While the Bitcoin price has been consolidating largely post-ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) has been making strong upside moves, thereby closing the gap with BTC. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.44% up at a price of $2,564 with a market cap of $308 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Dominance\n\nAccording to insights provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s price dominance has experienced a notable surge against Bitcoin, marking a +22.4% increase over the past week. This period has witnessed the creation of 89.4K new Ethereum addresses per day, further underscoring the platform\u2019s growing traction. Notably, a staggering 96.3K wallets were created just yesterday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to these on-chain activities, Santiment\u2019s data reveals a significant trend in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, nearing its All-Time Low of 8.05%. This movement toward self-custody and staking implies a reduced risk of an imminent selloff, presenting a more favorable scenario compared to concerns arising from a rising supply on exchanges. These on-chain dynamics shed light on Ethereum\u2019s current market strength and its potential implications for future price movements.\n\nETH Price Action Going Ahead\n\nIn the recent trading session on Tuesday, Ethereum price initially experienced a slight pullback, testing the crucial $2,500 level. Notably, this level had previously served as significant resistance but now appears to be providing substantial support for the cryptocurrency. The price action suggests Ethereum\u2019s attempt to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nThe $2,700 level emerges as a key threshold, representing the upper boundary of the short-term trading range. Analysts consider this level crucial, and a breakthrough could set the stage for a potential market surge, with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) traders likely to join the rally. Beyond $2,700, the Ethereum price could further rally all the way to $3,400.\n\nConversely, a downside scenario could unfold if the second-largest crypto by market cap breaks below the hammer formed during the Monday session. In such a case, the cryptocurrency might see a downward movement toward the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), situated around the $2,300 level. Traders are closely monitoring these critical levels, anticipating potential shifts in Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "In the dynamic crypto landscape, Arbitrum has kept pace with Ethereum, executing 375.3 million transactions in 2023, solidifying its position in the Layer 2 network revolution.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details of CoinGecko\u2019s new 2023 cryptocurrency report in the article.\n\nCrypto Arbitrum challenges Ethereum mainnet with 375.3 million transactions\n\nAs anticipated, according to the new CoinGecko report, last year the Arbitrum crypto handled 375.3 million transactions, almost on par with the 383.1 million on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nMore generally, in 2023, Layer 2 networks have totaled over 1.31 billion transactions, of which precisely 375.3 million on Arbitrum, constituting 28.6% of L2 transactions on Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum has accounted for over a third (37.5%) of transactions on Ethereum Layer 2, excluding opBNB.\n\nThis system has also almost matched the number of transactions of the Ethereum mainnet, which recorded 383.1 million transactions in 2023.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, transactions on L2 grew by 93.8%, reaching 659.0 million compared to the previous quarter\u2019s 340.0 million.\n\nThe significant increase is mainly attributable to opBNB, with 304.8 million transactions (47.6%) in the fourth quarter, mainly due to an increase in registrations. In fact, in December alone, the network recorded several days with over 20 million transactions.\n\nIn addition to these remarkable achievements for Arbitrum, the CoinGecko report also provides valuable information on the 2023 performance of Bitcoin, Solana, NFT, and more.\n\nThe beginning of 2024 for Arbitrum: increase in DEX volume and historical TVL\n\nThe level 2 network, Arbitrum, built on the Ethereum blockchain, has started the new year with a strong performance. The platform has indeed shown significant increases both in trading volume and in the valuation of its native token, ARB.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from DeFiLlama, the volume of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Arbitrum has surpassed other blockchains, including names like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polygon, in the last week.\n\nSurprisingly, on January 5th, the DEX volume on Arbitrum briefly surpassed that of the Ethereum mainnet, reaching a remarkable milestone.\n\nThis success can be mainly attributed to the increase in cryptocurrency investors who take advantage of the network\u2019s affordable transaction fees.\n\nAccording to the data from L2Fees, Arbitrum is one of the cheapest networks for transactions, with an average fee of 0.26 dollars, unlike the Ethereum network with an average fee of over 5 dollars.\n\nThis could explain the significant increase in trading volume on Arbitrum DEXs.\n\nFurthermore, the on-chain data from L2Beat indicates that Arbitrum is among the top three layer 2 networks based on Ethereum, with an average of 12.85 daily transactions.\n\nThe increase in DEX volume and intensified network activities have generated a peak in the total value locked (TVL) within the blockchain.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the blockchain has recorded a net positive flow of over 250 million dollars. This has brought Arbitrum\u2019s TVL to an impressive all-time high of 2.64 billion dollars on January 12th.\n\nDespite its remarkable success, the ARB token of Arbitrum has suffered a significant impact due to the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Specifically, it has experienced a decrease of about 10% and is currently positioned at approximately $2.13.\n\nBrief focus on the price of Arbitrum and the upcoming airdrop\n\nCurrently, the price of Arbitrum (ARB) is around $2.08, with a trading volume of $576,853,819.67 in the last 24 hours. This represents a decrease of 3.32% in prices over the course of one day.\n\nHowever, during the same period, there has been an increase of 3.94%, particularly in the last seven days. The market capitalization of Arbitrum is $2,655,026,574, with a circulating supply of 1.3 billion ARB.\n\nWe see that Arbitrum is currently conducting an airdrop of its native token, ARB, targeting users who have previously used specific Ethereum-based applications.\n\nThe goal is to encourage users to explore the Arbitrum network and promote the adoption of the protocol.\n\nUsers interested in participating in the airdrop must meet certain criteria.\n\nAmong these, creating a bridge in Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, conducting transactions in different months, executing a series of transactions with various smart contracts, and making transactions with a cumulative value exceeding a certain threshold in dollars.\n\nDespite the recent decrease of 3.32% in prices, Arbitrum (ARB) has recorded a 3.90% increase in the last seven days, surpassing the global cryptocurrency market decline of -5.20%.\n\nHowever, it has shown a slight underperformance compared to similar cryptocurrencies in the Ethereum ecosystem, which have recorded an increase of 12.70%."

        "content": "The latest developer report from Electric Capital reveals a sobering decline in the active crypto development workforce, despite Ethereum\u2019s strong pull on new talent and the rise of multi-chain development.\n\nMost crypto developers who joined in 2022 did not stay beyond their first year, according to a new report.\n\nThe Electric Capital Developer Report for 2023 has cast new light on the sector\u2019s challenges, revealing a 25% decline in active developers over the last year, with a total of 22,266 as of the end of 2023, down from 29,606 in the same period of 2022. This drop underscores the industry\u2019s vulnerability to market swings and raises questions about the sustainability of its workforce.\n\nThe report also highlights a concerning trend in developer retention, particularly among newcomers. Most developers who joined in 2022 did not stay beyond their first year, resulting in a 53% drop in new entrants. Despite this, there was a silver lining: namely, a 32% increase in the number of established developers \u2014 those with over two years of experience in the field. This growth in seasoned professionals suggests a maturing market, where experience is increasingly valued and likely correlated with the complex development needs of advanced blockchain projects.\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s annual developer report is based on tracking of different ecosystems and code and candidate repositories.\n\nEthereum Is Still Number One\n\nDespite the industry-wide downturn, Ethereum has solidified its position as the epicentre for developer activity, attracting 17,146 new developers in 2023. This influx is 2.7 times the number recorded by the next largest ecosystem, underscoring Ethereum\u2019s strong appeal to developers. The platform has emerged as the starting point for 22% of all new developers entering the crypto domain.\n\nPolygon and Solana trail Ethereum, having onboarded a little over 6,300 and 4,600 new developers, respectively.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains\n\nremain dominant, with only 2 of the top 10 blockchains for new devs being non-EVM \u2014 Solana and Cosmos.\n\nOrdinals Give Bitcoin a Boost\n\nAmid the broader contraction, Bitcoin Ordinals have emerged as a niche yet noteworthy area of growth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While the overall developer count in Bitcoin represents only 2% of the global share, with 1,067 active open-source contributors, the Ordinals Inscriptions sector has attracted 36 developers. This figure, although modest, signals a specific, targeted interest within a development community that is otherwise experiencing a general decline.\n\nThis surge is particularly interesting due to some in the Bitcoin community urging for Ordinals to be discontinued because they have slowed down the network. Others, meanwhile, highlight that without Ordinals, the block rewards wouldn\u2019t suffice to keep incentivizing miners to validate transactions\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Fees Surge to Highest Level Since April 2021\n\nMulti-Chain Developers\n\nAnother noteworthy trend is the increasing number of developers who are not confined to working on a single chain. Approximately 35% of developers now engage with more than one blockchain, indicating a shift toward a more interconnected and versatile development environment.\n\nAmid the overall decline, several ecosystems have demonstrated exceptional growth. dYdX leads the pack with a 520% surge in full-time monthly active developers, while Coinbase\u2019s Base has registered a 420% increase. In terms of total monthly active developers, Base and Scroll saw their numbers swell by 489% and 345%, respectively."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin sparks debate on layer-2 classifications - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Buterin says that systems relying on external data availability are validiums rather than \"genuine\" rollups.\n\nShare this article\n\nA discussion over classifying layer-2 solutions (L2s) has erupted within the Ethereum community after remarks by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn response to a post on X by Daniel Wang, founder of Taiko, an Ethereum rollup solution, Buterin said that reliance on external chains makes a system no longer a rollup since assets can\u2019t unconditionally be withdrawn if operators collude against users.\n\nThis is correct. The core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you. Can't get that if DA is dependent on an external system. But being a validium is a correct choice for many apps, and\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin adds, though, that despite the classification, validiums remain suitable for many other applications. Buterin notes that systems relying on external data availability (or DA, as mentioned in the tweet), such as modular blockchain Celestia, are validiums rather than \u201cgenuine\u201d rollups.\n\nValidiums and rollups are scaling solutions for Ethereum that allow more transactions to be processed off-chain, reducing congestion and gas fees.\n\nRollups batch transactions off-chain while posting data to Ethereum for security, providing scaling through compression. Validiums also enable off-chain transactions but use zero-knowledge proofs for validity without publishing transactions on-chain.\n\nThe main difference between the two is data availability. In a rollup, the data is available on-chain, while in a validium, the data is stored off-chain and only a hash is stored on-chain.\n\nThis difference makes validiums more efficient and versatile than rollups but also introduces a data availability risk if the data availability providers collude, censor, or go offline. Validiums are administered by a collection of smart contracts deployed on Mainnet, including a verifier contract and a data availability committee.\n\nOn the other hand, rollups publish the full data of transactions on-chain, making them more reliable and secure but ostensibly less private than validiums.\n\nIn this case, Buterin is proposing critical changes to how layer-2 solutions are classified, introducing a new taxonomy of layer-2 solutions based on more neutral \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201clight\u201d labels for rollups and validiums, respectively, with the \u201cstrong\u201d label denoting \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions, and the \u201clight\u201d label representing \u201cscale-favoring\u201d L2s.\n\nThis logic is based on two distinct purposes that layer-2 solutions serve: scaling and modularity.\n\nIn terms of scaling, rollups offer compression from transaction batching, providing security inherited from layer 1. However, data storage and verification processes limit throughput. Validiums avoid this through zero-knowledge proofs that validate off-chain activity without exposing transaction details on-chain. This enables validiums to scale to higher volumes.\n\nRegarding modularity, solutions like Celestia adopt this approach: data availability is customizable based on specific needs, and validation layers are open to independent deployment. If a classification between \u201clight\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d L2s, as Buterin proposes, is implemented, it will affect how modular chains allow customization across data and validation components.\n\nThe key difference here is how rollups mandate data availability on Ethereum, maximizing security but reducing modular flexibility. On the other hand, validiums enable adaptable data and validation layers to optimize performance but also open up trust assumptions, potentially lowering transaction security.\n\nRyan Berckmans, an investor in decentralized payments protocol 3cities, countered Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposed taxonomy by asserting that validiums should still be considered layer 2 solutions. Berckmans claims the L2 sector has the flexibility to define terms in ways that maximize usefulness.\n\nTo support his position, Berckmans points to L2Beat, a data provider tracking the adoption of layer-2 protocols, which currently categorizes validiums under its umbrella of L2 coverage.\n\nHowever, L2Beat\u2019s explainer states that validiums and other models relying solely on validity proofs rather than direct data availability on Ethereum introduce additional trust assumptions and fall outside the scope of rollup-style L2 solutions. By avoiding base layer settlement, L2Beat argues that validiums fail to inherit the security guarantees that define conventional layer-2 implementations.\n\nThe arguments reveal inconsistencies that are still present across layer-2 implementations. Projects like L2Beat aim to bring clarity but need help with contradictions as pioneering teams innovate on scaling models that don\u2019t neatly fit the current definitions.\n\nBerckmans advocates for a functional taxonomy that includes advanced networks expanding Ethereum\u2019s throughput and capacity. In contrast, Buterin and L2Beat favor more strict security-oriented criteria that validium tradeoffs fail to satisfy at a conceptual level."

        "title": "The ETF showdown: Bitcoin\u2019s store of value vs Ethereum\u2019s technological utility - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Over the last few months, the crypto internet has been dominated by the Bitcoin ETF talk. And for a good reason. At a $835.7 billion market cap, the pioneering crypto makes up 49% of the total crypto market, consisting of tens of thousands of tokens.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s 15-year life cycle, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) represents a pivotal divergence, a milestone in legitimacy. Once derided as \u201cfraud\u201d akin to tulip mania, \u201crat poison,\u201d or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d, Bitcoin\u2019s entry into the ETF arena discards those perception rags and replaces it with a brand new coat.\n\nLong-Term Trickling from a Deep Pool\n\nHaving the blessing of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) means that institutions can start apportioning their capital into a high-yielding asset. Bitcoin fits the bill because, even more so than gold, its supply is affixed, and even though Bitcoin is digital, it is grounded in physicality via the proof-of-work mining network.\n\nAs of October 2023, US ETFs have $5.6 trillion worth of equities. Even in low single-digit percentages, capital trickling into Bitcoin is poised to create a rising tide, a feedback loop owing to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply. Without the hassle of custodianship, investors get exposure to this tide, represented as ETF shares that track Bitcoin\u2019s spot price.\n\nJust one such Bitcoin ETF applicant is BlackRock. The world\u2019s largest asset manager had already lined up capital to the tune of $2 billion, according to sources.\n\nFollowing the approvals on January 11th, an expected sell-pressure transpired in a classic \u201csell the news event,\u201d bringing the BTC price down -7.4% over the week. Yet, launching a new investment vehicle has been successful, tracking over $1.4 billion in AuM and $3.6 billion in volume in just two days.\n\nBut what of Bitcoin\u2019s long-following shadow, Ethereum? Having transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, the Ethereum project is perceived quite differently from Bitcoin. What are these differences and how would they reflect on their respective ETF investment vehicles?\n\nThe Store of Value: Bitcoin in the Spot ETF Market\n\nFor many years, it was not clear what Bitcoin would become. After all, Bitcoin underwent over 100 hard forks, splintering the original whitepaper vision of a \u201cpurely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d.\n\nFollowing the resolution of Bitcoin\u2019s contentious block size wars in 2017, the Small Blockers faction won. Instead of increasing block size outright, they opted for soft Bitcoin scaling via the SegWit upgrade. This veered Bitcoin\u2019s fate into a store-of-value asset instead of a low-friction P2P digital cash.\n\nHard limitations make it impossible to have it both ways. If the large block size faction had won, more computing power and bandwidth would have been required to run full mining nodes, leading to network centralization and potential transaction censorship.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller blocks retain decentralization but make it difficult to scale on-chain. As fewer transactions fit inside a block, higher network activity leads to higher transfer fees because waiting lines are formed. And if BTC transfer fees go up, Bitcoin\u2019s daily currency proposition is diminished.\n\nAt least, without using layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, harnessed by payment apps like Strike. Such payment systems can utilize Bitcoin as a vehicle to transfer cash and interface with the existing banking system.\n\nI use send globally via strike app to bank all the time. It is near instant cash deposit settlement. Our family in the Philippines are in awe of the power of#Bitcoin \u2014 General Plebian (@GenPlebian) December 23, 2023\n\nIn the end, Bitcoin cemented its position as true sovereign money, peer-to-peer but not inherently low friction. Rather, Bitcoin is the foundation for a financial edifice to be built upon. In the age of continuous fiat currency debasement via central banking, decentralized sovereignty overrides low friction, painting Bitcoin as a monetary escape hatch.\n\nFor people accustomed to fiat money erosion, this is a novel concept. Yet, Bitcoin ETF applicants are now incentivized to bring that concept in the public spotlight.\n\nThis competitive marketing push alone is poised to deepen the capital pool for Bitcoin exposure. And the deeper it gets, the higher the Bitcoin price will likely go, creating a feedback loop of more capital inflows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Technological Utility: Beyond Mere Investment\n\nWhile Bitcoin pioneered the concept of blockchain-based sovereign money, Ethereum is a work-in-progress infrastructure layer. One that onboards digital assets and supplants traditional financial services.\n\nThis purpose drove Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake transition, as such blockchain networks rely on economic stakes instead of energy-hungry computing power. However, having a negligent energy footprint (compared to Bitcoin) is only the scaling starting point.\n\nDaily operational financial infrastructure necessitates low friction (minimal fees) to be accessible and to truly take on TradFi. Ethereum is yet to achieve low friction, relying instead on many layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nThis became even clearer in the latest roadmap, emphasizing Ethereum interoperability and security against cyber attacks, instead of L1 scaling for low transaction fees.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThis approach poses two major problems:\n\nBy ditching proof-of-work, the Ethereum blockchain becomes reliant on large stakeholders and cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). This reduces Ethereum\u2019s perception as a decentralized network that could be a true TradFi substitute. In turn, Ethereum positioned itself among other PoS network alternatives, with similar centralization issues But those have been built from the ground up for L1 scaling, without the extra L2 scaling complexity for the end user to interface with.\n\nIn this cycle, this dynamic became more evident. Even though ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it lagged behind Bitcoin at +64% year-over-year performance. Ethereum lagged greatly behind its direct competitors Avalanche (AVAX) at +118% YoY, and Solana (SOL) at +321% YoY performance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s lackluster performance transpired despite having an even lower inflation rate than Bitcoin. This could indicate that Ethereum\u2019s perception is much more precarious than Bitcoin\u2019s, which has a more coherent and focused \u201csound money\u201d proposition.\n\nThat proposition is not duplicatable due to Bitcoin\u2019s mining network effect. For instance, if Bitcoin code were to be tweaked to become a PoS chain, per the preference of Greenpeace, it would simply be a dead code without the network onboarders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect stems from holding dApp domination among PoS chains. Yet, it is not clear if that domination will not shift to AVAX, SOL or another PoS network. Additionally, while it is clear that Bitcoin is viewed as a commodity by regulatory bodies, Ethereum is still in the fog of regulatory obfuscation.\n\nMarket and Regulatory Dynamics\n\nAs of date, SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t explicitly announced whether ETH is a security or a commodity. By the latest speculation, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart thinks that the SEC is leaning in the commodity designation by already approving Ethereum future ETFs in August.\n\nJames Seyffart at CryptoQuant webinar on January 4th:\n\n\u201cSo again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures.\u201d\n\nOther PoS chains like SOL, ADA and AVAX are in the same regulatory uncertainty boat. In last year\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC named them all as \u201ccrypto asset securities.\u201d If Seyffart is correct, and ETH becomes a commodity per the preference of CFTC, this could give Ethereum an edge over its competitors.\n\nPresently, spot-traded Ethereum ETFs are delayed until May 2024, from Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF to Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. Likewise, the SEC pushed back Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, 21Shares and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nGiven the limited market liquidity, compared to the Fed money supply extravaganza in 2021, Bitcoin is poised to be the greater beneficiary of the first move advantage than Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a reason why the SEC failed to approve a single spot-traded Bitcoin ETF since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2013. Not only was Bitcoin less mature, but the banking sector wouldn\u2019t give a leg up to its P2P competition.\n\nSince those days, Bitcoin has overcome its underground, tulip, money laundering detractors. The digital asset is now secured by the world\u2019s most powerful computing network, erecting an ecosystem of mining companies. This further bolstered investor confidence due to Bitcoin\u2019s conservative coding practices.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is perceived as a more patchworked crypto project yet to entrench itself as a DeFi vanguard to tackle TradFi. Burdened with technical and regulatory uncertainty, conservative Bitcoin is a far likelier candidate to receive sustained retail and institutional attention from the first ETF vehicle.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Macro investor Raoul Pal is predicting \"life-changing wealth creation\" in the crypto space over the next few years.\n\n\"This crypto opportunity is literally the perfect macro opportunity of a lifetime,\" he said Thursday. \"It's a very high probabilistic outcome that the next two years make life-changing money.\"\n\nYounger investors, particularly those burdened with student debt or unable to afford property, have a unique chance to improve their financial standing, he says.\n\nPal's advice:\n\nAvoiding FOMO (fear of missing out)\n\nSteering clear of leverage\n\nFocus on major assets like Bitcoin BTC/USD , Ethereum ETH/USD , and Solana SOL/USD\n\n, , and Be wary of exposing your portfolio to high-risk ventures.\n\nBitcoin ETFs \u2014 'A Pivotal Moment': Pal described the Bitcoin ETF launch as a pivotal moment, akin to a \"go rodeo\" scenario, characterized by chaos and humor, typical of the crypto world.\n\n\"It's a total shitshow, nobody knows what's going on. Everybody's laughing. Everybody's memeing the whole thing,\" he said in an interview with YouTuber Jamie Tree, capturing the essence of the crypto community's response to the event.\n\nThis launch, according to Pal, signified a major shift where traditional financial entities are stepping into a domain previously dominated by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nDespite the high trading volumes witnessed during the launch, Pal pointed out an unexpected market response.\n\nMany hedge funds had been buying into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC at a discount and hedging their bets, he says. But with the ETF's introduction, these dynamics shifted, leading to a sell-off in Bitcoin.\n\n\"So there's little selling of Bitcoin that was coming out of that. So there might have been $1 billion of selling that came out of that,\" Pal adds.\n\nDiscussing future inflows, Pal projects a bullish scenario for the Bitcoin ETF, estimating around 50 billion dollars in inflows for the year.\n\nRead Also: Binance's Market Share Among Crypto Exchanges Slides As OKX, ByBit Chip Away At Its Dominance\n\nEthereum ETFs: Regarding Ethereum ETFs, he gave a 70-75% chance of approval by August, citing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's likely strategy to integrate major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin into the traditional financial system.\n\nPal wasn't taken aback by Ethereum's surge following the Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nHe drew parallels with the late 1990s public market, where early-stage investors and ETF companies had been selling products in advance, leading to significant market churn upon actual launch.\n\n\"The new volumes come in, people taking stuff off. So there's lots of churn,\" he said, explaining the post-launch market dynamics.\n\nPal's \"Everything Code\" thesis, known for its accuracy in predicting market movements, was a significant topic of discussion.\n\n\"The everything code just says liquidity in, I buy it, you make money. That's it,\" Pal summarized.\n\nThis approach, focusing on liquidity as a primary driver of asset prices, has enabled him to anticipate trends and make successful investment decisions in the volatile crypto market.\n\nRead Next: Sam Bankman-Fried's Mom And Dad Want FTX Lawsuit Dropped, Deny Wrongdoing"

        "content": "The 2021 bull market produced a surge in new developers entering the crypto industry in 2022, but a majority of those newcomers did not outlast the bear market that followed.\n\nBlockchain developers active for fewer than 12 months fell by -53% year over year, according to Electric Capital\u2019s latest annual report published Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s the principal reason total developer numbers are down by a quarter in the same span, the report finds.\n\nBut there\u2019s also positive news for the industry\u2019s tech chops.\n\nAmong the 22,411 monthly active crypto developers, those with experience are sticking around in increasing numbers.\n\n\u201cEmerging\u201d and \u201cestablished\u201d developers, who have been working in crypto for more than one year, are up 15% since December 2022, continuing a steady uptrend.\n\nSource: Electric Capital\n\nMarket cap leader Bitcoin saw a roughly -19% year-over-year drop. It now has a bit more than 1,000 monthly active developers.\n\nThe 2023 Ordinals phenomenon, while a notable contribution to network fee revenue, is still relatively small in terms of bringing new coding talent to the chain.\n\nRead more: Satoshi-era Bitcoin code idea gets a boost from Taproot Wizards\n\nEthereum still leads in developer mindshare by a wide margin, with 2.7 times more dedicated new developers than runner-up Polygon.

US-based devs have been steadily declining, though the trend lessened in 2023. Still, the US is the only region whose share of developers has declined since 2018.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 237,000 followers on the social media platform X that Solana might soar more than 39% from its current value.\n\n\u201cI think SOL might be gearing up for a leg up to $140-plus. This downtrend has been tested too many times now for me to consider bearish and can\u2019t ignore the clear three-wave move down from the highs looking corrective. Looks like the past two-week range has been a base, send it.\u201d\n\nBluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset goes through a five-wave rise followed by an ABC corrective move before starting its next leg up.\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that Solana will ignite a new five-wave surge after completing an ABC correction.\n\nSolana is trading for $100.62 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) is set up for a breakout after a period of price consolidation around the $0.33 level.\n\n\u201cVery healthy consolidation range beneath prior ATH (all-time high) on WIF. You better believe once we get out of this range it\u2019s going to full send.\u201d\n\nWIF is trading for $0.42 at time of writing, up more than 59% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also believes that decentralized exchange (DEX) project Maverick Protocol (MAV) is undergoing a massive rally after breaking out of an ascending channel.\n\n\u201cNow that is a monster daily MAV breakout. We\u2019ve entered the parabola phase.\u201d\n\nMAV is trading for $0.67 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to remain stable within the $42,000 range on Thursday. Other top coins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor losses across the board. The ETHDYDX token emerged to be the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of over 6 percent. THORChain (RUNE) became the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of over 10 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.68 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour loss of 1.20 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $42,594.04, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.68 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 37.30 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $2,529.24, marking a 24-hour dip of 1.70 percent at the time of writing.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 8,664.62.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (January 18)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\ndYdX (ETHDYDX)\n\nPrice: $3.10\n\n24-hour gain: 6.47 percent\n\nFlare (FLR)\n\nPrice: $0.02187\n\n24-hour gain: 5.85 percent\n\nRender (RNDR)\n\nPrice: $4.22\n\n24-hour gain: 2.55 percent\n\nHelium (HNT)\n\nPrice: $7.65\n\n24-hour gain: 2.14 percent\n\nSei (SEI)\n\nPrice: $0.7965\n\n24-hour gain: 1.67 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (January 18)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nTHORChain (RUNE)\n\nPrice: $4.25\n\n24-hour loss: 10.56 percent\n\nBeam (BEAM)\n\nPrice: $0.02062\n\n24-hour loss: 9.76 percent\n\nBonk (BONK)\n\nPrice: $0.00001289\n\n24-hour loss: 8.69 percent\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nPrice: $3.13\n\n24-hour loss: 8.06 percent\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nPrice: $1.96\n\n24-hour loss: 7.69 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin consolidates at $42,000, marked by profit booking and increased investor interest following spot ETF approval. Bears are currently active at $43,500. BTC's resistance stands at $43,250, with support at $42,120. Simultaneously, Ethereum developers deploy the Dencun upgrade on the Goerli testnet, and Ethereum is trading at $2,500.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cWith BTC (-0.8%) consolidating in a tight range for a fifth day straight post the ETF development, altcoins have started to show weakness. With Ethereum (ETH, -1.8%) going up in the last few days, even ARB (-7.8%) and LDO (-8.9%) which were among the top gainers, have posted losses in the last 24 hours. On the regulatory front, Thailand is now getting its own version of Binance exchange as Binance and Gulf Innova joined hands to launch Binance Thailand, providing a more secured and regulated way of trading digital assets for the country. BNB (-2.3%) was unfazed by this move, however.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cThe US inflation data is falling back, and labour market indicators are in a position to enable the Fed to start slashing interest rates soon. This has been a cause of hope among market analysts who predict a favourable run for Crypto in the months following the rate cut, most likely in March. Liquidity issues in the market will also be reduced significantly due to this. Bitcoin\u2019s price has mostly remained flat since ETF approval with a further decline in the last 24 hours as the market continues to get accustomed to funds related to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is witnessing a significant selloff as miners released a substantial 10,600 BTC (over $455.8 million) in the last 24 hours. On-chain analytics from CryptoQuant indicates a 130.45% increase in the crypto exchange's net flow, indicating active selling by miners. However, the decline in exchangeable bitcoin reserves suggests lower selling pressure as investors move assets out of exchanges. Despite recent swings, Bitcoin, currently supported between $41,000 and $43,000, maintains positive momentum. Experts are predicting that Bitcoin will soon cross $45,000 as they anticipate a halving event in April 2024, lower block rewards and boosted by the SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The network's robustness is evident in a saturated mempool that reflects organic growth.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market is at $1,68 trillion with Bitcoin and Ether witnessing marginal fluctuation from the previous day. If Bitcoin closes above $43,000 this week, then we may witness a healthy surge in its price in the coming weeks. The Bitcoin ETF inflows are nearing the $1 billion mark, which according to the experts, qualifies for a successful listing. We can expect a less volatile Bitcoin after the listing of ETFs as it\u2019s a regulated financial product now.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cFrom a technical perspective, there's a notable bullish indicator with the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) crossing above the 200-week SMA, a first in recorded history. However, upon closer examination, the previous weekly close appears bearish, contributing to mixed signals. Crucially, the $40,000-$41,000 range serves as a significant support level for BTC. ETH, meanwhile, has maintained its position above $2,500. The focus now lies on targets at $2,660 (local resistance) and $2,940.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Fluctuations in market sentiment, often triggered by news events or regulatory developments, can play a role. According to an article by Economic Times, the price of Bitcoin dropped after the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started trading in the US. Some analysts believe that the recent hype surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may have cooled down, and that the market is now waiting to see whether it can sustain upward momentum."

        "content": "We\u2019ve analyzed multiple Ethereum mining apps for Android to help you understand why using them probably isn\u2019t the best idea and why any app claiming to offer \u201cEthereum mining\u201d is misleading.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to leave you empty handed, so we\u2019ll also be featuring 5 Ethereum apps for Android that will enable you to earn ETH passively through staking.\n\nAre Ethereum mining apps for Android legit?\n\nThe short answer is no. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is secured through staking, and not mining. This has been the case since September of 2022, when an upgrade called The Merge removed the network\u2019s old Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and introduced a new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEven if Ethereum still used mining, no mobile phone on the market today would be powerful enough to mine it profitably.\n\nTherefore, any app that claims to provide Ethereum mining services is misleading at best and an outright scam at worst.\n\nWe were able to find 5 apps on the Google Play store that claim to be providing Ethereum mining or Ethereum cloud mining services. While the majority of these apps have a solid rating of 4 stars or more on the surface, a closer look at the reviews makes it obvious that the majority of 5-star reviews are not genuine. Meanwhile, there are a lot of genuine reviews with a 1-star rating that suggest the apps are not actually mining Ethereum. In some cases, the apps are even trying to convince users to buy another product.\n\nFor example, there are a lot of complaints from users saying that the app requires them to purchase a particular cryptocurrency wallet app before they can withdraw the ETH rewards they have supposedly earned.\n\nIf someone is asking you to pay to use a cryptocurrency wallet, that is a major red flag \u2014 legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, even those offering the most advanced features, can be downloaded for free. In fact, we haven\u2019t been able to find a single legitimate cryptocurrency wallet that is not completely free to use (apart from the fees blockchain networks charge for transactions).\n\nBest Android apps for earning Ethereum rewards\n\nThe bottom line is that you should avoid all apps that claim to be offering Ethereum mining. However, there are apps that will allow you to earn ETH passively, by giving you access to Ethereum staking. Please keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to already own some ETH if you want to earn additional ETH through staking.\n\nBinance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\n- The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature Kraken - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\n- A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\n- Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\n- The best Ethereum wallet overall Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\n1. Binance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\nBinance is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that lists hundreds of different crypto assets and provides a diverse suite of services for crypto investors. This also includes Ethereum staking \u2014 if you have ETH, you can stake it on Binance to passively earn rewards.\n\nIf you stake ETH through Binance, you will receive WBETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH. The conversion rate between WBETH and ETH gradually increases in favor of WBETH through the time to reflect the rewards earned by the ETH Binance is staking on behalf of its users.\n\nIf you wish to get your ETH back, you can simply redeem your WBETH tokens and receive ETH in return. The amount of ETH you can earn this way is determined by the size of your stake (bigger is better) and the duration of your stake (longer is better).\n\nEarn ETH on Binance\n\n2. Kraken Pro - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating for more than a decade and has built a strong reputation for keeping its users\u2019 fund safe even though many other exchanges have lost their customers\u2019 fund to hacks.\n\nIf you have ETH, you can stake it via the Kraken Pro app to benefit from staking rewards. Unlike Binance, which uses a token to represent staked ETH, the process on Kraken is more straightforward as there is no such token involved. However, the downside of Kraken\u2019s approach is that users can\u2019t get any liquidity from their staked ETH unless they unstake their coins.\n\nEarn ETH on Kraken\n\n3. Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\nCoinbase is a reputable crypto exchange that\u2019s known as one of the best crypto platforms for beginners. Coinbase provides an Ethereum staking service which allows ETH holders to earn additional rewards on their coins passively.\n\nUsers on Coinbase have the option to wrap their staked ETH coins and receive cbETH tokens. These tokens can be redeemed (or \u201cunwrapped\u201d) for ETH, but can be useful to still access the liquidity associated with your staked ETH.\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-term ETH holder that wants to put your idle coins to work, staking through Coinbase is certainly an option worth considering.\n\nEarn ETH on Coinbase\n\n4. MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\nThe previous ETH staking options we\u2019ve covered in this article are all facilitated through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges which stake users\u2019 ETH on their behalf. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some options to stake Ethereum in a more decentralized manner using on-chain liquid staking protocols.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with MetaMask, an extremely popular Ethereum wallet that also offers an Android app version. MetaMask offers a convenient staking option within the MetaMask portfolio feature that allows users to easily stake their ETH through liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe added benefit of using MetaMask instead of a cryptocurrency exchange is that you remain in control of your private keys and don\u2019t have to trust anyone but yourself to keep them safe.\n\nGet MetaMask\n\n5. Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\nTrust Wallet is a very popular all-purpose crypto wallet that is available both as a browser extension or as a standalone desktop application.\n\nOne of Trust Wallet\u2019s biggest strengths is that it supports a truly impressive selection of cryptocurrencies, as it\u2019s not just limited to EVM-compatible blockchains. You can also use Trust Wallet to store Bitcoin, XRP, Solana and many other popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrust Wallet has a user-friendly interface designed to cater to both beginners and experienced users. Navigating the wallet is easy, allowing users to seamlessly view their portfolio value in their preferred currency, monitor their transaction history, and effectively manage multiple wallets.\n\nYou can use Trust Wallet to securely hold your ETH and use it in liquid staking protocols to earn staking rewards. Just like MetaMask, Trust Wallet is also a non-custodial wallet, which means that you control your own private keys.\n\nGet Trust Wallet\n\nThe bottom line\n\nHopefully, this article helped explain why there are no legitimate Ethereum mining apps available on the market. However, there are still ways to earn ETH using an Android app. For example, you can stake your ETH coins through a cryptocurrency exchange app or use an Ethereum wallet app to stake your coins via protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nIf you want to learn more on the topic of earning crypto with your phone, make sure to take a look at our list of the best crypto mining apps for Android."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nThe founder of the decentralised mining network and software development platform Ethereum Vitalik Buterin shared his insights about Ethereum layer 2 of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVitalik shared pivotal points regarding L2 networks which are considered as main scalability tool for the Ethereum Network.\n\nDebate About L2 Layer\n\nThe L2 layer on the Ethereum blockchain is a collective term for an Ethereum scaling solution that manages transactions off Ethereum layer 1 while still taking benefit of the robust decentralized security of Ethereum layer 1. Layer 2 is a different blockchain that extends Ethereum.\n\nL2 solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and pace without compromising on the security which is facilitated by the main chain layer1. This proves to be beneficial for the users as it helps users to understand the types of solutions available for their respective issues.\n\nVitalik engaged in a debate which was about \u201cL2s\u201d encompassing both rollups and validiums. The users need to understand the different security features where rollups are \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions that bundle or \u201croll up\u201d transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain. This methodology enables high security, as the L1 blockchain instantly secures them.\n\nComparatively, rollups are a bit expensive due to their ability to its data on-chain which provides higher security on the other hand Validiums provide an inexpensive alternate option to rollups. The founder of Ethereum Vitalik has suggested that terminology should reflect these distinctions without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he suggests terms like \u201cstrong L2\u201d for rollups and \u201clight L2\u201d for validiums to enable users to guide their choices better.\n\nVitalik also cleared that the whole process of L2 solution is not only about security as both rollups and Validiums have \u201cintermediate space\u201d."
