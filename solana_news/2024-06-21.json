        "title": "Ethereum wins a major battle, but its war with the SEC is far from over - Fortune",
        "content": "Consensys, the maker of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, announced this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission has backed off its unpopular campaign to investigate developers who use Ethereum. The move is in line with the growing legal consensus that Ethereum is a commodity, not a security, which puts it outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The announcement, however, also contained a dark lining that reveals SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crusade against Ethereum is far from over.\n\nYou may recall that things between Consensys and the SEC came to a head when the company took the bold step of suing in April, asking a federal judge to force the agency to back off. The lawsuit came as a preemptive strike after the SEC had telegraphed it was on the verge of filing charges against the company after a year-long campaign of issuing subpoenas to developers who use Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s legal position became tenuous after the agency, under growing political pressure, approved Ethereum ETFs\u2014an acknowledgement the currency is indeed a commodity. In response to an enquiry from Consensys, the SEC then informed the company it was \u201cclosing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\u201d The \u201c2.0\u201d phrase appears to be a reference to the blockchain\u2019s new proof-of-stake system that went into effect in 2022.\n\nAll of this came as good news to the market, and the price of Ethereum jumped around 3%. But one line in Consensys\u2019s announcement hinted that all was not quite as well as it seemed\u2014namely that its lawsuit with the SEC was ongoing. This seemed strange given that, if Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has no jurisdiction and there is nothing to hash out in court.\n\nI asked Consensys\u2019s lawyers what is going on and they told me the SEC is still going after MetaMask because it can be used to swap tokens on the DeFi market, and also because it offers access to staking\u2014a key element of Ethereum that pays users to help secure the network. Here is how the lawyers put it:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s theory is that, because the Swaps offering allows users to trade various tokens using DeFi platforms, it is a securities broker due to at least some of those tokens being securities. They also assert that providing a user interface to two liquid staking protocols is also brokerage activity, and that it also constitutes offering unregistered crypto asset securities. The closing of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation doesn\u2019t resolve those issues.\u201d\n\nThe SEC, in other words, is trying to argue that Consensys\u2014and by extension other firms\u2014is an unlicensed brokerage engaged in the securities trade. This is likely a losing argument too, but it\u2019s on brand for Gensler, who has treated the process of crypto regulation like a personal vendetta, to dig in to the bitter end. The upshot for the crypto industry is it has won another battle, but the war goes on.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating Jump\u2019s crypto trading activities. (Fortune)\n\nS&P wrote that Ethereum restaking, carried out by EigenLayer and others, could become akin to an \u201cinternet bond market.\u201d (Bloomberg)\n\nWorldcoin has resumed iris-scanning in Kenya after regulators dropped a year-long privacy probe that had halted operations. (TechCrunch)\n\nThe price of private shares of crypto firms like Kraken, Circle, Chainalysis, and Ripple have jumped this year amid rumors the bull market will lead to long-awaited IPOs.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is finally entering reversal mode, with the price of the first cryptocurrency sliding in above the $65,000 zone. However, it is still moving below key support levels like the 50 EMA and is currently consolidating at the 100 EMA. The most decisive factor for a recovery would be momentum that is not present at this exact moment.\n\nIt is critical that Bitcoin maintains above $65,000 for the near future. Strong support has been seen at this level, which might serve as the basis for a reversal. If Bitcoin is able to overcome the immediate resistance at the 50 EMA or roughly $67,000, traders are hopeful of a possible rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI which is centered on 47, shows that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, pointing to a period of consolidation prior to any notable movement. The macroeconomic environment as a whole is one factor influencing Bitcoin's current performance. Investor sentiment in a variety of markets, including cryptocurrency, has been influenced by worries about inflation and possible interest rate increases by central banks.\n\nBitcoin's long-term prospects are still promising despite these obstacles because of its growing institutional adoption and ability to act as an inflation hedge. Given its continued institutional interest and widespread adoption, Bitcoin's long-term prospects appear bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana's questionable position\n\nWhile Solana clearly gained some respectable strength back in May, the situation for the asset has changed, and it has been going down steadily for the past 20 days. The SOLETH chart, often used for gauging market volatility, is clearly exhausted and might provide us with some growth in the future.\n\nThe Solana vs. Ethereum chart, which contrasts the two most powerful altcoins available, is an important comparison. This comparison makes the relative strength and possible volatility of the altcoin market easier for traders and investors to understand.\n\nA positive outlook for altcoins overall is frequently indicated by Solana's strong performance versus Ethereum and vice versa. Because SOLETH captures the growth and performance dynamics of two significant cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin, it is regarded as a barometer for market volatility. In the domains of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana and Ethereum are renowned for their strong ecosystems and noteworthy use cases.\n\nSignificant movements in these two assets may point to more general trends on the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum frequently serves as a benchmark since it is the bigger and more well known of the two. Conversely, Solana stands for more recent quickly expanding blockchain initiatives. It is possible to infer market sentiment regarding innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency space from the interaction of these two assets on the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nCardano's unexpected bounce\n\nCardano somewhat bounced from a local support level at approximately $0.35, with the potential to fight with the 26 EMA for momentum in the next few days. This bounce is a small but crucial step toward breaking an aggravating downtrend that has plagued the cryptocurrency for months.\n\nHolding above $0.35 is critical for Cardano in the near term. This level has provided a lot of support and might provide the groundwork for a future upswing. Cardano may indicate the start of a recovery phase if it can muster enough momentum to test and possibly break above the 26 EMA.\n\nAn RSI of about 37 indicates that ADA is in oversold territory, which may draw in buyers searching for cheap points of entry. But Cardano has not exactly performed well over the long haul. Even with the community's strong support and the project's lofty objectives, ADA has had difficulty holding onto its value. Cardano has experienced a protracted decline and has not been able to return to its prior highs since hitting its all-time high in early 2022.\n\nNumerous reasons contribute to this subpar performance, including the general mood of competition from rival blockchain platforms and slower-than-anticipated development progress. Although anticipated by many investors, the Cardano ecosystem has not yet produced the ground-breaking applications.\n\nAlthough the deployment of smart contracts on the Cardano network was a big step forward, neither the number of dApps nor user adoption has increased significantly as a result of it. Some investors have become frustrated with ADA's slow development, which has made them doubt the company's long-term prospects."

In case Ethereum breaks down to around $3,400, Pizzino proposes that $3,200 might be a secure level to observe. In any case, on the off chance that it falls below $2,829, it might flag that the ETF news isn't as positive because it shows up. This level of strength shows a bullish structure for Ethereum, proposing potential for a slow recuperation over the coming months.\n\nSolana's Bullish Positioning\n\nSolana (SOL) is in a comparable position to Ethereum, remaining over the 50% mark of the whole bear market range.

This situation indicates a bullish structure, with Solana putting in higher lows and keeping up quality inside its cycle. Previous corrections in Solana extended from 37% to 52%, recommending that a redress down to 50% would be steady with past designs.\n\nSolana's capacity to remain over these key levels despite market instability highlights its potential for a major upward move.

        "title": "From Ethereum to Polkadot: The Journey of Gavin Wood - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Gavin Wood co-founded Ethereum and wrote its first implementation, pioneering smart contracts.\n\nWood founded Polkadot, enhancing blockchain interoperability, and later transitioned to Chief Architect for innovative focus.\n\nGavin Wood\u2019s journey into the world of blockchain began using LEGO bricks rather than a computer. Self-described as a \u201ctechnologist at heart,\u201d Wood\u2019s early interest with creating intricate constructions gradually moved from actual blocks to digital ones. This love of innovation and problem-solving made his later activities in the blockchain sector possible.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that Wood came into contact with. Thanks to the Silk Road online black market, his discovery was, in a sense, accidental.\n\nEnticed by the mathematical approach of human cooperation and interaction found in Bitcoin, Wood recognized the possibility of establishing whole new social systems. In little time at all, this interest became a professional possibility.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nWood had a meeting with Vitalik Buterin and other trailblazers engaged in the ambitious Ethereum project in 2014. Once Wood joined this team, he was instrumental in turning Ethereum from a white paper into a working blockchain.\n\nWith the creation of the initial Ethereum implementation, he introduced the world to smart contracts\u2014a ground-breaking idea that made decentralized, programmable transactions possible.\n\nWood wanted to create a platform that might propel social change as much as a new coin. Ethereum seemed to him like a means of creating a new planet that would propel human development for the remainder of the century.\n\nHis Ethereum work established the foundation for a significant force in the blockchain space that would upend established financial and economic institutions.\n\nMoving Beyond Ethereum: The Creation of Polkadot\n\nWood made major contributions to Ethereum and then focused on addressing some of the shortcomings he observed in the state of blockchain technology. As a result, Polkadot, a technology meant to facilitate smooth interoperability between several blockchains, was developed.\n\nThrough its special architecture, Polkadot addresses the scalability and governance problems that single-chain networks encounter by enabling several blockchains to run concurrently.\n\nood just presented a significant Polkadot update at the Token2049 conference: the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM). By enabling multi-core computing and improving network flexibility, this new protocol seeks to offer a more modular and minimalistic design.\n\nFrom Polkadot\u2019s current Relay Chain, the JAM protocol marks a dramatic change that will solve present constraints and advance the ecosystem toward its lofty objectives.\n\nWood resigned from Parity Technologies, the business that owns Polkadot, in October of 2022. He is still very much a part of Polkadot\u2019s technical and conceptual components as Chief Architect, even if he is no longer CEO. This change enables him to spend more time on the creative improvements and projects that still define his profession.\n\nThe Broader Impact of Gavin Wood\u2019s Work\n\nWood made more than just Ethereum and Polkadot contributions to the blockchain space. His concept to build decentralized platforms with blockchain technology has impacted a great deal of initiatives and businesses.\n\nThrough enabling interoperability between several blockchains, Polkadot has created new opportunities for both developers and companies, encouraging creativity and teamwork throughout the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a LEGO fanatic to a blockchain visionary, Gavin Wood\u2019s path demonstrates his unwavering quest of technical innovation. Beyond what blockchain technology can do, his work has encouraged a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to go outside the box.\n\nThe tale of Wood is proof of the ability of creativity and vision to propel technological advancement. Key elements in his success have been his commitment to finding solutions to difficult challenges and his ability to predict the promise of blockchain technology.\n\nWood\u2019s story emphasizes for would-be entrepreneurs and engineers the value of remaining inquisitive, accepting obstacles, and never stopping to get better.\n\nThe future of distributed technology seems bright as long as Gavin Wood keeps leading and innovating in the blockchain field. His efforts with Polkadot and the JAM protocol are expected to completely change the way blockchains communicate, strengthening and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt\u2019s been another uninspiring week for Bitcoin, with the top crypto asset chopping sideways to enter the weekend below $64,500, notching another 2.6% loss in the last seven days.\n\nIt's extra disappointing given how MicroStrategy bought another $786 million in BTC this week, which the company\u2019s founder says it never plans to sell. Still, MicroStrategy\u2019s demand was overpowered by an onslaught of sell pressure from other long-term Bitcoin whales, including the German government.\n\nCryptoQuant noted that the broader crypto market is starting to lose momentum due to a lack of new investor demand. It follows, thenn, that most momentum-based meme coins like PEPE, DOGE, SHIB, and WIF are all down 5%, 9%, 13%, and 25%, respectively, on the week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToncoin also lost some of its momentum from last week, dropping 10% after previously rising to all-time highs on hype from projects within its gaming ecosystem. It remains a top ten crypto by market cap, and is only $300 million away from overtaking Dogecoin.\n\nDefying the market\u2019s momentum to some degree is Ethereum. Its trading at $3,492 as of writing, hovering within a percent of its price seven days ago as Ethereum spot ETFs inch closer to reality. Multiple asset managers have now unveiled the fee on their ETFs, and Bitwise even published a commercial advertising ETH to old-school TV audiences.\n\nSolana\u2014Ethereum\u2019s top smart contract competitor\u2014was less fortunate, sliding another 6% this week to $134.92.\n\nOne of the network\u2019s high-flying Trump-based memecoins, DJT, amassed a $110 million market cap this week, and made headlines on rumors that it may have been launched by Trump\u2019s team itself. One of the ex-president\u2019s legal consultants later confirmed that the coin wasn\u2019t launched by Trump nor his offspring.\n\nEven crypto stocks couldn\u2019t retain momentum this week. Coinbase (COIN) fell 8%, MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell 1.96%, and DeFi Technologies (DEFTF)\u2014which soared after buying Bitcoin earlier this month\u2014has cratered 29.9% this week after crypto reports spread doubt about the company online.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll the negative momentum from altcoins this month has many analysts saying the crypto bull market may already be over. Still, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes doubled down on his bullish thesis this Thursday that now is the time to ape into shitcoins and \u201cbuy the fucking dip\u201d \u2013 before global money printers go brr.\n\nPrices as of 3am ET.

        "content": "The world\u2019s number one and two leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, daily transaction volume, and crypto exchange volume have almost perfectly tied for ROI from Jan. 1 through the middle of June.\n\nFor comparison, the S&P 500 Index notched up nearly 15% over that same period. But that\u2019s more than the broad stock market benchmark usually makes in an entire year.\n\nSo even during an unusually good two quarters for U.S. stocks, Bitcoin and Ethereum delivered investors four times more ROI. In other words, Bitcoin broke the government\u2019s investment planning tool. Again.\n\nThe average annualized ROI for Bitcoin and Ethereum price performance since Jan. 1 is aces. The top two cryptocurrencies are pacing for a +116% year.\n\nThat\u2019s a return so high that the compound interest calculator tool on Investor.gov does not even allow users to enter interest rates above 100%.\n\nBy the way\u2014 if you enter $100 a month into the calculator for 15 years at an estimated interest rate of 15% (above average for the S&P 500), with a daily compounding frequency, you end up with $68,815 in 15 years for capitalizing your country\u2019s economy with a total of $18,100 in contributions.\n\nIf you do the same exercise with Bitcoin or Ethereum profits, and just enter 99% for the interest rate \u2013 the result is a little different (more like a bajillion dollars).\n\nQuestion is which cryptocurrency will outdo the other in Q3, or will Bitcoin and Ethereum come remarkably close again to earning the same amount of profit for crypto investors in the next half of the year?\n\nHere are six salient factors that may be worth considering. Some are more bullish for BTC, some for ETH, and some are a wash between the two blockchain network giants.\n\n1. Fed Dollar Inflation (Advantage Bitcoin)\n\nThe center of gravity for the entire global financial system is the U.S. federal funds rate. It represents the cost for Federal Reserve banks to borrow cash from the ultimate lender in the economy.\n\nThe Fed interest rate calibrates the dollar interest rates for loan products all the way down the food chain to store credit cards and pay day lenders. When it goes up or down, so does the rest of the financial economy with it.\n\nBut when it goes up that\u2019s a big headwind that puts downward pressure on prices for stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, when it goes down, there\u2019s a big tailwind for investment products that tends to put upward pressure on their market prices.\n\nIt looks like there will be one interest rate cut for the U.S. dollar later this year. \u201cIf all of it happens to be as forecasted, I think one rate cut would be appropriate by year\u2019s end,\u201d said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker on Monday. After the Fed left rates unchanged last Wednesday for the seventh FOMC meeting in a row, Investopedia reported:\n\n\u201cA bevy of tamer-than-expected inflation numbers over the past week has supercharged expectations that a Federal Reserve rate cut is ahead, but Fed officials themselves are proceeding with caution.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a good level and with a strong labor market,\u201d said Fed Chair Jerome Powell. \u201cUltimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far, they haven\u2019t had to.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other central bank economies, like those in the United Kingdom and South Korea, are getting antsy to cut rates.\n\nNot if, but when the Fed eventually begins to trim rates back down again, it will be a tailwind for crypto, but especially for Bitcoin \u2013 because of its deflationary tokenomics, with a hard supply cap of only 21 million BTC tokens to ever be issued by the blockchain network.\n\n2. DeFi and DApps (Advantage Ethereum)\n\nBitcoin is like digital gold, but Ethereum is like the automotive economy that burgeoned in the 20th Century as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Bitcoin is scarcity in the digital world of cyber abundance.\n\nIt turns out that a world without scarcity is missing something useful. Meanwhile, Ethereum is a vehicle to bring different parts of the economy closer together so they can engage in smart financial markets.\n\nMetaMask, Oasis App, MakerDAO, and Uniswap usage statistics continue to wow in 2024. In February, MetaMask announced a 55% surge in users from 19 million to 30 million in a matter of four months.\n\nThe numbers are almost as high as the 2022 peak for MetaMask installations now. The company behind the Ethereum wallet says those 30 million users manage 100 million accounts with MetaMask.\n\nOasis App is a decentralized app (dApp) built on Ethereum. According to data hosted by BitDegree the app\u2019s balance was worth some $1,769,996,160 in market value Thursday and the dApp had executed 308,620 transactions in the last 30 days (a 100% increase over the prior month).\n\nEthereum MakerDAO is one of those beefy, serious DeFi dApps making the Ethereum vision happen. The decentralized app\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the stablecoin DAI, is a small economy unto itself, with a market capitalization this week exceeding $5.4 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Uniswap continues to impress. The leading decentralized exchange (DEX) for cryptocurrencies absolutely dominates other DEXs, ranking in fees almost as high as $100 million in total over the previous 30-day period.\n\nThe only Web3 apps to generate more fee revenue in the past month were: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, and Lido.\n\n3. Institutional Adoption (Advantage Bitcoin)\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted in March how the Bitcoin exchange traded fund was the fastest growing ETF in history.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink says the $IBIT Spot #Bitcoin #ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history\n\npic.twitter.com/NOsDlFgROi \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) March 27, 2024\n\nAgainst every other cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and Ethereum both have an advantage in regard to regulatory approval. But against each other, Bitcoin still has a clear advantage going into Q3 2024. Hundreds of millions of dollars flow into and out of the Washington-regulated Bitcoin ETFs daily.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump now has the confidence to promote cryptocurrency to voters on the campaign trail. Before the last presidential election in 2020, Trump said he was anti-Bitcoin and crypto.\n\nThat is a strong signal of institutional and mainstream crypto adoption for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump recently said he wants all Bitcoin to be mined in the United States and he thinks it can help win the AI arms race.\n\nMeanwhile, VanEck announced Thursday that it will be launching the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Australia.\n\n4. Prague Electra (Pectra) Update: (Advantage Ethereum)\n\nThe Dencun Update \u2013 the most recent major upgrade to Ethereum \u2013 was a massive boon to Ether\u2019s market value on crypto exchanges. Ether price went parabolic buying the news from Jan. 24 until the upgrade happened on Mar. 13.\n\nEthereum devs plan to ship the Pectra upgrade by early 2025, maybe in Q4 2024, so this will be a bullish tailwind supporting ETH price in the background for the medium term.\n\nPectra is short for the Prague-Electra update.\n\nThe Wall Street stock analysts over at TipRanks recently praised the Pectra upgrade in an article featured on Nasdaq for the update\u2019s enhanced rollups and new staking limit for ETH validators: 2,048 ETH.\n\n5. Meme Coins (Advantage Ethereum)\n\nEthereum is still dominating meme coins, but the emergence of fungible token issuance on Bitcoin through the UTXO function using a technique branded Runes and some big hits in Q2 \u2013 like Dog Go To The Moon (Runes) \u2013 shows Bitcoin is a relevant player in this niche as well.\n\nThrough the Bitcoin Ordinals technique, BTC-minted NFTs remain popular and transacted in volumes of five and ten million dollars daily in June, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe Ethereum meme coin economy, however, is a multi-billion dollar concern that continues to drive capital inflows to Web3 like the world\u2019s gone mad.\n\n6. Competitive Analysis (Advantage Bitcoin)\n\nThe competitive landscape is an important factor in the horse race between BTC and ETH. These are far from the only two cryptocurrencies in the world in 2024.\n\nEthereum grows faster because of motivation from its competition, but it has far more competitors than Bitcoin. Market share in a competitive landscape is a real issue for this currency. It\u2019s not just a technology, toy, or platform; it\u2019s a business.\n\nWhile BNB, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Aptos, and a hundred others compete with Ethereum for DeFi market share, there is only one Bitcoin with only 21 million BTC. The Web 2.0 dons, Messrs Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg, both know the Web3 competition for those oranges is about to get fierce."

        "title": "PEPE\u2019s correlation with Ethereum might play out THIS way for the memecoin - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Data revealed that the memecoin\u2019s strong ties to ETH could stall further growth\n\nHigh exchange outflows might help PEPE\n\nFrog-themed memecoin Pepe [PEPE] was one of the few top-50 cryptocurrencies to register gains in the last 24 hours. At press time, PEPE was trading at a value of $0.000011, following a 3.35% hike its its value on 21 June.\n\nHowever, AMBCrypto found that the uptrend might not last. One reason for the same may be the memecoin\u2019s correlation with Ethereum [ETH]. According to IntoTheBlock, PEPE\u2019s correlation with ETH was. 0.91 at press time.\n\nETH has strong links with PEPE\n\nThe aforementioned figure was far above the correlation it shares with Bitcoin [BTC], which stood at 0.60. Values of the correlation ranges from -1. to +1. When the reading is close to -1, it means that prices hardly move in the same direction.\n\nHowever, if the reading is close to +1, it means that prices head in the same direction most times. And that was the case with ETH and PEPE.\n\nBut unlike PEPE, ETH did not appreciate on the charts. Instead, it moved sideways, trading at $3,502 at press time.\n\nShould the price of the altcoin continue to consolidate or encounter a decline, PEPE\u2019s price could retrace too. Beyond that, only a few memecoins also jumped, meaning a lot of capital was not flowing into the category to kickstart a rally.\n\nOn the contrary, exchange flows seemed to suggest that ETH might not be able to halt the uptrend. At press time, PEPE\u2019s exchange inflows were 845,000.\n\nMemecoin is in a tight spot\n\nInflows measure the number of tokens being sent into exchanges. When this number is high, it means that selling pressure could be intense, and could probably lead to a price decline.\n\nOn the other hand, Santiment data revealed that the exchange outflows were much higher at 131.07 million. The rise in the outflows means that those accumulating the token are refraining from keeping them on exchanges.\n\nInstead, participants are keeping them in non-custodial wallets. Should this activity continue, PEPE might overlook its strong ties with ETH, and the price could appreciate on the charts.\n\nIf this is the case, the value of the token could hit $0.000013 in the short term. However, traders might not need to be cautious.\n\nThis, because of the holdings distribution data. Consider this \u2013 Addresses by holdings revealed the 30-day change of the number of participants buying more of a token at a certain threshold.\n\nIn most cases, the retail cohort rarely impact prices like large investors. At press time, the number of addresses holding $1,000 to $10 million worth of the token had fallen.\n\nConsidering the most recent sell-offs across the market, PEPE might now struggle to keep up with its former bullish momentum.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s PEPE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nIf this happens, the prediction to $0.000013 mentioned above could be invalidated. Therefore, PEPE\u2019s price could move at the same pace as ETH, and its price might remain around the $0.000011 zone."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered is creating a Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk in London, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThis will make it one of the first global banks to enter spot crypto trading, in the wake of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs being approved in the U.S.. Standard Chartered\u2019s new crypto desk will begin trading soon, two people told the outlet, and will be part of the Forex trading unit.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, in line with our strategy to support clients across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,\u201d Standard Chartered told Decrypt, echoing the statement it made to Bloomberg.\n\nBut Standard Chartered declined to respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bank part-owns institutional crypto custodian Zodia Custody and has backed institutional digital asset trading firm Zodia Markets. Now setting up its own spot crypto trading desk shows clear intention to move deeper into the world of digital assets, after dipping its toes through investment.\n\nOther banks have traded crypto before, but due to regulation they have had to trade in derivatives rather than the actual asset itself. For example, Goldman Sachs began trading Bitcoin futures in 2020, then opened its Bitcoin derivative trading desk in 2021.\n\nThe Basel Committee, an organization that sets global standards for banks, recommended in a 2022 report that banks should apply a 1,250% risk weighting when trading crypto assets. This term refers to the amount of capital a bank should have in reserve to counter the risk of the investment. Industry experts have noted that this incredibly high weighting makes it hard for banks to turn a profit on crypto trading.\n\nStandard Chartered has been bullish on crypto recently. In May, it predicted Bitcoin and Ethereum to hit all-time highs after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the U.S.. Soon, the bank predicted that Solana and XRP ETFs would be next to be approved in the States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlbeit this is likely a 2025 story not a 2024 one,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, said.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "S&P Global Ratings recently published a report stating that the Ethereum restaking services offering an additional yield are gaining prominence and could lead to a solid \u201cinternet bond\u201d market in the long term.\n\nSimilar to the bond market, holders of Ethereum earn additional yield by either pledging or staking their ETH coins to help with transaction verification on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to lending out securities in fixed-income markets, ETH restaking reinvest the staking rewards and provide compounding returns to investors. Ethereum restaking platforms like EigenLayer have been much in the limelight recently. Amid this popularity, EigenLayer went live on the crypto exchange Coinbase recently.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum Restaking\n\nIn a report published on Wednesday, Andrew O\u2019Neill, S&P Global\u2019s digital assets analytical lead, highlighted the importance of restaking in order to enhance economic growth within the crypto market.\n\nO\u2019Neill also stated that restaking allows Ethereum node operators to validate new services by using established tokens thereby eliminating the need for these services to create their own validator with their own, illiquid, and volatile tokens.\n\nAs of now, there are only a few active restaking services popular as \u201cactively validated services\u201d. The report by S&P Global also notes that the total value of ETH restaked in the EigenLayer has surpassed 5.3 million Ether, valued at a staggering $19 million. Earlier this week, EigenLayer opened the Phase 2 claims for the EIGEN airdrop.\n\nRisks Associated with Restaking\n\nThe risks associated with restaking are primarily operational and specific to each actively validated service (AVS), though financial risks could emerge due to market speculation.\n\n\u201cWe do not currently foresee significant ecosystem-level financial risk as staking and restaking are generally non-custodial and there is no rehypothecation of the collateral,\u201d O\u2019Neill writes. \u201cThe impact of restaking on system-level leverage must be monitored, particularly through borrowing and leverage metrics on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols\u201d.\n\nEver since the EigenLayer launch in April, the protocol has gained strong traction within no time. This could inspire more players in the market to bring restaking services.\n\nHowever, the bigger question is whether the US SEc would allow more restaking protocols in the market. Another doubt is whether the SEC will allow restaking protocols to mature into \u201cinternet bond\u201d market without proper regulations.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

Still, 2024 is widely anticipated to be a very bullish year for the market, even more so than it has already been. However, things have slowed down recently, and markets have tumbled.\n\nSo, what about ETC? What\u2019s its fate for the rest of the year?\n\nSince late May and into June, the trend has appeared generally bearish as ETC\u2019s price made lower highs and lower lows \u2013 A classic indication of a downtrend. This recent decline in price can be coupled with diminishing trading volume \u2013 A sign of a reduction in investor interest and market fatigue.\n\nTypically, low volume during a downtrend might suggest a lack of conviction in the sell-offs, but it could also mean that fewer buyers are present to push the price back up.\n\nA hike of +5.56% means heightened trading activity in ETC derivatives, which can be speculative buying or selling. In fact, the notable spike seemed to align with a peak in ETC\u2019s price line, possibly pointing to a speculative rush that was not sustained and led to price retraction.\n\nDeath Cross signals prolonged downtrend\n\nThe 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish \u2018death cross.\u2019 This pattern typically is a sign of a long-term downtrend.\n\nThe price peaked at around $35 in March, followed by a sharp decline. After that, it consolidated around the $30-mark before breaking below the 200-day moving average.\n\nPrevious support levels can be observed around the $25-level, which have now been breached and may act as resistances if a price recovery attempt occurs. The next key support is likely around the $20-level, which could be tested if the prevailing bearish trend continues.\n\nIn conclusion, the hike in selling volume plus the breach of prior support levels tells us that the bears are here to stay."

        "title": "3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent commentary shared on X, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which ranks as the world\u2019s largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds, detailed why investors should consider diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Ethereum (ETH), alongside maintaining a position in Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan offered three compelling reasons for investors to embrace ETH, while also presenting a critical viewpoint for remaining invested solely in BTC.\n\nEthereum Vs. Bitcoin: 3 Reasons Pro-Ethereum\n\nHougan began by emphasizing the importance of diversification within crypto investments. Drawing an analogy to the early days of the internet, he pointed out how difficult it is to predict which technologies or companies will dominate over the long term. \u201cIt is very hard to predict the future with precision,\u201d Hougan remarked, referring to investors who bet on early internet companies like AOL and Pets.com, which failed to maintain their initial promise despite the internet\u2019s overall growth.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase? 3 months ago\n\nApplying this lesson to crypto, Hougan advised a diversified approach to hedge against similar uncertainties. Ethereum\u2019s current market capitalization stands at approximately $420 billion, which is substantial but still only about one-third that of Bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap. Given these figures, Hougan proposed a default starting allocation of 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum for investors seeking broad market exposure.\n\nHougan\u2019s second point delved into the functional differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He described Bitcoin as primarily \u201ca new form of money,\u201d highlighting its design choices aimed at enhancing its utility as a robust monetary system. \u201cEvery design choice the Bitcoin ecosystem makes is designed to make Bitcoin the best form of money that has ever existed,\u201d he stated, underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s targeted development toward optimizing its use as a currency.\n\nConversely, Ethereum is characterized by its role as a foundational technology for building new applications that leverage its capability for programmable money. This includes everything from issuing stablecoins to enabling complex decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s primary function is making money programmable,\u201d Hougan explained. He argued that the ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem provides a broader exposure to the potential applications of blockchain technology, which is still in its nascent stages.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe third argument for Ethereum centered on historical performance data. Hougan pointed out that historically, portfolios that included Ethereum along with Bitcoin showed better performance metrics, both in absolute terms and when adjusted for risk, across full crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing about that table is that the +ETH portfolio has both higher returns and a lower maximum drawdown,\u201d he highlighted. This historical analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer better downside protection and higher potential returns, though Hougan cautioned that \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future returns\u201d and noted that in shorter, recent periods, a Bitcoin-only strategy would have outperformed.\n\nCounterpoint: Why a Bitcoin-Only Strategy May Be Preferable\n\nAddressing the other side of the coin, Hougan discussed why many investors might prefer a Bitcoin-only strategy. This perspective is especially relevant for those concerned with macroeconomic issues like the degradation of fiat currencies and inflation.\n\nHougan posited that Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position and its community\u2019s focus on becoming a new form of money make it likely to continue leading this space. \u201cIt has a large lead, and size matters in money,\u201d he stated, supporting the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s simplicity and focused use-case as digital gold could be more appealing for certain strategic investments.\n\n\u201cMoney is a massive market. There\u2019s plenty of space for BTC to run if it succeeds. [\u2026] My view, in a word: If you want to make a broad bet on crypto and public blockchains, you should own multiple crypto assets. If you want to make a specific bet on a new form of digital money, buy Bitcoin,\u201d Hougan concluded.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,514.06.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ethereum or Silver? We asked ChatGPT-4o which asset is a better investment for 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated notable resilience, maintaining its value above $3,400. At the same time, silver (XAG/USD) is holding firm at a key support level of $29.00, rebounding as US bond yields come under pressure.\n\nThe evolving economic environment has led investors to reevaluate their strategies, comparing the benefits of Ethereum as a leading digital asset with the crucial role of silver in emerging technologies and its responsiveness to industrial demand fluctuations.\n\nEthereum: The innovator\u2019s choice vs. Silver: The steady performer\n\nEthereum\u2019s potential for aggressive growth and high volatility makes it an appealing speculative investment. Its foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and smart contract functionality offers significant upside potential.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s continuous technological advancements, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and growing institutional interest, add to its attractiveness as a high-reward investment. Standard Chartered, an international banking giant, recently announced plans to open a trading desk for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, enhancing Ethereum\u2019s market presence.\n\nEthereum\u2019s flexibility and innovation within blockchain technology provide a hedge against traditional financial market instability and inflation, positioning it as a forward-looking investment choice.\n\nSilver, on the other hand, provides stability and growth potential tied to emerging technologies and global sustainability trends. Unlike Ethereum, silver is less volatile and benefits from its dual role as both an investment and an industrial commodity.\n\nIts sensitivity to industrial demand cycles and use in high-tech solutions position it for steady appreciation. Silver\u2019s traditional role as a hedge against inflation and economic downturns makes it a reliable choice for more conservative investors.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s analysis: Ethereum vs. Silver investment prospects\n\nAccording to ChatGPT-4o, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance.\n\nInvestors looking at Ethereum should be comfortable with higher risks and the potential for high rewards. This includes tech enthusiasts captivated by blockchain innovations, long-term believers in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, and institutional investors seeking advanced digital assets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent resilience, growing user engagement, and potential ETF approvals make it a compelling choice for those aiming for significant growth.\n\nChatGPT Ethereum investment prospects. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT\n\nOn the other hand, silver suits conservative investors who prioritize stability and steady growth. Silver\u2019s extensive use in electronics, solar panels, and medical devices ensures ongoing demand, making it a reliable industrial commodity.\n\nAdditionally, silver serves as a traditional hedge against inflation and economic downturns, appealing to those who prefer tangible, physical assets. Its role as both an investment and an industrial commodity makes silver a sound choice for those seeking a balanced and secure addition to their portfolios.\n\nChatGPT Silver investment prospects. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT\n\nUltimately, diversification with both Ethereum and silver can be a way to manage risk and potentially benefit from the growth of both major assets. The choice between Ethereum and silver should align with individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and interest in the technological aspects of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum and Silver recent price performance\n\nEthereum and Silver 6 months performance. Source: TradingView\n\n\n\nAs of 2024, six months performance for Ethereum and silver presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Ethereum has seen a significant rise, with an increase of 39% in six months, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature with its current price at $3,505.\n\nIn comparison, silver has gained 30% in six months, with its current price at about $29.5 per ounce.\n\nIn conclusion, both Ethereum and silver offer unique investment opportunities suited to different risk profiles and market perspectives.\n\nEthereum\u2019s innovative edge and high-growth potential make it an attractive option for those willing to embrace volatility and technological advancements. In contrast, silver\u2019s stability and industrial applications provide a safer, more conservative investment route.\n\nDiversifying with both assets could offer a balanced approach, allowing investors to capitalize on the strengths of each while mitigating overall risk.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Chairman, Jay Clayton revealed in a Monday interview with CNBC that there is now an increased chance of seeing a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) go live for U.S investors soon.\n\nClayton made the revelation while answering questions regarding how far crypto market participants seeking the listing of a Bitcoin ETF have satisfied concerns expressed by the SEC regarding such a product.\n\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s work left to be done,\u201d said Clayton who had in the past mentioned perceived market price manipulation on unregulated exchanges and unreliable custody as the primary reasons why the SEC hasn\u2019t blessed any of the Bitcoin ETF proposals it has received so far.\n\nOnce again, the SEC Chairman highlighted those concerns as tough questions, before saying,\n\n\u201cNow, progress is being made, but people needed to answer those hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate type of product.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the latest comments made by the SEC Chairman raises hopes that there is yet a possibility of seeing the first Bitcoin ETF launch later this year or at least sooner than many had envisaged.\n\nAs Coinfomania reported last month, the SEC must now rule on whether or not to approve proposed rule changes to list Bitcoin ETFs submitted by Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX. These filings were published in the federal register in February kickstarting a 240-day waiting period for a final decision by the SEC.\n\nHowever, the regulator has delayed deciding on three occasions and must now rule on October 13, 2019, whether or not to approve the Bitwise ETF application, and make a similar decision regarding the VanEck/SolidX on October 18, 2019.\n\nIt is also vital to note that there is a possibility that the SEC decides against approving the current proposals [with only roughly a month remaining] since Clayton also mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s work left to be done.\u201d"
