        "title": "It\u2019s been a year since Ethereum completed its switch to proof of stake. Vitalik Buterin on what\u2019s new, what\u2019s next, and how he\u2019s using AI - Fortune",
        "content": "In an exclusive interview with Fortune, Vitalik Buterin, the brains behind Ethereum, shares his thoughts on everything from blockchain technology to AI to the people who most inspire him.\n\nHe also discusses what\u2019s happened since Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work to proof of stake and how spending time in Antarctica could help prepare humans\u2014maybe even him?\u2014for interplanetary travel.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nWhat use cases for blockchain excite you the most?\n\nThere are a few different categories of blockchain applications that I think can be valuable, and I wrote about some of these in a blog post last year, but a summary would be: One, currency applications are valuable, especially in the developing world. And two, identity, reputation, and decentralized social applications are exciting due to their potential network effects and enhanced security.\n\nGoing into the specifics of one application, I\u2019ve been using Farcaster a lot recently. There\u2019s a lot of interest in creating alternative stuff to Twitter now\u2014lots of people are either unhappy with various things that Elon does or people just realize that this is a monopoly and we need alternatives.\n\nSome of these have been on-chain. For example, my Farcaster account is connected to an Ethereum address, and if I lose my Farcaster key, I can use my Ethereum address to recover it. This is actually more secure than what centralized social media do, where they rely on phone numbers that can be hacked.\n\nOne of the big challenges in social media is how you tell who is a human and who is a bot. There\u2019s just lots of incentives for malicious actors to just create 50,000 bots. The nice thing about Ethereum is that it already has this lively on-chain ecosystem where there are different ways of doing that.\n\nOne is you can verify just the existence of activity on an Ethereum account. To have activity, you need to pay transaction fees, so there\u2019s a cost. You can make a few hundred fake accounts if you can pay a cost, but you can\u2019t make a million of them.\n\nSecond, you can look at POAPs [proof-of-attendance protocols] that verify that you participated in various in-person or online events.\n\nThird, there are proof-of-personhood protocols, and there is proof of humanity like Worldcoin. There\u2019s a Gitcoin passport that aggregates a lot of those. The ideal goal here is to do this in a way that lets people prove that they are people and not bots, but is also compatible with the goal of preserving people\u2019s privacy.\n\nLast year, you experienced the milestone of transitioning Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. What are you focused on now, and then what\u2019s next?\n\nAccount abstraction is definitely a big and important one. Another thing is obviously scalability. We have EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which is coming out very soon, which basically adds more data space on the blockchain\u2014not transactions, but just blobs of data. The purpose of this is to enable greater scalability, specifically for layer-2 projects, our rollups.\n\nThen after EIP-4844 there is a longer-term road map of increasing that amount of space over time and then ongoing improvements to proof of stake in identifying ways that we can improve decentralization even further.\n\nWe talked a year ago about AI, the intersection of AI and blockchain, before the release of ChatGPT and all the hype around that. What are your current views on the AI industry?\n\nAI is obviously super important. It\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s hard to think about because it\u2019s so hard to predict where it might go in the future. It\u2019s massive gains in productivity, but also massive philosophical consequences just in terms of what the role of humans in this new world is going to be. The world that is controlled by AI has completely different goals from us in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect at first\u2014that could also lead to very bad things happening.\n\nIn terms of the intersection between AI and crypto, this is one of those things where people have tried really hard to find an answer. Unfortunately, part of the answer is just that the intersection is less than it seems. There are a few things like ZK ML [zero-knowledge machine learning], but it\u2019s realistically a pretty small area.\n\nThere is the fact that AI\u2019s rapid growth makes it much more important to solve certain problems, like proof of personhood, for example. Then there\u2019s obviously the possibility of just crypto tokens being used by AIs. There is the possibility of crypto-based DAOs governing AIs and the process of training AIs.\n\nHave you read any books in the last year that have inspired you?\n\nIn the last year, I have definitely done less books and more reading blogs and things on the internet, things like podcasts and even science fiction. Maybe 10 years ago I read a lot of Austrian economics literature and things like Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, but also things like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a novel by Robert A. Heinlein about a society that creates a civilization on the moon and tries to gain independence.\n\nMuch more recently, I watched some of The Three-Body Problem\u2014I read part of the novel and I also watched part of the TV series, and I was fascinated by that because it presents its world view in a way that is totally different from things that we\u2019re used to. There are aspects to the world view that I disagree with. There\u2019s always this mentality that the world is super dangerous and basically the five big countries have to get together and figure things out, and no one else gets a seat at the table.\n\nThat\u2019s not the kind of world that I want, and not the kind of mentality that I want to see get bigger. But there is this aspect of appreciating the vastness of the universe and how lucky humanity is to have been born\u2014and how significant and how small we are at the same time.\n\nAre there people you admire, who inspire you?\n\nA lot of people. Akira Fuyuno has a blog called Samurai Novelist. It\u2019s not a book, but his posts are so long, they\u2019re basically like the equivalent of reading 10 books. He just does a very good job of making really important philosophical concepts understandable and talking about just all kinds of things in science and politics in deep ways. Other people have told me that my writing style is inspired by his.\n\nI kind of have to say Volodymyr Zelensky. I appreciate his soft-power leadership and his ability to be a figure who rallies and inspires people in that way\u2014like, not just giving out the orders, but just being the face and rallying people behind the cause.\n\nThen there are Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander\u2014the two of them are kind of similar characters in a lot of ways. Also, within the Ethereum community, Justin Drake, Dankrad Feist, and Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation\u2019s executive director, who\u2019s really pushed the philosophy of subtraction\u2014different people who have stepped up and made a piece of Ethereum their own and put their souls into making that piece as great as possible.\n\nYou\u2019ve also mentioned Steve Wozniak. Can you tell us more about meeting him? And maybe a few other people who\u2019ve impressed you?\n\nSteve Wozniak, he was just a genuinely fascinating guy who had really interesting hobbies and a lot of cool things that he was able to tell me about.\n\nFrom the government, Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s digital minister, she had all kinds of interesting ideas of her own. She has her own history of being involved in Taiwan\u2019s democracy movement and then g0v [gov zero], which is trying to create a more democratic e-government infrastructure in Taiwan.\n\nThe likely new prime minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spaji\u0107, a.k.a. Mickey, I\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m also impressed by him. From what I can tell, it\u2019s his dedication to making the country better and also just being a curious person who was willing to talk to me and willing to learn things about crypto.\n\nDo you use ChatGPT or any other AI tools?\n\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT. I\u2019ve also used the Stability AI chat. I use that for a few things. One is asking specific questions that I want answers for; another one is for writing code. I find that the thing that ChatGPT is best at is writing code that uses APIs or libraries or tools that you did not really know about. It even sometimes can take natural language tasks and convert them.\n\nAlso, for a translation, ChatGPT often does better than even Google Translate for helping to learn languages. If I want to understand the grammar behind a particular sentence, it does a really good job of doing that. The things that it\u2019s less good at are basically things where there aren\u2019t many millions of examples to learn from.\n\nI use either Stable Diffusion or the various other AI drawing things to draw images. I use those images and things in, like, my posts and my slides quite a bit. That has been it so far, but I\u2019m sure as AI gets better, I\u2019ll use it in other places as well.\n\nIt definitely does increase my productivity by quite a bit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest dream?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. I feel like I\u2019m not the sort of person to have one dream. I\u2019m the sort of person to have a lot of dreams. I dream of a world where I can be more free and more open, and where the tools that we\u2019re building in the crypto space can be a big part of actually making that happen. I have a dream of humanity as a whole really succeeding and ending disease and becoming a multiple-energy-area civilization.\n\nSpeaking of civilization, do you think in the future we can travel between planets? And would you take that ride to space?\n\nI think we\u2019ll absolutely get there. I will not be the first one to go\u2014I might be the hundredth person to go. Before we\u2019re really ready to do space, we need to get better at doing Antarctica first. I think of Antarctica as being the tutorial ground of going into space, because it\u2019s an environment that\u2019s definitely somewhat harsh and you have zero infrastructure, but you still can breathe the air without wearing a helmet. Start with the simpler things. But I would definitely love to actually be a part of that myself at some point over the next few decades."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin: If AI Turns on Us 'Even Mars May Not Be Safe' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin reflected on his own take on \u201ctechno-optimism,\u201d inspired by Marc Andreessen, who opined about AI in his Techno-Optimist Manifesto in October. While Buterin agreed with Andreessen\u2019s positive outlook, Buterin also noted the importance of how AI is developed and the technology's future direction.\n\nButerin acknowledged the existential risk of artificial intelligence, including causing the extinction of the human race.\n\n\u201cThis is an extreme claim: as much harm as the worst-case scenario of climate change, or an artificial pandemic or a nuclear war, might cause, there are many islands of civilization that would remain intact to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut a superintelligent AI, if it decides to turn against us, may well leave no survivors and end humanity for good,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cEven Mars may not be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin pointed to a 2022 survey by AI Impacts, which said between 5% and 10% of participants believe humans face extinction from AI or from humans' failure to control AI, respectively. He said that a security-focused open-source movement is ideal for leading AI development rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\n\n\u201cIf we want a future that is both superintelligent and \"human\u2014one where human beings are not just pets, but actually retain meaningful agency over the world\u2014then it feels like something like this is the most natural option,\" he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, Buterin continued, is the active human intention to choose its direction and outcome. \u201cThe formula of 'maximize profit' will not arrive at them automatically,\u201d he said.\n\nButerin said he loves technology because it expands human potential, pointing to the history of innovations from hand tools to smartphones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI believe that these things are deeply good, and that expanding humanity's reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nButerin said that while he believes transformative technology will lead to a brighter future for humanity, he rejects the notion that the world should stay how it is today, only with less greed and more public healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of technology that much more reliably make the world better than other types of technology,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cThere are certain types of technology that could, if developed, mitigate the negative impacts of other types of technology.\u201d\n\nButerin cautioned about a rise in digital authoritarianism and surveillance technology used against those who defy or dissent against the government, controlled by a small cabal of technocrats. He said the majority of people would rather see highly advanced AI delayed by a decade rather than be monopolized by a single group.\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Buterin said he is sympathetic to the effective acceleration (also known as \"e/acc\") movement, he has mixed feelings about its enthusiasm for military technology.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm about modern military technology as a force for good seems to require believing that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future,\u201d he said, citing the idea that military technology is good because it's being built and controlled by America and America is good.\n\n\u201cDoes being an e/acc require being an America maximalist, betting everything on both the government's present and future morals and the country's future success?\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin cautioned against giving \u201cextreme and opaque power\u201d to a small group of people with the hope they will use it wisely, preferring instead a philosophy of \"d/acc\"\u2014or defense, decentralization, democracy, and differential. This mindset, he said, could adapt to effective altruists, libertarians, pluralists, blockchain advocates, and solar and lunar punks.\n\n\u201cA defense-favoring world is a better world, for many reasons,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cFirst of course is the direct benefit of safety: fewer people die, less economic value gets destroyed, less time is wasted on conflict.\n\n\"What is less appreciated though is that a defense-favoring world makes it easier for healthier, more open and more freedom-respecting forms of governance to thrive,\" he concluded.\n\nWhile he emphasized the need to build and accelerate, Buterin said society should regularly ask what we are accelerating towards. Buterin suggested that the 21st century may be \"the pivotal century\" for humanity that could decide the fate of humanity for millennia.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging problems,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut I look forward to watching and participating in our species' grand collective effort to find the answers.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "What Is Block Time? What It Measures, Verification, and Example - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Block Time?\n\nBlock time measures the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain.\n\nBlockchains were first popularized by Bitcoin when it was introduced in 2009. The technology has grown as more cryptocurrencies are created, each of which can use a different or identical blockchain, validation methods, and techniques for creating new blocks.\n\nKey Takeaways Block time is the time it takes to process a block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is verified by miners, who compete against each other to verify the transactions and solve the hash, which creates another block.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, a block is validated by randomly selected nodes, which is must faster because there is no competition.\n\nOther chains might use different mechanisms, which would affect their block times.\n\nUnderstanding Block Time\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions within a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block within the database as a cell in a spreadsheet where transaction information is stored. Bitcoin miners verify the transactions, which takes time because finding the solution to the encryption problem requires the computers to make a vast number of trial-and-error attempts.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called hashing\u2014generating random hexadecimal numbers to try and find one that is less than or equal to one set by the network. When the block solution is found or otherwise validated, a new block is opened. The amount of time it takes to find the solution and create a new block is the block time.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key points to remember if you're trying to understand block time:\n\nA block is a record of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions, similar to a cell in a table of columns and rows.\n\nEach block contains the information from the block that preceded it in hashed form (that's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency).\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptocurrency \"miners\" race against each other to generate a random hash plus the nonce that is less than or equal to the target hash. The winner receives a reward.\n\nEthereum validators use a different consensus mechanism, which makes the block times shorter.\n\nBlockchains that use other mechanisms may have shorter or longer block times.\n\nWhy Block Times Differ\n\nConsensus mechanisms are what allow a network of participants to agree that a transaction is valid. Cryptocurrencies can use different consensus mechanisms, which, among other factors, affect the time it takes to verify transactions and create new blocks.\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that use different transaction verification methods. Each blockchain has a different block time because of the way their mechanisms work\u2014Bitcoin averages about 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 12 seconds.\n\nThe exact amount of time it takes for block generation on the Bitcoin proof-of-work blockchain is governed by the difficulty level, which changes with network traffic and the number of miners on the network to keep block times at 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake, which is much faster because there is no competition for a reward\u2014participants with staked ether are randomly selected to validate the transactions and receive network fees.\n\nBlock Time vs. Confirmation Time\n\nSometimes confused with each other, block times and confirmation times are two different measurements on a blockchain. Confirmation time is the amount of time it takes a blockchain to confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's often thought that a transaction needs six confirmations before it goes through; however, this is a misunderstanding. When a transaction makes it into a block, and the block is closed, the transaction has one confirmation and concludes. The number six comes from the belief that a transaction that was confirmed six times (included in six closed blocks) is secure from any network attacks.\n\nA block may be opened every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not all transactions that occur within that period can be sent to the current block to be mined and confirmed. Confirmation can take up to several hours on the Bitcoin blockchain because transactions are sent to a mempool, where they are queued in order of the amount of fees paid.\n\nUsers who want their transactions placed in front of others pay more than the average, while those who pay average or below-average fees must wait their turn to be sent to a block, verified, and confirmed at least once.\n\n\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created? Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins created yearly halves every four years. This slows down Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Will Ever Be Created? Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be created.\n\nHow Do I Get a Bitcoin Block? You never actually receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's framework. Instead, you receive a reward of bitcoin when your miner solves the hash and creates another block.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are one of the structures used in a blockchain that store information. The time it takes to open a new block on a chain is that chain's block time. Block times differ from confirmation times, which can take several hours or days to complete.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The introduction of Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard earlier this year drew much attention, but adoption and retention are off to a slow start.\n\nExisting hardware wallets rely on a pair of keys. If those keys are compromised, so are tokens in the wallet. The ERC-4337 standard was instead intended as a new baseline for how users interact with crypto wallets services, including social recovery mechanisms and other multisig options.\n\nThe standard turns Ethereum accounts into \u201csmart accounts,\u201d which are much more flexible to suit the needs of wallet holders.\n\nAccording to data on BundleBear:\n\nWeekly retention for ERC-4337 smart wallets drops as low as 1% for accounts older than five weeks.\n\nAn average smart account only sends five user operations.\n\nRevenue for transaction \u201cbundlers\u201d is also low, currently less than $8,000 per week.\n\nRead more: What Are Smart Contract Wallets? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nAt the time of writing, daily active users are at around 3%, sixdegree data shows. Most smart account users today are on the Polygon network, making up over 66% of all smart account holders and almost all monthly new users by chain.\n\nDespite the low adoption rates on Ethereum, industry participants remain optimistic about the future of smart accounts and have been actively working on proposals to spur usage.\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, an account abstraction infrastructure company, notes that many existing issues with ERC-4337 can be resolved with the first-ever Rollup Improvement Proposal, RIP-7560.\n\nThe existing ERC-4337 standard is considered a \u201csemi-native+\u201d smart account, where a user does not need a private key because the trustless relay network is designed to forward transactions to the blockchain.\n\nRising believes that the goal is to move towards a \u201cnative\u201d smart account, where accounts would be able to specify their own validation logic, completely removing the need for a private key \u2014 something that RIP-7560 hopes to do.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 has always been intended as a stepping stone to native account abstraction. The account abstraction proposal, RIP-7560, is designed to be backwards compatible with ERC-4337,\u201d Rising told Blockworks.\n\nFurther discussions around the proposal and its applicability must still be considered. Native account abstraction has drawn concerns over the complexity it adds, as it introduces consensus layer changes rather than just high-level infrastructure layer modifications.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum: A Buy Opportunity Is Underway! - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Broad markets and cryptocurrencies are preparing for more volatility, as explained in Leading Indicators Confirming A Pullback Is Underway. The intensity will not be like June nor September of last year, it will be closer to the December pullback. That said, we can clearly see that the next wave of selling will come with a buy opportunity in Ethereum (ETH). This is consistent with our crypto predictions for 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, we predicted that leading indicator Bitcoin was unable to move higher. As explained in Bitcoin: Resolution Comes After Chart Tension Is Cleared:\n\nThat said, what do we see on the Bitcoin chart currently? First, BTC did hit resistance, strong resistance. Any market that is unable to clear resistance will move back to support before it can re-attack resistance. Second, several trendlines coincide in the 19-22k area in the period February & March. This is the \u2018tension\u2019 we were talking about in our introduction. As seen, as of April, there is only one trendline above 22k which suggests that IF Bitcoin is able to get back to 23k in April/May it should be able to clear that resistance level.\n\nWhen both time and price meet resistance, when there is tension on the chart in that time/price combination, there is simply no way that a market can move higher.\n\nIt\u2019s a very simple principle that most investors nor analysts are able to \u2018see\u2019 although it\u2019s there, on the chart, visible, for anyone with an open mind.\n\nThat said, the Ethereum chart is also pretty clear. What we observe is straightforward:\n\nThe 1549-1658 area has lots of resistance. It\u2019s the 3d attempt of Ethereum to clear this area since last summer. We suspect that the 4th attempt will come with a breakout, but only in 4 to 6 weeks from now. Everything will depend on how low ETH will fall. If support at 1336 will hold, in March, we are convinced that ETH will clear 1658 not later than April of this year.\n\nOverall, what we do like most about the Ethereum chart, other than the \u2018details\u2019 outlined above, is that tension is disappearing. The candles are getting smoother, the candles are smaller, the volatility is disappearing. Needless to say, if volatility will pick up (which we expect to happen in the next few weeks) the picture might change but you can clearly see how this current period is getting smoother, certainly when compared to last summer and fall.\n\nIn our crypto research service, we will be tracking relative strength in our watchlist of 30 tokens. We also do expect to hit at least one unicorn (a multi-bagger) before the start of the summer."

        "title": "Despite Massive Gains, Solana (SOL) Could Just be Getting Started - Markets Insider",
        "content": "Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have bounced back in a big way in 2023, with year-to-date gains of 123% and 69%, respectively. Beyond the two largest cryptos, other assets like Solana (SOL-USD) have done even better. Solana is up 387% so far in 2023, but the party could just be getting started.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Solana\u2019s long-term potential based on its impressive performance metrics, the explosive growth of usage and activity on the Solana blockchain, and its relatively low market cap versus its peer, Ethereum.\n\nStellar Metrics\n\nSolana is a proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum. To be fully transparent, I own both Solana and Ethereum, and I am bullish on both, so the following comparison between the two networks is simply meant to illustrate the potential value of Solana.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but Solana features several notable advantages from a user perspective. While Ethereum is averaging a throughput of under 30 transactions per second (TPS), Solana features an exponentially higher throughput of 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThis high throughput leads to faster transaction times. Transactions on Solana are often completed in a matter of seconds, whereas transactions on Ethereum can take five minutes or more to process at times (the average is between 15 seconds to five minutes).\n\nMeanwhile, high transaction costs, or \u201cgas fees,\u201d have been one of the main gripes Ethereum users have had about the network for a long time. At writing, Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have hit their highest levels in six months and are averaging over $30 per transaction, making it cumbersome and expensive to use the network for routine transactions.\n\nIn contrast, transactions on Solana cost less than a penny. This makes Solana an appealing option for users who want to make low-cost transactions. If you want to buy a nonfungible token (NFT) for $40 or send a friend $20, paying $30 in gas on Ethereum isn\u2019t practical, whereas a transaction fee of under a penny on Solana is hardly noticeable. These low costs could help Solana appeal to more users as cryptocurrency reaches wider adoption.\n\nThis massive throughput, low cost, and fast transaction time led Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts to declare that Solana could be \u201cthe Visa (NYSE:V) of the digital asset ecosystem\u201d earlier this year.\n\nWhile the Solana blockchain\u2019s performance is impressive, it could get even better. Solana users are awaiting the launch of Firedancer, a new validator in development that will reportedly increase Solana\u2019s throughput to a mind-blowing one million transactions per second.\n\nUsage Explodes\n\nThis positive user experience has led to an explosion in usage for Solana. Crypto publication The Defiant recently reported that \u201cSolana is having its best month ever\u201d in terms of trading volume and total value locked.\n\nVolume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana hit an all-time high of $5.1 billion in November, smashing the previous record of $2.8 billion last November.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) \u2014 essentially a measure of how much value users have committed to or locked up in the network \u2014 has jumped from $427 million at the start of November to $610 million currently, indicating growing confidence in the Solana network by crypto users.\n\nOn November 11th, the number of daily active users (DAUs) on Solana even surpassed those of the much larger Ethereum, with 356,300 users for the day versus 330,000 for Ethereum.\n\nIncreasing Collaborations and Partnerships\n\nAdditionally, Solana has made significant headway in terms of corporate partnerships and tie-ups with other crypto projects.\n\nIn August, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) announced an integration with Solana Pay, which would make using Solana a new payment option on the platform. Then, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, in September, Visa announced that it would use Solana to facilitate USDC (USDC-USD) stablecoin transactions.\n\nFurthermore, some interesting crypto projects, like Helium and Render (RNDR-USD), are migrating to Solana. Render, which seeks to provide decentralized GPU computing power for 3D content creation, migrated from Ethereum to Solana earlier in November. Render founder Jules Urbach said that Render made the move because of Solana\u2019s \u201cincredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Helium, which is focused on providing decentralized WiFi, made the move from its own layer-1 blockchain to Solana to free up its developers from having to focus on maintaining their own blockchain and leverage Solana\u2019s fast transaction times.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSolana\u2019s enormous throughput, fast transaction times, and minuscule transaction fees have attracted more users to the network. As a result, activity on the Solana blockchain is experiencing a Cambrian explosion, as seen in the significant increase in DEX volume, total value locked, and daily active users.\n\nNone of this is to say that Solana will displace or disrupt Ethereum (and again, I am bullish on both). It should be noted that Ethereum is working on upgrades that could improve its throughput and lower gas fees. Still, these impressive stats are even more notable when considering that Solana has a market cap of just $23 billion versus Ethereum\u2019s considerably higher market cap of $239 billion.\n\nWith performance metrics that are ahead of Ethereum\u2019s and user numbers that are rapidly growing, Solana looks like it offers considerable value with a market cap that is just one-tenth the size of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a high-risk investment and can be extremely volatile. But for risk-tolerant investors who are interested in cryptocurrency and investing in the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it could make sense to add exposure to Solana while it has just one-tenth of Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Throughout the major part of November, the Ethereum price remained within a sideways range, fluctuating between $2133 and $1917. Both of these horizontal levels were tested twice, signaling uncertainty among market participants. However, this consolidation has formed a bearish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential further downside for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why CBDCs Could Outshine BTC, Ethereum, and Other Private Cryptos\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill $ETH Consolidation Lead to Massive Leap?\n\nThe overhead supply at $2133 assists sellers in developing a bearish reversal pattern called double bottom\n\nThe $1917 level aligned with the 32.8% Fibonacci retracement level creates a strong support zone.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.\n\nAmid the past two weeks\u2019 consolidation, the Ethereum price retreated twice from the $2133 resistance, indicating substantial overhead supply. These reversals have emphasized the emergence of a bullish reversal pattern known as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart.\n\nTypically observed near market tops, this pattern signifies a decline in bullish momentum. At present, ETH trades at $2,025 and, with an intraday loss of 1.6%, is gradually approaching the neckline support at $1,970.\n\nA bearish breakdown below this neckline could intensify supply pressure, potentially causing ETH to drop to around the $1700 mark, marking a potential loss of 12%.\n\nHowever, the recent price rejections around the psychological support of $2,000 suggest buyers are attempting to counter the bearish setup. If this buying pressure persists, the ETH price might rebound to challenge the last swing high at $2133 and the upper trendline of a longstanding wedge pattern.\n\nETH Price Recovery to $3400\n\nOver the past 20 months, the ETH price has experienced a shallow recovery within a rising wedge pattern. Historically, the upper boundary of this trendline has resulted in increased supply pressure, leading to significant corrections. Therefore, the current upward movement towards this upper trendline necessitates a definitive breakout to confirm a bullish trend. A post-breakout rally could potentially drive prices up to $3400\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A sharp drop in the daily RSI slope suggests a bearish divergence with the Ethereum price, hinting at potential upcoming downturns.\n\nBollinger Bands: The converging boundaries of the Bollinger Bands indicate an uncertain market sentiment prevailing for Ethereum.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter cooling its November rally Solana has shot up again: it's right now the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing Solana (SOL) is trading for $60.16 per coin\u2014a 24-hour jump of over 7%, according to CoinGecko. Over the past seven days, SOL has gained 10% in value.\n\nSOL experienced a phenomenal rally throughout November. The Ethereum-competitor price soared past $50 for the first time since May 2022, beating most coins and tokens in performance.\n\nAccording to experts, the boom was likely down to a short squeeze caused by short sellers exiting their positions and renewed interest from institutions. But that was nearly a month ago and Solana is still pumping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL was the most oversold asset in the space after rumors swirled that collapsed crypto exchange FTX's new management was thinking about selling large amounts of SOL. But it shot up unexpectedly after short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) rapidly exited their positions.\n\nOver the past 30 days, SOL is up over 70%.\n\nElsewhere, the crypto market is relatively sleepy. Bitcoin has barely budged over a 24-hour period; the same goes for Ethereum. Other major players like Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP have also not moved by a percentage point.\n\nBitcoin yesterday did experience impressive price movements, breaking past $38,000 per coin for the second time in a week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same goes for most of the top digital assets\u2014except for Avalanche (AVAX), which is up in the past day, coming in at $20.87.\n\nAVAX\u2014like SOL\u2014is also a winner over the past 30 days: it has gained 80% in value.

        "title": "Optimistic Rollups vs. ZK Rollups: Which Is Better? - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Today, we\u2019ll differentiate between ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups, famous Ethereum Layer 2 protocols that help boost speed and lower costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first, let\u2019s define rollups.\n\nWhat are Blockchain Rollups?\n\nBlockchain rollups are scaling solutions designed to scale slow and expensive blockchains like Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRollups process transactions on another, faster blockchain called Layer 2, then bundle them up into groups or batches and submit them to the parent blockchain (Layer 1) instead of sending each one individually.\n\nThat way, the cost of that transaction is split across many users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, their time is saved because they don\u2019t have to wait and pay for each transaction to process independently on Ethereum.\n\nTherefore, users can benefit from the speed and cheapness of the roll-up while also benefiting from the security of the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it more transparent,\n\nEthereum processes around 15-30 transactions per second (TPS). That's like handling 54,000 - 108,000 transactions in an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, imagine this:\n\nWhen loads of people try to transact, only the top 54,000 - 108,000 transactions get through due to congestion, causing high fees and slow verification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we had an \"express lane\" for Ethereum transactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lane gathers up lots of transactions, say 10 thousand, and bundles them into a single package. Then, this package gets submitted onto the Ethereum network as one transaction.\n\nSo, one move represents a group of transactions, easing the congestion and boosting TPS.\n\nWith this, Ethereum could process over 10,000 transactions per second.\n\nThis is the ideology behind rollups.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we\u2019ll look at the two main types of rollups.\n\nTypes Of Rollups (Optimistic vs. Zero Knowledge)\n\nThe difference is how they verify transactions before posting them to the main blockchain.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Optimistic Rollup.\n\nFor Optimistic rollups, they assume that all the transactions contained within a rollup are valid unless proven otherwise using a fraud-proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransactions are grouped off-chain into a batch and processed off-chain by a set of validators, after which they are submitted to the main chain in a compressed format.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here is the exciting part:\n\nNetwork users can dispute fraudulent transactions before they are submitted to the main chain to ensure that this batch of transactions is not manipulated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is termed the \u201cchallenge period,\u201d during which anyone can submit evidence or fraud-proof to prove a transaction is invalid. This lasts for about a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no evidence is submitted, the batch is considered valid and is added to the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if evidence is submitted, the dispute is resolved through a dispute resolution process, and the batch is either accepted or rejected based on the procedure's outcome.\n\nNext is the Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollup.\n\nZK rollups do not assume the validity of the submitted transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they use a sophisticated cryptographic technique known as Zero-Knowledge proof to verify the legitimacy of transactions before submitting them to the main blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs are a type of cryptography that allows someone to prove that they know something without revealing what the thing is.\n\n\\In the case of ZK rollups, \u201cthe thing\u201d that is being proven is that the transactions in a rollup block are valid without showing all the transaction details.\n\nLike other rollup solutions, ZK Rollup begins by grouping multiple transactions into a batch or rollup block.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, it uses mathematical algorithms to generate validity proofs for each transaction within the batch.\n\nInstead of submitting all transaction details to the main blockchain, it submits only these validity proofs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese validity proofs indicate that the transactions have indeed occurred and are valid.\n\nIn addition, the validity proof allows anyone to confirm that the transactions within a rollup block are valid without revealing any information about those transactions.\n\nBut Which is Better of These Two?\n\nLet\u2019s look at their strength and weaknesses under these four categories.\n\nTransaction Validity time Security and Privacy Gas Fees and Implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Delay in Transaction Validity\n\nOptimistic rollup transaction verification can take a week because of how fraud-proof works.\n\nThis means that users' funds take up to a week to be reversed during the challenge period if the transaction's validity is questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, ZK rollups eliminate the need for a challenge period.\n\nThis enables users to withdraw their funds promptly and without any waiting period.\n\n2. Security and Privacy\n\nCompared to Optimistic rollups, ZK rollups offer improved security and privacy by verifying transactions through validity proofs.\n\n3. Gas Fees\n\nZK rollups typically have higher gas fees as they require more computational power than Optimistic rollups to generate validity proofs.\n\n4. Implementation\n\nZK rollups are generally more complex to implement than Optimistic rollups.\n\nThis is primarily due to the cryptographic techniques and computations in generating and verifying Zero-Knowledge proofs.\n\nIn addition, ZK rollups are limited to supporting specific use cases, such as swapping NFTs or transferring coins.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a new type of ZK rollup called zkEVMs.\n\nzkEVMs are a new type of ZK rollup that is EVM-compatible\n\nThis means that they can be used to run Ethereum applications.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBoth Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups are promising scaling solutions for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, they have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimistic rollups lead the way regarding reduced complexity and lower gas fees.\n\nTwo of the leading layer 2 blockchains that use optimistic rollups are Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to security, scalability, and privacy, Zk rollups take the lead.\n\nSome of the most prominent layer 2 blockchains using ZK rollups are Polygon zkEVM and zkSync.\n\n\n\n"

Learn how to place bets using cryptocurrency, understand the benefits, and explore expert tips and tricks for successful betting. Dive into the future of sports gambling with Ethereum.\n\nThe Beginner's Playbook to Ethereum Sports Betting: How to Wager Crypto on Games\n\nEthereum and sports betting go hand-in-hand. If you're new to crypto wagering on games, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. Learn how Ethereum sportsbooks work, find the top sites to bet at, and get tips to do it safely. More about experiences in crypto betting read in our guide.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Sports Betting Work\n\nEthereum Sports Betting\n\nEthereum sports betting refers to the act of wagering on sporting events using Ethereum and its blockchain technology. With Ethereum sports betting, bettors can place bets on games and matches using Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. The bettor deposits Ether into a sportsbook or betting exchange and can use the Ether to place bets. The transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which is transparent, permanent, and verifiable. Once the outcome of the event is determined, winnings are paid out in Ether back to the bettor's wallet. Ethereum brings the key benefits of blockchain technology to sports betting - decentralized, transparent, and secure transactions with fast settlement times. Bets can be placed pseudo-anonymously, with no central authority controlling the flow of funds.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in Sports Betting\n\nEthereum plays several key roles in enabling trustless, peer-to-peer sports betting:\n\nBet Settlement - The Ethereum blockchain allows for fast, secure, and verifiable settlement of sports bets. Outcomes can be determined objectively based on data feeds or other oracles, and winnings automatically distributed per the smart contract terms.\n\nTransparency - All bets and payouts are visible on the public Ethereum ledger, enabling independent verification of sportsbook activities. This prevents fraudulent behavior.\n\nSecurity - Cryptographic signatures enabled by Ethereum prevent unauthorized withdrawals or changes to bets. User funds are secured through private keys and are not controlled by sportsbooks.\n\nSpeed - Ethereum processes transactions quickly, allowing bettors to swiftly place wagers and cash out winnings. Bets can be made right up to the start of an event.\n\nAccessibility - Ethereum sports betting is accessible to anyone globally with an internet connection. Geographic restrictions are removed through blockchain technology.\n\nBy integrating these technical advantages, Ethereum unlocks provably fair, quick, and globally accessible sports betting.\n\nHow to Bet with Ethereum\n\nBetting with Ethereum consists of three key steps:\n\nObtain an Ethereum Wallet - To transact on Ethereum, you'll need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask. This will allow you to securely store Ether and interact with betting platforms.\n\nFund Your Wallet - Transfer Ether into your wallet by purchasing it from an exchange or requesting a transfer from an existing Ethereum account. Popular exchanges to buy Ether include Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.\n\nPlace Your Bets - Connect your wallet to a sports betting platform that accepts Ether. Review the available betting markets and odds, select your wagers, and submit the Ethereum transaction. If your bet wins, profits will be sent back to your wallet.\n\nIt's important to exercise caution when choosing a sports betting platform and only deposit what you can afford to lose, as with any form of gambling. But by following these steps, you can enjoy trustless and efficient Ethereum sports betting.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum Sports Betting\n\nUsing Ethereum as a means to bet on sporting events brings important advantages compared to traditional online sportsbooks:\n\nSpeed and Efficiency\n\nOne major benefit is the speed and efficiency enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions on Ethereum take 15 seconds or less to complete, compared to 3-5 days for bank transfers or credit cards. This allows bettors to swiftly deposit funds, place last-minute wagers before an event begins, and instantly withdraw winnings. Ethereum cuts out delays from middlemen payment processors - bets are peer-to-peer. The efficiency of smart contracts also allows for complex betting scenarios like parlays, prop bets, and live in-game wagering to be executed seamlessly on Ethereum.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nEthereum sports betting also enhances privacy and security compared to traditional sportsbooks. All transactions are pseudo-anonymous - bettors transact using Ethereum addresses rather than real identities. Funds are secured through cryptographic private keys as opposed to passwords. Ethereum's distributed network makes it virtually immune to hacks, offering rock-solid security of user funds. Smart contracts act as trustless escrow accounts, only distributing winnings automatically once bet conditions are met. This prevents sportsbooks from withholding funds or changing odds retroactively.\n\nChallenges in Ethereum Sports Betting\n\nHowever, there are some challenges to evaluate with Ethereum sports betting:\n\nVolatility of Ethereum\n\nAs a cryptocurrency, the value of Ether can fluctuate dramatically. The stakes of bets made in Ether may change quickly. This introduces some unpredictability compared to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Sudden crashes in Ether price right before major sporting events could cause issues for betting platforms. Users may lose funds simply from Ether volatility rather than losing bets.\n\nLegal Considerations\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrency sports betting varies widely across different countries and jurisdictions. While decentralized, blockchain betting removes geographic restrictions, local laws still apply. Bettors should research if sports betting is permitted where they live, regardless of whether Ether or fiat currencies are used to place wagers. Know your rights and obligations.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum in Sports Betting\n\nBased on its current trajectory, Ethereum appears poised to continue disrupting the online sports betting industry in the future:\n\nIncreased adoption of Ethereum by major sportsbooks will streamline crypto betting and provide on-ramps for new bettors.\n\nFurther development of smart contract capabilities will support sophisticated betting markets and oracle data feeds.\n\nThe scalability improvements coming to Ethereum will allow higher transaction throughput at lower costs.\n\nMainstream interest in cryptocurrencies will drive new bettors to explore Ethereum sports betting.\n\nDecentralized sports betting exchanges will remove counterparty risk inherent with sportsbooks.\n\nAs Ethereum technology progresses and gains mainstream traction, the advantages and applications for sports betting will only expand further. Ethereum has the potential to fundamentally transform sports betting by opening up true peer-to-peer, global markets backed by the transparency and security of blockchain technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum sports betting presents an exciting new paradigm through which to engage with sports. It provides bettors with a transparent, fast, secure, and decentralized way to wager on sporting events and outcomes. By leveraging Ethereum's native cryptocurrency and blockchain, bettors can place trustless peer-to-peer bets without centralized authority. This unlocks powerful advantages like speed, efficiency, enhanced privacy, and global accessibility compared to traditional sportsbooks. While challenges around volatility and legality exist, Ethereum sports betting is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of provably fair outcomes, liquid betting markets, and instant payouts. As the technology matures, Ethereum has the capacity to fundamentally transform sports betting for bettors and sportsbooks alike. Understanding the inner workings of Ethereum sports betting is key to appreciate this emerging innovation.\n\nThis article was written in cooperation with SafeHamsters"

QUBE also follows a governance model, where each holder can make their voice heard according to the size of their portfolio.\n\nOne key reason behind Ethereum whales showing confidence in this project is the successful completion of an audit by a reputed blockchain security firm. The appeal is further enhanced by the astounding success in the presale, with over $5.4 million already raised. QUBE is currently one of the best new cryptos to invest in, given the bright future roadmap of InQubeta.\n\nSolana\u2019s Meme Coin BONK Witnesses a Major Spike\n\nMeanwhile, the Solana network\u2019s meme coin BONK has been making headlines with its impressive 25% price jump. This surge coincided with Binance\u2019s announcement of a futures offering for BONK, along with PYTH, a DeFi network oracle. BONK\u2019s spike in popularity appears to be benefiting from the increased attention on Solana, which itself has seen a 90% increase in price over the last month.\n\nThis development in BONK\u2019s value and the renewed investor interest in Solana underscore the dynamic and sometimes whimsical nature of meme coins in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market is currently buzzing with the significant growth of Solana\u2019s meme coin BONK and the rising interest from Ethereum whales in the AI-driven InQubeta. Memecoins are still a thing in the market, but it\u2019s top ICOs like InQubeta that add a different taste to the industry.

        "content": "Bitcoin emerged as the leader, capturing a significant 49.11% of the market share, followed by Ethereum with 16.50%.\n\nThe top 20 cryptocurrencies make up 85.93% percent of the total market, according to a recent report done by Invezz.com, an investment platform. Bitcoin emerged as the leader, capturing a significant 49.11% of the market share, followed by Ethereum with 16.50%.\n\nIn a recent analysis, researchers examined the market caps of 2,174 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, revealing that the top 20 tokens command a substantial 85.93% of the total market. It\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies with self-reported market caps were intentionally excluded from the study.\n\nIn the crypto scene, market cap is a way to gauge a cryptocurrency\u2019s popularity and potential for growth. Calculated by multiplying the total coins in circulation by the price per coin, this figure helps assess whether a cryptocurrency is a solid choice compared to others in terms of safety and potential returns.\n\nThe analysis also unveils that the top 120 cryptocurrencies account for a staggering 93.07% of the total market.\n\nThese are the top 20 cryptocurrencies ranked by their total value in circulation, known as market capitalization. It\u2019s not a suggestion on what to buy or avoid; rather, it\u2019s a list of the most significant projects by market capitalization. It gives you an overview of the landscape before making decisions about investing in crypto:\n\nSpeaking on the result of the analysis, Invezz Market analyst, Crispus Nyaga commented that: \u201cMarket cap remains a crucial gauge of a cryptocurrency\u2019s relevance, despite being criticized for reflecting long-term popularity rather than immediate value. Large-cap cryptocurrencies, with market caps exceeding $10 billion, are generally viewed as safer investments due to their stability compared to smaller assets. Mid-cap cryptos, while more volatile, offer greater growth potential, while small-cap cryptocurrencies are highly risky but may present short-term growth opportunities with the caveat of sudden crashes.\u201d\n\nInvezz is an online financial news platform offers financial information and peer review market analysis related to equities, forex, commodities, real estate and crowdfunding, enabling investors to stay updated about the recent trends in equity, trading and derivative markets.\n\n"

        "content": "JAKARTA - Vitalik Buterin, a key figure in the crypto world, responded to Andresson Horowitz's views regarding his future role in technology and its impact on humans. The Ethereum founder outlined his ideas in Vitalik.eth.limo's personal blog post on November 27, 2023.\n\nPreviously, Horowitz wrote his idea entitled The Techno-Optimist Manifesto\" in a blog post stressing the importance of embracing technology and markets for a brighter future. This Manifesto rejects the idea of stagnation and highlights the need to prioritize progress rather than maintaining the status quo.\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his views on the impact of technology on the quality of life, health, comfort, and access to information in the last century. However, he highlighted certain risks caused by technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) that have the potential to threaten human existence.\n\nLaunching Beincrypto, Buterin proposed an alternative perspective called \"defensive acceleration\" or \"d/acc\". This concept involves accelerating certain technologies which are expected to make the world safer. It also emphasizes the need to limit or slow down the development of technology that tends to consolidate power or pose an uncontrolled risk.\n\nSome examples of \"defense-favoring\" technologies suggested by Buterin to accelerate include resilient infrastructure and pandemic-response technologies. Also include encryption and blockchain to maintain privacy and decentralization, as well as tools to enable democratic governance.\n\nButerin warned about the increasing digital authoritarianism that could be exploited against opposition or those who oppose the government. This is claimed to be controlled by a large number of technology companies.\n\nHuman And AI Collaboration\n\nNot only that, the Ethereum boss added that most people prefer to postpone the development of highly sophisticated artificial intelligence for a decade rather than being monopolized by one group or technology giant company.\n\nEspecially for advanced artificial intelligence, Buterin suggests focusing more on collaboration between AI and humans than autonomous systems. The cognitive increase in autonomous systems will also be prioritized to address the risk of takeover by superintelection.\n\nFor Buterin, humans are 'bright stars' who are able to produce good things and reap the positive values of the progress of human civilization itself. Then, he also emphasized the importance of using technology, and responding wisely to the rapid development of technology.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

These apps are not necessarily trading apps but are used by people who buy and keep cryptocurrencies rather than trade frequently. Let\u2019s explore the MetaMask wallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetamask is one of the world\u2019s most popular Ethereum apps with over 30 million global users. Since its inception, MetaMask has continued to break boundaries and set itself as the best Ethereum wallet mobile app and the go-to portal between users and Web3 or blockchain applications. Let\u2019s explore why MetaMask is special.\n\nKey Features\n\nMetaMask is incredibly simple to use:\n\nMetaMask allows users to buy, sell, and swap tokens over its mobile application or browser extension. The wallet gives you a secure vault, token exchange capabilities, a token wallet, and safe login. It\u2019s an all-in-one app that promotes Web 3 usage in a simple interface. The beginner-friendly interface helps you store and manage your tokens.\n\nInteract with blockchain applications:\n\nMetaMask is ever so important because most Web 3 applications sit on the Ethereum blockchain and its variants. MetaMask bridges metaverse explorers with blockchains by providing a seamless portal to buy and exchange Ethereum \u2013 Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token.\n\nMetaMask allows you securely access blockchain apps without giving up more than necessary data. The mobile app also supports NFT and DeFi applications such as opensea, giving you unlimited access to the DeFi world.\n\nMetaMask swap:\n\nMetaMask\u2019s new Swap feature allows you to swap tokens at the most competitive prices. For example, MetaMask accesses liquidity information of DEX\u2019s liquidity pools and DEX aggregators like UniSwap, AirSwap, Curve, 0XAPI, 1inch, and Paraswap. With such data, you can execute positions with DEXs with the largest liquidity and save money from spreads.\n\nThe gas fee on a swap is $0.0875% of the swap volume. For large swap volumes, MetaMask spreads your order over multiple DEXs to avoid slippage. Slippage occurs when you make large orders from a single exchange, and prices swing because the exchange isn\u2019t liquid enough to immediately execute the order. Large swaps or positions often lead to slippage, but MetaMask saves you from slippage costs by spreading your order over multiple DEXs.\n\nSecurity:\n\nMetaMask has intensive security protocols, multi-layer security systems, and 2FA authentication to ensure consumer funds\u2019 safety. MetaMask also has an open policy. That is, they disclose security breaches to the users immediately one is suspected. The transparency makes them the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\nMetaMask native ecosystem supports ETH and ETH-based tokens like the ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nPros: MetaMask is one of the most popular ETH wallets available.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.

With MetaMask, you can execute large swaps without worrying about painful gas fees. Cons: While spreading your large order over different liquidity providers and DEXs, you may incur unwarranted fees each DEX charges on order execution. Spreads are not fixed and are entirely dependent on the market and the liquidity of the commodity.\n\nMetaMask supports Ethereum and its variants in its native ecosystem, while swaps are executed via a partnership with other companies. It begets the question of trust. Can you trust MetaMask to keep your data safe and not share unnecessary data with its partners? We think you can!\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nAre Crypto Apps Safe To Use?\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has been the target of malicious groups. While they operate on autonomous and decentralized systems powered by blockchain networks, attackers often find loopholes in smart contracts and bridges, seizing unimaginable amounts of money from users\u2019 wallets. It\u2019s important to consider the security of your crypto apps before choosing an app to use. Ethereum and Bitcoin trading are the two most prominent coins, and we also have tons of tokens in the market. Investing or trading these coins comes with risk. Let\u2019s explore the safety of crypto apps:\n\nBefore you choose a crypto app, ensure that the app has grade-A level security protocols and does not have a long history of breaches: Apps like Crypto.com and MetaMask, are considered extremely safe because of the safety and security measures they explore in keeping user assets.\n\nCold wallets:\n\nWhile it is easier to transfer funds in hot wallets, cold wallets offer the best security. A crypto wallet or app should store its assets in a cold wallet \u2013 inaccessible online to hackers. When your assets are securely stored in a vault, it means that hackers cannot access your wallet through the portal.\n\nLicenses:\n\nA licensed crypto app beats an unlicensed one. No matter how promising an app is, you are subject to malpractices like pump and dumps, rug pull, and hacks if it is unlicensed. Also, when a crypto app is unlicensed, users are not under any user-protection contract; hence, funds lost are dead and gone.\n\nUser reviews:\n\nBefore choosing an app, check out their reviews on PlayStore. It\u2019s usually rare to see a crypto app with a 5-star review aggregate, but anywhere from 3.9 to 4.5 stars is good enough. Of course, the latter number is preferred.\n\nAustralian regulation\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, is the highest regulatory body for financial providers and financial asset collectors. It\u2019s important to use an app that is licensed by the ASIC. First, the ASIC puts financial institutions through an extreme vetting process, ensuring they have excellent security protocols and insurance policies protecting users. When you visit an exchange\u2019s \u2018Security\u2019 page, you see many industry lingoes. Some of these words and numbers are entirely impossible to decipher. An exchange can boast of a certain security feature, but it takes an expert to know real stuff from the shaft. An ASIC certification proves that an exchange or app is as secure as they claim they are.\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSecurity and privacy are two very important factors to consider before choosing an app. Let\u2019s take a look at the security features and privacy factors you must consider:\n\n2FA: A crypto app should always support two-factor authentication. The more complex the layers of authentication, the better. Some apps won\u2019t allow you to log into your account without authenticating your primary device. Other apps send codes to your email address and phone number. If an activity on your account raises suspicion, an app should be able to lock you out and request your private key before logging you back in. Other 2FA protocols include location \u2013 if you log in from an unusual location, a crypto app can log you out and request your private key before letting you gain access. Volume: If your withdrawal volume is disproportionate to your usual volume, an app\u2019s AI can spot this as a scam and request that you provide your private keys. Cold storage: Cold storage removes your wallet from online. When your wallet and assets are on the blockchain, it is online and susceptible to attacks from malicious scammers. When your assets are offline, it is impossible for an attacker to steal them through online measures. Data sharing: Apps like MetaMaks partner with multiple exchanges to find the best liquidity when you want to swap cryptocurrencies. While the process ensures that you get the most competitive prices at any given time, it may mean that MetaMask and the other DEXs have to share information. MetaMask has explicitly stated in its website that it values user privacy and doesn\u2019t share more-than-needed data; you may need to check the data privacy of other crypto apps to ensure that they do not share sensitive data with their partners.\n\nHow to spot a crypto app scam\n\nCrypto app scams have become a mainstay in the cryptocurrency industry. Scammers often employ different techniques to draw unsuspecting victims and siphon their funds. Let\u2019s take a look at activities that scream scam in the crypto industry.\n\nA shabby-looking website: Scam websites often have the same layout because most scammers are impatient and use scripts of other scam websites to lure people into registering their accounts. A scam website will lack a good home page, won\u2019t reveal the name of the founders of the project, and will have a poor layout. Websites like MetaMask, Binance, and Coinbase, are professionally built and have a simple layout. Leave the website immediately if the layout doesn\u2019t appeal to your sense of safety. Promise mouth-watering returns: Scam websites often promise their users mouth-watering returns like 33% to 44% APY on staking and investments. Cryptocurrency investment can have great returns, but the market is volatile, and no exchange or broker can boast of constant positive returns on investment. A website that promises to double your investment in a few days is certainly a scam. Even established brokers like Crypto.com promise an 8% APY after about a year of holding. Does not require identity verification: Scammers want you to quickly get to the payment page, so they skip many important elements a crypto website should have. One of those elements is identity verification and proof of address. It is illegal to allow an entity to trade without verifying the entity\u2019s identity. Any exchange or app that allows you to trade unverified is certainly not licensed by any major agency. You will be better off donating your funds to charity. No licenses: A crypto website that allows users worldwide to trade without proper licenses in trading regions is a scam site. Be careful! Scam sites are usually open to everyone in every country. Some of them are small time, so they do not fall under the radar of law enforcement; however, these websites can steal thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Spam calls and messages: Any website that claims that an expert will call you during the registration process is most likely a scam. First, a real website with good traffic won\u2019t invest that much in telemarketing. The cryptocurrency space is volatile, and authentic sites avoid telemarketing at all costs. If a crypto exchange calls or sends messages advising you to invest more, you may be in a scam ecosystem.\n\nOther tips to consider include the following:\n\nNever open a link or button in an email from unverified sources. Opening unverified or malicious links can make your device vulnerable to security attacks, including cryptojacking (your device will be used to mine cryptocurrencies). Ensure that you visit the correct URL of popular crypto apps. For example, metamask.io can be cunningly delivered as metamasks.io. The former is the correct MetaMask website URL. The latter, if it exists, is a phony website dressed like the actual MetaMask site.\n\nTop Tips for Using Ethereum Apps Safely Never share your passphrase Under no circumstance should you ever share your private key or passphrase. With your passphrase, scammers can lock you out of your wallet and withdraw every penny you have. Passphrase security tips include: Do not store your passphrase online. Instead, store it in a physical security box. Do not share your passphrase with friends or family members. Use a reliable internet connection A reliable and secure internet connection allows you to explore cryptocurrency applications without exposing yourself to vulnerabilities. Before logging into your crypto wallet, follow these security steps: Do not use public online access: When you browse on public wifi, scammers can mirror your online activity and gain access to valuable information like your wallet address and password. If you want to log into your MetaMask, ensure you do so on a public and secured network. Auto-filling your wallet address might be a bad idea. If a thief steals any of your devices (mobile or laptop), he can gain access to some of your wallets if he logs in through your device. This is because apps like Google and Dashlane lets you autofill passwords and email addresses. Instead of auto-filling, you can set password-saver apps to request for your fingerprint or facial recognition before providing the password. Read user reviews before signing up User reviews give you practical data on how a wallet or an exchange works. If an exchange has poor customer service or has frequent glitches, many users will use the review section of PlayStore or Apple Store to express their displeasure. If a wallet generally has negative reviews, you should find another decent one for your Ethereum storing and trading needs. Store your ETH in a cold wallet after purchasing When you purchase Ethereum, ensure you store it in a cold wallet like MetaMask. A cold wallet is offline and protects your assets better.
