        "title": "Tether 24 hour trading volume surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC and Ethereum combined - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Tether USDT\u2019s 24-hour trading volume exceeds the combined total of the following five digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nReflecting on Tether\u2019s dominance in trading volume provides insight into market liquidity. As CryptoSlate data indicates, Tether (USDT) maintains a higher volume than Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and First Digital USD (FDUSD), pointing to its significant presence in the market. Specifically, Tether recorded a 24-hour volume of over $55 billion, far surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s $28 billion and Ethereum\u2019s $15 billion.\n\nWith a market cap of over $112 billion, the trading patterns also show that Tether\u2019s volume has consistently been robust throughout 2024, peaking at $130 billion on March 16. Tether\u2019s stability and frequent use in trading pairs make it a preferred choice for traders seeking to hedge against volatility.\n\nThese volume statistics reflect broader market trends as Tether provides liquidity and stability. Tether regularly achieves daily trading volumes exceeding $25 billion, reinforcing its status as a key liquidity provider in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nPer Glassnode data, throughout 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen around $4 \u2013 $8 billion per day, far below Tether\u2019s volumes.\n\nThe high trading volume of Tether compared to other major digital assets illustrates its integral role in daily trading activities and the broader market strategy that traders and institutions employ. This continuous high-volume trading signifies trust and reliance on Tether\u2019s stability and accessibility, making it indispensable for efficient market functioning.\n\nWhile Tether has historically faced recounted challenges regarding its reserves and use in illicit activities, these volumes showcase its resilience in combating these claims. Tether\u2019s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently told CryptoSlate that Tether is currently over-collateralized, with the firm\u2019s profits being put back into reserves to strengthen its stability.\n\nFurther, Ardoino commented how Senator Warren\u2019s discouragement of accounting firms from engaging with Tether had hindered its ability to use one of the US\u2019s top four accountants for audits. The CEO claimed that Tether is continuously seeking to hire one of the leading companies but has almost given up on it happening any time soon, regardless of their efforts to do so.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "7 Famous Ethereum Investors that You Should Know - UseTheBitcoin",
        "content": "Currently, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has started to attract more attention from investors. After December 2017 when, along with most other cryptos, ETH price hit an all-time high even more Ethereum investors have joined the market. Today we will list the 7 most famous ones.\n\nOne reason why Ethereum has become a favorite among investors is the fact that it\u2019s actually so much more than just a cryptocurrency project. In fact, one could argue that Ethereum is the world\u2019s most important blockchain project, since it actively contributes to the mainstream adoption of cryptos thanks to its platform that offers support for dApps, smart contracts, and new blockchain projects.\n\nAs with all cryptocurrencies, there are various risks involved when it comes to investing in Ethereum as a platform. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped a great number of people from doing just that, including various celebrities and big names within the cryptosphere.\n\nHere is a list of famous Ethereum investors:\n\nJoseph Lubin\n\nBoasting immense experience in fields such as software engineering, robotics, machine vision, and neural nets, Joseph Lubin is also one of the biggest names to be associated with the Ethereum project. The co-founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys (a Brooklyn-based software company focused on building dApps based on the Ethereum platform) may very well be one of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nAccording to various rumors, Joseph Lubin was one of the top buyers in the Ethereum crowd sale event that took place a couple of years ago. Joseph Lubin is regarded, by various industry insiders, as being one of the most important holders of Ethereum, with a valuation that is supposed to be as high as $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Lubin is also the founder of the Swiss-based company EthSuisse that has been heavily investing in Ethereum. With ConsenSys and EthSuisse, they do not only invest in the future of the network but also in solutions that would be able to offer better services to users.\n\nIn addition to it, Lubin has also been involved in different cross-industry groups that aimed at advancing solutions related to governance issues in the blockchain space. Thus, when you buy Ethereum, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean funds directly to developers, but it can also be by developing new services, gathering efforts to create new solutions, and expand the whole ecosystem.\n\nSource: rte.ie\n\nRichard Sherman\n\nRichard Sherman, an American football cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL (National Football League), is yet another famous person passionate about cryptocurrencies. Sherman started as a Bitcoin and Ethereum investor extremely early, after fans started asking if they could purchase products and merchandise from his official website using various digital coins.\n\nRichard declared on multiple occasions that he owns a few BTC, ETH, and LTC but is not really interested in the multitude of other smaller coins. He purchased Bitcoin when it was valued somewhere around $1,000 and managed to cash out when the prices skyrocketed upwards of 19,000. Regardless, he declared that he regrets not keeping the Bitcoins as they were.\n\nRichard Sherman has been selected to the Pro Bowl four times and has also been voted All-Pro four times. He has been playing in the Seattle Seahawks between 2011 and 2017 and in the San Francisco 49ers since 2018.\n\nMr. Sherman is not only interested in cryptocurrencies but he is also an ambassador for the trivia application FleetWit. Moreover, he has also invested in other tech stocks, showing that he has a diversified portfolio.\n\nThere are different individuals that decided to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss Brothers \u2013 Ethereum Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have made headlines on numerous occasions due to their connection with the crypto world. Even though the brothers have made a name for themselves after suing Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, claiming that he stole their idea of a social network, nowadays, the Winklevoss brothers are known as some of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nThe lawsuit allowed the brothers to settle for a whopping $65 million of Facebook stock and cash. After seeing an opportunity in blockchain and crypto technology, they decided to invest in Bitcoin. The brothers ended up buying 120,000 Bitcoin in 2012 when the price was less than $10. After their financial success, they re-invested and racked up around $350 million from other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included. The siblings are also renowned for creating the New York-based crypto exchange called Gemini.\n\nAlthough the Winklevoss brothers have been investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and focus on this digital asset, they were also holding Ethereum. Tyler Winklevoss explained that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were not compliant with securities law and that they are tokens on top of tokens. Regarding the value of the Ethereum network and its tokens, Mr. Winkleovss said that its value lies in the network itself rather than on other digital tokens.\n\nAt the moment there is no clear information regarding the amount of ETH that they hold or whether they have decided to sell a part of their stake. Nonetheless, they will continue playing an important role in the whole cryptocurrency market independently from the virtual currency they hold.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nVitalik Buterin \u2013 Ethereum Founder\n\nVitalik Buterin is a name that hardly requires any introduction, especially for those well accustomed with the crypto space. Our list wouldn\u2019t be complete without Vitalik, the mastermind behind the whole Ethereum project, and, arguably, the most important person in the crypto sphere after Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that Vitalik Buterin is a very wealthy man with one of the biggest net worths in crypto. Even though the inventor has never publicly acknowledged how much ETH he owns, there have been reports of him transferring 30,000 ETH to Bitstamp, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, somewhere in December 2017. Other forums and public posts depict Vitalik as the holder of somewhere around 500,000 ETH.\n\nAt the end of the day, nobody can answer this question apart from Vitalik Buterin himself. What\u2019s more amazing is that when most people think about Buterin, they don\u2019t see that wealthy man, but the inventor of one of the best blockchains platforms, a person for whom money is not a priority, and always looking to solve real problems within the crypto sphere.\n\nMr. Buterin has been involved in the cryptocurrency market and their investment on the Ethereum network is not merely financial. He is dedicated to Ethereum as a developer and leader of different teams that are investing their time and funds in improving the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThus, spending time and effort in the network is also a way of investing in it. Furthermore, there are many companies that rely on his recommendations and advice in order to invest their money in developers working on top of Ethereum. More adoption means stronger fundamentals for Ethereum, which would eventually be translated into a higher price of the ETH digital asset.\n\nButerin is in a similar situation as Joseph Lubin. Both of them co-founded Ethereum and they have been working in order to expand Ethereum\u2019s solutions and projects. They may not invest large amounts of money directly in ETH but they have been working in order for ETH to have more value over time.\n\nSource: Ethereum World News\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher, the Hollywood actor, is known for being passionate about technology in general. He was also one of the early investors in technologies and apps such as Airbnb and Uber, as well as for cryptocurrencies. He was one of the first celebrities to jump onto the crypto craze bandwagon and has even tweeted about Ethereum in 2014, almost a year before its initial release. Kutcher is said to be one of the big Bitcoin and Ethereum investors, even though an official number is yet to be released.\n\nSource: MarketWatch\n\nCharles Hoskinson\n\nCharles Hoskinson is also one of the co-founders of Ethereum. He is now the lead developer of Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). He has been working in order to offer alternative solutions to Ethereum.\n\nDespite that, he is an early adopter of virtual currencies. He entered the space when Bitcoin was traded close to $1. When the digital currency moved to $250 he decided to lead other major projects and start moving forward with the expansion in the crypto space.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that he is among the early Ethereum investors as the co-founder of the network. However, he didn\u2019t disclose part of his investments in the crypto project or whether he sold all his coins after some time.\n\nHe has been involved in a large number of crypto projects and now is focused on Cardano, one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. The work he has been doing is very positive for the crypto market, something that helped increase the level of technical improvements in the crypto space. Ethereum is also now trying to compete with other networks, including Cardano, which is allowing developers to offer even better solutions and products.\n\nSimilarly to what Lubin and Buterin did, Hoskinson invested his time rather than just money on Ethereum. Thus, because of him and his passion for crypto projects, we could now have a much more advanced network and cryptocurrency industry. 11\n\nCole is a freelance writer focusing on cryptocurrency and emerging technologies. Previous articles on Masternodes have been featured on leading crypto websites and quoted in Whitepapers.\n\nWant to buy Ethereum today?

Per the latest tweet from Whale Alert, 11,215 ETH were transferred from an unknown wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis latest ETH transaction is estimated to be worth around $34.35 million. It is a major move as it appears that the whale has shifted ETH in order to trigger a sell-off. Moreover, the timing of this sell-off is crucial as it comes amid the recent market crash.\n\nThe broader crypto market has been consolidating after last week\u2019s crash. The price of Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has crashed 16.68% over the last 30 days. This shows the intensity of this market dump, impacting major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) .\n\nWhile many are still expecting a price recovery from ETH, it appears that some traders are dumping their holdings. In the case of this Ethereum whale, they have almost $34.35 million in ETH. Since this is a major amount, it can further impact the market and push the ETH price to lower levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhales always play a crucial role on the digital asset market. The buying and selling from these traders leave short-term impacts on the price movements of a particular coin. In this case, the Ethereum price can absorb the toll of this sell-off. It may hinder the potential recovery of the coin after a recent downturn.\n\nETH price outlook\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum is trading around $3,072. While the price is up 0.52% in the last 24 hours, it has failed to recover from the previous losses. The recent bearish sentiment has not been good for bulls, causing uncertainty on the market."

        "content": "STAMFORD, Conn., July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments\u00ae, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager*, offering more than 20 crypto investment products, today announced that it has set a record date of July 18, 2024 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d) for the initial creation and distribution of shares of Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (the \u201cETH Trust\u201d) to shareholders of Grayscale Ethereum Trust (Ticker: ETHE) (\u201cETHE\u201d) (referred to as the \u201cInitial Distribution\u201d). Grayscale intends to list the ETH Trust on NYSE Arca, subject to required regulatory approvals, under the ticker symbol \u201cETH.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs part of the contemplated Initial Distribution, each holder of shares (the \u201cETHE Shares\u201d) of ETHE as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive shares (the \u201cETH Shares\u201d) of the ETH Trust, a Delaware statutory trust sponsored by Grayscale, as described in a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2024 and most recently amended on July 8, 2024 (the \u201cPreliminary Information Statement\u201d). ETHE will also file a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or after the Record Date.\n\nIn the Initial Distribution, ETHE will contribute 10% of the Ether that it holds as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date to the ETH Trust, and each holder of ETHE Shares as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive ETH Shares pro rata based on a 1:1 ratio, such that for each one (1) ETHE Share held by an ETHE shareholder as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date, such ETHE shareholder will be entitled to receive one (1) ETH Share on the Distribution Date, as described below and in the Preliminary Information Statement. ETHE shareholders will not need to pay any consideration, exchange or surrender existing ETHE Shares, or take any other action to receive ETH Shares.\n\nRecord Date July 18, 2024 Ratio of ETHE Shares: ETH\n\nShares 1:1 % of ETHE contributed to the\n\nETH Trust 10% Distribution Date Subject to conditions stated\n\nbelow\n\nImportantly, both the launch of the ETH Trust and the Initial Distribution of ETH Shares to ETHE shareholders are subject to regulatory review and customary conditions. The \u201cDistribution Date\u201d will be the first date following the Record Date on which the conditions to the Initial Distribution have been satisfied, including (i) the filing and effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form 8-A to register the ETH Shares under the Exchange Act, (ii) the effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-278878) under the Securities Act, and (iii) the ETH Shares having been approved for listing on NYSE Arca. The Distribution Date will be no sooner than July 19, 2024, and, as a result of such conditions not having been satisfied as of the date hereof, no assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nSubject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE (including with respect to the qualification of both ETHE and the ETH Trust as grantor trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares), it is expected that neither ETHE nor any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. Accordingly, it is expected that neither ETHE\u2019s contribution of Ether to the ETH Trust nor ETHE\u2019s distribution of shares in the ETH Trust to ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be reported to any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares (or to any intermediary holding ETHE Shares) as giving rise to income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or proceeds.\n\nFrom and after July 18, 2024 (the \u201cEx-Distribution Date\u201d), ETHE Shares will trade without the right to receive ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution. There is not expected to be a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d market for the ETH Shares prior to the Distribution Date. Following the Initial Distribution, ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on July 18, 2024 will automatically see both ETHE Shares and ETH Shares in their portfolios or investment accounts on the Distribution Date.\n\nThe Grayscale team will communicate additional updates, as applicable, including the anticipated Distribution Date, any material updates regarding pending regulatory approval and customary conditions, and the announcement of Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust\u2019s first day of trading on NYSE Arca.\n\n*By AUM as of 6/28/2024\n\nNO OFFER OR SOLICITATION\n\nThis communication is for informational purposes, solely in your capacity as a shareholder of ETHE, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. No shareholder approval of the Initial Distribution is required by applicable law, and we are not seeking ETHE shareholder approval.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain of the statements contained herein may be statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on Grayscale\u2019s views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.

As further discussed in the section of the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Initial Distribution,\u201d the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution are complex, subject to uncertainty in certain respects and may be affected by circumstances specific to a beneficial owner of ETHE Shares. Any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares who receives ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding ETHE Shares or ETH Shares, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares. Please refer to the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of the ETH Shares.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT\n\nA definitive information statement on Schedule 14C will be furnished to ETHE shareholders on or after the Record Date for the purpose of informing ETHE shareholders of the Initial Distribution, in substantial compliance with Regulation 14C of the Exchange Act.

An investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of total loss associated with an investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Ether, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the shares of each trust could lose all or substantially all of their value. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset. Digital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset. Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust relate directly to the value of the underlying digital asset, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.\n\nA registration statement related to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. An investment in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust cannot be made, nor money accepted, until the registration statement is effective. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust carefully before investing. A preliminary prospectus which contains information about Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust may be obtained by emailing info@grayscale.com. The information in the preliminary prospectus is not complete and may be changed. The final prospectus should be read carefully before investing, and when available may be obtained from the same source.

        "title": "News regarding Ethereum (ETH) ETFs: towards a new bull run? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "News regarding the approval of Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, which could trigger a new bull run in the cryptocurrency market, with the United States SEC playing a crucial role.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe SEC at the center of the wait for spot ETFs on Ethereum (ETH): latest news\n\nAs anticipated, Ethereum ETFs are considered a possible spark for a new bull run, but the approval of the US SEC is crucial.\n\nThe regulatory authorities, traders, and investors are eagerly awaiting the presentations of the form S-1 for the spot Ethereum ETFs, which are expected to be available by the weekend.\n\nToday, the entities that have applied for ETH ETFs, including BlackRock, 21Shares, Fidelity and Grayscale, will submit the S-1 forms to the SEC after making the requested changes.\n\nThe first half of 2024 was dominated by the issue of Spot ETFs on Bitcoin. Now, the attention has shifted to ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nNate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, tweeted:\n\n\u201cthe amendments to the ETF S-1 of the spot ETF should be made tomorrow\u2026 How quickly will the SEC be able to reverse course?\u201d\n\nGeraci emphasizes the importance of commissions, adding that the issuers might be ready to launch the products in the coming weeks.\n\nBitwise, an asset management company, has recently updated its S-1 registration with the SEC to list and trade shares of ETH ETFs.\n\nThe CIO of Bitwise, Matt Hougan, predicts that ETH ETFs will attract at least 15 billion dollars in net flows by 2025. Hougan, in particular, states the following:\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to know how much the exchange-traded product (ETP) of ether spot will attract in terms of net flows. My answer: 15 billion dollars in the first 18 months. It is not a random guess. It is what the data suggests.\u201d\n\nFocus on the price of Ethereum\n\nAt the moment, Ether has slightly recovered from last week\u2019s drop, trading at around $3,042. The price has increased by 0.7% in the last 24 hours, but remains 12.2% lower compared to seven days ago.\n\nThe recent history of Bitcoin shows how the approval of the Spot BTC ETF led to a 58% surge in just a few months. On January 10, the day of the approval of the Spot ETF on BTC, the price of Bitcoin was $46,105, rising to $73,097 in March.\n\nThe approval of the Spot ETF on Ethereum could bring the markets back into the green. Based on historical data, the approval of a Spot ETF on ETH could push the price of Ethereum above $4500, assuming a 50% increase.\n\nIn any case, the 1-hour chart of ETH/USD showed a recent bullish trend that started at $2,803, highlighted by a significant bull candle that reached $3,096 before a slight retracement.\n\nA bullish engulfing pattern indicates a possible continuation of this trend, although the recent declines suggest a consolidation phase. The volume analysis reveals a peak during the bullish movement.\n\nHowever, the decreasing volume during the consolidation suggests that, if the volume were to increase again, the bull trend could resume.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart of ETH/USD, Ethereum has confirmed a downward trend recently bouncing from the low of $2,803. A strong increase on July 8 indicates a significant bull movement, potentially suggesting a short-term reversal.\n\nHowever, the recent candles with small bodies and reduced shadows also highlight a certain degree of uncertainty in the market. The volume analysis supports this bullish movement with higher volume, indicating a genuine buying interest.\n\nThe daily chart shows a clear downward trend in the last month, with ETH falling from around $3,889 to a low of $2,803.\n\nContradictory forecasts: analysts divided on the future of Ethereum ETFs\n\nWith the imminent launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Ethereum, the financial community is divided on the possible consequences of this debut.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs have led to a significant increase in the price of BTC, analysts are not sure that Ethereum will follow the same path.\n\nRyan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, expressed skepticism regarding the impact of ETFs on Ethereum compared to those on Bitcoin, stating:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and Ethereum are two assets with different fundamentals and a distinct market appeal. When ETFs on Ethereum start trading, ETH will capture about 2.5% of its market capitalization. If this bull scenario were to materialize, the spot ETF on Ethereum could see $11.55 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Galaxy Research predicts that inflows into Ethereum ETFs will be slower compared to those into Bitcoin.\n\nCharles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy, has estimated that \u201cEthereum spot ETPs will see about 5 billion dollars in net inflows in the first five months of trading.\u201d\n\nDespite the moderate expectations of some, other observers are very optimistic about the future of Ethereum post-launch of the ETFs. Steno Research predicts that ETH could reach at least $6,500 by the end of the year, thus surpassing the previous all-time high of ETH by 33%.\n\nStandard Chartered offers an even more bullish forecast. Specifically suggesting that the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum could lead to up to 45 billion dollars of inflows within the first 12 months. Potentially pushing the price of ETH to $8,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares this optimism. Jupiter Zheng, partner of the Liquid Fund of HashKey Capital, predicts a short and modest initial rally followed by a strong \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nEvent in which investors might sell their positions after the launch of the ETFs, leading to a price correction."

        "content": "Rome Protocol has secured $9 million in a funding round to integrate modular services from the Solana network into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol stated that its funding round included several notable investors like Hack VC, Polygon Ventures, HashKey, Portal Ventures, Bankless Ventures, Robot VC, LBank, Anagram, TRGC and Perridon Ventures.\n\nThe round also included notable angel investors, such as Solana\u2019s Anatoly Yakovenko and Austin Federa. Other investors included Nick White, Santiago Santos, Comfy Capital, and Jason Yanowitz.\n\nRome protocol\n\nAccording to the protocol, the platform would be designed to integrate Solana\u2019s capabilities into services on Ethereum.\n\nThis approach will allow Ethereum-based rollups to use Solana as a shared sequencer, thereby confirming transactions faster, enhancing privacy and scalability, and reducing blockchain costs.\n\nRome Protocol pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s isolated sequencer feature raises concerns about liquidity fragmentation, weakest link security, and interoperability on the network\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap. Due to this, many rollups rely on centralized sequencers, which risk censorship, limited visibility, and critical downtime.\n\nTo solve these challenges, Rome Protocol will enable rollups to use Solana\u2019s existing validators as shared sequencers for transactions, state maintenance, and transaction publication. This approach aims to turn Solana\u2019s 50,000+ transactions-per-second (TPS) capacity into infrastructure for Ethereum rollups. It also ensures atomic composability with transactions confirmed on Solana before submission to Ethereum.\n\nRome Protocol will allow developers to focus on their applications rather than building new cross-chain interoperability infrastructure. Ethereum developers canuseg familiar technologies like OP Stack for execution and state maintenance.\n\nShared sequencer architecture\n\nThe proposed shared sequencer architecture includes the Rhea, Remus, Romulus, and Hercules features.\n\nRhea will ensure fair sequencing and submission to Solana, while Remus will enhance atomic transactions across rollups.\n\nAccording to the protocol:\n\n\u201cRhea enables fair and blind sequencing of rollup transactions. All transactions are treated equally and processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Remus enables atomic execution of cross-rollup transactions as a premium service.\u201d\n\nRomulus will facilitate atomic transactions across Solana and various rollups, while Hercules will accept ordered transaction blocks from Solana.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Most short-term traders experienced losses and would be eager to exit their positions in case of a price bounce.\n\nThe $2.8k level is likely to be revisited as support, but it is unclear if the bulls can hold on thereafter.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] flow from exchanges took a turn recently and strayed deep into negative territory in June, but this has not turned out the way investors were hoping it would. Instead of appreciating, the prices continued to drop.\n\nBearish sentiment was prevalent in the market, as seen by the price drop below $3k. This psychological level is likely to be contested hard, but the selling pressure behind ETH has been unforgiving.\n\nWhale accumulation did little to halt bearish trend\n\nIn June, the 7-day simple moving average of the exchange netflow dropped deep into the negative territory. It stayed negative till the 28th of June.\n\nIn the past ten days, it has crept into the positive territory, accompanying the sharp price drop seen in July.\n\nThe negative netflow indicated Ethereum tokens moving outside of exchanges and signaled accumulation. Despite this, the prices continued to slump.\n\nInvestors would be hoping that this is the final jolt of pain before the trend turns bullish.\n\nThe supply distribution analysis showed that the 10k-1M ETH holders have increased since mid-May. The 1k-10k ETH wallets moved higher toward the end of June but have fallen lower again over the past week.\n\nTogether it indicated the large whales with 10k+ ETH accumulated, but most other wallets have reduced their holdings.\n\nWhere can traders expect prices to find relief?\n\nAMBCrypto noted from the in/out of the money data that the $2850-$3000 zone was a strong support zone due to the number of holders.\n\nOver the past three days, the price decline to $2.8k saw a bounce to $3k but it is unclear if the buyers can withstand the sellers\u2019 onslaught any longer.\n\nAround the current market price, 60.25% of the addresses were out of the money, which meant that price bounces would likely be sold as holders look to exit at break-even. This can add to the downward pressure.\n\nThe MobChart data outlined large limit orders on the order books for Ethereum. The $3100 and $3170 levels have $3.7 million worth of limit orders. Above them, the $3220-$3250 region and $3500 have just over $5 million, marking these as strong short-term resistances.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe $2800 level has just under $10 million worth of buy orders and might be tested once again. Overall, the metrics show that in the short term, bears were in control.\n\nThe exchange outflow in June did little to halt the price decline, and the best bulls can hope for now is a period of consolidation around the psychological $3k support."

Meanwhile, ETH long-term holders are gradually returning to the market after years on the sidelines.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum ETF Issuers files updated S-1s\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have all filed their amended spot ETH ETF S-1 registration statements with the SEC on Monday following the regulator's July 8 deadline for issuers to return their amended drafts.\n\nSeveral top analysts expect the SEC to approve the drafts within the next two weeks as issuers have already completed most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe SEC approved issuers' spot ETH ETF 19b-4 applications on May 23 but also need to greenlight their S-1s before they can begin trading.\n\nDespite the positives from a potential ETH ETF launch, on-chain data shows that a few ETH long-term holders (LTHs) are slowly returning to the market. According to Lookonchain, Golem, which raised 820,000 ETH for $10.12 per coin during its ICO \u2014 has moved 26K ETH worth $78 million to an address. In turn, the address sends the ETH to exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nSpot On Chain also reported that a whale who had held onto its tokens for about 1.5 years moved 7,240 ETH worth $21.4 million to Kraken exchange at an estimated profit of $12.8 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Immuenfi and the Ethereum Foundation announced the launch of Attackathon, a time-boxed audit competition aimed at improving Ethereum's security. Attackathon would also feature an educational program to boost security researchers' understanding of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has seeded the event's reward pool with an initial $500,000 while calling on sponsors in its ecosystem to contribute.\n\nETH technical analysis: Is this the beginning of a recovery?\n\nEthereum traded around $2,975 on Monday, down about 0.3% on the day. ETH's slight increase earlier in the day saw shorts suffer over $49 million in liquidations, with long liquidations slowing down to around $44 million, according to Coinglass data.\n\nETH retested the support around $2,800 to $2,852 again on Sunday but failed to sustain an extended move below it for the second consecutive time as prices quickly bounced above the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nAs mentioned in a previous analysis, this level has proven to be a crucial support during downtrends experienced in April and May. Hence, ETH will likely continue to face strong buying demand around the $2,852 support level.\n\nThe chart also shows ETH posted a double bottom, a pattern that signifies potential seller exhaustion due to failure to break below a key support level \u2014 $2,800 to $2,852 in this case.\n\nETH could repeat the pattern it followed between April 12 and May 21, where it crashed from $3,550 before sustaining a horizontal movement for a while and then spiked following the SEC's U-turn to approve 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. If ETH repeats such a move, it may consolidate for a few days and then see a potential spike when spot ETH ETFs begin trading on exchanges.\n\nETH Liquidation Heatmap\n\nIn the short term, ETH could briefly move to the $3,104 price level, where there is a liquidation wall of $2.94 million."

        "content": "Currently, the state of the crypto market can be expressed as extremely bearish, with a notably negative impact on the Ethereum token ecosystem. This sentiment is captured by the Fear and Greed Index, which hit a low of 20, an extreme level of fear prevailing in the market.\n\nThe volatility surrounding virtual assets has instilled fear among investors, resulting in a rush to exit and, consequently, a fall in price.\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum tokens have dipped from the \u2018fear factor,\u2019 but RCO Finance (RCOF) offers safety for the Ethereum ecosystem. Let\u2019s examine past episodes of extreme market fear and how Ethereum tokens persevered through them.\n\nExtreme Fear Grips the Crypto Market\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a preferable sentiment tracker, has fallen to levels last observed in the second half of 2022. It currently stands at 26, pointing more towards a side of extreme fear in the market rather than extreme greed.\n\nThis shift in sentiment stems from several factors: The future decline of Mt. Gox, Germany\u2019s decision to sell some of the Bitcoins, and macroeconomic factors. This has caused major crypto prices to drop, and Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently been worst affected.\n\nIt is important to note that panic has been witnessed in the crypto market before, indicating that previous events can help understand the current situation.\n\nPrevious Instances of Extreme Fear in the Crypto Market\n\nExtreme fear has occurred in the crypto market at some point in the past, and such events reveal possible tendencies regarding how the market will respond this time.\n\nThe 2022 Crypto Winter\n\nThe most recent extreme fear of cryptocurrencies was experienced during the 2022 crypto winter. \u201cInfluenced by factors such as regulatory risk, macroeconomic issues, and the failure of projects such as Terra/LUNA, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to levels not observed since the bear market 2018.\n\nDuring this period, the ether price dropped, and almost all the newly developed Ethereum altcoins faced a decline in value. However, the market emerged, so the Ethereum community became active and started using Ethereum and its altcoins.\n\nThe 2018 Bitcoin Crash\n\nOne other major example of the extreme rear in the crypto market is the 2018 Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin and other forms of crypto surged in late 2017, and Bitcoin rose almost to $20000.\n\nBut it was succeeded by sharp declines, with Bitcoin\u2019s value falling to less than 20% of its preceding value. During this period, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reached lower lows as demands for digital currency plummeted due to a bearish trend.\n\nHowever, good sense prevailed, and the market finally calmed down as the crypto ecosystem grew and developed further.\n\nNavigating the Uncertain Landscape\n\nAs the broader cryptocurrency landscape grapples with uncertainty, a glimmer of hope emerges from the past \u2013 the last time such fear gripped the market, the Ethereum altcoin sector staged a remarkable rebound. As the crypto world shifts, one project, RCO Finance (RCOF), is ready to capitalize on this shift in sentiment.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): \u201cA Beacon of Hope\u201d\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum blockchain, the RCOF token benefits from the network\u2019s growing adoption and strong infrastructure. As the market stabilizes, RCOF offers a promising opportunity for investors seeking stability in Ethereum tokens.

        "content": "Ethereum ICO participants moved a significant amount of their holdings.\n\nWhale interest and retail interest in ETH declined.\n\nDue to the rising bearish sentiment in the market, the price of Ethereum [ETH] declined significantly, dipping below the $3,000 mark.\n\nInitial coin offering\n\nIn November 2016, the Golem project conducted a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), raising a significant sum of 820,000 ETH.\n\nOver a 37-day period, Golem transferred 36,000 ETH to major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance [BNB], Coinbase, and Bitfinex. This transfer amounted to roughly $115 million.\n\nDespite these transfers, Golem still held a substantial amount of ETH, with a press time balance of 231,400 ETH, valued at approximately $656 million.\n\nThis indicates that Golem maintained a strong financial position and may be strategically planning for future developments.\n\nWhen a large amount of cryptocurrency hits exchanges, it creates sell pressure. This means that more ETH is available for purchase, potentially exceeding current demand and driving the price down.\n\nMoreover, a large holder like Golem moving their ETH to exchanges can trigger speculation in the market.\n\nInvestors might interpret this as a sign that Golem believes the price of ETH is about to fall, leading them to sell their own holdings to avoid losses. This can create a snowball effect, pushing the price further down.\n\nThe sell-off of these tokens wasn\u2019t an isolated event. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data indicated that large addresses were losing interest in ETH and their holdings had declined.\n\nCoupled with that, retail interest had also decreased over the last few days. This indicated a potential lack of overall demand across different investor segments, further increasing sell pressure.\n\nNew developments on the Ethereum network\n\nDespite these factors, development on the Ethereum network continued to soar.\n\nEthereum developers recently held an online meeting to discuss the Pectra upgrade, a major update for the Ethereum blockchain. The upcoming Pectra Devnet 1 launch is on hold waiting for other software updates.\n\nResearchers presented ways to improve data collection on the software diversity used to run Ethereum. Additionally, they debated a new feature to prevent software bugs from disrupting the network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe meeting also included discussions about potentially including further changes in the future, but no final decisions were made.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,914.63 and its price had fallen by 3.19% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Must Buy Ethereum Meme Coins Before the ETH ETF Approval - CoinGape",
        "content": "The recent hype around the potential ETH ETF is causing investors to scout for Ethereum meme coins to invest in for maximum profits. Ethereum price prediction shows the ETF news is not yet priced in. Furthermore, ETH seems to be following Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory following its ETF approval. BTC\u2019s price retraced after its ETF news before surging to $73,000.\n\nEthereum is a huge network and meme coins are famous for being the best runners during impactful market news. However, not all meme coins are winners. Here are three meme coins to buy before the Ethereum ETF gets approval in July.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Ethereum Meme Coins \u2013 Turbo (TURBO)\n\nTurbo is the first AI-scripted meme coin in the history of cryptocurrencies. The token, which was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, was created using only a budget of $69 and following guidance from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The community came in later and crowd-funded the initial liquidity required to launch the project, as the previous $69 was not enough. Turbo is therefore a community token, riding both the meme coin and artificial intelligence (AI) narratives in this bull run.\n\nThe price of TURBO today is $0.003809, a 6.7% drop in the last 24 hours following Bitcoin\u2019s sell-off. Turbo did well following its launch, hitting an all-time high of $0.009632 two months ago before retracing. TURBO\u2019s market cap is currently at $294 million\u2014enough to surge 10\u201320X and transform investors\u2019 portfolios. TURBO\u2019s 24-hour trading volume is down 16.2% as market participants refrain from trading during these market conditions.\n\nThe AI revolution in the crypto industry is picking up fast, and more so within the Ethereum meme coin ecosystem. Turbo and a few other AI based meme coins may be the first runners if Ethereum gets a win with ETF approval. The current price retrace sets TURBO in an optimal buy-in position.\n\n2. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe is among the top list of the giant Ethereum meme coins that started as a joke, before quickly garnering popularity. The meme coin was inspired by Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. Furie is also the creator of several other memes on the Ethereum chain, namely, Landwolf, Andy (ETH), Bird-Dog, and Fofar. By extension, these meme coins have the potential to soar along with PEPE.\n\nThe price of PEPE today is $0.000009162, which represents a drop of 2.1% in the last 24 hours. Sitting at a market cap of $3.8 billion, Pepe has fallen by over 50% from its all-time high market cap. This is just an indicator of how volatile meme coins can be.\n\nDespite this fall in price and valuation, the number of Pepe holders is up over 5% in the last month and $0.01% in the last 24 hours per Santiment.\n\nAdditionally, the 24-hour trading volume for Pepe is down by 32% which shows there has been a decrease in market activity.\n\nPEPE price showcased incredible price performance following the announcement of the approval of Ethereum ETF 19-4b forms. Even though this approval was not the real thing since it could be contested, Pepe\u2019s price still soared and hit an all-time high price of $0.00001665 on May 28 before beginning to retrace.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki is one of the older meme coins that came out right after Shiba Inu\u2019s rise to popularity. Having been around for three years, Floki\u2019s creation drew inspiration from Elon Musk but has since transformed from just a meme coin to a recognizable brand all over the world. Floki has over 480,000 holders and boasts multiple partnerships with sports clubs, DeFi protocols, and popular blockchain companies.\n\nFloki price is trading at $0.000149, a 2.4% price surge in the last 24 hours. The meme coin has had three major peaks in its lifetime, one in November 2021 and the other two within the March-June period. The price action of Floki formed a potential double top, which may result in a further drop in price to $0.00003500. If the current support holds, Floki may enter into a consolidation zone between $0.00033 and $0.00015.\n\nBeing an ERC20 meme coin with a large holder base, Floki may be one of the top Ethereum meme coins to run hard in the case of an ETF approval.\n\n4. Apu Apustaja\n\nApu Apustaja is a recent meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. It gained popularity on the anonymous chatting platform 4Chan and quickly rose to prominence, hitting a $28 million market cap. However, the developer began dumping their holdings and eventually abandoned the project near its all-time lows. In response, the community took over the project, driving it to a new all-time high market cap of $311 million on May 21.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Apu hovered around $0.000494, marking a 16.6% increase in the last 24 hours. Apu is one of the few tokens to rebound with double-digit gains following Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. The meme coin found support around the $100 million mark and has tested this level twice in the past three weeks.\n\nCommunity takeovers (CTOs) are becoming a prominent narrative in this bull cycle, and Apu exemplifies this trend through its price history. With the potential for further market recovery, Apu shows promise for future price surges, especially if the Ethereum ETF receives approval.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe potential Ethereum ETF approval anticipation fuels interest in ERC20 meme tokens like Pepe, Floki, and Turbo. These Ethereum meme coins command attention for their ability to potentially return high rewards in a short period of time. As we approach the expected decision day, price volatility in the crypto market may increase.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Whe will ETH ETF be approved? According to speculations, an ETH ETF approval is expected around mid-June. 2. Can Ethereum reach 6,000? Some analysts say that Ethereum can pump to 6,600 after ETH ETF approval. 3. When was a Bitcoin ETF approved? The first Bitcoin ETF was approved on January 10, 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Buterin\u2019s transfer amid market downturn sparked speculation on ETH\u2019s sentiment impact.\n\nETH held steady with moderate losses, contrasting sharply with other cryptocurrencies\u2019 declines.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin sparked intense speculation within the crypto community with a significant transfer.\n\nMany investors assumed that Buterin was making a strategic move or possibly selling some of his holdings.\n\nClearing the air around Buterin\u2019s move\n\nHowever, things got clear when Wu Blockchain shared more details.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin\u2019s move coincided with a broader market downturn, as the global crypto market cap hit $2.05 trillion at press time, down 2.67% in the past day.\n\nNow, whether Buterin\u2019s move will shift ETH\u2019s market sentiment from bearish to bullish remains to be seen.\n\nAs of the latest update, the largest altcoin was trading at $2,946.55, reflecting a 1.98% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis decline is relatively moderate compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which dropped by 2.40%. Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] experienced declines exceeding 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nBut despite the recent market decline, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis using IntoTheBlock data indicated that buying pressure continued to exceed selling pressure among bulls and bears.\n\nIs crypto adoption on the rise?\n\nNeedless to say, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight. Of late, the king coin has attracted attention from Wall Street, major institutions, and the political sphere.\n\nWhile this surge is often seen as a step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, it primarily revolves around Bitcoin rather than the broader crypto market.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Buterin\u2019s recent actions could boost ETH adoption, especially considering investors\u2019 losing interest in ETH fueled by the delay in ETH ETF approval by the SEC.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s financial influence\n\nAccording to a recent report published by on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Vitalik Buterin remains the largest individual holder of ETH.\n\nHis net worth has climbed from $552.86 million at the start of 2024 to $834.66 million.\n\nHis holdings of approximately 245,279 ETH fluctuate with Ethereum\u2019s market prices.\n\nDuring the 2021 bull market peak, ETH\u2019s value propelled his net worth above $2 billion, though subsequent downturns in 2022 reduced it by about 75%.\n\nDespite market volatility, Buterin\u2019s strategic investments and pivotal role in Ethereum continue to solidify his financial influence."

        "content": "Ethereum price increased by 5.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $3,070 during European business hours. The increase comes against the backdrop of Germany\u2019s continued Bitcoin sell-off. BTC also saw an increase of 3.4% over the last 24 hours, and is trading at $57,189.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price To Rebound If This Happens\n\nETH price broke below a falling channel on Thursday last week, a non-bullish move on its part. Ethereum price plummeted to a low of $2,811 as Bitcoin continued to bleed. However, ETH price found another support below around $2,815, using it as a cushion against the fall. The price of ETH consolidated around this local bottom over the weekend before showing some renewed strength on Monday going into Tuesday.\n\nThe Ethereum price action has revisited the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is currently acting as a resistance. If Ethereum breaks above this key indicator, market sentiment may turn to bullish.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the asset may likely break above the 200-day SMA but succumb to the overhead 50-day SMA, falling into a consolidation zone between $3,371 and $2,811. This will also put it back into the falling channel.\n\nIf ETH bulls can exert more power, they can break above the falling channel and the potential consolidation zone to hit the previous yearly high of $3,967. On the flip side, if the bears prevail, ETH price may break below the $2,815 support and drop lower to $2,200, with temporary cushioning around $2,490.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price hit a low of $53,550 in the recent sell-off (which may still be in play) before bouncing back, as data from CoinGecko shows. The asset seems to have found support around the $55,000 level, though history suggests this may not hold for long. If BTC continues to fall, the next major support is around $50,000, and below that, $46,000.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price Rising?\n\nThe markets today have spots of green, with Ethereum among the biggest gainers. VanEck was the last to file an S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF yesterday, indicating a high likelihood of ETF approval soon. As of July 9, 2024, all spot Ethereum ETF applicants have filed their updated S-1s.\n\nMeanwhile, while Germany continues to sell Bitcoin indiscriminately, ETFs saw $384 million in inflows last week, showing that investors are using the fear in the market to get exposed to BTC at discounted prices.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement shows signs of a potential reversal, but uncertainty lingers as market participants debate whether this uptick represents a genuine trend change or a deceptive bull trap. Close monitoring of key indicators may provide clarity on whether ETH can sustain its momentum relative to BTC in the coming days.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Which firms have filed for Spot Ethereum ETF? Grayscale, VanEck Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Bitwise have all submitted filings for a spot Ethereum ETF. 2. When will Spot Ethereum ETF launch? Speculations say that Ethereum ETF will launch mid-July. 3. Can Ethereum reach $5000? According to analysis, after the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, ETH could rally to $6,600.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana and Ripple: The biggest crypto news of the past week - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jul 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nBetween groundbreaking announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a limitless territory of innovation and a battlefield of regulatory and economic conflicts. Here is a summary of the most notable news of the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nMt. Gox: The creditors\u2019 reimbursement after ten years of waiting\n\nAfter a decade of legal battles and complex procedures, the former bitcoin exchange platform Mt. Gox is finally starting to reimburse its creditors. Founded in 2010 and handling up to 70% of global bitcoin transactions at its peak, Mt. Gox went bankrupt in 2014 following the loss of 850,000 BTC due to a security breach. Reimbursements are made in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) via designated exchanges, with 47,288 BTC already transferred for reimbursements. Creditors must confirm the validity of their accounts to receive their compensation. However, this news has had disastrous repercussions on the crypto market, leading to massive liquidations reaching $675 million in 24 hours, primarily due to the sale of the newly reimbursed BTC, which could intensify sales and put pressure on the price of bitcoin.\n\nEthereum introduces EIP-7732 and shifts into high gear\n\nEthereum developers have introduced EIP-7732, a proposal aimed at revolutionizing block validation on the blockchain by separating the process into two parts: consensus and execution. This initiative, supported by Vitalik Buterin, proposes the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS), which divides block creation between a consensus proposer and an execution proposer, with the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC) overseeing the timings. The goal is to reduce the computational load of validators, thus increasing the efficiency and speed of transactions, now confirmed between five and twenty seconds. This advancement could strengthen Ethereum\u2019s competitive position, requiring a complete network upgrade and community approval.\n\nPanic in the crypto market: Bitcoin and Ethereum collapse\n\nA shockwave hit the crypto world last week, with a sudden drop of 8% for Bitcoin and over 10% for Ethereum in a few hours. This dramatic plunge led to massive liquidations of $580 million, notably on heavily leveraged bullish positions that couldn\u2019t withstand the price drop. The massive fund movement from Mt. Gox, transferring over $2.7 billion in bitcoins to a new address in anticipation of reimbursements, intensified the selling pressure. Meanwhile, the liquidation of part of Germany\u2019s bitcoin holdings added to the uncertainty. Traders, already nervous about macroeconomic uncertainties and upcoming US presidential elections, reacted by selling off their positions massively, leading to significant losses. This increased volatility plunged the fear and greed index to alarming levels, leaving the market\u2019s short-term outlook uncertain.\n\nSolana sets new records with its memecoins\n\nThe memecoin universe on Solana is experiencing unprecedented excitement and has recorded performances exceeding all expectations. After a rocky start, Solana has managed to establish itself as a key player in the meme crypto sector, surpassing Ethereum by 800% since the beginning of the year. This success is attributed to Solana\u2019s ability to attract talented developers and create an environment conducive to the growth of memecoins. Meme cryptos like Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Billy (BILLY) have contributed to this rise, with Dogwifhat soaring by 12.34% in 24 hours and Billy seeing its market cap explode by 97% to reach $117 million. The Solana community, technological innovations, as well as the support of celebrities and investors have been key factors in this dynamic. Solana now dominates the memecoin sector with a market share of 9.64%.\n\nRipple teams up with crypto exchange Binance to counter the SEC\n\nRipple is taking advantage of a recent court decision in favor of Binance to strengthen its defense in its litigation against the SEC. On June 28, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia partially dismissed the SEC\u2019s accusations that certain cryptocurrency sales by Binance were equivalent to securities sales. Ripple quickly seized this opportunity, noting that the court adopted logic similar to that of Judge Analisa Torres in its case against the SEC in July 2023. Judge Amy Berman Jackson distinguished secondary market sales from institutional sales, criticizing the SEC\u2019s approach of regulating the bitcoin and alternative crypto industry through litigation without providing regulatory clarity. Ripple sees these observations as supporting its argument on the necessity of clarifying the legal status of cryptos, questioning the severity of the penalties demanded by the SEC.\n\nDiscover our newsletter This link uses an affiliate program.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Justin Sun Announces Gas-Free Stablecoin Solution for Tron and Ethereum\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has announced his team's development of a gas-free stablecoin solution. In a post on July 6, Sun explained that this new stablecoin would allow transfers without requiring any gas tokens, as the fees would be covered by the stablecoins themselves. However, he did not provide specific details on how this mechanism would function.\n\nSun plans to integrate this innovative solution on the Tron blockchain by the fourth quarter of this year, and will \u201clater support Ethereum and all EVM-compatible public chains.\u201d Sun believes that this gas-free stablecoin could revolutionize the way companies offer stablecoin services, significantly boosting blockchain adoption. \"I believe that similar services will greatly facilitate large companies in deploying stablecoin services on the blockchain, elevating blockchain mass adoption to a new level,\" Sun posted.\n\nCurrently, Tron leads the market in peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers, consistently processing two to three times the volume of Ethereum, according to blockchain analytics firm Artemis. Tron hosts over $50 billion of Tether's $112 billion in value issued across multiple blockchains, based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nThis new solution could position Tron as a competitor to PayPal's PYUSD, which offers certain U.S.-based users the ability to make free cross-border payments. Additionally, Circle's USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum layer-2 Base via Coinbase Wallet also allows for free transfers, highlighting a growing trend towards cost-free stablecoin transactions."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF approaches: Comparing ETH and BTC\u2019s states pre-launch - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs were gaining much popularity in the United States.\n\nETH was down by 12% last week, but a few market indicators hinted at a trend reversal.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been facing multiple price corrections over the past month. This happened at a time when its much-awaited ETH ETFs launch was drawing in.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s going on with ETH to find out whether its launch would benefit the king of altcoins and allow it to outshine Bitcoin [BTC] in the coming days.\n\nEthereum ETF hype isn\u2019t enough?\n\nInvestors and the crypto market as a whole have been waiting patiently for the launch of ETH ETFs. As per the latest data, the possible launch of Ethereum ETFs can be expected on the 15th of July.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Google Trends\u2019 data showed that the popularity of Ethereum ETFs has been consistent throughout the last 30 days in the United States, reflecting the hype around them.\n\nAlthough the launch date was getting closer and the market seemed excited, Ethereum continued to struggle to raise its price.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 125 in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $3,045.32 with a market capitalization of over $366 million.\n\nA possible reason behind this bearish price movement could be the lack of confidence in ETH among investors.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Weighted Sentiment moved southward substantially last week. This clearly meant that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF\n\nSince ETH remained bearish despite the launch getting closer, AMBCrypto planned to compare both Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s states ahead of their ETF launches.\n\nOur analysis revealed that BTC\u2019s price started to gain bullish momentum way before its ETF launch date.\n\nTo be precise, BTC\u2019s price started to move in November 2023 and peaked during the BTC ETF launch on January 10, 2024. However, soon after the launch, BTC\u2019s price started to decline.\n\nOn this front, Bitcoin was clearly dominating Ethereum. However, to see whether ETH was planning something bullish a week ahead of the ETF launch, we then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nWe found that Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick after touching the oversold zone.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAdditionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar increasing trend. This indicated that ETH might turn bullish in the coming days.\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved southward. The MACD also displayed a bearish advantage in the market."

        "title": "Solana Outperforms Ethereum Amid $441M Money Inflow Into Crypto - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a remarkable shift, Solana has overtaken Ethereum, attracting significant investment amid a $441 million inflow into the crypto market. With Solana pulling in over $16 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s $10 million, the dynamics of digital asset investments are seeing notable changes.\n\nNotably, this development signals a growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies as investors seek new opportunities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Outshines With Robust Weekly Inflow\n\nSolana\u2019s recent performance has caught the attention of investors, as highlighted in a report by CoinShares. Digital asset investment products saw substantial inflows totaling $441 million, with recent price dips viewed as buying opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, the inflows were primarily driven by the U.S., contributing $384 million, while other significant contributions came from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada. According to the report, Bitcoin led the inflows with $398 million, but for the first time, it accounted for just 90% of the total, indicating a broader interest in top altcoins.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana emerged as the standout altcoin, attracting $16 million last week and bringing its year-to-date inflows to $57 million. This makes Solana the top-performing altcoin in terms of investment flows, surpassing Ethereum, which saw $10 million in inflows but has experienced net outflows year-to-date.\n\nHowever, blockchain equities did not share this positive sentiment, facing an additional $8 million in outflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $556 million. The report suggests that recent selling pressures from the German government\u2019s Bitcoin dump have impacted the market, but savvy investors are leveraging these events as opportunities to invest in digital assets.\n\nBesides, looming concerns over Mt. Gox repayments have also weighed on the broader crypto market sentiment lately.\n\nAlso Read: Matrixport Reveals Ethereum ETF Launch Timeline, Bernstein Targets ETH To $6,600\n\nPotential Reasons Behind The Robust Performance\n\nThe question remains: why is Solana outperforming Ethereum? Several factors contribute to this trend. One significant reason appears to be the ongoing discussions about a potential Solana ETF in the US.\n\nVanEck was the first U.S. firm to file for a Solana ETF with the SEC, which may have fueled optimism among investors, driving robust inflows into the asset.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s performance in the broader altcoin market has been notable. As investors diversify their portfolios beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana\u2019s technological advancements and growing ecosystem have made it an attractive option.\n\nThe network\u2019s scalability, lower transaction costs, and rapid transaction speeds position it as a strong competitor in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, regional investment patterns highlight a global interest in Solana.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains a dominant player, substantial investments from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada underscore Solana\u2019s appeal across different markets. This diverse investment base further strengthens its position as a leading altcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC delaying the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF approval might have forced some investors to shift their focus toward other low-priced altcoins.\n\nAlso Read: Binance To Delist All Spot Pairs Of These Major Crypto\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "title": "Zero fee for stablecoin on Tron and Ethereum? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "On Saturday, the founder of the crypto project Tron, Justin Sun, stated that they are working on a solution to eliminate the fees on stablecoins, possibly even on the Ethereum network.\n\nOur team is developing a new solution that enables gas-free stablecoin transfers. In other words, transfers can be made without paying any gas tokens, with the fees being entirely covered by the stablecoins themselves. \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) July 6, 2024\n\nIt would be a new solution that allows stablecoin transfers without gas, so that transfers can be made without paying fees, which would be entirely covered by the stablecoin themselves.\n\nAccording to Sun, this solution will be implemented first on the Tron blockchain, but will subsequently also support Ethereum and all public chains compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and will greatly facilitate large companies that want to implement services based on stablecoin, thus bringing the mass adoption of blockchain to a new level.\n\nThe solution: zero fee for stablecoin exchanges on Ethereum and Tron\n\nThe details of this solution have not yet been disclosed, except for the fact that the Tron development team plans to launch this service in the fourth quarter of the current year.\n\nWhat is known is that it is a solution that will be applied to on-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions, that is, those without intermediaries, and that it will require the fees to be paid neither by the sender nor the receiver.\n\nIt is therefore not an abolition of the fees, also because the block validators must still have an incentive to continue working on validation, but a change regarding who pays them.\n\nSince it is a solution specifically designed for stablecoin, it is possible that it also directly involves the issuers of the stablecoin, even though for example Tether has not said anything about it so far.\n\nTron and USDT\n\nTron is now by far the most used chain in the world for transactions of the main stablecoin, USDT by Tether.\n\nAccording to the data from Artemis, it dominates not only in terms of the number of transactions but also in volumes.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 P2P Transfers\n\n\n\nTRON leads in P2P transfers.\n\n\n\nWe classify P2P transfers as transfers going from an EOA to EOA\n\n\n\nTRON consistently has 2-3x as much P2P transfer volume as Ethereum, indicating TRON is facilitating more payments and money transfers, compared to DeFi activity. pic.twitter.com/48n60qLRO2 \u2014 Artemis (@artemis__xyz) June 27, 2024\n\nIn particular, starting from the beginning of 2023, it has surpassed Ethereum and has not been reached again.\n\nIt is an average daily volume that in recent months has exceeded 10 billion dollars, with peaks even over 15.\n\nHowever, regarding transactions in USDT on Ethereum, the average daily volume often remains below 8 billion, although with peaks at almost 10, while in 2022 it had also abundantly surpassed this last threshold.\n\nThe chart clearly shows how starting from 2023 the trading volumes of USDT on Ethereum have decreased just as those on Tron were increasing.\n\nThe reason is quickly explained: in the face of an average transaction fee of about $0.175 on Tron, on Ethereum it rises above $1.3, which is almost ten times as much.\n\nThe competitors\n\nNote that on Solana and TON the average fee drops even below $0.05.\n\nIn particular, transactions on TON are experiencing strong growth, especially since Telegram is heavily promoting the use of \u201cits\u201d blockchain.\n\nIt is possible that the idea of the Tron team to develop an even more economical solution, in terms of fees, has only recently emerged precisely thanks to the competition from TON and Solana.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the largest use of Tron today is USDT transactions, so if these were to move to other chains, Tron would lose many users and a lot of traffic.\n\nGiven that Solana and TON allow transactions with much lower fees, a drastic solution was needed to keep Tron competitive. Also, the main reason for using Tron instead of Ethereum is precisely the much lower fees. Therefore, from this point of view, Solana and TON seriously risk becoming strong competitors of Tron if the fees on Tron remain at current levels.\n\nTether and the news of zero fees on stablecoins on Ethereum and Tron\n\nAlthough Tether has not yet made anything official regarding this initiative by Tron, its CEO Paolo Ardoino wrote on Saturday that changes are coming.\n\nHe was referring to the use of USDT for making payments, and in particular to a solution developed by the Celo development team.\n\nUSDT in fact is not present only on Tron, Ethereum, Solana, and TON, but also on Omni (a sidechain of Bitcoin) and on other chains, including Avalanche, Near, Cosmos, Tezos, and others, including Celo.\n\nThe solution developed by Celo allows for payments in cryptocurrency (USDT) using a card.\n\nCrypto Payments Going Mainstream\u2728\n\nYou can seamlessly pay with USDT on Celo using Ammer Pay. It's as simple as tapping your card\ud83d\udcb3\n\n\n\nExperience the future of payments today with @Celo @Tether_to @AmmerWallet\n\n\n\nP.S. Want to learn how to add USDT on Celo to your Ammer Wallet? Check\u2026 pic.twitter.com/c1MZ4SRnmy \u2014 Ammer Cards (@AmmerCards) July 5, 2024\n\nThis should allow payments in USDT practically anywhere payment cards like Visa and Mastercard are accepted.\n\nThe future\n\nCombining the two things, one can imagine that in a not too distant future it will be possible to make transfers of USDT and other stablecoins from one wallet to another without paying fees, or paying very low fees, and then use those same stablecoins to make payments anywhere with classic credit or debit cards.\n\nThe fact is that all these operations can be managed easily and in a very fast and efficient way by new IT platforms specifically designed and created to minimize waste and friction, thus reducing costs and execution times to the maximum.\n\nTraditional payment systems in fiat currency have never managed to achieve as much, also because they are based on a monetary system that has never been truly optimized in recent decades.\n\nCryptocurrencies are natively digital tokens, already designed to be easily exchangeable by anyone, and stablecoins also solve the last obstacle to their mass adoption, namely the excessive volatility of their purchasing power."

One of the reasons for the surge in Solana\u2019s growth was the emergence of memecoins.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum\n\nA recent report by CoinMarketCap highlights a significant trend in the cryptocurrency market for the first half of 2024.\n\nSolana-based memecoins have experienced exceptional growth, outperforming their Ethereum counterparts by an average of nearly 800% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nThis surge extends beyond memecoins, as the Solana ecosystem itself has garnered increased investor attention compared to Ethereum during this period.\n\nWhile this heightened interest may not directly translate to a corresponding increase in network activity, it signifies a noteworthy shift in investor sentiment.\n\nSince October 2023, both the native token SOL and the broader ecosystem, including its memecoin projects, have witnessed a remarkable uptick in both price performance and public interest.\n\nThis momentum has propelled Solana into the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape, solidifying its position as a competitor of increasing prominence.\n\nAlthough Ethereum currently maintains its dominant position, Solana\u2019s impressive growth cannot be overlooked and suggests a potential future challenge to the established leader.\n\nActivity on Solana soared in Q4\n\nSolana\u2019s network activity experienced a significant surge in the second quarter of 2024. Transaction fees and revenue grew exponentially, exceeding $26 million, a remarkable 42x increase year-over-year.\n\nThis growth reflects a booming ecosystem, further evidenced by the total SOL trading volume reaching a staggering $292 billion, nearly seven times higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nDelving deeper into the network metrics, Q2 2024 saw over 15.3 billion transactions completed, encompassing both voting and non-voting activities. This represents a substantial increase in overall network utilization.\n\nAdditionally, the total value locked (TVL) within SOL\u2019s DeFi protocols skyrocketed to $3.4 billion, reflecting a tenfold year-over-year growth. This surge indicates the growing popularity of Solana for decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe NFT sector on Solana also witnessed explosive expansion. Over 98 million new NFTs were minted in Q2 2024, a staggering 54x increase compared to the previous year.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThis suggests a thriving and dynamic NFT ecosystem within the network.\n\nNotably, USDC, reached a market cap of $2.15 billion on Solana, constituting approximately 70% of the total stablecoin market cap on the platform."

        "title": "Tether: the daily trading volumes exceed the combined total of Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Tether (USDT) is recording dizzying daily trading volumes, surpassing the combined total of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto. In 24 hours, traders exchanged USDT for over 55 billion dollars, almost double BTC and more than three times ETH.\n\nTether: daily trading volumes exceed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined\n\nAccording to reports, it seems that Tether is dominating the daily trading volume scene across the entire crypto market.\n\n#ICYMI: Tether 24 hour trading volume surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC and Ethereum combined\n\n\n\nRead the full article \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/rgvjPLCboo pic.twitter.com/1TQvGjuNfx \u2014 CryptoSlate (@CryptoSlate) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cICYMI: the trading volume of Tether in the last 24 hours surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC, and Ethereum combined. Read the full article\u201d\n\nIn fact, in 24 hours, USDT was traded by traders for over 55 billion dollars, doubling the 28 billion dollars of BTC and tripling the 15 billion dollars of ETH.\n\nNot only that, doing some calculations, Tether maintains a volume higher than the combined volume of Bitcoin, Ethereum, in addition to USD Coin, Solana and First Digital USD, highlighting its significant presence in the market.\n\nThis is possible because USDT remains the most used (and most favored) stablecoin in trading pairs, capable of providing coverage from the typical volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTether and daily trading volumes beyond those combined of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other assets\n\nIn general, the daily trading volumes of Tether have remained robust throughout 2024, remaining above 25 billion dollars. This allows Tether to strengthen its position as a key liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nNot only that, on March 16, 2024, Tether recorded the highest peak of daily trading volumes of 130 billion dollars.\n\nUSDT is also the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap. At the time of writing, in fact, Tether records a total market capitalization of over 112 billion dollars.\n\nIn addition to winning over crypto traders, Tether is also succeeding in its mission to extend the adoption of USDT to other sectors as well.\n\nIn fact, recently, Tether has entered the Philippines, where it will be possible to use USDT for payments to the Social Security System (SSS), managed by the State. This public service manages social security and employee compensation, and its payment is mandatory by law.\n\nClosing cycles to open new ones\n\nOther recent news also talks about Tether strategies that on one hand close roads that are no longer viable, but on the other hand open new ones.\n\nIn fact, the issuer of the largest stablecoin has announced the end of the minting of USDT on the EOS and Algorand platforms. Specifically, the minting of USDT on the two blockchains ended in late June, but the company has reassured users that the transition will be carried out meticulously and with minimal disruptions.\n\nThus, while on one hand Tether is closing a circle that began some time ago, on the other hand it assures users that it will decide to allocate resources where they can improve and innovate in the crypto sector.\n\nJust the week before, meanwhile, Tether had already announced an important piece of news regarding the launch of a new stablecoin collateralized in gold. It is called Alloy by Tether (aUSDT) and it is pegged to the US dollar but, instead of being collateralized in dollars, it will be collateralized in gold.\n\naUSDT is not even a stablecoin in the style of Tether Gold (XAUT), as the latter is a simple stablecoin pegged to the value of gold.\n\nTherefore, aUSDT is pegged to the dollar and technically over-collateralized in gold, meaning the total market value of all gold reserves held by Tether as collateral for aUSDT exceeds the market of all issued aUSDT tokens."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing with activity, especially as Ethereum (ETH) maintains a solid support level at $3000. While ETH continues to hold strong, investors and crypto whales are now shifting their focus to a new player in the market: Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising cryptocurrency priced at a mere $0.00077.

Unlike many other tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages the popularity of sports fandom and blockchain technology, creating a vibrant community around sports-related activities and meme culture. This innovative blend has resonated well with investors who are always on the lookout for the next big thing.\n\nInspired by the legendary Pepecoin and the talents of professional soccer player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a distinctive value proposition. Its maximum supply of 7.6 billion tokens and an initial price of $0.00077 make it accessible to a broad range of investors, promising significant returns as the token gains traction in the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Stability and Whale Movement\n\nEthereum (ETH) has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, known for its robust blockchain technology and widespread adoption. Holding the $3000 support level is a testament to ETH\u2019s resilience and investor confidence. However, the stability of Ethereum (ETH) has also led investors to explore new opportunities for higher returns, particularly in emerging cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE).\n\nWhales, or large-scale investors, play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. Their investment decisions can significantly impact the price and perception of a token. When ETH whales begin to diversify their portfolios by investing in new cryptocurrencies, it often signals strong potential for growth in those assets. The influx of whale investments into Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that these savvy investors see substantial upside potential in this new token.\n\nThe Impact of Whales on Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nThe involvement of whales in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a promising sign for its future. These investors typically conduct extensive research and have a deep understanding of market dynamics. Their decision to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) indicates a high level of confidence in the token\u2019s potential for growth.\n\nWhale investments can lead to increased liquidity and stability for Mpeppe (MPEPE). As more whales enter the market, the token\u2019s price could experience less volatility, making it an attractive option for other investors. Additionally, whale support can boost the credibility of Mpeppe (MPEPE), attracting more attention and fostering a strong community of supporters.\n\nStrategic Tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nThe tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE) are meticulously designed to ensure growth and stability. With 50% of the tokens allocated for presale, 20% for liquidity, 15% for games and sports betting, and smaller percentages for the Mbapp\u00e9 treasury and Mpeppe agents, the distribution is strategically planned to balance market stability and community engagement. This careful planning creates a strong foundation for the token, ensuring it can sustain long-term growth.\n\nThe Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market evolves, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a promising new player poised for substantial growth. The predicted rally of 1500% is already attracting attention from Ethereum (ETH) investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the next big thing.

        "content": "Major financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock have updated their Spot Ethereum ETF filings in compliance with the SEC July 8 deadline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remains stable above US$3,000 following positive regulatory developments and expectations of ETF approvals.\n\nFuture ETF prospects for altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and XRP depend on upcoming political and regulatory changes.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) saga goes into the next round. All applicants have now updated their S-1 filings: Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Grayscale and BlackRock.\n\nRelated: Republican Platform Promises to Halt \u2018Un-American\u2019 Crypto Crackdown, Opposes Government Digital Currency\n\nThese have been filed according to the request by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which had asked to stick to the deadline of July 8.\n\nThe filings do not include details related to fees, as the SEC has informed issuers that these are not needed yet. Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there shouldn\u2019t be too much back-and-forth from now on \u2013 with trading to start soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will give guidance back to issuers soon along with the game plan. Then the docs will come back with fees (and every other blank) filled [in] and then it\u2019s go-time. Eric Balchunas Eric Balchunas\n\nEthereum Price Holds Above US$3K Mark\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the second-largest crypto by market cap has remained steady at over US$3K (AU$4.5K) since the most recent overnight dip. The current price is a solid 6.4% increase from yesterday.\n\nEthereum (ETH), 1-day graph, source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe price of ETH seems tied to any news around these funds, with many observers firmly expecting a launch without further delays. The odds of the funds being approved increased dramatically last month when the SEC dropped an investigation about ETH\u2019s status as a security.\n\nPresident of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, said he would be shocked if these funds are not trading within the next two weeks, eyeing July 15 for the first trading day.\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026\n\n\n\nLater next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, price of eth \u2193 20%+ since \"surprise\" 19b-4 approvals in late May. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 6, 2024\n\nOther Altcoin ETFs Next? Chances of Solana, Cardano and XRP\n\nWith the Ethereum ETFs done and dusted \u2013 going by the experts at least \u2013 the next likely candidates for a fund are probably Solana, Cardano and XRP. VanEck and 21Shares have applied for a US listing of these funds and there has been talk around Cardano and XRP to also get a listing.\n\nHowever, many observers are highly doubtful if any of this is happening in the near future. If President Joe Biden remains in office \u2013 which is still out in the open given his recent shaky public appearances \u2013 some believe any such request for a fund for SOL, XRP or ADA will be shot down.\n\nRelated: Defying Market Fears, Notcoin and Celestia Rally, with TIA Gaining 27%\n\nOthers are hopeful that if elected, self-proclaimed crypto-president Donald Trump could fix the broken relationship between the US-crypto sector and the US Government. Only time will tell whether that expectation will be fulfilled."

However, it has since bounced back and is now trading at $57,000. The next resistance levels are at $57,600 and $58,200. Meanwhile, Ethereum has traded above $3,000 and is aiming for $3,110, which could indicate the beginning of a rally towards $3,270.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cWith Bitcoin trading below the critical resistance level at 58.4k USD, bears are looking to strengthen their grip even as the German government has already sold more than 50% of its originally held 50,000 BTC as per the data from Arkham Intelligence. ETH as well is just able to sustain above 3000 dollars even as the ETF trading of the world\u2019s largest crypto is coming close.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is consolidating losses above $55,000 after attempting a recovery above $56,500 and $57,500. It failed to break past $58,200, forming a high at $58,129 before declining and hitting a low of $54,954. It\u2019s now consolidating, with minor gains above the 50% Fib retracement level from $58,129 to $54,954. Bitcoin remains below $57,500 and the 100-hour SMA, with immediate resistance near $57,250.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market witnessed a highly volatile Monday after German government transferred over $900 million worth of assets from its bitcoin holdings as per the blockchain data. The transfer was made to crypto exchanges and a total of 8700 BTC was moved which resulted in a 3% drop in BTC prices on Monday afternoon. However, Bitcoin rebounded to $57,200 level but this support level looks very weak. The increased supply of BTC in the market is good news as more BTCs are available on exchanges to buying and trading activities. Ethereum on the other hand recovered by over 5% and is changing hands at $3070 level.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cGermany continues to have a significant influence on the cryptocurrency market, holding 39,826 BTC worth $2.2 billion, which is about 9% of the $25.3 billion daily bitcoin trading volume. The stash, obtained from movie piracy site Movie2k.to, is gradually being liquidated, impacting BTC prices. Recent sales have seen a nearly 20% drop, with the spot price reaching $55,490. There has been criticism of Germany's strategy of selling BTC for fiat currency, which is seen as potentially harmful given the scarcity of Bitcoin versus unlimited fiat printing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners are experiencing a \"capitulation,\" which may signal a market bottom, as they adjust to reduced profits amid market turmoil.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cDespite selling pressure from the German government moving BTC to exchanges, the crypto market has shown resilience with positive returns in the last 24 hours. Technically, BTC needs to reclaim $58,500 for a bullish sign, while ETH needs to stay above $2,875. ETH/BTC bounced from key support, helping some alts like TIA and ETHFI gain over 20% in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bithumb To List Vitalik Buterin-Backed ETH Layer 2 Project & Top Meme Coin - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, has revealed plans to list BRETT and TAIKO in Korean won markets on July 9 at 18:00 local time. TAIKO is a zkEVM Ethereum layer 2 network that has received support from Vitalik Buterin. BRETT is a prominent meme coin built on the Base chain. Both cryptocurrencies have seen significant price increases following the listing announcement, reflecting investor enthusiasm.\n\nListing Details and Market Impact\n\nBithumb has officially scheduled the launch of BRETT and TAIKO trading in the Korean won market for July 9 at 18:00 local time. This announcement has generated substantial excitement and trading activity among investors, driving significant price surges for both BRETT and TAIKO.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTAIKO, a zkEVM Ethereum layer 2 network backed by Vitalik Buterin, will be listed with a base price of 2,938 won. The exchange has set the number of required deposit confirmations at 30 for TAIKO transactions. This relatively low number of confirmations suggests a balance between security and transaction speed, which could appeal to traders looking for efficient transactions.\n\nBRETT, a popular meme coin deployed on the Base chain, will enter the market with a base price of 149 won. Bithumb has set a higher bar for BRETT transactions, requiring 200 deposit confirmations. This increased number of confirmations might indicate a more cautious approach to the meme coin, possibly due to the volatile nature of such tokens.\n\nThe listing on Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the highly active South Korean market, represents a significant milestone for both BRETT and TAIKO. This move is expected to substantially boost their visibility and trading volume. The increased exposure on a major platform like Bithumb not only enhances the liquidity of these tokens but also attracts a new pool of investors, potentially contributing to their upward price momentum.\n\nFurthermore, the listing on a reputable exchange like Bithumb may be seen as a form of validation for these projects, especially for TAIKO, given its association with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This could lead to increased confidence among investors and potentially pave the way for listings on other major exchanges in the future.\n\nAlso Read: DigitalX Gears to List Spot Bitcoin ETF on Australia\u2019s ASX Exchange As Demand Soars\n\nCurrent Market Performance and Future Outlook\n\nAs of the latest data, Brett (BRETT) is trading at $0.1239, with a 24-hour trading volume of $83.9 million and a 7.41% price increase over the past day. Its market capitalization stands at $1.2 billion, based on a circulating supply of 9.9 billion BRETT.\n\nTaiko (TAIKO) is priced at $2.28, with a 24-hour trading volume of $57.1 million and a 10.92% price increase in the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $144.6 million, with a circulating supply of 63 million TAIKO.\n\nThe substantial price movements following the Bithumb listing announcement indicate positive market reception and suggest potential for further growth. As BRETT and TAIKO continue to gain traction, their listing on a prominent exchange like Bithumb is anticipated to boost investor confidence and encourage wider market adoption.\n\nAlso Read: SOL Price Surges 6% Following Cboe Filing for Spot Solana ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Ethereum price seems to be forming a base above the $2,820 level. ETH could break the $3,160 resistance and rise toward the $3,320 resistance.\n\nEthereum is consolidating losses above the $2,880 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $3,160 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes More Upsides\n\nEthereum price retested the $2,820 support zone. ETH seems to be forming a base above $2,820 and recently started a consolidation phase, like Bitcoin. There was a recovery wave above the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels.\n\nThere was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair tested the $3,080 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,072 and the price could aim for more upsides in the near term.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,894 swing low to the $3,072 high.\n\nIf there is another recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $3,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,150 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,200 level. A close above the $3,200 level might send Ether toward the $3,320 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,350. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,500 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,020. The first major support sits near the $2,960 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,894 swing low to the $3,072 high.\n\nA clear move below the $2,960 support might push the price toward $2,880. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,960\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,150"

        "title": "Ethereum: Top Reasons Ethereum Could Overtake Bitcoin BTC As New Cryptocurrencies Take Centre Stage - NewsBTC",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Ethereum (ETH) has emerged as a strong contender to potentially overtake Bitcoin (BTC). With its advanced blockchain capabilities, including smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum (ETH) offers more than just a digital currency. Among the promising tokens riding the Ethereum (ETH) wave is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new cryptocurrency that is capturing the attention of investors. Here\u2019s why Ethereum (ETH) might surpass Bitcoin (BTC) and what it means for tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Technological Edge\n\nEthereum (ETH) stands out due to its robust technology. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum (ETH) offers a versatile platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). This flexibility has attracted a wide range of developers and businesses, driving innovation and adoption.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network supports smart contracts, which automate and enforce contractual agreements without the need for intermediaries. This feature has opened up new possibilities in various industries, from finance to supply chain management, making Ethereum (ETH) an integral part of the digital economy.\n\nThe Rise of DeFi and NFTs\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have become significant trends in the crypto world, and Ethereum (ETH) is at the forefront of both movements. DeFi platforms built on Ethereum (ETH) allow users to engage in lending, borrowing, and trading without relying on traditional financial institutions. This democratization of finance has attracted billions in investment.\n\nSimilarly, the NFT craze, which involves digital collectibles and art, is predominantly based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The popularity of NFTs has brought Ethereum (ETH) into mainstream consciousness, further solidifying its position in the market.\n\nImplications for Ethereum (ETH) Surpassing Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nIf Ethereum (ETH) were to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization, it would signify a major shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. Such a milestone would validate the broader utility of Ethereum (ETH) beyond just a store of value, highlighting its role as a foundational technology for decentralized applications and financial services.\n\nThis potential shift would also boost confidence in Ethereum-based tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As more investors recognize the value and potential of the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, projects built on this platform could see increased investment and growth.\n\n\n\nThe Potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) is an innovative ERC20 token that leverages the strengths of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Inspired by the meme culture and the global popularity of football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to create a vibrant community around sports and entertainment. With a maximum supply of 7.6 billion tokens and an initial price of $0.00077, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to attract both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nThe strategic allocation of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens ensures market stability and community engagement, making it a promising investment. The presale of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens has already generated significant interest, particularly among Ethereum (ETH) investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Its Impact on Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to innovate and expand its capabilities, tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand to benefit. The scalability and security of the Ethereum (ETH) network provide a strong foundation for Mpeppe (MPEPE), ensuring reliable transactions and robust smart contract functionality.\n\nThe potential launch of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF could further boost the network\u2019s adoption and visibility. Increased institutional investment in Ethereum (ETH) would likely spill over to ERC20 tokens, including Mpeppe (MPEPE), driving their demand and value.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum Whales\n\nEthereum whales, or large holders of Ethereum (ETH), play a significant role in the market dynamics. Their investment decisions can influence trends and drive prices. The entry of Ethereum whales into new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) can signal confidence and attract other investors.\n\nBy supporting Mpeppe (MPEPE), Ethereum whales not only diversify their holdings but also contribute to the token\u2019s growth and stability. Their involvement can provide the liquidity needed for Mpeppe (MPEPE) to thrive, making it an attractive option for smaller investors as well.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum (ETH) has the potential to overtake Bitcoin (BTC) due to its technological advantages and broader application in decentralized finance and digital assets. This shift would have positive implications for Ethereum-based tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), driving investment and growth. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on developments within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem and emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) can offer valuable opportunities for investors. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, providing a gateway to potentially significant returns.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s=11&t=hQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Since 2014, the Ethereum ecosystem has been at the forefront of sponsoring and pioneering countless projects and innovations through its nonprofit arm, the Ethereum Foundation. Among these, Golem stands out as an early ICO-era stalwart. Recently, Golem made headlines by transferring over $100 million worth of ether (ETH) to exchanges in just one month. This has triggered speculation \u2014 as expected \u2014 within the crypto hub about Golem\u2019s ultimate plans and the potential impact on the price of its native token, Golem Network Token (GRN).\n\nIndependent journalist Colin Wu first reported on Golem\u2019s wallet movements, sparking curiosity among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nGolem, a project that raised 820,000 ETH in ICO in 2016, has transferred 36,000 ETH to Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex, etc. in the past 37 days, worth about $115 million. Currently, Golem still has 231,400 ETH, worth about $656 million. https://t.co/EjLTyeEAmz \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 8, 2024\n\nGolem\u2019s ICO Days\n\nGolem emerged during the ICO bout of 2016, raising an impressive $8.7 million worth of ETH in a mere 29 minutes. Its vision was ambitious: to create a decentralized marketplace for computing power. Users could rent out their unused computational resources in exchange for Golem\u2019s native token, GLM. However, despite its promising start, Golem\u2019s journey has been marked by both highs and lows.\n\nGolem\u2019s main wallet has been on the move, transferring millions of ETH to other wallets, which were subsequently sent to major exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase, Arkham Intel data reveals.\n\nThese transactions, mostly below $10 million in value, occur daily.\n\nImage via: Golem ether transfers (Arkham)\n\nMarket Speculations and Selling Pressure\n\nThe $100 million ether transfer raises questions about Golem\u2019s intentions. When tokens move to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell holdings. Large amounts of tokens are rarely held on exchanges for extended periods due to security concerns resulting from past bridges on established CEXs. Speculatively, as Golem\u2019s ETH floods the market, it potentially adds selling pressure, affecting prices and investor sentiment.\n\nDespite its initial success, Golem\u2019s token value has dwindled significantly. Currently trading at around 30 cents with a market cap of $300 million, it\u2019s a far cry from its all-time high of $1.32 in the good old days of January 2018. However, Golem remains committed to development efforts, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Their roadmap spotlight released in May highlights their focus on AI-based solutions.\n\n24h Trading Data of GLM. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nLearning from the ICO Era\n\nGolem\u2019s story reflects broader trends in the crypto space. ICOs, once a popular fundraising method, lost their charm due to regulatory challenges and waning investor interest. Statista report shows that billions were raised between 2016 and 2019, but subsequent years saw a decline. Golem\u2019s journey serves as a cautionary tale for projects seeking sustained success beyond the initial hype."
