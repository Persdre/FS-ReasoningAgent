        "title": "Can Ethereum Hit $100,000? An In-depth Analysis. - Investing Haven",
        "content": "There is no path for Ethereum to hit 100k before 2030, it\u2019s impossible.\n\nRELATED \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) prediction 2025.\n\nIn this article, we explore why ETH cannot rise to $100k in the coming 10 years. We apply a rational method to assess what would happen if ETH were to hit $100k. The outcome, clearly, is that a world in which ETH hits $100k is simply not realistic relative to world economies, market capitalization and valuation of leadings assets and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe answer to this existential question is certainly not to be found in traditional communication channels which are very short term oriented (case in point: $ETH). Similarly, an ETH peak price prediction search is not helpful neither.\n\nWe have to establish the answer ourselves by using common sense.\n\nCan Ethereum hit $100,000? Market cap implications.\n\nShould Ethereum reach the $100,000 mark, its market capitalization would soar to an astounding $13.7 trillion, based on the current circulating supply. This figure is not just monumental; it is transformative.\n\nFor perspective, this would dwarf the market cap of:\n\nMany of the world\u2019s most valuable companies combined;\n\nSurpass the GDP of several major economies.\n\nSuch a valuation would signify Ethereum\u2019s transition from a digital asset to a global economic powerhouse.\n\n\u2018What If\u2019 analysis: Can Ethereum hit $100,000\n\nThe possibility of Ethereum reaching a valuation of $100,000 per unit is a scenario that is often discussed on the web. We see all sorts of opinions and \u2018analysis\u2019, from decent to speculative.\n\nSuch a monumental rise, equating to approximately a 50-fold increase from Ethereum\u2019s current value, requires a deep dive into the implications. To understand the magnitude and feasibility of this scenario, we must analyze it through various lenses:\n\nMarket capitalization;\n\nComparison with Bitcoin;\n\nthe temporal aspect of such growth.\n\nWe take a very structured and analytical approach to answer the question whether ETH can rise to $100k in the coming 7 years.\n\n1. Market cap implications\n\nThe implications of a $13.7 trillion market cap are vast:\n\nFirst, it would reflect an unprecedented level of adoption and utilization of the Ethereum platform, far beyond what we see today. This could mean that Ethereum has become the backbone of a new digital economy, underpinning everything from finance to supply chains, and even governmental systems.\n\nand utilization of the Ethereum platform, far beyond what we see today. This could mean that Ethereum has become the backbone of a new digital economy, underpinning everything from finance to supply chains, and even governmental systems. The technical challenges of scalability, security, and sustainability would need to be fully addressed to support this level of adoption, necessitating groundbreaking advancements in blockchain technology.\n\nA $13.7 market cap which will be the result of a scenario in which Ethereum hits $100,000 seems really unrealistic.\n\n2. Comparison with Bitcoin\n\nIn this scenario, ETH to 100k, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap would be projected at $42 trillion, assuming it maintains its current dominance, also assuming no change in the current BTCETH ratio.\n\nThis would result in a BTC price of around $2 million dollar per unit. That\u2019s not going to happen in the next 7 years.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s positioning as a platform for decentralized applications offers a different kind of value proposition.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth to a $13.7 trillion market cap suggests a broader range of use cases and a deeper integration into the fabric of the digital economy.\n\n3. Temporal Considerations\n\nPredicting such a significant increase in Ethereum\u2019s value before 2030 presents a considerable challenge. The impact of technological innovations, regulatory developments, and global economic conditions over this period is highly uncertain because this scenario is so far out in the future.\n\nTake-aways\n\nThus, while not impossible, the data points suggest that Ethereum to $100k is an unlikely outcome in the mid to long-term.\n\nLooking beyond 2030, the forecast becomes even more speculative. The rapid pace of change in technology and society makes long-term predictions notoriously difficult. However, if we consider the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize multiple sectors, the ongoing evolution of Ethereum, and its ability to address current limitations, the prospect, while still ambitious, cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nETH to $100k chart implications\n\nLet\u2019s chart out the hypothetical scenario in which Ethereum hits $100k in the coming years.\n\nThis is the current daily ETH price chart, with our projected target area for 2024.\n\nSeptember 13th, 2024 \u2013 While we remain bullish cryptocurrencies, including ETH, long term, the current chart setup shows why crypto investors need to remain realistic about expectations on valuations. A 4x rise in ETH will bring ETH to $10k, a realistic target in the coming years. But considering the pace at which this ETH chart is evolving, it simply is not realistic to expect $100k ETH as this would mark a 25x rise from current levels.\n\nSeptember 13th, 2024 \u2013 Our most recent Ethereum prediction suggests that ETH will need to drop once more in 2024 in order to create a bullish reversal that will resolve higher in 2025. We remain confident that our most bullish ETH target of $10,000 will be hit in the coming 3 years provided key support levels outlined in our predictive research will be respected.\n\nNow, we use the same rising trendline, as seen on the above daily chart. We turn it into a channel. We adjust scale to see where Ethereum\u2019s $100k mark comes in.\n\nThe same chart, but now without annotations:\n\nYou don\u2019t need a PhD, you can see it with your own eyes: ETH to hit $100k is very unlikely to be hit in the coming years, say before 2030.\n\nConclusion: can Ethereum hit $100,000?\n\nThe scenario of Ethereum reaching a $100,000 valuation and achieving a market cap of $13.7 trillion is a fascinating \u201cWhat If\u201d analysis. It stretches the boundaries of current thinking around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology\u2019s potential.\n\nThis hypothetical scenario underscores the transformative impact Ethereum could have on the global economy, should it overcome existing challenges and fulfill the promise of widespread adoption and utility.\n\nCrypto markets aren\u2019t ready for such a stretched valuation. Ethereum\u2019s chart doesn\u2019t support moving to $100k in the coming years.\n\nWhile ETH to $100,000 might happen at a certain point in time, it won\u2019t happen before 2030, is what we confidently can say. Here is a path to $10,000 though.\n\nETH fundamentals supportive of a $100k scenario?\n\nThe analysis discussed before was essentially a \u2018What If\u2019 analysis.\n\nWhile we had clear conclusions from the \u2018What If ETH hits $100k\u2019 analysis, we still want to understand a scenario in which Ethereum rises 50x from current levels.\n\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, moving from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability \u2013 key factors that could boost Ethereum\u2019s adoption and value.\n\nTechnical Advancements and Scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to scale and meet the growing demand for its platform is critical. The success of Ethereum 2.0, including the implementation of layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, could significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput. These advancements are essential for Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and its potential to increase in value.\n\nFrom a technological perspective, it looks like Ethereum is not ready to reach a $13.7 trillion market cap, not yet.\n\nRegulatory Environment\n\nRegulation poses a significant risk to all cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Positive regulatory frameworks could pave the way for institutional investment and wider adoption, while stringent regulations could limit growth or even pose existential threats.\n\nIn the medium to long term, however, the lack of regulatory clarity, certainly as it relates to exchanges and trading/investing cryptocurrencies, will hold a massive inflow of capital back. This is subject to change over time, but much more time will be needed to justify Ethereum to rise to a $13.7 trillion market cap token.\n\nEconomic and Market Dynamics\n\nCryptocurrency markets are very volatile, influenced by factors like investor sentiment, market liquidity, and macroeconomic trends. Ethereum reaching $100,000 would not only require technological success and widespread adoption but also favorable economic conditions and market dynamics.\n\nWith so much uncertainty post-Covid, driven by inflationary fear and tight monetary policies, it is unlikely that economic conditions will ignite a tremendous bullish momentum wave in markets and crypto to justify a 50x rise in ETH.\n\nPotential Pathways for ETH to hit $100,000\n\nFor Ethereum to reach a valuation of $100,000, several factors would likely need to converge:\n\nMassive institutional adoption: Large-scale investment from institutional investors could drive significant demand.\n\nLarge-scale investment from institutional investors could drive significant demand. Mainstream use cases: Ethereum becoming the backbone for major applications in finance, supply chain, and beyond.\n\nEthereum becoming the backbone for major applications in finance, supply chain, and beyond. Technological success: Successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0, leading to widespread adoption due to improved scalability and efficiency.\n\nSuccessful implementation of Ethereum 2.0, leading to widespread adoption due to improved scalability and efficiency. Favorable regulatory environment: Supportive regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while providing clear guidelines.\n\nConclusion: ETH to $100k\n\nWhile the potential for Ethereum to reach $100,000 exists, it is likely many years out, at least 7 years (if not more).\n\nWith a $13.7 trillion market cap of Ethereum, if and when it hits $100k, massive changes need to occur, first and foremost fundamental, technological, regulatory. Moreover, institutions will need to be buying massive amounts of Ethereum.\n\nWe prefer to stick to our ETH to $10k target, that\u2019s already a big one. It will happen in the coming 3 years. Let\u2019s enjoy the ride, and not be too concerned about wild targets like ETH to $100k.\n\nOur premium crypto research service, the first premium crypto charting service in the world, covers tokens that can move much higher in the years to come."

        "title": "Spot ETH ETFs without staking miss the mark - Blockworks",
        "content": "While the recent approval of the spot bitcoin ETF in the US marks a positive step towards the institutionalization of the digital asset industry, the imminent approval of spot ether ETFs raises some concerns.\n\nThese ETFs do not offer staking rewards to investors (unlike European ether crypto ETPs), reflecting a lack of understanding by regulators and certain traditional finance asset managers of the key features that distinguish ether from bitcoin.\n\nDespite both being leading cryptocurrencies, ETH and BTC differ significantly in their functionality and role within the blockchain ecosystem. It\u2019s therefore essential for the industry and regulators to tailor financial products to their specific characteristics, benefiting both investors and the underlying networks.\n\nUnderstanding staking and Ethereum 2.0\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of ether ETFs, it\u2019s important to understand what staking entails and why it is integral to Ethereum\u2019s project.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in September 2020.\n\nStaking involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the network\u2019s operations, such as block validation, network security and governance. In return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of staking, consider that over 32 million ETH is currently locked up for staking. This represents 27% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply. At current prices, this equates to more than $121 billion. This significant portion of ETH being staked underscores the critical role staking plays in securing and maintaining the Ethereum network.\n\nBTC vs ETH: Different natures, different functions, different benefits\n\nTo fully appreciate the significance of staking in Ethereum, it\u2019s important to understand the fundamental differences between ETH and BTC. While both are leading cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes and have different technological underpinnings.\n\nBitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange. Its blockchain operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin\u2019s supply is predetermined, and the issuance rate of new bitcoins is halved approximately every four years. This predictable supply schedule further enhances its appeal as a deflationary asset, in stark contrast to the unpredictable monetary policies governing traditional currencies. These characteristics make bitcoin a unique and attractive asset for investors seeking to hedge against inflation, benefit from its potential decorrelation with traditional financial assets and diversify their portfolios.\n\nGiven these attributes, it makes a lot of sense to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. As a digital commodity, bitcoin provides specific benefits for an investor portfolio, similar to those of gold but with the added advantages of digital assets. Our CoinShares Research demonstrates that including just 4% of bitcoin in a traditional 40/60 portfolio significantly enhances its performance. This improved the quality of diversification and potential for higher returns underscore the value of integrating bitcoin into mainstream investment vehicles like ETFs.\n\nEther, on the other hand, is much more than a digital currency. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, Turing-complete platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH serves multiple roles, from facilitating transactions to staking and securing the network.\n\nIn addition to these roles, ETH plays a critical role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3.\n\nWeb3, the potential next evolution of the internet, aims to create a decentralized web where users have control over their data and digital identities. Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement, providing the infrastructure for dapps that give users ownership and governance over their digital interactions. NFTs, which represent unique digital assets, are another significant innovation enabled by Ethereum. They could revolutionize digital art, collectibles and virtual goods, creating new economic models and markets.\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s versatile nature as a platform that facilitates network usage, dapps, DeFi and NFTs, it raises questions about the relevance of launching a spot ETH ETF without a staking feature.\n\nWithout staking rewards, a spot ETH ETF fails to fully leverage the unique advantages that Ethereum offers, both as an investment and a foundational technology for the future of decentralized applications and digital finance.\n\nThe benefits of staking ETH ETFs for investors\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons for including staking in an Ethereum ETF is the potential for additional returns through staking rewards.\n\nWhen investors stake their ETH, they earn a percentage of newly created ETH as a reward, significantly enhancing the overall return on investment (ROI) compared to simply holding ETH in a non-staking ETF. The annual percentage yield (APY) for staking ether typically ranges between 1% and 4%, which is attractive to investors seeking both capital appreciation and income generation.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ether ETFs are the wrong solution to the right problem\n\nBy staking ether, investors are directly contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests ensures that stakeholders are incentivized to act in the network\u2019s best interests, promoting a healthier and more secure ecosystem. This, in turn, can enhance the value of their holdings, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and security.\n\nAdditionally, staking-enabled ETH ETFs can foster a more informed and educated investor base. Engaging in staking helps investors better understand the different types of blockchain and stay updated with the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe inclusion of staking rewards in an ether ETF can lead to significantly higher total returns compared to a non-staking ETF. Staking can also help mitigate some of the inherent volatility associated with cryptocurrencies by providing a steady stream of income.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the daily volatility of ether can exceed the annualized staking reward, meaning the notion that staking provides a cushion against price swings might be perceived as somewhat far-fetched. Nevertheless, this regular income can still offer a more predictable return profile, which is particularly important for institutional investors who may be more risk-averse and seek steady income streams in addition to capital appreciation.\n\nStaking-enabled ETFs encourage greater investor engagement with the Ethereum network. By participating in staking, investors are not just passive holders but active contributors to the network\u2019s security and governance. This deeper level of involvement can foster a stronger, more informed investor community, ultimately benefiting the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nRegulatory considerations and challenges\n\nThe primary concern for regulators with staking ETH is the security and custody of staked assets.\n\nEnsuring that staked ETH is safely and transparently managed is crucial for gaining regulatory approval and investor trust. Fortunately, the staking and custody ecosystem for Ethereum is now well-developed, with robust solutions in place to address these concerns. This maturity in infrastructure and technology ensures that investors can participate in staking with confidence, knowing their assets are secure and well-managed.\n\nAdditionally, there are fund structure considerations that present significant hurdles. For example, the US SEC has shown itself unwilling to allow staking in the traditional spot ETF structures. This is further complicated by the fact that the spot ETF structure (a 1933 Act grantor trust) generally does not hold securities. Because regulators in the US could consider staking a securities activity, this complicates the inclusion of staking rewards in the currently contemplated US spot ETF structure. Navigating these regulatory and structural challenges is essential to bring a staking-enabled ether ETF to market successfully.\n\nMoreover, the tax implications of staking rewards need to be clearly defined.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, staking rewards are considered taxable income, which could complicate the tax reporting process for ETF investors. Clear guidance from regulatory bodies will be essential to address these concerns and facilitate the adoption of staking-enabled ETFs. Additionally, depending on how staking is integrated into the product, it could generate additional revenue for the IRS, which is a positive aspect for the government to consider.\n\nBut the overall case for staking-enabled ether ETFs is compelling.\n\nBy integrating staking into the ETF structure, investors can enjoy additional income through staking rewards, benefit from compounding growth and contribute to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests between investors and the network fosters a healthier, more secure, informed, and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nWithout the inclusion of staking, a spot ETH ETF may struggle to attract investors, who might instead opt for crypto-native solutions which already offer staking and network participation.\n\nJean-Marie Mognetti is Chief Executive Officer of CoinShares, a publicly listed investment firm that manages over five billion in digital assets on behalf of a global investor base, and an experienced commodities trader with a background in quantitative strategies.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently in an important phase dealing with substantial re\u00adsistance and the risk of a price de\u00adcline. The major cryptocurrency is trading at about $3,790, according to CoinMarketCap. A well-known crypto analyst, Morecryptoonl, pointed out that re\u00adsistance is coming into play at the $3,795 and $3,846 marks, which repre\u00adsent a huge obstacle that might le\u00adad to price movement to highe\u00adr levels.\n\nSource: Morecryptoonl\n\nThe chart studie\u00ads imply that a break below $3,710 might be the\u00ad start of wave C of 3 down.

        "content": "Institutional Interests and Investor Confidence\n\nWhy is the Web3 Community is Celebrating?\n\nWhat does it mean for Indian Investors, developers, and the startup ecosystem?\n\nA step towards mainstream adoption\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nWith Ethereum firmly established as the world\u2019s second-largest virtual digital asset, the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marks a monumental stride in the crypto sphere. This endorsement carries profound implications, particularly for investors, given Ethereum's robust market presence.Moreover, Ethereum's pivotal role in propelling the mainstream adoption of crypto cannot be overstated. As the market undergoes continuous evolution, Ethereum stands as a cornerstone, guiding the industry toward unprecedented growth and innovation.One of the most compelling narratives surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs is their impact on investor confidence . Ethereum has already established a strong market presence, and the introduction of ETFs offers a more structured investment vehicle. The ETF structure provides several advantages, including ease of access, as investors can now purchase Ethereum ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts. Additionally, ETFs offer enhanced protection, as regulatory oversight by the SEC ensures higher standards of security, easing investor skepticism.The introduction of ETFs is particularly important because they contribute to market stability by attracting institutional investors , who bring in new capital and a long-term investment perspective. This will certainly accelerate the growth of the asset class. Additionally, technological upgrades, such as the implementation of roll-up technology and Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, are set to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency, further strengthening its appeal to institutional investors.The growing optimism surrounding ETH price action is grounded in significant inflow data. For instance, over $58 billion flowed into ten newly launched Bitcoin ETFs within five months of their debut. If Ethereum ETFs follow a similar trajectory, substantial institutional inflows, combined with bullish speculative trading, could swiftly propel ETH prices to new all-time highs. Institutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs will likely seek to diversify into this newly approved Ethereum ETF.Ethereum plays a crucial role in the decentralized ecosystem, and this regulatory progress is essential for shaping the future of Web3 and the ongoing digital revolution. The SEC's decision is especially significant, given previous media reports suggesting the SEC was investigating the Ethereum Foundation and the ongoing debate about wh ether Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH), should be classified as a security.Classifying Ethereum as a security could have major implications for the Web3 industry. Ethereum underpins a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects , which range from DeFi to NFTs and rely heavily on Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions. Recently, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem has surged, reaching $100 billion, with Ethereum leading the space with over 60% market share. A security designation for Ethereum could have introduced regulatory challenges for dApps built on its network, potentially hindering innovation and growth within the Web3 space.India held the top spot for overall crypto adoption and also ranked first for the on-chain value received through centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms when adjusted for purchasing power parity. The total crypto value received by India in 2023, which was second only to the USA, jumped from ~$170B in 2022 to ~$270B in 2023 indicating a 60% growth. This compares to 10% for the US, 8% for the UK, and 18% for Vietnam. (Source: Hashed Emergent Report)The community remains bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry for 2024. Despite the current limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs being available only to investors in the US and Hong Kong (with a Bitcoin ETF for Hong Kong investors), their introduction has significantly contributed to the global growth of the crypto market. The launch of Ethereum ETFs is expected to further propel this positive momentum.India's share of the global Web3 developer community is fairly big, around 12% of the global figure. There's a network of over 1,000 Web3 startups, a significant percentage building on Ethereum, the largest decentralized ecosystem. This, in turn, will definitely boost the confidence of the developers and entrepreneur community.The approval of Ethereum ETFs signifies a broader trend of crypto integration into the mainstream financial system. It reflects a growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate and valuable component of investment portfolios. This development is not just about making Ethereum more accessible; it is about bridging the gap between traditional finance and the emerging world of crypto assets.As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its use cases\u2014from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\u2014the ability for investors to participate through ETFs will likely accelerate the adoption of these technologies. The ripple effects of this approval will extend beyond just Ethereum, potentially paving the way for similar financial products for other crypto.The US SEC has approved the 19b-4 filings, and it is anticipated that they will approve the final S-1 forms when these ETFs begin trading soon. The decision affects funds proposed by VanEck Fidelity , Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale."

        "title": "Where crypto angel investors should deploy capital after Ethereum ETF approval - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Tim Haldorsson, CEO of Lunar Strategy.\n\nIn nine short years, Ethereum has gone from pioneering on-chain smart contracts and programmable crypto to becoming the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The recent SEC approval of ETH ETFs is just a single step in this journey, albeit a significant milestone that has solidified Ethereum\u2019s status as a mature asset class worthy of serious investment consideration.\n\nThis op-ed will highlight the most promising sectors within the Ethereum ecosystem that I believe angel investors should watch closely to take advantage of this economic momentum.\n\nLayer 2 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum paved the way for the birth of decentralized on-chain markets, planting the seeds that have blossomed into a global DeFi sector with a market cap of $104.55 billion. DeFi is a complex rabbit hole filled with unique financial mechanisms that are unparalleled in traditional finance. However, they rely on the security, speed, and decentralization offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and zkSync have emerged to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues, reducing usage costs and increasing transaction speeds without sacrificing privacy or security. These improvements make Ethereum\u2019s technology more accessible and perfect for DeFi activities.\n\nIn the DeFi space, projects like lending and borrowing platforms, futures and perpetuals trading platforms, token seeding and launching platforms, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have proven immensely successful. Even in the days when ETH only commanded the attention of a small niche of market participants, these technologies were spun into a myriad of business models that proved a real demand for DeFi solutions on a grand scale. Some of the top DeFi protocols have even grown to multi-billion dollar valuations, underscoring the strength of this sector.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions into a recognized commodity, the potential for further growth in DeFi becomes even more certain, making it a lucrative area for angel investors to deploy capital.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence is one of the most important technologies of our time, comparable to the impact of blockchain technology. The world needs AI technologies that can be trusted and that are free from centralized control.\n\nBlockchain enables secure, private, and decentralized frameworks for AI services, crucial for preventing monopolies on scarce compute resources and for providing broader access to decentralized machine learning networks. By leveraging Ethereum\u2019s blockchain for AI projects, developers are already building AI services that remain secure and decentralized.\n\nThis intersection of AI and blockchain is an attractive playing field for investment, as the demand for decentralized and secure AI solutions continues to rise. AI projects built on Ethereum have already achieved multi-billion dollar market caps, showing discerning observers that it is a powder keg of explosive growth. The recent approval of ETH ETFs might be the spark that ignites the next leg of expansion this sector is primed for.\n\nDecentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)\n\nDePIN is one of the exciting blockchain-dependent sectors that have emerged thanks to the miracle of smart contracts. In a nutshell, it merges physical infrastructure with digital networks of decentralized participants and facilitates the global exchange of limited but in-demand resources like sensors, data storage, or wireless connectivity in return for crypto tokens.\n\nDePINs offer decentralized governance, peer-to-peer infrastructure sharing, tokenization, and enhanced security and privacy for traditional and digital industries.\n\nAs demand for DePINs grows, so will the market for these resources, driving token appreciation and market expansion. Ethereum powers the smart contracts that run these DePINs, making it a crucial component of this ecosystem. With the recent approval of ETH ETFs, more angel investors are likely to turn their attention to DePINs, recognizing their potential for high returns and significant real world impact.\n\nETH Restaking\n\nStaking is a fundamental aspect of securing decentralized networks like Ethereum through economic game theory. Validators, who run the nodes powering the blockchain, are required to stake ETH. If they follow the rules, they earn rewards; if they attempt to cheat, they lose their staked ETH. Currently, over $100 billion worth of ETH is staked\u2014that\u2019s how important this mechanism is to operating blockchain networks.\n\nRestaking takes this concept further by applying the same game theory to secure any protocol on the blockchain. This enables smaller participants to maintain high levels of security through proof-of-stake mechanisms that would otherwise be unattainable. Restaking helps to create a more resilient network for multiple protocols, making it cost-prohibitive to attack any single participant within the larger proof-of-stake pool.\n\nLiquid restaking services further simplify the process for those seeking to stake tokens without managing complex validators. These services issue Liquid Restaking Tokens, which accrue yield and interest from validator rewards and can be traded or restaked to generate additional rewards. This sector\u2019s growth underscores its importance as a security mainstay for blockchains, making it a compelling area for angel investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approval of ETH ETFs has stamped Ethereum as a leading investment vehicle. The Ethereum ecosystem offers many exciting opportunities for angel investors, from Layer 2 DeFi and AI integration, to DePINs and restaking.\n\nIt\u2019s important to study these sectors and understand both their leading narratives and growth catalysts. This way, investors can deploy smart capital while contributing to the growth of Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecasts: Where Is ETH Headed After the ETF Approvals? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs has increased volatility, with analysts predicting potential rallies and significant future growth.\n\nPositive on-chain metrics, like rising TVL and negative exchange netflow, indicate a possible bull run for Ethereum.\n\nETH\u2019s Next Possible Step\n\nEthereum made the headlines last week after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially greenlighted the launch of ETH ETFs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The approval happened on May 24, and somewhat expectedly, it caused enhanced volatility for the asset.\n\nIts price passed through severe ups and downs in the range of $3,650-$3,950 before settling to its current level of around $3,800 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThe X user Jelle argued that ETH is consolidating above \u201cthe key support area\u201d of approximately $3,750, expecting \u201cthe market to chop around this area for a while, at least until Monday.\u201d The analyst advised investors not to \u201cfall for the boredom stakeout,\u201d predicting a rally above the $4,500 mark in the following months.\n\nYoddha and Satoshi Flipper were also optimistic. The former claimed that ETH\u2019s bull cycle is about to begin and could fuel a price explosion of as high as $20,000.\n\nSatoshi Flipper envisioned a bright future for Ethereum based on the assumption that major world banks and financial institutions will enter its ecosystem after the SEC gave the thumbs up on the aforementioned ETFs.\n\nRecall that one of Singapore\u2019s largest banks\u2014DBS Bank\u2014was recently revealed as a crypto whale, holding 173,753 ETH. Currently, the stash is valued at almost $670 million.\n\nTaking a Closer Look at On-Chain Metrics\n\nETH\u2019s price has soared substantially in the past year, marking a jump of over 100%. The positive trend coincides with the rise of essential metrics surrounding the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, the total value locked on Ethereum has risen impressively since October 2023 and currently stands at almost $65 billion. TVL is a key indicator that refers to the total value of assets currently being staked, lent, borrowed, or otherwise utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIts increase suggests that more capital is flowing into the ecosystem, which could, in turn, reflect positive market sentiment.\n\nAnother bullish metric is the Ethereum exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the last seven days. Some may consider the shift from centralized platforms to self-custody methods as bullish for ETH\u2019s valuation since it reduces the immediate selling pressure."

        "content": "The Ethe\u00adreum (ETH) market is buzzing with optimism. Renowne\u00add cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi has pre\u00addicted a significant rally for Ethereum (ETH), sugge\u00adsting the digital asset could see\u00ad substantial gains. Ethereum is currently hovering at $3800, reflecting a notable upward tre\u00adnd following recent corrections and consolidation pe\u00adriods. This recovery phase hints at a pote\u00adntial continuation of Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish tre\u00adnd.\n\nMaster Ke\u00adnobi\u2019s analysis provides a historical overview of Ethe\u00adreum\u2019s price moveme\u00adnts, tracing its performance from early 2016 to the\u00ad present. His analysis highlights seve\u00adral key aspects of Ethere\u00adum\u2019s price behavior, each re\u00adpresenting significant bull runs followed by corre\u00adctions and consolidation phases.\n\nEthereum on the Verge of a Breakout: Analysts Predict 3-4x Increase 4\n\nKenobi\u2019s chart fe\u00adatures two major trend lines: an asce\u00adnding white dotted line indicating a long-te\u00adrm upward trajectory and a red dashed line\u00ad marking upper resistance le\u00advels. These te\u00adchnical indicators project Ethereum\u2019s pote\u00adntial future price range, with targe\u00adts around $10,662.90 and $15,498.60, suggesting a possible 3-4X increase\u00ad from current levels. Ke\u00adnobi also suggests that such a rally in Ethereum could drive\u00ad substantial gains across the entire altcoin marke\u00adt.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Momentum Signals Price Surge\n\nThe crypto analyst Washigorira has also fore\u00adcasted a significant price increase\u00ad for Ethereum, suggesting it could re\u00adach between $10,000 and $12,000. Washigorira note\u00ads that Ethereum is on the cusp of a major bre\u00adakout, showing signs of a robust bullish structure since early 2023. Ethe\u00adreum recently broke\u00ad through a critical resistance leve\u00adl, which analysts call the 1st Breakout. After consolidating, Ethe\u00adreum experie\u00adnced a 2nd Breakout, indicating strong upward momentum.\n\nEthereum on the Verge of a Breakout: Analysts Predict 3-4x Increase 5\n\nWashigorira also highlights the Moving Ave\u00adrage Convergence\u00ad Divergence (MACD) crossove\u00adr as a bullish signal that typically precedes significant price\u00ad increases. A similar crossover at the\u00ad end of 2020 led to a major rally. Also, a trend line\u00ad dating back to 2017 implies that Ethereum might achie\u00adve $10,000 and $12,000 if its current bullish trend continue\u00ads.\n\nThe combine\u00ad\u00add insights from Master Kenobi and Washigorira paint an optimistic picture of Ethe\u00ad\u00adreum\u2019s future. They conclude\u00add that historical cycles, technical indicators, and projecte\u00add price targets all point to the pote\u00adntial bullish phase of Ethe\u00adreum. The\u00ad possibility of a 3-4x price increase\u00ad and the\u00ad overall influences on the\u00ad altcoin market demonstrate that Ethe\u00ad\u00adreum\u2019s progress in the ne\u00adxt period may be crucial for the cryptocurre\u00adncy market in 2024.\n\nRelated Readings | Chiliz (CHZ) Shows Strong Upward Trend: Analyst Set Targets at $0.26 & $0.43"

        "content": "Ethereum is trading within a bullish trend channel in the medium to long term. This upward momentum indicates strong positive development, with increasing buy interest from the crypto community. The price is approaching a key resistance level at $4,000, potentially triggering a sell-off or a consolidation phase. However, a decisive breakout above the $4,000 mark would be a highly bullish signal, indicating potential for further gains.\n\nThe positive volume balance indicates strong buying pressure, supporting Ethereum\u2019s short-term bullish outlook. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 68, signifying nuetral conditions after notable price increases over the past weeks. Currently, Ethereum is priced at $3,769.56, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12.02 billion and a market capitalization of $452.86 billion. The ETH price has seen a modest increase of 0.18% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHidden Bullish Pattern Signals Ethereum Rally Towards $4,811\n\nRenowned crypto analyst JAVON MARKS has recently provided an in-depth analysis of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) market performance, suggesting a significant price surge may be imminent. MARKS has been closely monitoring ETH\u2019s price movements and has identified several key patterns that indicate a potential bullish trend.\n\nInitially, the analyst observed a Hidden Bullish pattern in Ethereum\u2019s chart. This technical pattern is often a precursor to upward price movements, even though it may not be immediately obvious to the broader market. Following this confirmation, ETH experienced a brief continuation of its upward trend. However, this movement was relatively modest and short-lived, described by MARKS as \u201cminuscule.\u201d\n\nEthereum experienced a pullback, a common occurrence in cryptocurrency trading where prices retract before making another significant move. Ethereum\u2019s price action established an even larger Bullish Pattern during this pullback. This new, more pronounced pattern is highly significant because it suggests the potential for a substantial upward continuation.\n\nThe technical analysis from MARKS indicates the new Bullish Pattern can take the price of ETH towards $4,811.9. This target has been derived from historical price moves and pattern projections two keys to technical analysis. These milestones will most probably be accompanied by a massive increment in prices from current levels and big participation by Ethereum in the market.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Below $68K: Mixed Crypto Trends And Top Gainers Analysis"

        "content": "Unlike Bitcoin or Polygon, Ethereum has many use cases, like DeFi, running applications, and buying and selling NFTs. This is why the movements of prominent cohorts of holders such as \u2018Sharks\u2019 and \u2018Whales\u2019 aren\u2019t always reliable for determining the market trajectory for ETH. Because the motive behind their transactions might go beyond just market speculation. For instance, these transactions could be for interacting with smart contracts or paying transaction fees, making it challenging to predict Ethereum\u2019s price based solely on these transactions.\n\nOne of the key advantages of analyzing wstETH and rETH holders is that it helps filter out the noise. By focusing on these wrapped and staked tokens, we can more accurately identify committed and strategic investments that are related to price expectations from holders that carry the power to move them. By understanding the behavior of these key stakeholders, all of us can gain better insights into market dynamics and make more informed decisions related to Ethereum, and ERC-20 projects.\n\nEthereum's Hidden Secrets: Why Whale Movements Aren't Everything 3\n\nSantiment, in its latest report, has identified key lesser-known indicators that might come in handy to predict ETH\u2019s next big pumps. The first is stakeholder accumulation for Wrapped Staked Ethereum [wstETH] and RocketPool Ethereum [rETH]. For the uninitiated, wrapped tokens represent ETH which is being staked [locked up] in specific protocols like DeFi.\n\nBy allowing users to earn rewards, while still participating in the DeFi ecosystem, the token\u2019s dual functionality reflects a clear picture of trading and investment behaviors. This, in turn, offers crucial insights into market trends and sentiment related to Ethereum and its ecosystem rather than mere accumulation and dumps from millionaires and billionaires.\n\nBesides understanding Ethereum\u2019s market behavior through tokens like Wrapped Staked Ethereum and RocketPool ETH, another valuable tool is Eigen Layer.\n\nScaling Ethereum\u2019s Network\n\nEigen Layer is a blockchain scaling solution that aims to improve the performance and scalability of the ETH network. It uses a unique \u201d eigentrust \u201d approach to validate transactions, making the network more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nAs reported by TronWeekly, this protocol aims to enhance security and functionality for the network empowering ETH stakers to validate any software modules referred to as Actively Validated Services [AVS]. Hence, EigenLayer strengthens the network\u2019s resilience through centralizing security aspects."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has slipped today, while Ethereum continues to maintain positive momentum. This divergence in performance between the two leading cryptocurrencies has sparked intense market discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, amid this, a recent report from QCP Capital has provided insights into this trend, highlighting key factors influencing the current dynamics and why analysts remain bullish on Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Price Struggles While Ethereum Soars\n\nThe recent decline in Bitcoin can be attributed to multiple bearish factors. According to QCP Capital, potential supply pressures from the upcoming Mt. Gox distribution, valued at approximately $9.6 billion, and the recent DMM hack, which saw $305 million stolen, have weighed heavily on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nNotably, these events have created a bearish outlook, contributing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s current struggles. However, despite the sluggish performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price has surged today.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has managed to sustain its positive momentum, driven by bullish catalysts. The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has significantly boosted investor confidence.\n\nBesides, QCP Capital\u2019s report notes, \u201cVols have been absolutely crushed after ETH spot ETF approval this week despite prevailing catalysts.\u201d The anticipation of these ETFs trading earlier than expected has injected fresh optimism into the market.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent move to urge applicants to submit S-1 forms by May 31 suggests that Ethereum spot ETFs could start trading as early as June, according to the report. This accelerated timeline has further fueled bullish sentiment for Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the contrasting reactions to these developments have highlighted the different trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the current market.\n\nAlso Read: Binance founder CZ Begins Four-Month Sentence in Lompoc, California\n\nBullish Outlook on Ethereum\n\nAnalysts at QCP Capital are particularly optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future performance. They believe that the market may be underestimating the potential impact of the upcoming Ethereum spot ETFs. In its report, QCP Capital stated:\n\nA sleepy market may get caught offside, and our bet is on the bullish side, particularly for ETH.\n\nNotably, this suggests that the approval and launch of these ETFs could trigger significant price movements, catching many investors by surprise. The overall sentiment around Ethereum remains positive, with many expecting the cryptocurrency to continue its upward trend.\n\nMeanwhile, the factors contributing to this optimism include the regulatory green light for ETFs and the broader adoption of Ethereum in various applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile Bitcoin faces headwinds, Ethereum\u2019s favorable conditions and strong market interest position it well for future gains. The differing performances of these two major cryptocurrencies underscore the importance of understanding the unique factors driving each one\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nAs of writing, Bitcoin price dipped 1.17% and exchanged hands at $67,561.26, while touching a low of $66,633.42 in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum price soared 1.56% to $3,781.67, while its trading volume rose 8% to $14.95 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Woods\u2019 Ark Invest Withdraws Spot Ethereum ETF Application\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

As hope started to emerge about a potential challenge to the all-time high of $73,800, though, the landscape changed and BTC slumped by more than three grand by Tuesday.\n\nMore volatility ensued in the following days, but bitcoin ultimately remained in a range between $67,000 and $69,000 with a short-lived attempt to overcome the latter on Thursday. The subsequent rejection pushed the asset south hard, and it fell by $3,000 to $66,600 yesterday, which became its lowest price tag in about a week.\n\nThe bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn\u2019t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, BTC spiked by roughly $1,000 and now sits between $67,500 and $68,000.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

        "title": "3 Ethereum Rivals To Buy If You Missed Solana - CoinGape",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is an ocean of opportunities, often snapped up by fast fingers. Many times if the ship sails before getting on board, it\u2019s an uphill battle to catch up\u2014and if you do, you could end up sinking with the same ship. However, there are plenty of second chances, thirds, fourths, and even fifths. For this reason, investors who may have missed out on the Solana rally could consider leading Ethereum rivals like XRP, SHIB, and LUNC.\n\nWhy Buy Ethereum Rivals\n\nSolana has since its inception been a noteworthy rival to the world\u2019s second-leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum. The token boasts an efficient blockchain, scalable and able to support a high transaction throughput at a fraction of the fees charged to send value on Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLike Solana, other Ethereum rivals emerged with immense potential. For instance, XRP runs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) which supports value transfer across international borders. The network has over the years partnered with banking institutions using its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform to send and receive money.\n\nShiba Inu, on the other hand, started as a meme coin rival to Dogecoin. However, the token has transformed from a simple dog-themed joke cryptocurrency to a powerhouse hosting other tokens and scaling networks like Shibarium. SHIB is very affordable compared to Ethereum\u2019s at $3,800.\n\nThe Terra Classic community has shown resilience since its downfall in 2022. After crashing almost to zero LUNC has continued to rally, aiming to reach $1 in the next bull market.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP holds above the crucial $0.52 support on Friday amid increasing signs of an inbound bullish move.\n\nMarket factors are strong for Bitcoin and altcoins. The approval of Ethereum ETFs raised the stakes for XRP and Solana to receive similar products in the future.\n\nXRP stands out as the eighth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $28 billion. With a green candle established on the four-hour chart, this could be a good chance for traders to seek exposure to longs ahead of a larger move up.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the same time frame is starting to reinforce the bullish grip with potential. Should the RSI cross above the descending trend line and close the gap to the midline in the neutral area, the path of least resistance would uphold the uptrend.\n\nThe increasing four-hour candle shows that buyers have the upper hand. However, for XRP to establish a sustainable uptrend, all three exponential moving averages (EMAs) must flip to provide support. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) dons a bullish signal likely to encourage traders to consider buying XRP. A major rally would erupt if resistance at $0.56 is broken, paving the way for a smooth path to $1.\n\n2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nData from CoinGecko shows Shiba Inu price traded around $0.00002573 during European hours, a 3.6% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 6.6% increase in 7 days.\n\nSHIB price is currently in an ascending triangle and almost at the end. Ascending triangles show investors\u2019 interest and accumulation as the highs remain relatively flat with lows rising higher. If the market structure holds, Shiba Inu may break out on the upside and rally 32% to around $0.000036.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price fundamentals are strong as the meme coin rides in favor of its huge community. Coinbase Futures recently announced support for SHIB perpetual futures, with trading beginning on May 30, 2024.\n\nSeveral renowned crypto analysts have also called for imminent SHIB price breakouts in the near future. Ali Martinez suggested a 20% upswing in price if the SHIB price breaks above $0.000025.\n\n3. Terra Classic (LUNC)\n\nOver the past week, LUNC price has been trading upward, with an 8% surge driven by increasing market optimism and renewed investor interest. Additionally, in the past month, this token experienced a steady rise of 15%, trading in a range of $0.0001 to $0.00012, reflecting a positive market sentiment.\n\nAs bullish sentiment gains momentum, Terra Classic (LUNC) could surpass the $0.00013 mark, signaling a renewed upward trend. This positive market shift might push the Terra Classic price toward breaching the resistance at $0.0002, aiming for $0.0005 in the next bullish cycle.\n\nBottom Line\n\nComing up with a winning crypto portfolio is not an easy feat for many. However, investors who focus on solid narratives like Ethereum and its popular rivals are on the path to achieving more from their holdings. A potential bull run in 2024 could turn the fortunes of ordinary people to achieve immense success.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market witnessed a renewed recovery following the Bitcoin reversal from $56,000 in May. While a majority of major altcoins experienced a notable uptrend, Ethereum meme coins rallied with higher momentum as they are appealing to speculative traders. If you have missed the Pepe coin rally to its new all-time high, the top meme coins to buy are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Memecoin (MEME), and Floki (FLOKI) to capture similar trends.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Prediction: MVRV Ratio Hints Bitcoin Bull Run Has Room to Grow\n\nadvertisement\n\n1) Ethereum Meme Coin \u2013 Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-based cryptocurrency that started as a playful homage to Dogecoin. Key fundamental factors for SHIB include its significant social media presence, strategic token burns to reduce supply, and continuous development of its ecosystem.\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most promising Ethereum meme coin available today. In the daily chart, the SHIB price is steadily recovering under the influence of the ascending trendline. The dynamic support has uplifted the asset from its April 13th low at $0.0000183 to $0.000026, registering a growth of 45%.\n\nBy press time, the Shiba Inu price had a market cap of $14.7 billion, while the 24-hour trading volume dropped to $250 million.\n\nIf the support mentioned earlier is intact, the buyers could breach the swing high resistance of $0.00003. This breakout could offer better confirmation of market sentiment shifting from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThe post-breakout rally could push the asset to $0.000038, followed by $0.000054.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium Achieves Major Feat, Curtails Ethereum Bridge Time\n\n2) Floki\n\nFloki is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that has significantly evolved from its origins as a playful homage to Elon Musk\u2019s Shiba Inu dog. The core of Floki\u2019s ecosystem includes Valhalla, an NFT gaming metaverse that allows players to earn rewards through engaging activities like battles and asset trading.\n\nAmid the current market consolidation, the Floki price witnessed weakened bullish momentum, resulting in a reversal from $0.000313. This bearish turnaround plunged the meme coin 16% to trade at $0.0000259, while the market cap plunged to $2.44 Billion.\n\nIf the supply pressure increases, the coin price could tumble another 20% to seek support at the ascending trendline. This dynamic support has been carrying a bullish trajectory for nearly three months and can recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum in FLOKI.\n\nA potential rebound from this floor could push the asset beyond the $0.0000313 ceiling making it one of the best Ethereum meme coins to invest in.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase Adds Shiba Inu, FLOKI, BONK In Full-Trading Mode, Prices To Recover?\n\n3) MAGA (Trump)\n\nMAGA Coin, also known as TRUMP, is a meme cryptocurrency inspired by the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump. The coin aims to merge political finance (PoliFi) with traditional cryptocurrency principles, targeting supporters of Trump and conservative causes.\n\nThe Trump coin entered an aggressive recovery rally from May\u2019s second week as the price rebounded from the $4.12 support. The reversal propelled the asset 256% to current trade at $14.7, while the market cap boasted to $637.4 Million.\n\nAmid this rally, the buyers recently gave a decisive breakout from the angular resistance trendline and $10.5 horizontal barrier. Sustaining this breakout should provide buyers with suitable support to lead a higher rally and target potential at $22, followed by $25.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump Jail Discussions Unsettle Markets; Bitcoin Price Down 3%\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe current market recovery is particularly robust in the Meme coin sector, drawing in speculative traders eager for quick profits. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki, and MAGA (TRUMP) are notable Ethereum-based Meme coins demonstrating significant potential to drive a prolonged rally into 2024. These coins stand out due to their strong community support, innovative projects, and recent impressive market performances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum has trended within a range in the past ten days.\n\nFutures traders continue to take long positions.\n\nAn analysis for Ethereum [ETH] price prediction showed that ETH has trended within a horizontal channel since it closed above $3650 on 20th May.\n\nA horizontal channel is formed when the price of an asset consolidates within a range for some time. This happens when there is a relative balance between buying and selling pressures, which prevents the asset\u2019s price from trending strongly in either direction.\n\nThe upper line of this channel forms resistance, while the lower line forms support. For ETH, it has formed resistance at $3962, while it finds support at $3638.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows bulls are here\n\nReadings observed from ETH\u2019s key momentum indicators confirmed that the market has been marked by equal amounts of buying and selling activity in the past few days.\n\nAlthough still positioned above the 50-neutral spot, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have been \u201cflat\u201d in the past few days.\n\nThese momentum indicators are said to be flat when they trend in a seemingly straight line, with no significant swings up or down.\n\nWhen they trend in this manner, it suggests that neither strong buying nor strong selling pressure exists. Traders interpret it to mean that there is no clear signal for a breakout upward or downward.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s RSI was 64.92, while its MFI was 63.74.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s declining Average True Range (ATR) confirmed the price consolidation. This indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods.\n\nWhen the indicator falls, it suggests lower market volatility and hints that the asset\u2019s price is trending within a range without significant upward or downward movements.\n\nFutures traders are unmoved\n\nDespite ETH\u2019s sideways price movements in the past few days, its futures market activity has continued to grow. Since 20 May, the coin\u2019s futures open interest has increased by 42%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s futures open interest surges like this, more traders are entering the market to open new trading positions. At press time, ETH\u2019s futures open interest was $16.45, per Coinglass\u2019 data.\n\nRegarding whether these traders are opening short or long positions, ETH\u2019s positive funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive. This shows that there has been more demand for long than short positions."

The increased trading volume by 10.32% and open interest by 1.19% shows that traders are still quite active with ETH.\n\nLooking at the long/short ratios, we see a predominance of long positions over shorts, indicating that despite the slowdown, many traders are still betting on Ethereum\u2019s bull run as ETFs get ready to start trading next week.\n\nEther\u2019s current liquidation pattern could signal that despite the predominant bullish sentiment, ETH is facing increased market caution. This typically precedes a short-term consolidation, as was seen from Bitcoin after breaking all-time highs earlier this year.\n\nThe ETH/USDt chart shows an incoming consolidation even more. After peaking around $3,980, Ethereum faced resistance and has since formed a consolidation pattern, generally fluctuating between $3,770 and $3,900.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads at 51.43, indicating a neutral momentum that aligns with the ongoing price consolidation.\n\nThis suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing no strong bias towards either bullish or bearish momentum in the near term.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, the key support level to watch is around $3,770, marked by several touches over the past few days, which have prevented further declines.\n\nOn the upside, resistance is set near $4,000, where Ethereum has struggled to sustain upward movements.\n\nMeanwhile, a notable peak in social dominance suggests a recent surge in discussions or interest around Ethereum, which is clearly driven by the ETF hype.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

It is already consolidating."
