        "content": "Buoyed by the bullish market momentum, Solana has recaptured investors\u2019 sentiment, steering attention away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL is on the cusp of breaking new records as the token approaches a 2-year high. From less than $10 a year ago, the leading altcoin exceeded $130, a whopping 500% surge.\n\nSimilarly, the trading volume of the 5th largest crypto asset has spiked 120% to $3.2 million. Market experts have drawn parallels between SOL\u2019s price trajectory and that of Ethereum in 2020. If the rest of the cycle plays out similarly, a takeoff is imminent.\n\nSOL still really reminds me of ETH in 2020. Pretty sure the rest of the cycle plays out similarly too, expecting takeoff soon. Bring it on.\n\nWhile price is one way to look at it, the other perspective is revenue, as gauged by the gas fees of the respective blockchains. And Solana\u2019s gas fees have been soaring, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of Ethereum\u2019s gas fees. In February 2023, Solana\u2019s daily gas fees were less than 0.2% of Ethtereum\u2019s. In January 2024, the table flipped as Solana\u2019s daily gas fees exceeded 8% of Ethereum\u2019s, making a nearly 40-fold increase.\n\nImage Credit: PYOR\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi TVL has also scored a new milestone, surpassing $2 billion, a level not seen in the last 20 months. The new feat is a testament to its robust DeFi ecosystem, which has bounced back strongly since the 2022 FTX collapse. Since December, the total value locked has doubled, indicating increased user activity and trust in the platform\u2019s DeFi applications [DApps]. The blockchain\u2019s scalability and affordability make it a cheaper and faster alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana: Dynamics of DEX Volume and Notable Sector Gains\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is that while constituting less than 3% of total DeFi TVL, Solana generates over 20% of the overall on-chain DEX volume. Along with SOL, Ethereum, Manta, and Arbitrum also recorded notable gains. This uptrend marks the fourth consecutive month of growth for DeFi since it finally broke its downtrend in October 2023.\n\nMarket observers have noted that the liquid staking and lending/borrowing sectors led the surge across key protocols, culminating in a robust DeFi week for Solana."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nThe recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked a resurgence in the crypto market, attracting a wave of new investors and igniting a surge in trading activity. This positive momentum has created a ripple effect of optimism that transcends Bitcoin alone. Now, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gears up to decide on a potential spot in Ethereum ETF in May, anticipation is running high for another major milestone in the crypto space.If Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market is undeniable, Ethereum's unique functionalities and growing ecosystem make it a force to be reckoned with. The Ethereum blockchain and its native currency, Ether (ETH), serve as the backbone for a vast array of decentralized applications and innovative projects. From smart contracts to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum's ecosystem continues to drive unprecedented levels of use cases and activities.ETH has already demonstrated strong performance with a 33% gain year-to-date. This rally is fueled by a combination of factors, including Ethereum's shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model, which has made its token supply deflationary. Additionally, the amount of ether locked up in staking pools, DeFi smart contracts and layer-2s is also an important factor. The proportion of ETH held on exchanges has reached an all-time low of 11%, suggesting increased demand and scarcity.The growth of Ethereum's ecosystem, particularly in the DeFi sector and layer 2 scaling solutions, further reinforces the bullish outlook for ether. New layer 2 networks have brought scalability and lower fees to the Ethereum network, driving higher transaction volumes and activity. With further upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's ecosystem is poised for continued expansion and value accrual. To add this, the number of Zk rollups being built on top of Ethereum further bolster its position in the Web3 space.The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs presents a significant opportunity for investors to capitalize on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem while mitigating the complexities associated with direct asset ownership. These investment vehicles offer a regulated and simplified avenue for investors, providing indirect exposure to Ethereum's price movements.Several established financial institutions, including Franklin Templeton, Blackrock, and Fidelity, who already have SEC-approved Bitcoin ETFs, are actively pursuing the launch of an Ethereum ETF in the U.S. These firms see the potential for Ethereum ETFs to do more than simply track the price of Ether; they believe it can facilitate the development of transparent and accessible tokenized financial markets built on the Ethereum network, offering benefits beyond simply attracting investors.The classification of Ethereum as either a commodity or security remains an ongoing discussion. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler's statement regarding the potential categorization of most crypto assets as securities adds complexity to the ETH ETF approval process, it also signifies the ongoing engagement of regulatory bodies in defining a framework for the evolving crypto landscape.India boasts millions of enthusiastic investors who are increasingly convinced about the future of virtual digital assets (VDAs). For Indian investors, although such ETFs are currently unavailable for investment, these developments have nonetheless infused the community with positivity.While the availability of ETFs for crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum remains a future prospect, the recent developments have nevertheless inspired confidence and optimism among Indian investors. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, Indian investors eagerly await opportunities to participate in the growth and innovation of this dynamic sector."

It does this by comparing the current market value of an asset to the average price at which all units were last moved on the blockchain.\n\nWhen it increases, it suggests that the current market value of an asset is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was 103.11%, having risen by 145% since 25th January, per Santiment\u2019s data. This rally coincides with the recent surge in ETH\u2019s price, which recently surpassed the $3,400 mark, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith an MVRV ratio of 103%, ETH\u2019s current market price is 1.03 times higher than the average price at which all ETH units were last moved on the blockchain. Therefore, on average, most coin holders would realize at least 100% profit on their investments if they sold now.\n\nNo cause for alarm\n\nWhile readings from ETH\u2019s Bollinger Bands indicator observed on a single-day chart revealed that ETH\u2019s price remained prone to swings, other key indicators showed that bullish sentiments exceeded bearish activity.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Awesome Oscillator returned green upward-facing bars at press time. This indicator measures market momentum by comparing its short-term and long-term moving averages.\n\nWhen it returns only green bars, it indicates that the short-term moving average is rising faster than the long-term moving average. This suggests that the bullish sentiment is strong and gaining momentum.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line (blue) rested solidly above the trend (orange) and the zero lines as of this writing.\n\nWhen readings from this indicator show the MACD and trend lines above zero (as is the case here), it suggests that bullish momentum is prevailing in the market.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nOn the coin\u2019s derivatives market, futures open interest totaled $11.38 billion as of this writing. The last time ETH\u2019s futures open interest was that high was in December 2021, per data from Coinglass.\n\nWith the growth in the coin\u2019s positive funding rates across exchanges, futures traders continue to place bets in favor of a price rally."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Highlights Polymarket's Prediction on Ethereum's Gas Fee Reduction Jessie A Ellis Vitalik Buterin draws attention to predictions of lowered Ethereum gas fees post-EIP-4844, with market speculation suggesting major cost cuts.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has brought to light on X (formerly Twitter) a Polymarket prediction that could signal a significant change in the network's fee structure following the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. The forecast, a topic of intense discussion within the Ethereum community, estimates a notable reduction in transaction costs, potentially lowering the price of data blobs (~125 kB) to under 0.001 ETH.\n\nThe current expense of calldata on Ethereum, calculated at approximately 0.06 ETH factoring in gas and data size, has been a substantial bottleneck for the network\u2019s scalability and user adoption. Polymarket\u2019s speculative market, a barometer of community sentiment, shows that a sizable portion of participants, 46%, predict gas fees will fall between 0.0001 and 0.001 ETH a month after EIP-4844's implementation. Another 24% believe it could settle between 0.001 and 0.01 ETH.\n\nButerin's mention serves as a reminder that these market predictions, while speculative, provide insight into community expectations and can be utilized as a hedging tool against the potential outcome of the EIP-4844 upgrade. The proposal is a key part of Ethereum's ongoing efforts to enhance its protocol , which includes the much-anticipated transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe reduction in gas fees anticipated by EIP-4844 could significantly amplify the network's appeal to developers, encouraging the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps) and boosting overall network activity. It also reflects the broader goal of Ethereum's upgrade path: to maintain its competitive edge as a leading blockchain for smart contracts in the face of rising alternatives offering lower transaction fees.\n\nInvestors and the Ethereum community are keeping a watchful eye on the development and eventual outcome of EIP-4844. The reduction in gas fees has been long sought after and is expected to not only improve the user experience but also potentially influence the market sentiment around ETH positively.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, upgrades of this magnitude come with inherent risks and uncertainties. Nonetheless, the community's response to Buterin's highlight of Polymarket's predictions indicates a prevailing optimism about the proposal's capacity to resolve some of Ethereum's most pressing challenges related to gas fees. As the upgrade looms on the horizon, all eyes will be on its real-world impact versus the speculative predictions.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently drew attention to the predicted cost of \"blobs\" on the Ethereum network, highlighting potential economic ramifications. Blobs, introduced by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, are data bundles roughly 125 kilobytes in size that can be attached to transactions.\n\nButerin compared current data transmission costs on Ethereum with projections from Polymarket, a prediction market platform. According to current gas prices, transmitting 125 kB of data (calldata) costs approximately 0.06 ETH.\n\nIn contrast, Polymarket forecasts the price of blobs to be around 0.001 ETH. This significant disparity suggests that EIP-4844, if implemented, could drastically reduce data storage costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolymarket is predicting that blobs (~125 kB) will cost ~0.001 ETH.\n\n\n\nToday, 125 kB calldata costs ~30 gwei per gas * 16 gas per byte * 125000 gas ~= 0.06 ETH\n\n\n\nAnd if you think polymarket's guess that blobs will be 60x cheaper is over-optimistic, you can use the market to hedge! pic.twitter.com/vUwJInNhCP \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 3, 2024\n\nWhat is EIP-4844?\n\nEIP-4844 proposes a three-part solution to tackle blockchain's scalability issues. Firstly, it introduces Type-3 transactions, which enable users to attach blobs directly to their transactions. This offloads non-critical information from the main ETH chain, freeing up space and potentially reducing transaction fees.\n\nSecondly, the proposal introduces blob storage, allowing a limited number of blobs to be temporarily stored on beacon nodes (validators) for a specific time frame. Finally, a blob base fee mechanism is implemented to incentivize validators to include these blobs in blocks. This ensures the continued availability of the data while preventing excessive storage that could strain the network.\n\nHow to hedge by Vitalik Buterin\n\nBeyond cost reductions, Buterin suggests that Polymarket's predictions could serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders within the Ethereum ecosystem. By understanding the market's anticipated cost of blobs, participants can potentially hedge against price fluctuations, contributing to a more stable and predictable environment.\n\nIt is important to note that EIP-4844 is still under development and its implementation timeline is uncertain. However, the potential cost savings and increased scalability offered by blobs highlight the ongoing efforts toward a more efficient and cost-effective Ethereum network."

Discover SCENE\n\nCross-chain bridge protocol Wormhole is gearing up for a multi-billion dollar airdrop of its upcoming W token, pre-market trading data suggests.\n\nOn Monday, W traded for 2.49 USDT in OTC trades recorded through Bybit\u2014 more than five times higher than it traded for one month ago in the perpetual futures market. At the time, Wormhole published a tokenomics and unlock schedule for W, which entailed a token generation event that would immediately release 1.1 billion tokens, with another 600 million tokens released to the community over the next several months.\n\nThe math adds up to an immediate airdrop worth $2.73 billion at current prices, potentially one of the largest airdrops in crypto history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the largest crypto airdrop so far was for Uniswap\u2019s UNI token on September 16, 2020\u2014a $6.43 billion event. Wormhole\u2019s upcoming airdrop would place it firmly within the top five.\n\nThat said, Wormhole hasn\u2019t announced an official airdrop date, and pre-market trading prices may fluctuate wildly before then. There\u2019s also a strong chance the price could collapse dramatically after the token is listed on exchanges, as is what happened with Starknet\u2019s STRK airdrop last month.\n\nThe Wormhole and Starknet airdrops are similar in several ways: tokens for both protocols have a fully diluted supply of 10 billion tokens, and each gives governance rights to its holders to determine the future of the project in a decentralized manner. Much of the W supply is also being reserved for its biggest stakeholders, including 5.1% for guardian nodes, 12% for core contributors, and 11.6% for strategic network partners.\n\nWormhole allows crypto users to send messages and assets between 30 different blockchains, having popularized as a two-way bridge between the Ethereum and Solana networks. It held a $2.5 billion valuation following a $225 million funding round that closed in November 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWormhole\u2019s website currently claims that the protocol has processed over $35 billion in transfers since its inception. Portal, the asset bridging protocol built on Wormhole, holds TVL worth $1.6 billion, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Filecoin is riding the boom in liquid staking - DLNews",
        "content": "Liquid staking is booming on Filecoin.\n\nMost of the increase has come from the GLIF protocol.\n\nGLIF said it intends to launch a points system, a trend among Ethereum and Solana DeFi applications.\n\nAlmost one year after the introduction of Ethereum-style smart contracts, so-called liquid staking protocols are booming on Filecoin, a blockchain built to store data.\n\nSince January 1, the value of crypto locked in Filecoin\u2019s dozen liquid staking protocols has grown to more than $450 million from $272 million.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign users are becoming more familiar with Filecoin and its nascent DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s also another sign that users love the points systems that have taken over Ethereum and Solana, too.\n\nA \u201clikely catalyst\u201d for Filecoin\u2019s recent growth \u201cis the anticipation of rewards programs that incentivise user activity,\u201d Messari analyst Mihai Grigore told DL News.\n\nLike airdrops \u2014 projects\u2019 distributions of free tokens to reward early or loyal users \u2014 points programs, which function much like traditional businesses\u2019 rewards programs, can juice user activity.\n\nUnlike airdrops, however, they allow US-based projects to avoid the regulatory headache that can come with promising or issuing tokens.\n\nAs such, they have spread like wildfire among decentralised finance applications on Ethereum and Solana. They appear to be a powerful incentive on Filecoin, too.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOf the dozen liquid staking protocols tracked by DefiLlama, all have grown at least 48% in the past month. But GLIF, the largest, has separated itself from the pack.\n\nGLIF is a long-running project on Filecoin. It built one of the blockchain\u2019s first wallets, according to founder Jon Schwartz. When Filecoin developers added smart contract functionality in March 2023, GLIF built a liquid staking service.\n\nDeposits to GLIF have skyrocketed since early February, when it announced a $4.5 million raise and the launch of a points system sometime in the first quarter of the year.\n\nSince then, the total value of crypto locked in GLIF has more than doubled. On February 22, user activity briefly overloaded GLIF\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cYear-to-date, GLIF\u2019s increase in net deposits of [about] 6.9 million FIL accounted for nearly 76% of the total DeFi net deposits on Filecoin,\u201d Grigore said. That figure doesn\u2019t account for collateral posted by borrowers on GLIF.\n\nSchwartz attributes the jump to points and to growing comfort with Filecoin.\n\nWhen Filecoin developers launched the blockchain in October 2020, there were only 11 built-in smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThat would be analogous to Ethereum having, say, 11 smart contracts, and those were the only ones you could really use on the network,\u201d Schwartz told DL News. \u201cNo developers like myself could deploy custom smart contract logic to the chain.\u201d\n\nThat changed last March, when developers introduced smart contract functionality.\n\nThat change brought Ethereum-style smart contracts on Filecoin, enabling DeFi use cases, \u201cnotably liquid staking,\u201d Grigore said.\n\nSchwartz believes the blockchain is now reaping the benefits of that paradigm change.\n\n\u201cYou know how these things go, especially with new and immature networks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time for DeFi to develop and for people to get comfortable.\u201d\n\nLiquid leasing\n\nLiquid staking is the biggest business on Ethereum. As of Wednesday, users had deposited more than $46 billion in cryptocurrencies in Ethereum\u2019s three dozen liquid staking protocols.\n\nThat\u2019s because it addresses a key issue with Ethereum\u2019s so-called proof-of-stake security system, which was adopted in September 2022.\n\nIn a proof-of-stake system, security, as well as the privilege of confirming and ordering transactions, comes from users willing to lock up, or stake, their Ether in exchange for a modest annual yield.\n\nLiquid staking protocols address the opportunity cost that comes with locking away one\u2019s Ether by issuing derivative tokens, which typically trade at par with Ether and are accepted in its stead by decentralised exchanges and lending protocols.\n\nFilecoin isn\u2019t a proof-of-stake blockchain, and Schwartz prefers to call GLIF a \u201cliquid leasing\u201d protocol.\n\n\u201cThat said, the problem space the GLIF is filling for Filecoin is pretty much the same problem space that, say, Lido is building for Ethereum, or Jito for Solana,\u201d he said, referring to other blockchains\u2019 liquid staking protocols. \u201cBut the mechanisms are different.\u201d\n\nFilecoin\u2019s big year\n\nIt\u2019s just the beginning of what could be a busy year for Filecoin.\n\nEarlier this month, Filecoin and Solana project Triton One announced a partnership, in which Triton would store Solana data on Filecoin.\n\nDevelopers behind billion-dollar decentralised exchange Uniswap deployed the protocol to Filecoin this week. SushiSwap developers launched their decentralised exchange on the blockchain in November.\n\n\u201cA lot of these new projects that have components that were built on the [smart contract functionality] \u2026 they\u2019ll come out this year,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to look like a different Filecoin, simply because what\u2019s possible this year was not possible in the three, four years prior,\u201d he added.\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent for DL News.

        "title": "Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: ETH, DOGE, SHIB - crypto.news",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was highly prosperous last week, witnessing a remarkable 16% surge in the global crypto market cap to $2.32 trillion. During this positive trend, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are among the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into Monday.\n\nETH, DOGE, and SHIB prices \u2013 March 3 | Source: Santiment\n\nETH breaches $3,400\n\nETH is up 9.6% this week.\n\nAs Bitcoin (BTC) garnered significant attention from market participants this week, Ethereum capitalized on the rally, achieving substantial surges beyond crucial psychological thresholds that had historically posed formidable challenges during its previous rallies.\n\nAt the onset of the week, Ethereum started on a positive note, securing an impressive three-day winning streak spanning from Feb. 26 to Feb. 28. During this period, the cryptocurrency overcame the psychological resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,300.\n\nRemarkably, Feb. 28 stood out as Ethereum\u2019s most bullish day, with the asset surging 4.40% amid Bitcoin\u2019s rally beyond $63,000. However, ETH experienced a pullback on Feb. 29 after reaching a peak of $3,521. The last time ETH saw the $3,500 level was in April 2022, before the Terra-induced price slump.\n\nAfter retesting $3,500 on Feb. 29 due to increased exchange outflows, Ethereum faced intense bearish pressure, resulting in a 1.33% decline \u2014 this marked Ethereum\u2019s first intraday loss for the week. Nonetheless, a recovery campaign on March 1 saw ETH breach and retain $3,400.\n\nDespite facing selling pressure attributed to rising exchange inflows and a potentially overbought RSI, Ethereum has managed to stay above $3,400, currently trading for $3,411 at the reporting time.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin options surge to $500m as whales apply cautious strategies\n\nDOGE records a 55% surge\n\nWhile Ethereum recorded a bullish week, its gains pale compared to Dogecoin. Notably, DOGE emerged as one of the most significant beneficiaries of the market uptrend despite commencing the week at a modest price of $0.08611.\n\nBefore the recent rally, Dogecoin had been in a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $0.094 and $0.076 since the beginning of the year, with $0.09438 acting as a formidable resistance level. On Feb. 27, DOGE successfully surpassed this threshold, rallying to a peak of $0.10058.\n\nFollowing the correction at the $0.10 resistance, Dogecoin maintained its position above the $0.094 level, concluding Feb. 27 at $0.00766 with an impressive 9.45% intraday gain. The meme coin built on this momentum, achieving a substantial 18.69% gain on Feb. 28, as it surpassed the $0.11 and $0.12 levels.\n\nDOGE sustained its uptrend until it hit a 16-month high of $0.15074 on March 2. This price represented a 75% increase from Dogecoin\u2019s weekly opening price of $0.08611. The token expectedly faced stern resistance at $0.15, but held up well above $0.14, closing the day at $0.14206.\n\nIn a notable retracement from the March 2 highs, Dogecoin has experienced a 6.07% drop today as the market corrects from the week-long uptrend. Despite these bearish developments, DOGE maintains a considerable 55% gain for the week, currently trading at $0.13335.\n\nSHIB makes it to the top gainers\u2019 list\n\nThe crypto market witnessed a resurgence of meme coins amid the uptrend, with Shiba Inu surfacing as one of the biggest gainers. SHIB began the week at the $0.000009 level, a threshold it had continued to trade at amid the previous market bearish consolidation phase.\n\nShiba Inu held above $0.000009 at the time, looking to leverage the threshold as a springboard for more substantial gains when a market uptrend comes up. This plan went well, as the asset took advantage of the Bitcoin rally to secure one of the most substantial weekly gains in the market.\n\nSHIB recorded multiple substantial intraday gains, with the lowest coming in at 4.18% on Feb. 26.\n\nThe month of March bode well for the token, as it recorded its largest intraday gains on March 1 and March 2 soaring 34.33% and 33.93%, respectively. SHIB eventually flipped MATIC, DOT and TRX to become the 12th largest asset by market cap.\n\nAmid these price surges, SHIB breached the $0.00001 and $0.00002 zones, soaring to a 22-month high of $0.00002390 on March 2 before witnessing a retracement. Despite the retracement, Shiba Inu has retained a spot among the top 5 gainers this week, changing hands at $0.00002176 amid a 125% weekly gain."

Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nA watershed event awaits\n\nSuch numbers come at a time when the L2 proponents and the broader Ethereum ecosystem were eagerly awaiting for the Dencun Upgrade. The biggest upgrade since last year\u2019s Shapella, Dencun was expected to bring about a whopping 10x reduction in L2 transaction fees.\n\nIf these estimates come true, the ETH L2 ecosystem might hold the vast majority of all DeFi users and apps in the near future."

And if you need a quick way to get caught up on the latest moves around crypto video games, we\u2019re debuting This Week in Crypto Games.\n\nOur weekend roundup serves up the biggest news from the past week, along with a few other tidbits you might have missed. We also showcase a few of our original stories from the week.\n\nBiggest news\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPortal token launches: You\u2019ve probably heard about this one if you follow the crypto gaming world at all. The long-awaited PORTAL token launched Thursday following a huge airdrop farming campaign across Twitter, and it popped above a $500 million market cap before cooling off. Portal is a cross-chain gaming platform designed to bridge the gap between games and networks, and there\u2019s still a ton of hype around it.\n\nParallel open beta: NFT card game Parallel, which we picked as our 2023 game of the year, is now available for anyone to hop in and play following Thursday\u2019s launch of the open beta. Think Hearthstone but with added complexity, an appealing space opera vibe, and collectible NFT cards. Now one of crypto\u2019s brightest games is available for anyone to check out.\n\nDookey Dash cash: We already knew that Yuga Labs plans to bring back last year\u2019s viral crypto gaming sensation Dookey Dash, albeit without NFT gating. And now we know that the free-to-play version\u2014Dookey Dash: Unclogged\u2014will still offer serious prizes, with a prize pool of more than $1 million set to be offered up when the game launches this month.\n\nSpeaking of Dookey Dash: Unclogged\u2014Rug Radio creator Gabriele \"Orangie\" Leyva went hands-on with an early version provided by Yuga Labs and shared the following preview with Decrypt's GG:\n\nEx-PlayStation boss joins READYgg: This news flew under the radar a bit, but former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden was announced last week as an advisor for READYgg, a crypto gaming infrastructure startup. He\u2019s apparently keen on NFT tech being used for user-generated games, for example, and will use his connections and influence to help more game developers embrace the space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nICYMI\n\nThe original Stormtrooper design from \u201cStar Wars: A New Hope\u201d will be featured in Solana gaming platform MixMob, but there\u2019s an interesting backstory to the deal .\n\nArbitrum layer-3 gaming network Xai launched staking rewards last week, which will roll out in phases. Here\u2019s what you need to know .\n\nCrypto gaming startup Gala launched its GalaSwap decentralized exchange (DEX) last week on its new layer-1 network\u2014and there are trading rewards.\n\nTelegram game Notcoin will start to purge mined coins from inactive game accounts ahead of the upcoming token drop on The Open Network (TON).\n\nLong-running Ethereum NFT card game Gods Unchained has finally gone mobile with last week\u2019s launch of iOS and Android versions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Arcade promotion will showcase games building on the Ethereum scaler and offer up $200K worth of grants to content creators.\n\nImmutable said last week that it has now onboarded 200,000 users to Immutable Passport, a streamlined wallet designed for non-crypto natives.\n\nNot crypto, but AI\u2014Google\u2019s DeepMind team revealed a demo for an AI tool that can generate video games on the fly based on a user prompt. Wild.\n\nGG spotlight\n\nHere are a few of our original stories from this past week that we think are well worth a weekend read:"

        "content": "An Ethereum trader has achieved a remarkable feat by turning a mere 0.7 ETH into a staggering $1.39 million in just three weeks.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain monitoring, the story began when this trader spent 0.7 ETH ($1,848) on February 14 to buy 4.26 million GPU tokens. At the time, GPU had only been live for two months.\n\nIn just 21 days, this trader made ~$1.39M with only 0.7 $ETH($1,848), a gain of 755x! He spent 0.7 $ETH($1,848) to buy 4.26M $GPU on Feb 14, when $GPU had been online for more than 2 months. Then sold 3.37M $GPU for 102 $ETH($336K), with 891K $GPU ($1.06M) left.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kUMLpPR0iu \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 6, 2024\n\nCapitalizing on the token\u2019s price surge after their initial purchase, this trader then sold 3.37 million GPU for 102 ETH ($336,000) several hours before press time.\n\n755x Return in 21 Days\n\nOn-chain data shows that this investor still holds 891,000 GPU ($1.06 million) tokens in their wallet.\n\nIf the trader were to offload their renaming GPU tokens worth $1.06 million, they would make a total profit of $1.39 million, which translates to a 755x return on their investment. This final figure is obtained by adding the $336,000 profit already taken to their $1.06 million unrealized profit.\n\nWhat is GPU?\n\nGPU is the native token of Node AI, a decentralized platform that provides access to GPU and AI resources, utilizing blockchain to \u201ccreate a secure and transparent environment for users.\u201d GPU facilitates various activities within the platform, including revenue sharing and renting AI servers with high GPU capabilities.\n\nSince its launch, GPU has been printing impressive numbers.
