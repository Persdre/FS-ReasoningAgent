        "title": "Brief History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche curiosity into a mainstream financial phenomenon, transforming how we think about money, technology, and business. It began with the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency that promised a decentralized, secure, and immutable way to transfer value across the globe. Bitcoin's success paved the way for Ethereum, a platform that expanded the potential of blockchain technology with its smart contracts and decentralized applications. As the crypto landscape continued to evolve, new innovations like the BlockDAG Network emerged, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional blockchain architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article explores the fascinating history of cryptocurrency, from the inception of Bitcoin to the rise of Ethereum and the cutting-edge developments in BlockDAG Network, providing a comprehensive overview of the journey and the impact these technologies have had on the world.\n\nBitcoin: The Genesis of Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin, often hailed as digital gold, revolutionized the financial world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. The brainchild of a pseudonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's white paper was released on October 28, 2008. The document introduced a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, enabling digital value transfer between parties without intermediaries like banks. This system utilized a blockchain, a chain of transactions stored on multiple computers competing to process and store transactions. This process, known as mining, created new Bitcoin BTC tokens and ensured the network's security and decentralization.\n\nThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. At the time, 10,000 BTC was worth $41. As Bitcoin's value surged over the years, reaching peaks like $70,000 in March 2024, this transaction became a legendary story in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's journey from a cryptographic novelty to a multi-trillion-dollar asset involved overcoming significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and security breaches. However, its decentralized, immutable, and divisible nature made it a revolutionary global financial instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum: Beyond Currency to Decentralized Applications\n\nWhile Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced a decentralized platform for running smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's unique feature is its Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that run exactly as programmed without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. This innovation opened the door to numerous applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network by compensating miners for computational work and transaction validation. Despite facing volatility and security challenges, Ethereum has solidified its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network: The Next Evolution in Blockchain Technology\n\nThe traditional blockchain architecture, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, operates on a linear sequence of blocks. While effective, this model faces scalability issues, particularly with increasing transaction volumes. Enter BlockDAG Network , a novel approach that aims to address these limitations.\n\nBlockDAG has attracted investor\u2019s attention and capital as a decentralized network structure where transactions are arranged in a graph format rather than a linear chain. This architecture allows multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, significantly enhancing transaction throughput and scalability. Key characteristics of BlockDAG networks include parallel transactions, enhanced scalability, and improved security.\n\nNow BlockDAG Network has attracted even more attention within the industry with the release of its second keynote video, humorously titled \u201cFrom the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe project's presale has amassed over $40 million in record time for any cryptocurrency or digital asset initiative. This impressive funding surge underscores the rising interest in BlockDAG Network as a new store of value and passive income generator, akin to Bitcoin.\n\nThe momentum behind BlockDAG Network suggests that the $40 million raised is merely the beginning of what is poised to be a groundbreaking force in the digital market.\n\nThe Evolution of Crypto Assets and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's brief surpassing of $70,000 on Monday marked a peak amidst a fourth consecutive week of inflows into crypto investment products. CoinShares International Ltd. reported $185 million in inflows for the week ending May 31, with $2 billion invested in May alone. This surge underscored the growing institutional interest and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, characterized by its volatility, continues to evolve with significant developments like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe journey from Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network illustrates the rapid evolution and diversification of cryptocurrency technologies. From enabling peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized applications to enhancing scalability and security, these innovations are reshaping the financial landscape.\n\nThe digital evolution promises not only to disrupt traditional financial systems but also to democratize access to financial services, empowering users worldwide.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Should Ethereum Layer 2s Urgently Decentralize Their Sequencers? - Unchained",
        "content": "After Layer 2 network Linea halted block production this week, many demanded the sequencers be decentralized. But is it necessary?\n\nThe recent temporary halt of block production on Consensys\u2019 Linea network following a $6.8 million exploit on the Velocore DEX, has renewed the debate about decentralizing sequencers in Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Amidst this, on Wednesday, Optimism passed a proposal to implement fraud proofs. Although this wouldn\u2019t help decentralize the sequencer, it would propel the blockchain to what\u2019s referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d decentralization on layer 2s.\n\nSequencers\n\nin layer 2 solutions are entities that order and batch transactions before submitting them to the layer 1 blockchain, enabling more transactions per second at a lower cost. However, the centralization of these sequencers has raised concerns about security and censorship.\n\nLearn more: What Are Sequencers in Layer 2 Protocols?\n\nSteven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, which develops Ethereum\u2019s top L2, Arbitrum, told Unchained that it\u2019s important to properly contextualize when discussing sequencers: \u201cThe term \u2018sequencer\u2019 means different things in different protocols.\u201d The sequencer\u2019s role is to order transactions, thus the definition. While this centralized component allows for faster transaction processing, it could censor by delaying transactions, though it cannot alter account balances or post illegitimate transactions. This safeguard is ensured by a network of validators that can challenge any incorrect actions via a fraud-proof mechanism.\n\nTherefore, according to Goldfeder, while the sequencer is centralized, the validation process is not, involving entities like Offchain Labs, Consensys, and even Google. However, Goldfeder highlighted that the \u201choly grail\u201d is that everyone can validate. To achieve that, in the next couple weeks, they expect to roll out Arbitrum Bold, a new protocol for managing disputes on Arbitrum chains that enables permissionless validation. Goldfeder suggests that while decentralizing sequencers is an important problem, it is a \u201cbit smaller than what a lot of people might expect.\u201d\n\nChristine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy Digital, believes that decentralization is a spectrum and that fault-proof mechanisms alone do not ensure decentralization. \u201cRollups in general are significantly less decentralized and secure than the base layer, Ethereum.\u201d However, she thinks that having a working fault-proof mechanism does not mean that a rollup is more decentralized than another because \u201cworking fault proofs is not the only mechanism that rollups need to achieve higher levels of decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she told Unchained via email.\n\nHaseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly, concurs, noting that while Arbitrum has fault proofs, they are currently whitelist-only. \u201cThe important thing about sequencers is not decentralizing so much as making the sequencers more robust. That almost certainly comes first,\u201d he told Unchained.\n\nEven though fault proofs are not the only measure of decentralization for L2s, of the top five L2s by TVL, only Arbitrum has a fraud system in place. Optimism, Base, Blast and Mantle, currently lack fraud-proof mechanisms, meaning their sequencers have more power over transaction outcomes. \u201cBasically they have a dictator,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\n\u201cWe need fault proofs on OP Stack, and then we need fault proofs to be reliable enough that anybody should be able to submit them, and move away from security councils and multisigs,\u201d Qureshi said.\n\nKim argues that while optimistic rollups should work towards decentralizing their sequencers, they must also build working fault proofs, robust governance mechanisms, reduce reliance on admin controls, lower fees, and improve interoperability with other rollups. \u201cA decentralized sequencer may be one of the hardest initiatives for a rollup to work towards but certainly not the only important one in the near-term to improve a rollup\u2019s decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she added.\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "title": "All of Michael Saylor\u2019s Ethereum predictions were wrong - Protos",
        "content": "Michael Saylor has made a lot of predictions during his career. And because he became a billionaire in the process, many assume that his forecasts are generally accurate. For example, Bitcoiners applauded his support for \u2014 and multi-billion dollar purchases of \u2014 bitcoin. He invested at the right times and prices and has earned billions in profit. So when Saylor decided to place a bet on the future of Ethereum, millions listened.\n\nUnfortunately, Saylor got all of his predictions about Ethereum totally wrong.\n\nFirst, he predicted that the SEC would classify Ethereum as an unregistered security. At his corporate conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, he said, \u201cSometime this summer it will become very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity.\u201d\n\nSecond, Saylor predicted that US stock markets would never list a spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cIt will never be wrapped in a spot ETF. It will not be accepted by Wall Street; it will not be accepted by mainstream institutional investors.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that spot bitcoin ETFs would be the first and last type of spot cryptocurrency ETF. Pointing to the Bitcoin logo, he said, \u201cThis is the one, universal, consensus-accepted, institutional-grade crypto asset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d\n\nEvery one of those predictions turned out to be wrong within five weeks.\n\nRead more: Michael Saylor dumps quarter billion worth of MSTR while hyping bitcoin\n\nSaylor lost all his bets on Ethereum\n\nDespite Joe Lubin\u2019s ConsenSys lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that commissioners secretly classified Ethereum as a security in some redacted document, there\u2019s no public evidence that they have actually done so.\n\nRead more: ConsenSys says the SEC designated ETH a security but won\u2019t say where\n\nFurthermore, the SEC recently approved three 19b-4 exchange rule change requests from three US stock markets \u2014 NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE \u2014 to list spot ether ETFs. With those landmark approvals out of the way, the SEC will soon review and is widely expected to approve associated S-1 filings from up to nine ETF sponsors.\n\nWorse for Saylor, those sponsors include the largest and most mainstream Wall Street institutions imaginable: BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Ark, and others.\n\nThat sets a final score for Saylor\u2019s three bets on Ethereum at 0-3: no SEC unregistered securities designation (yet, at least), likely SEC spot ether ETF approval, and mainstream institutional investor support.\n\nSaylor lost many bets, then won one\n\nOf course, Saylor has lost other bets during his career. For example, he lost $15 million in his bet that Washington DC wouldn\u2019t notice his $25 million tax evasion scheme. A few days ago, he agreed to pay $40 million to resolve his tax fraud lawsuit.\n\nSaylor also lost $8.5 million in his bet that he would avoid an SEC penalty for declaring false financials during the dot-com mania. He paid $8.2 million in stock plus $350,000 to settle.\n\nSaylor also lost an uncomfortable number of bets about the best corporate strategy for MicroStrategy for two full decades. From late 2000 through 2020, MicroStrategy stock failed to rally anywhere close to an all-time high despite Saylor\u2019s continuous leadership. Finally, in recent months, and thanks to an improved price of bitcoin, shares are approximately two-thirds of their way back to their dot-com highs.\n\nIn all, Saylor got a lot of bets wrong in his career, but only one mattered. His prediction that bitcoin was worth buying on margin has made up for all of his previous and subsequent errors. His company, MicroStrategy, owns 214,400 bitcoins today worth over $15 billion after buying at an average price of $35,180 per coin. With the crypto trading at double that price today, MicroStrategy has doubled its $7.5 billion investment.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "content": "The Base ecosystem, incubated within Coinbase, is a Layer-2 solution designed to make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable, reduce transaction costs, and improve dApp user experiences.\n\nDespite ties to a centralized exchange, the project aims for progressive decentralization, which is critical for an open cryptoeconomy. Built on the OP Stack, Base ensures security, stability, and scalability for on-chain apps.\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Base has become one of the fastest-growing Layer-2 networks with nearly $2 billion in total value locked.\n\nNote: Base currently has no plans to introduce a new token; it uses ETH as its gas token. Be wary of potential scams offering fake Base tokens.\n\nThe following Base guide explores the ecosystem\u2019s growth metrics & potential, leading projects, and a step-by-step guide to use it.\n\nAbout the Base Ecosystem: The Vibe\n\nBase significantly benefits from its integration with Coinbase\u2019s large user base, which has helped usher in rapid user adoption and project integration.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in North America with nearly 100 million users. The integration with Base has enabled seamless fiat onramps and access to a large user base.\n\nBase operates as a decentralized network, and Coinbase does not intervene in its daily operations. While Coinbase supports the ecosystem, Base maintains its decentralized nature by operating independently, utilizing the OP Stack for scalability and security.\n\nThe benefits of the Base blockchain for developers are numerous. Beyond financial investments, the Base ecosystem fund frequently offers developer grants and organizes hackathons. So far, it has invested in projects like:\n\nAvanti, an oracle-based synthetic derivatives protocol, that allows users to trade crypto and real-world assets with up to 100x leverage and earn yield as a market-maker by providing USDC liquidity.\n\nBSX, a decentralized limit order book, that combines the best of CeFi and DeFi trading experiences, offering features like cross-collateralization, powerful cross-margining, and self-custody.\n\nOnboard , a project that provides an onchain, self-custodial path for users to onramp and offramp crypto in a peer-to-peer manner through their own MPC wallet and smart contracts, focusing on developing markets.\n\nOpenCover, t he first Layer 2 insurance aggregator that works with underwriters to protect DeFi users against onchain risks such as smart contract hacks and oracle failures.\n\nt Paragraph, an onchain creator platform that helps creators publish, share, and monetize their content using permissionless protocols, enabling novel onchain mechanisms like turning posts into collectibles.\n\nTruflation, an onchain financial oracle providing automated, independent daily inflation reporting by compiling data from millions of points and sources, offering a higher fidelity picture of inflation.\n\nBase\u2019s Coinbase link gets its foot in the door with potential partnerships with institutional investors, enterprises, and developer communities. These partnerships could lead to larger-scale projects and collaborations that drive substantial value for the ecosystem.\n\nAbout Base Ecosystem: The Numbers\n\nBase saw its first notable spurt of activity and TVL in September 2023, but its most significant in Q2 2024.\n\nBase\u2019s blockchain total value locked in 2024 is nearly $2 billion as of writing.\n\nBase saw its daily transactions jump from 500,000 in March 2024 to over 3 million in April 2024.\n\nAround the same time, Base broke the $1 billion in total value bridged and currently has about $2.1 trillion of total value bridged, with ETH taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nBy April 2024, Base had over 400,000 sign-ups and a cumulative trading volume surpassing $1 billion, driven by a memecoin frenzy.\n\nBase Explorer is the recommended chain explorer.\n\nAbout Base: The Tech\n\nBase, like other \u201coptimistic rollups,\u201d assumes transactions are valid initially, reducing computational overhead. Suspicious transactions undergo fraud-proof verification, maintaining low costs.\n\nDefinition: optimistic rollup (noun)\u2013 Transactions are initially assumed to be valid, hence \u201coptimistic,\u201d and are later validated on-chain. A fraud-proof mechanism is triggered to verify its validity if any transaction is suspected to be fraudulent. This allows for significant scalability and efficiency improvements while leveraging the underlying blockchain\u2019s security. Several other blockchain projects also utilize optimistic rollups for scaling, including the pioneering Optimism, Arbitrum, and Boba Network.\n\nBase is designed to seamlessly integrate with Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other chains. Base offers cost-effective EVM features, developer-friendly APIs, and smart contract wallets. As the second core dev team on the OP Stack, Base collaborates with OP Labs to build a robust, interoperable web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe Base RPC Endpoint is here: https://mainnet.base.org.\n\nNetwork information can be found here: https://docs.base.org/docs/network-information\n\nBase is a decentralized Ethereum scaling solution, helping boost transaction speed and reduce costs.\n\nUnlike traditional Layer-1 blockchains (like Ethereum), which handle transactions individually, Base consolidates them into batches, processing them more efficiently and economically before recording them on Ethereum.\n\nHow to Use Base\n\nUsing Base, or any Layer-2, requires jumping through a few hoops. Basically, you\u2019re going to move funds from the Ethereum base layer onto Layer-2.\n\nStep 1 Choose your Wallet: Use MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStep 2: Change/Add Network (top left corner)\n\nYou\u2019ll probably see Base pop up, but just make sure it matches the below criteria:\n\nRPC Endpoint: https://mainnet.base.org`\n\nChain ID: 8453\n\nCurrency Symbol: ETH\n\nStep 3 Bridge ETH: Bridge ETH from Ethereum or other EVM chains to Base once connected.\n\nDefinition: Bridge (noun, verb) \u2013 transferring assets, like ETH, from one blockchain network to another. This involves moving your cryptocurrency from its original network (e.g., Ethereum) to a new network (e.g., Base) so you can use it within the new ecosystem. The bridge ensures that the value of your assets remains intact while allowing them to be utilized on different blockchain networks.\n\n\ud83d\udca9Note: While the gas fees are significantly lower on Base, you still have to pay ETH\u2019s Layer-1 fees to bridge funds.\n\nBlock Explorer: Https://basescan.org\n\nFor more details, visit https://www.base.org.\n\nMost Popular Base Projects\n\nDeFi\n\nThe most active (based on unique active wallets) dApps in the Base ecosystem are decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, 1inch Network, SushiSwap V3, and Compound.\n\nAerodrome, a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base\u2019s central liquidity hub, is a stand-out infrastructure in the Base ecosystem.\n\nMemecoins\n\nMemecoins such as TOSHI, TYBG, NORMIE, and BRETT drive significant trading volumes and transactional activity on Base.\n\nAs of writing, the $BRETT memecoin is having its moment in the sun.\n\nOther Base Ecosystem dApps\n\nDmail Network is a social messaging platform offering email and marketing services; Dmail Network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient communication within the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nParallel is a popular trading card game that integrates social elements.\n\nFrens On Chain is a unique digital pet project featuring dynamic NFTs.\n\nFinal Thoughts: From Coinbase to Base\n\nThe Base ecosystem, while backed by Coinbase, is designed to be a cornerstone for the decentralized future of blockchain technology.\n\nCoinbase is already credited with advancing and advocating cryptocurrency adoption to a mainstream audience, and its contributions have undoubtedly helped shape the United States policy toward cryptocurrency.\n\nBase, a decentralized Layer-2, is an exciting move from the organization and one of its first forays with direct entrepreneurship and incubation in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also launched the USDC stablecoin, an ERC-20, through CENTRE, a Coinbase-founded organization, and in collaboration with Circle.\n\nMuch of the Base hype revolves around memecoins\u2013 similar to how Solana\u2019s ecosystem received a significant pump in activity and TVL in Q1 2024. However, given its growth within the Coinbase ecosystem and beyond, the project\u2019s potential shouldn\u2019t be overlooked."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst\n\nIn late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMany consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF\u2019s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching.\n\nThe firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin\u2019s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale.\n\nMany believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications. In the long run, these use cases could potentially elevate Ethereum over Bitcoin, as Ethereum may have more room to adapt to changing market conditions. However, as it stands, Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin, which is expected to be reflected in ETF trading figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Sandbox, an Ethereum metaverse game platform, announced Wednesday that it has raised $20 million in convertible promissory notes at a $1 billion valuation. That makes the long-running project the latest crypto \u201cunicorn,\u201d based on the billion-dollar valuation.\n\nThe latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox\u2019s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited. LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures also participated in the round.\n\n\"We are deeply honored by the continuing commitment to the vision of The Sandbox, and we're incredibly excited about the future of composable user-generated content games,\" said Animoca co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu, in a statement.\n\nWith the new funding in tow, The Sandbox\u2019s development team said that its key priorities include improving creator tools, adding new social and gameplay features, and developing a mobile version scheduled for 2025.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Sandbox is one of the most prominent blockchain games, thanks to partnerships with over 400 celebrities and brands\u2014including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, and Paris Hilton\u2014and previously immense demand for in-game land plots sold via NFTs. In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg\u2019s metaverse mansion in 2021.\n\nThe game\u2019s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko. However, the price of its NFT land plots has fallen sharply since metaverse hype peaked in early 2022\u2014from 3.9 ETH ($11,700) to 0.08 ETH ($300) today.\n\n\"Our mission at The Sandbox is to develop creative tools and technologies that bring fairness and new opportunities for all types of creators in the open metaverse,\" said The Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid, in a release.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin is Unhappy With This Cycle\u2019s Celebrity Experimentation - Unchained",
        "content": "Celebrity memecoins have been the latest craze to dominate the crypto space, but Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin says there needs to be more to these projects than what\u2019s currently on offer.\n\nVitalik Buterin would prefer if celebrity crypto projects more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since celebrity tokens broke into the crypto space, with famous personalities like Davido, Iggy Azalea, Rich The Kid, Trippie Redd, and Caitlyn Jenner all launching memecoins that saw large boosts of trading activity.\n\nIn most cases, these tokens associated with celebrities saw wild upswings in price, followed by a sharp and rapid plunge in value. One exception is Azalea\u2019s Solana-based MOTHER token which surged 2,260% after an initial decline and now sits at a market cap of over $100 million.\n\nThe frenzy around the token prompted a Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske to tweet that if MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation it would also be \u201cthe mother of this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation.\u201d\n\nBurniske\u2019s comments invoked a response from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said he was feeling \u201cquite unhappy with \u2018this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation\u2019 so far.\u201d\n\nIn order for a celebrity crypto project to gain his respect, Buterin said it would have to offer form of public-good end goal, rather than simply enrich the celebrity who issued the token and early adopters.\n\nIn his view, these projects would have more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\n\u201cAs much as I dislike token voting DAOs, at least they give *something* for people to do and organize around. The DAO should not fully decide the agenda, but it can have some influence,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cMake something that lasts 10+ years, rather than bubbling around for a few months and then being forgotten.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin doesn\u2019t have a problem with memecoins itself, saying in a March blog post on the subject that he valued people\u2019s desire to have fun, and would rather the crypto space swim with this current than against it.\n\n\u201cI want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just by \u201cbringing in users\u201d) get more mindshare,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nData from Kaito AI shared last month shows that memes were the most dominant crypto narrative after AI, growing its mindshare within the market by 53% from the start of the year until May."

        "title": "VanEck predicts ETH will hit $22,000 by 2030 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "VanEck believes Ethereum (ETH) will be worth roughly $22,000 by 2030, the asset manager said in a comprehensive analysis published on June 5.\n\nThe forecast, developed by the firm\u2019s Digital Assets Research team, led by Matthew Sigel, highlights Ethereum\u2019s strong growth potential within both traditional and cryptocurrency-focused portfolios.\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis attributes the optimistic price target to Ethereum\u2019s expanding role as a high-growth, internet-native commercial system that could disrupt traditional financial sectors and Big Tech platforms.\n\nThe report emphasized Ethereum\u2019s significant user base and economic activity, noting that the network currently supports approximately 20 million monthly active users, facilitates $4 trillion in annual settlement value, and oversees $308 billion in digital assets.\n\n$2 trillion market cap\n\nVanEck\u2019s valuation model for ETH is based on a forecast of $66 billion in free cash flows \u2014 the amount of money generated by a blockchain network \u2014 by 2030, with a 33x valuation multiple on those cash flows.\n\nThe model considers Ethereum\u2019s potential to disrupt various business sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to the report, the Ethereum network is poised to capture substantial market share from traditional financial markets and technology giants.\n\nIf Ethereum maintains its dominance among smart contract platforms, VanEck sees a credible path to generating $66 billion in free cash flow \u2014 the amount of money generated by a blockchain network \u2014 for token holders \u2014 supporting a $2.2 trillion market capitalization and a $22,000 price per ETH by 2030.\n\nRevolutionary asset\n\nThe company emphasized ETH\u2019s broad use cases, stating:\n\n\u201cWe believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.\u201d\n\nVanEck cited ETH\u2019s role as \u201cdigital oil\u201d consumed in on-chain use and called it \u201cprogrammable money and a yield-bearing commodity.\u201d\n\nIt also referred to ETH as an internet reserve currency that prices activity and assets in Ethereum\u2019s $1 billion ecosystem and connecting blockchains.\n\nAccording to the report, Ethereum generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, surpassing some web2 apps like Etsy, Twitch, and Roblox. Meanwhile, its 20 million monthly active users surpass Instacart, Robinhood, and Vrbo.\n\nVanEck added that ETH offers cost-saving features, better interconnectivity for social applications, the opportunity to share earnings with end users, and a basis for AI applications.\n\nInvestment risks\n\nWhile the report is optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, it also emphasizes several risks associated with investing in ETH.\n\nOne major concern is Ethereum\u2019s reliance on speculative activities, which could lead to significant downside risk if market sentiment shifts.\n\nRegulatory changes pose another risk, as they could classify ETH as a security, thereby imposing stringent legal requirements on Ethereum-based businesses. The competitive landscape is also a threat, with emerging technologies like Solana challenging its market dominance.\n\nAdditionally, government actions to control non-sovereign financial systems could negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "3 Top Cryptos Worth Holding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Tokenist",
        "content": "Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nAmong thousands of cryptocurrencies, it is clear that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the public spotlight and are likely to take more capital inflows in the future. So much so that even Ethereum is poised to become an institutional investment vehicle via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining Bitcoin.\n\nOut of a total $2.63 trillion market cap, including stablecoins, ETH and BTC make 70% of the crypto pie. Year-to-date, Bitcoin and Ethereum are neck and neck, having gained 60% and 62% value, respectively.\n\nHowever, the larger the market cap, the harder it is to move the price upwards, just like in the stock market. This is why many low-cap memecoins performed well during 2024, driven by speculation and memory.\n\nYet, engaging in memecoins is exceedingly risky. Most traders can\u2019t tell if they are riding from the top to the bottom, holding the devalued bags, or riding from the bottom to the top, enjoying substantial profits. After all, memecoins\u2019 value is inherently unclear, which makes them so speculative in the first place.\n\nTo that end, prospective crypto investors should look into these infrastructure cryptocurrencies, which are backed by developers, funding, and clear goals.\n\nImmutable X (IMX)\n\nImmutable X (IMX) is an investor\u2019s exposure to blockchain gaming. While Ethereum is a blockchain network for issuing tokens and smart contracts to power decentralized finance (DeFi) with dApps, it relies on layer 2 networks to scale. Immutable X is one of those networks.\n\nOwing to StarkWare\u2019s zk-rollups technology, Immutable X facilitates zero gas fees for end-users. This contrasts Ethereum\u2019s expensive and volatile gas fees for even simple token transfers. In turn, this is a game changer for game developers who wish to deploy their products at scale.\n\nFor instance, if a game has tradable in-game assets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), like cards or collectible creatures, traders don\u2019t have to worry about long confirmation times and heavy transaction fees. This boosts the in-game economy and player experience, paving the way for blockchain gaming.\n\nPresently, there are over 300 games in Immutable\u2019s funding ecosystem worth $1 billion over 20 marketplaces. Previously known as Fuel Games, Immutable is the parent company in charge of the Immutable X framework for developers to launch their projects with low friction.\n\nThe cryptocurrency itself, IMX, is the utility and governance token of the network. Akin to shareholders of companies, IMX tokenholders get a say in the development of the platform with a voting mechanism. Additionally, developers using the platform pay 2% fee in IMX tokens.\n\nFor comparison, game developers deploying their games on Steam suffer a 30% sales cut. The total IMX token supply is limited, just like Bitcoin, but to a greater extent, it has 2 billion IMX tokens, of which 74% are already in a circulating supply.\n\nYear-to-date, the IMX token has gained 12% value after price correction but 393% over the last year. Given that the Immutable X network is Ethereum-adjacent, the token is likely to revisit previous highs with the prospective launch of ETH ETFs. According to Fortune Business Insights, the blockchain gaming market is forecasted for a 21.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030.\n\nJoin our Telegram group and never miss a breaking story.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nEthereum\u2019s software engineering path relies on layer 2 networks to offload the transaction burden from the main network. Avalanche (AVAX) is a competitive, versatile network that picked another approach.\n\nInstead of users having to jump through network hoops with their Web3 wallets, Avalanche itself has a modular design via subnets. Each subnet has its own rules and consensus mechanisms, but they all operate under the high-throughput Avalanche consensus protocol.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche boosts scaling with three interoperable blockchains within the network. X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain tackle different aspects of the network, like staking, smart contracts, and asset creation.\n\nThis leads to a greater unified experience for the end-user, who still enjoys fast execution and low fees. Moreover, Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain ensures compatibility with Ethereum, enabling users to transfer digital assets with Avalanche Bridge via the Core wallet.\n\nAttesting to Avalanche\u2019s approach to blockchain design, several banks used it to test their future tokenization efforts, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan.\n\nPowering the network\u2019s economy, the AVAX token is limited to 720 million, of which 55% is in circulation. AVAX token holders get a say in the issuance of the remaining supply. Year-to-date, AVAX is down 14%, making for a solid entry point after a one-year value growth of 160%.\n\nFetch.AI (FET)\n\nJust as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reaped the AI hype, Fetch.AI did the same in the blockchain world. The FET token gained 794% value over one year, or 194% YTD. Moving forward, this is crypto investor\u2019s main exposure to the tokenization of AI projects.\n\nThat\u2019s because Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) will all be under the umbrella of the SuperIntelligence Alliance, with its new universal token ASI, poised to merge the market caps of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN tokens.\n\nAfter the merger into ASI, FET tokens will be limited to a 2.63 billion supply. Mirroring the decentralization efforts of finance to counter banks and central banking, the new network\u2019s purpose is to monetize AI development openly and transparently.\n\nThis includes raising funds for AI projects with ASI tokens, paying transaction fees, using it as a governance token for voting, and using it as a utility for open-source AI development. After the merger announcement in mid-April, the FET price has been moving sideways, having dropped by 3%.\n\nWhich types of tokens do you prefer as your main exposure: sound money, generalist DeFI, gaming, or something else? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nDisclaimer: The author does not hold or have a position in any securities discussed in the article."

As these giants attract more capital and attention, the overall market sentiment improves, benefiting projects like Furrever Token. The 25% bonus offer provides a strategic entry point for investors to capitalize on this positive market environment.\n\nFurrever Token\u2019s well-structured tokenomics and strong community engagement further solidify its appeal.

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs \u2018will take some time\u2019 before they launch, according to SEC Chair.\n\nETH's open interest on exchanges surged 50% to a new all-time high after SEC\u2019s U-turn towards ETH ETFs.\n\nNew accumulating addresses holding 10-10K and 10K-100K ETH have grown steadily after ETH ETF 19b-4 approvals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price hovered around $3,860 on Wednesday following Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler expressing his opinion that the launch of spot ETH ETFs may be delayed. Meanwhile, Ethereum derivatives products on exchanges have seen a surge in open interest (OI).\n\nDaily digest market movers: ETH ETFs delay, rising open interest, new accumulating addresses growth\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said spot ETH ETFs would \"take some time\" before they go live on exchanges, indicating S-1 approvals are not imminent. He noted that his agency is still working on disclosure measures with exchanges.\n\nRead more: Ethereum leveraged ETFs go live as price fails to react\n\nAfter the SEC's sudden approval of 19b-4 filings from eight issuers on May 23, several analysts expected the agency to respond to S-1 registration statements quickly. The SEC's request for issuers to submit updated S-1 filings on Friday also seemed to have confirmed the expectations of these analysts.\n\nFollowing the filings, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggested spot ETH ETFs would launch in July. However, with Gensler's recent comments, it may take longer before the ETFs begin trading.\n\nIn other news, open interest (OI) for ETH derivatives products on exchanges reached a new all-time high, rising by 50.3% to $14 billion, according to CCData Exchange Review for May. Notably, open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged by 59.4% to $1.25 billion.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum sustains week-long consolidation, sees over $3 billion exodus from exchanges\n\nMeanwhile, the balance of new accumulating addresses holding between 10 - 10K and 10K to 100K ETH has been growing steadily since the SEC's pivot on ETH ETF, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nETH New Accumulation\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum to maintain sideways trend until spot ETH ETFs launch\n\nEthereum saw a slight gain on Wednesday, trading near $3,860 and continuing its sideways trend.\n\nETH's 30-day MVRV also aligns with the horizontal move, hovering around 6% in the past week. This indicates that the number of Ethereum addresses that purchased the coin within the last 30 days has seen an average of 6% gains.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Bitcoin\u2019s momentum poise to propel crypto market\n\nDespite the horizontal trend, whales are still accumulating ETH, and both long-term and short-term holders will likely hold onto their tokens.\n\nETH may continue its horizontal trend until the official launch of spot ETH ETFs. The $3,618 price level remains key support in case of short-term price swings. In the long term, ETH may overtake the $4,093 resistance and flip the $4,878 level to set a new all-time high of around $5,000.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nQCP Capital analysts also share the bullish view: \"ETH has been lagging on this move, but we expect a catch-up and possibly even outperformance against BTC when the ETH spot ETF begins trading,\" they said.\n\nETH liquidation data shows a total of $23.78 million liquidations, with $13.81 million of liquidated long positions and $9.97 million of shorts, according to data from Coinglass."

It\u2019s a sort of accelerationism and not only because of good execution but also because of contrarianism.\u201d\n\nIn response, Yakovenko, while praising ETH\u2019s decision to prioritize security over scalability, he said,\n\n\u201cPeople think Ethereum is moving slowly but if you look at the size of the network, its value\u2026I would be terrified of any changes to Solana if it was at that value.\u201d\n\nHe further went ahead and added,\n\n\u201cEthereum is at a point which I think every other L1 should be envious of, and try to get there as fast as they can. All of that I think puts it in a class in my mind actually above Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis highlights that Ethereum is still the winner in the L1 space owing to the most network effects, liquidity, maturity, and security, making it pre-ordained to surpass Bitcoin and become number one.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Drake justified that Solana could become the \u2018internet of value\u2019, justifying its $100 billion valuation.\n\nHe further added that SOL\u2019s developers are more focused on building user-targeting products rather than infrastructure, which contributes to its success.\n\nSOL a competitor to ETH?\n\nAdding to the fray, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor, drawing parallels with ETH\u2019s 2020 bull run highlighted Solana\u2019s emergence as a strong Ethereum competitor.\n\nHe best put it when he said,"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are watching the performance of major coins like Ethereum (ETH) and their potential impact on the broader market. One coin that is in the spotlight is Shiba Inu (SHIB). With Ethereum\u2019s price on the rise, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: how high can Shiba Inu go when Ethereum hits $20,000?\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Current Market Performance\n\nIn recent days, SHIB has gained momentum, reaching a low of $0.00002369 and a high of $0.00002577 in the past 24 hours. Currently, SHIB is trading with an 8% surge in its overall performance during this period.\n\nAlso read: Can Solana (SOL) Breach $260 And Hit New ATH in June?\n\nHowever, the meme coin has been down by 10.3% in the last seven days. Despite this temporary setback, SHIB enthusiasts remain confident in the coin\u2019s prospects in the current bull market.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Potential Value with Ethereum at $20,000\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is trading at $3,813, reflecting 30-day gains exceeding 20.3%. For ETH to reach the $20,000 threshold, it would need to increase by 427%.\n\nIf Shiba Inu were to mirror Ethereum\u2019s growth and achieve a 427% increase from its current price, its value could skyrocket to $0.0001282. This price level would be a new all-time high for Shiba Inu, breaching its previous ATH of $0.00008845.\n\nAlso read: Ripple: How Many XRP You Need To Make $5 Million If Price Hits $2?\n\nThe Correlation Between Ethereum and SHIB\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock stats, SHIB has a 69% correlation with the price of ETH, indicating that there is a 69% chance that SHIB will follow ETH if it rises to $20,000.\n\nThis strong correlation suggests that Shiba Inu\u2019s price is heavily influenced by the performance of Ethereum, and a significant surge in ETH\u2019s value could have a profound impact on SHIB\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Poised to Hit $0.0001 in June, Says Leading Analyst"

Fast. pic.twitter.com/8XLtyN5dv5 \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 5, 2024\n\nIn Q1 2020, Ethereum and its solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon had an average of over 250, 000 users daily. Fast forward to Q1 2024, and this number has grown to about 2. 25 million with Layer-2 solutions such as Optimism, Base, and zkSync among others.\n\nThis shift towards layer-2 solutions has seen Ethereum\u2019s mainnet user base reduced to 378,000 active users while Polygon alone has 1. 3 million users, with the other layer-2 networks having approximately 1. 5 million active users in total.\n\nLayer-2 scaling is considered by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as an essential component of Ethereum\u2019s development plan, comparing it to the sharding idea from the previous Eth 2 strategy. This strategy is to promote development in several subcultures of Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the issuer of one of the most popular crypto ETFs, VanEck, has raised its forecast for the Ethereum price to $22,000 by 2030 due to high revenue per user and the ability to attract financial market players and Big Tech.\n\nEther is currently at $3,862 and with the rumors of spot Ether ETFs in the near future, many people are expecting Ethereum to reach new highs. However, some warn that flows into these new crypto ETFs could be lower than that of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe extensive use of layer-2 solutions on Ethereum has increased the network\u2019s user base by more than 2. 25 million daily active users in the first quarter of 2024, which will significantly change the network\u2019s scale and openness."

Discover SCENE\n\nThree UK nationals are charged with orchestrating a $3 million scam related to the \u201cEvolved Apes\u201d NFT collection, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are accused of wire fraud and money laundering in what authorities called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nThe DOJ said the charges stemmed from a 2021 scheme to get NFT collectors to purchase one of \u201c10,000 unique\u201d Ethereum-based NFTs called Evolved Apes that could then be used in an online battle royale game. The defendants made off with 798 ETH, worth around $2.7 million at the time.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. \u201cThey allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Atcha and Waleedh aggressively promoted Evolved Apes, including hiring an unnamed social media influencer to shill the project.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThree United Kingdom nationals charged in connection with \u201cEvolved Apes\u201d NFT scam \ud83d\udd17: https://t.co/PWNHwklVmE pic.twitter.com/TArfjYdR8k \u2014 US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 6, 2024\n\nA pump-and-dump scheme is when investors are enticed to buy an asset based on misleading information. The fraudster uses early interest to drive up the price of the asset, only to sell everything off and disappear\u2014or \u201crug pull\u201d\u2014leaving unwitting victims holding worthless tokens.\n\nAccording to case documents, Waleedh identified himself as the lead marketing manager for Evolved Apes when attempting to withdraw funds that had been stuck on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange that the group was using. When Waleedh was allowed to access the funds, the DOJ alleged, he transferred them to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Hassan.\n\n\u201cDigital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal. As we allege, thousands of people believed these false promises and were tricked into buying these NFTs, including here in the Southern District of New York,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNFT fraud is no game, and those responsible will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf convicted, the trio faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nRug pulls are rampant in the cryptocurrency space. Most recently, two rug pulls made headlines, including in May when a purported \u201cmother and son\u201d duo staged a scandalous livestream to pump the \u201cLIVEMOM\u201d token and made off with $300,000. This was followed by another scheme in which a pseudonymous creator shilled the \u201cHANDS\u201d meme coin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hands, I cannot rug you guys, chill,\u201d the creator said during a livestream on the NoHandsNoRug Twitch channel\u2014only to reveal his hands before selling the 7 SOL accumulated in the scheme, worth around $1,000.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethereum price has been in consolidation for the past few weeks as the market prepares for an S-1 application approval. Ethereum price is currently trading at $3,787, a 0.6% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin broke above $70,000 once more after more than a month of trending below this crucial level and continues its journey to try and break an all-time high.\n\nETH/BTC Price Analysis: Ethereum Price Succumbs to Bitcoin Rally, Can ETH Bounce Back?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH price against Bitcoin witnessed some downward pressure as Bitcoin bulls pushed its price above $70,000 for the first time in the last 30 days. The majority of cryptocurrencies shed some value against BTC, and Ethereum was not left out.\n\nThe price of Ethereum broke downward from the consolidation zone and is headed toward the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around 0.052 BTC. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, this retracement level may act as a zone of support a bounce back higher toward the 27% Fibonacci extension level around 0.06 BTC.\n\nOn the way up, ETH price may encounter resistance around 0.057 BTC, and $0.058 BTC. Conversely, the support structure around 0.052 BTC may prevent the price of ETH from falling lower.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price just broke out of a descending triangle in a classic textbook breakout and retest pattern. BTC price may move higher, with a profit target for this kind of setup anywhere around $74,000. This would establish a new all-time high price for the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin price may find some overhead resistance around $72,200 and $74,000, but on the flip side, a key support level around $67,000 may help keep the price up.\n\nETH/BTC Price Future Outlook\n\nAs the Ethereum community awaits S-1 application approval, the Bitcoin community continues to spearhead mass adoption for the number one crypto. El Salvador, the \u2018Bitcoin State\u2019 now owns 5,660 BTC worth over $402 million, and is still accumulating.\n\nMoreover, the University of Austin, a private Texas institution, will now accept Bitcoin for tuition and create a long-term Bitcoin fund.\n\nMeanwhile, liquid staking and restaking on Ethereum is only gearing up, and much more liquidity is about to hit the ecosystem, a phenomenon that could pump the price of Ethereum even higher. When including liquid staking, Ethereum mainnet TVL came within 2% of its ATH recently\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto community is optimistic about an S-1 Form approval because BlackRock submitted it. The firm has a clean history of only wins when it comes to ETF applications and the Ethereum community is banking on this to pump ETH price to $10,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

These collaborations seek to provide high throughput, assist Superchain developers, and facilitate permissionless, high-throughput decentralized applications.\n\nRollups, hailed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as critical for scaling DeFi and boosting dapp performance, are intended to reduce congestion on layer 1 networks.\n\nWhen designing rollup-centric chains, developers have the option of using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs or optimistic systems. \u201cWe plan to explore ZK frameworks later this year,\u201d Garde said."

A major turning point was reached recently when the market broke above $70,000, indicating fresh interest and optimism. This optimistic view is supported by several important technical indicators.\n\nThe 50-day and 200-day moving averages in particular are positioned in a way that indicates sustained upward momentum. A traditional bullish signal known as a golden cross formed when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average.\n\nVolume analysis supports this optimistic scenario even more. The recent price surge is accompanied by elevated trading volumes, indicating strong market participation and interest at these price points. Maintaining the present upward trend and possibly pushing Bitcoin above $71,000 require this volume support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore Bitcoin remains a favorable investment option given the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin's allure as a store of value and safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies is still great in light of persistent worries about economic stability.\n\nEthereum's weird position\n\nThe surge toward $3,800 was not expected by the market, yet we are here. However, Ethereum's activity raises a lot of questions as the asset's price is going through an extremely prolonged consolidation phase, and it is unclear whether or not it will come out as a winner from it.\n\nAfter the steep increase to $3,800, the price of Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range, as can be seen by looking at the daily chart of ETH against the USD. When buyers and sellers are evenly matched, the market is usually in a state of indecision, as indicated by this sideways movement.\n\nEthereum has tested $3,750 several times without breaking below what appears to be the key support level. A number of technical indicators shed light on Ethereum's present situation. A golden cross, or the potential continuation of a bullish trend, could be indicated if the 50-day moving average, which is approaching the 200-day moving average, crosses above it. However, the market continues to be cautious until such a crossover occurs.\n\nFurther more, the fact that trading volumes have been comparatively low during this phase of consolidation suggests that a sizable portion of market participants are holding off until a more distinct trend becomes apparent.\n\nSolana's market position\n\nSolana's path on the market was tough in the last few weeks, but things are changing rapidly, with Bitcoin bouncing toward $70,000 and investors gaining some of that positive sentiment back. However, fundamentally, Solana might not be doing as well as it used to.\n\nSolana shows a gradual but consistent recovery. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are supporting the modest uptrend that Solana is currently showing at about $172. 92.\n\nThough technical indicators point to a bright future, the larger ecosystem surrounding Solana paints a different picture. The Solana meme coin scene used to be a hive of activity and creativity, but it is not as active as recently.\n\nThere has not been much buying interest in Solana, as seen by the low trading volume. This is concerning because price movements need to be supported and maintained by sustained volume, which is probably the biggest issue for it right now."

In May 2024, it outperformed Ethereum within the number of dynamic addresses. This noteworthy rise is due to Solana\u2019s lower exchange expenses, faster preparation times, and a solid environment of decentralized applications (dApps).

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum has a lot going for it as we approach the halfway point of 2024. It's comfortably the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and enjoys a lot of popularity in the community thanks to its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem. In addition, whether you\u2019re interested in swapping tokens, lending crypto, collecting NFTs or using stablecoins, chances are that the most exciting developments are happening on Ethereum first.\n\nIn addition to the general robustness of the Ethereum ecosystem, another thing that should make Ethereum investors happy is the fact that Ethereum will (very likely) soon be joining Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency that can be traded via a spot ETF in the United States. This will give it that much more legitimacy among investors and streamline access for institutional investors.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at Ethereum from multiple angles to help you determine if Ethereum is a good investment in 2024 or not. First, we\u2019ll begin by listing various reasons why Ethereum might be a good investment in 2024. Of course, we\u2019ll consider some of the downsides of investing in ETH as well.\n\nKey highlights: Ethereum's robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities make it the second-largest cryptocurrency with broad community support.\n\nThe upcoming potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF in the US could enhance its legitimacy and attract institutional investors.\n\nDeflationary pressures from reduced ETH issuance post-Merge and the EIP-1559 mechanism enhance its attractiveness as a long-term investment.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are mitigating Ethereum's scalability issues, maintaining its dominance in the smart contracts and DeFi space.\n\nHere\u2019s why Ethereum is considered a good investment\n\nIn September 2022, pretty much every ETH investor and user held their breath as the network underwent its most significant upgrade ever \u2013 the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm \u2013 dubbed \u201cThe Merge.\u201d While the price of ETH plummeted ahead of the upgrade, with investors fearing that it could have an adverse impact on the network, the price quickly recovered after it became obvious that the transition was a total success.\n\nNow, with the uncertainty of the Merge ever more distant in the rearview, there are several reasons that make Ethereum a good investment in 2024, including:\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is increasing\n\nDeflationary pressures are making ETH more valuable\n\nLayer 2 solutions are successfully mitigating Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues\n\nEthereum is retaining its smart contract dominance\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Ethereum is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Ethereum, so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nA substantial amount of ETH is staked even before withdrawals are enabled\n\nAt the time of writing, 27.6 million ETH, or about 23% of the ETH supply, is locked in the staking deposit contract. This is impressive, given that staked ETH is worth over $100 billion and that users can withdraw it whenever they wish (barring a short queue list). It's worth noting that the ability to withdraw ETH has rolled out with the Shanghai update in early 2023.\n\nThe fact that tens of billion of dollars worth of ETH had been staked even before there was a mechanism to withdraw the coins indicates that Ethereum investors had a lot of confidence in the project\u2019s ability to execute its roadmap. Now, a year later, the total value of staked ETH jumped to over $100 billion, which is an even greater vote of confidence from the market.\n\nThe number of staked ETH. Image source: Nansen\n\nThe fact that you can stake ETH is also one reason that can make Ethereum a good investment. If you\u2019re looking to hold your ETH over the long term, you can currently enjoy an APY of about 3.3% on your staked coins. While these are not earth-shattering gains, it\u2019s better than earning no yield at all if you weren\u2019t planning to sell your ETH anyway.\n\nDeflationary pressure on ETH supply\n\nWhen the Merge was close to happening, much of the discussion in the cryptocurrency community (rightly) revolved around Ethereum moving over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. However, there was one aspect of the Merge that perhaps got less attention than it deserves. Prior to the Merge, the Ethereum protocol issued about 13,000 ETH every day in order to reward miners. With the new Proof-of-Stake system, the protocol only needs to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to provide sufficient incentives to Proof-of-Stake validators to secure the network.\n\nThis change, combined with the EIP-1559 mechanism introduced in 2021, has actually turned ETH into a slightly deflationary cryptocurrency. According to ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by a total of more than 400,000 ETH following the Merge.\n\nThis deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH has made it a more attractive hold over the long term, as ETH holders effectively no longer need to consider inflation as a factor that could negatively affect the value of their coins.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not a certainty that ETH will remain deflationary, as this will depend on how much demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. More demand for transactions equals more burned ETH, as the base transaction fees for each transaction are being burned thanks to EIP-1559. While the deflationary aspect is a nice bonus, Ethereum is one of the best long term cryptos to buy, regardless of whether its tokenomics are slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary.\n\nEthereum layer 2s are making good progress\n\nIt\u2019s not secret that the current iteration of Ethereum has major problems with scalability. In 2021, when the crypto market was in the middle of a raging bull run, transaction fees on the Ethereum network skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. At points, users were paying north of $50 just to make a single transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is obviously not a sustainable situation if Ethereum is to become a widely adopted network. Thankfully, there are several solutions in sight. The Ethereum protocol itself will receive upgrades in the future, most notably sharding, which will allow it to process more transactions while keeping costs lower.\n\nIn addition to improvements on the protocol base layer, there are also a number of layer 2 scalability solutions that leverage the security of the Ethereum mainnet while processing transactions off-chain to keep costs low.\n\nThere\u2019s already a number of layer 2 platforms for Ethereum available. The most notable examples are Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are both based on optimistic rollup technology and offer much better transaction efficiency for the end user than the base layer.\n\nEthereum continues to dominate the smart contracts space\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of Ethereum competitors available on the market. Many alternative layer 1 chains have adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while others like Solana, Cardano and Aptos have taken completely different approaches.\n\nIn any case, no other blockchain has come even close to challenging Ethereum as the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are the main reasons why it tops the list of best altcoins to buy. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum has a 60% market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to the TVL (total value locked) metric. The next closest competitor, TRON, has a market share of about 7.2%.\n\nDeFi TVL market share among all blockchains. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe demand for using the Ethereum network is also evident based on the total fees paid to use it. As of early June 2024, users are paying a total of $9.6 million in fees daily for Ethereum transactions, according to data from cryptofees.info. Bitcoin is in second place with a daily average of $4.1 million in total daily fees.\n\nETH is still down from its all-time high\n\nEven though ETH kicked off 2024 with a rally, the Ethereum price is still down about 22% from its all-time high. This could make ETH a good investment at the moment, as it has already displayed the ability to reach higher prices in the past. In addition, several other major cryptos, including Bitcoin, BNB, and Toncoin, have managed to clinch new all-time high valuations this year, so Ethereum could be next.\n\nAs a side note, even if Ethereum were to surpass its previous ATH, there is virtually no chance that it could explode by 100x or post similarly impressive gains \u2013 its current market cap is just too large and the growth required to post triple or four digit gains is just not feasible.\n\nDespite being constrained from benefiting from 100x price increases, the 5-year Ethereum average return rate would still net investors an incredibly handsome sum in the span of 10 years, mostly due to the magic of compounding interest. Here\u2019s how a $5,000 investment in Ethereum with a monthly contribution of $100 would fare over the next 10 years, if we take the compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of ETH in the past 3 years as a basis.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Ethereum (with a $100 monthly contribution) in 2024 will grow to nearly $33,000 by 2034 if we assume Ethereum\u2019s CAGR over the past 3 years. Source: Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhat are the cons of Ethereum as an investment?\n\nHopefully, we have demonstrated that Ethereum has a lot going for it as an investment in 2024. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that buying ETH is a sure bet.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions promise to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes, they are still in their relatively early stages, with many taking compromises in terms of decentralization. Meanwhile, the Ethereum mainnet is still very expensive to use.\n\nAt the time of writing, a simple token swap will cost about $3.9 in fees, which makes it very difficult to portray Ethereum as a platform that targets a broad audience and enables financial inclusion. In addition, the fees get substantially higher whenever there is a surge in demand.\n\nIn addition, the macroeconomic situation might also not bode well for cryptocurrencies. After all, some economists are predicting a recession to happen in 2024. If these predictions materialize, the cryptocurrency market will be in uncharted territory, as it has never existed amid a global recession\u2014let\u2019s remember that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only became a significant asset a few years later.\n\nDepending on the severity of this expected recession, there could be a sell-off in the crypto markets due to investors getting rid of their risky assets, and ETH would undoubtedly also be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Ethereum is among the most established crypto projects, ETH is still a highly volatile asset when compared to traditional investments. Before buying any cryptocurrency, make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024: A new ATH brewing on the horizon?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Ethereum price to increase by +260% and reach a new ATH in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum will see a nice uptick in the second half of 2024. The world\u2019s largest altcoin is expected to start mounting a rally late in July, culminating in a new all-time high of roughly $5,450 in December.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction is based on the snapshot of technical indicators in early June 2024, with 28 indicators signaling bullish and 2 bearish signals. Keep in mind that the prediction could change considerably going forward if the underlying indicators change.\n\nThe bottom line: The future of Ethereum looks bright, but the macro environment could spoil the party\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d the current situation might be a good time to do so. As we can see, there are a lot of positive indications for the future of Ethereum that could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n\nA large number of ETHs are being staked even before the launch of withdrawals. EIP-1559 and the Merge have combined to drastically reduce the issuance of ETH, and Ethereum is continuing to dominate the smart contracts sector. In addition, ETH is trading below considerably its all-time highs while Bitcoin, BNB, and some other top coins are trading at the top, which means the current prices could represent an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nIn addition, the expected approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in the US in the near term could provide another boost that could push Ethereum above its previous highs.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto."
