        "title": "Is Ethereum Fulfilling Its Potential as an Incredible Disruptor? 3 Reasons I'm Bearish - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This innovative crypto gets a lot of attention, but investors need to ask pressing questions.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.92%) was born from the perceived limitations to adding functionality to Bitcoin. Launched in July 2015, Ethereum has skyrocketed nearly 93,000% in value since its public release, even though it remains more than 40% off its peak price.\n\nIs the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a current market cap of about $350 billion, fulfilling its potential as an incredible disruptor? I'm not so sure. Here are three reasons I'm bearish on Ethereum.\n\nHuge promise\n\nLet's first try to understand why there's so much hype surrounding Ethereum and its long-term potential. Thanks to the blockchain network having functionality for smart contracts, many bulls believe that Ethereum can disrupt numerous industries, particularly those that depend on expensive intermediaries, by giving power and value back to the users.\n\nIn other words, smart contracts can automate a lot of functions that are slow and cumbersome, and that might not add much value. The end result, as many hope, is a better and cheaper user experience.\n\nViewed in this light, it might be encouraging to see Ethereum's complex roadmap. With scalability, security, and sustainably as the top priorities, the network's developer community has laid out different sets of upgrades to accomplish certain milestones. The latest event, known as The Merge, changed Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, significantly reducing its energy usage.\n\nViewed as the world's decentralized computer, Ethereum's ultimate goal is to change the entire structure of the economy, mainly as it relates to how individuals can have greater control in an internet-enabled world.\n\nReasons to be skeptical\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Ethereum's promise. There are more than 250 million unique wallet addresses. It has the most total value locked by far of any other crypto, which measures the amount of assets locked in a specific DeFi protocol. And sure, there are thousands of decentralized applications.\n\nBut I view things with a critical perspective. I think Ethereum is still primarily used as a tool for financial speculation, not actual utility. Even if spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds get approved, it proves that investors only want price exposure, instead of using Ethereum tokens in some dApp setting.\n\nAnd are dApps really better than services provided by well-known businesses? Marketplace and platform-like businesses, such as Meta Platforms, PayPal, Uber, and Airbnb, have billions of users combined who find value in what they have to offer. They work just fine as is.\n\nAnother reason I'm bearish is that I view Ethereum as another venture start-up, which defeats the entire purpose of crypto aiming to be decentralized and give power to the people. There are still a few head developers, most notably Vitalik Buterin, who have outsized influence on the direction of the network. And these founders stand to gain the most financially should things work out as planned.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said that Bitcoin is the only crypto that's a commodity, and that others are essentially securities. This supports the argument that Ethereum is just another profit-seeking enterprise.\n\nAnd the last bear case rests on the belief that Ethereum is a solution looking for a problem. In fact, this is probably true for nearly all cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nAll of the focus and discussion centered on the complex technicalities of the underlying network sound exciting. However, one really has to question if more and more people will engage further with Ethereum and use its dApps in the future. I'm not confident in this outcome.\n\nIt might make some bullish Ethereum supporters uncomfortable to challenge their beliefs about the cryptocurrency. But I think healthy criticality is necessary to set realistic expectations about its future."

        "content": "While a possible spot Ethereum ETF approval looms ahead, Grayscale experts believe an upcoming technological improvement is behind recent price upticks.\n\nGrayscale research analyst William Ogden Moore said in a Feb. 23 report that Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade has most likely triggered rallies in Ether (ETH) prices. According to CoinMarkerCap, ETH is up 34% in the last 30 days and 28% year-to-date per TradingView.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13th, 2024, represents a major step forward and could help Ethereum compete in terms of scalability with faster chains in the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector, such as Solana. We believe that recent price performance reflects the market\u2019s anticipation of this upgrade. William Ogden Moore, Grayscale research analyst\n\nETH 30D price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase calls on SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF\n\nDencun promises to uplift throughput and reduce transaction costs, allowing users to spend less gas fees and make more transactions on ETH\u2019s mainnet and layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nDevelopers plan to achieve this key overhaul via proto-danksharding, introducing data blobs.\n\nMoore\u2019s report suggests that Ethereum could seize greater smart contract business share from competitors like Solana if the network can offer cheaper fees. Moore opined that this might unlock a multi-billion market tied to real-world assets.\n\nIf Ethereum can simply become more competitive in throughput and cost, it could position itself to capture smart contract applications that demand high levels of security and censorship-resistance like stablecoins or tokenized financial assets. William Ogden Moore, Grayscale research analyst\n\nGrayscale\u2019s bullish outlook on ETH and its blockchain complements the investment firm\u2019s bid for a spot exchange-traded fund following its successful GBTC conversion last month. According to Yahoo Finance, the company hopes to do the same with its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which holds over $7 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe U.S. SEC delayed a decision on Grayscale\u2019s application till May, along with several other issuers.\n\nETH YTD chart | Source: TradingView"

        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 projects.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Turner tells the 2.41 million channel subscribers that ETH\u2019s Dencun update may cause layer-2 projects to go on massive rallies and he names his top four picks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, which is expected to roll out in March, aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and data availability on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nSays Turner,\n\n\u201cAs the Dencun upgrade draws near, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s are about to take off.\u201d\n\nFirst up, the trader says that Arbitrum (ARB) could maintain its upward momentum.\n\n\u201cARB recently hit an all-time high of $2.40 on the 12th of January, and hasn\u2019t really shown many signs of slowing down either in large part due to the anticipated effects of Dencun. This is because Dencun\u2019s impact on layer-2 transaction speeds and costs will likely see more and more people adopting Arbitrum as an even cheaper way of interacting with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is trading for $1.83 at time of writing, down 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says Optimism (OP) has a lot of upward potential due to its aim to build a \u201csuperchain\u201d ecosystem that promotes collaboration across multiple layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\n\u201cOne of the first entrants to the \u2018superchain\u2019 ecosystem was none other than Coinbase\u2019s very own layer-2 solution, Base\u2026\n\nThis superchain could quickly become a reality after Dencun.\u201d\n\nOptimism is trading for $3.68 at time of writing, down more than 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAnother scaling solution on the trader\u2019s radar is Immutable X (IMX), which he believes could become more popular in the GameFi industry.\n\n\u201cImmutable could see a rapid acceleration in blockchain gaming development as network efficiency is supercharged. With Immutable being positioned as a big player in the GameFi narrative, many more gaming developers will be turning their attention to the best environment to launch their products in, and Immutable will be a top contender in that regard.\u201d\n\nImmutable is trading for $3.33 at time of writing, down more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Polygon (MATIC) could rise in value due to its own planned network upgrade called Polygon 2.0.\n\n\u201cMATIC hit an all-time high of $2.92 on the 27th of December 2021. At the time of shooting, it\u2019s still at 66% down from this price point. However, this could all change with 2.0.\u201d\n\nMATIC is trading for $0.93, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Reach $4,000 In March On 4 Factors Including Spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January turned the spotlight on Ethereum price, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Investors believe Ethereum has a high probability of receiving a spot ETF, especially with several proposals already with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDespite the growing optimism, ETH clawed back some of the gains it accrued earlier this week, falling from slightly above $3,000 to $2,900. The pullback came upon increased volatility in the market, with Bitcoin (BTC) rejecting $53,000 for a sweep at $50,500.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBesides Ethereum, other altcoins such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also pulled back to gather more liquidity. This could account for the modest price gains in the market on Thursday.\n\nEthereum price is one of the most uniquely placed projects, considering its standing as the second-largest crypto, the largest smart contracts platform, and its upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nThis article looks at these factors and more to determine the role they are likely to play in ETH\u2019s recovery journey in the short term.\n\n1. The Dencun Upgrade Scheduled For March\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comprised of two separate upgrades \u201cDeneb\u201d and \u201cCancun,\u201d is a major improvement for the Ethereum network that will increase its scalability and efficiency when implemented.\n\nIt will introduce proto-danksharding, a feature that will reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, which are faster and cheaper than the main chain. The upgrade has been tested on three testnets: Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.\n\nWith the final launch expected in March 2024, Ethereum price is already showing signs of an incoming rally. The token surged to highs slightly above $3,000 this week, backing positive sentiment.\n\n2. The Spot ETF\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been referred to as a major development for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to validating Bitcoin as a global mature asset, ETFs allow traditional investors who are not interested in the complexities of crypto to get exposure to BTC.\n\nMoreover, the move opened the door to fresh speculation regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Two years after the approval of Bitcoin futures ETF, Ethereum got its futures ETF. Experts say that the wait could be much short-term for the spot ETF.\n\nLike Bitcoin the hype surrounding the ETF could be a major catalyst for Ethereum price in the coming months.\n\nRecommended: Ethereum Price Rally Gains Momentum for $4000, Here Why?\n\n3. Staking\n\nValidators in the Ethereum ecosystem are required to stake at least 32 ETH. This condition significantly reduces the circulating supply. Ether becoming a PoS network through the Merge in 2022 allowed investors to freely stake and withdraw liquidity.\n\nContrary to expectations, the transition to PoS made staking even more attractive to investors, who have so far locked in $46.65 billion worth of ETH in smart contracts, according to Defi Llama.\n\nUnlike 2022 and 2023 when Ethereum experienced a persistent drop in staked assets, 2024 is looking positive, implying that investors have a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAn increase in staking translates to reduced sell-side pressure. Holders stake tokens they do not intend to sell in the near future, expecting the price will rise with time.\n\n4. Ethereum Price Dons Bullish Technical Structure\n\nDespite the correction from $3,000, Ethereum still holds above key indicators like the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Besides, support at $2,900 stopped the decline on Wednesday, realigning ETH with the upward trajectory.\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that dips are profitable. So until support at $2,800 flips, traders may want to consider buying ETH and in the process contributing to the momentum targeting $4,000 in March or before Bitcoin halving. The Ichimoku Cloud also affirms Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade: Which Layer-2 Platforms Will Benefit the Most? - CoinGape",
        "content": "As investors keep a close watch on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, attention is currently directed towards the imminent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Scheduled for March 13, this upcoming enhancement is anticipated to wield significant influence, potentially bolstering various players within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring the potential ripple effects, let\u2019s delve into how the Ethereum Dencun upgrade stands to benefit other Layer-2 platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum Dencum Upgrade\n\nGet ready for the \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade, set to roll out on March 13, marking a significant hard fork update aimed at boosting the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and user-friendliness. As part of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap initiative, dubbed \u2018The Surge,\u2019 this upgrade is a pivotal step forward in scalability enhancements.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can expect from the Dencun upgrade:\n\nEIP-4844: Boost scalability.\n\nEIP-1153: Cutting down on-chain data storage expenses.\n\nEIP-4788: Elevating security and functionality.\n\nEIP-5656: Fine-tuning EVM performance\n\nEIP-6780: Improving network security.\n\nThe standout feature in Dencun is the implementation of Proto-Danksharding. With EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), a new transaction type called \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 is introduced, reducing transaction costs for both L2 users and ramping up Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher explains that the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will reduce transaction fees on Layer-2 platforms by a considerable magnitude. The analyst also emphasizes the increased commercial viability for dApp developers and users. This shift will position L2s as more appealing options compared to alternative L1s, offering a positive catalyst across various sectors such as DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and on-chain trading.\n\nLayer-2 Platforms That Benefit From Dencun Upgrade\n\nAlthough several Layer-2 platforms will benefit from the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, Miles Deutscher shares his coveted list of those platforms that he thinks will benefit the most.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Deutscher noted that $MATIC currently finds itself in a compelling position. It\u2019s on the verge of rebranding to POL. Despite lagging behind other L2s, there\u2019s been notable investment in implementing zk technology. Considering these factors, Deutscher believes $MATIC could emerge as a strong performer in the weeks or months ahead. Arbitrum: Arbitrum\u2019s metrics remain impressive, solidifying its position as a preferred chain for launching new dApps. Maintaining its status as the top L2 in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Arbitrum also boasts transaction volume that outpaces other L2 solutions. Optimism: Optimism ranks as the second-largest L2 by Total Value Locked (TVL), closely following Arbitrum, and it has demonstrated robustness in transaction processing. Recently, the platform unveiled its fourth airdrop, which is expected to reignite interest and activity within the ecosystem. COTI Network: COTI has unveiled V2, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution focused on privacy, featuring the introduction of \u2018Garbled Circuits.\u2019 This innovative technology offers an efficient method for maintaining privacy, marking the blockchain\u2019s maiden implementation of such a feature. Mantle: Mantle is currently among the rapidly expanding Layer 2 solutions. With over $1.5 billion worth of ETH staked as mETH (Mantle Staked ETH), it ranks as the third-largest LSD (Layer 2 Staked Deposit) after Lido and RocketPool. Moreover, mETH stakers can anticipate some promising airdrops in the near future. Metis: Metis is experiencing a wave of favorable developments that are propelling its growth forward. Notable among these is the establishment of the 4.6 million $METIS Ecosystem Fund, signaling a significant injection of $400 million into the ecosystem. Additionally, the upcoming launch of the decentralized sequencer alpha mainnet in March promises to further enhance the platform\u2019s capabilities and usability. Moreover, the implementation of the LSB (Liquid Staking Blitz) campaign is poised to bolster participation and engagement within the Metis community.\n\nMiles Duestscher stated that he\u2019s keeping a close watch on other Layer-2 Networks such as Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Dogecoin (DOGE) 'Hidden Golden Cross' Might Surprise You, Ethereum (ETH) Breaks $3,000 Barrier, How Long Will Solana (SOL) Stay Bearish? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin is showing a gleam of technical optimism. The recent crossing of the 100-day and 50-day EMAs is a small version of the much celebrated 50-200 EMA golden cross, often regarded as one of the most bullish signals in technical analysis.\n\nThis mini golden cross, while not as definitive as the classic version, still gives traders a reason to pay attention. Historically, such crosses have been precursors to potential uptrends. For Dogecoin, the price has been oscillating around this crossover region, suggesting a tug-of-war between bears and bulls.\n\nDOGE/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nDogecoin's current support level can be spotted around the $0.077 mark, which aligns with the 100-day EMA. Should this level hold, it could act as a springboard, reinforcing the bullish sentiment brought about by the EMA crossover. On the flip side, if this support falters, we might see a dip toward the $0.070 threshold, where previous market activities have shown interest.\n\nIf Dogecoin can capitalize on this mini golden cross, the next target would be to test the resistance at $0.088. A break above this level with sustained volume could set the stage for a continued upward trajectory, with the $0.10 psychological barrier as the next significant milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum finally scores\n\nEthereum has achieved a significant milestone by breaking through the $3,000 price barrier, a bullish signal that many investors have anticipated for the last few months.\n\nThe ascent to $3,000 marks a key psychological and technical level for Ethereum. This breakthrough is supported by a robust volume profile, suggesting that the move is backed by substantial market interest.\n\nLocal support levels now adjust to this new paradigm, with previous resistance around $2,800 potentially becoming a new support zone. Should ETH maintain its position above this level, it would confirm the strength of the current trend and possibly establish a foundation for further gains.\n\nLooking at the potential for a rally continuation from the current levels, the momentum appears strong. Investors and traders will now be eyeing the next resistance levels, which could be around the $3,200 to $3,300 range, where ETH may face a test. A consolidation above $3,000 could provide the springboard needed to challenge these higher thresholds.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if Ethereum manages to sustain its current levels and market sentiment remains positive, there is a possibility of continued growth, potentially targeting the all-time highs seen previously. The RSI and volume will be key indicators to watch for sustaining buying pressure.\n\nSolana still losing\n\nSolana is currently exhibiting bearish tendencies. A close look at SOL's price trajectory reveals it is navigating through a potentially critical phase.\n\nAs of now, SOL is manifesting a downtrend within a bearish channel pattern. The price has recently faced resistance at the upper trend line of this channel, suggesting a possible continuation of bearish momentum. Key support levels to watch include the psychological round number at $100, followed by a more established support at around $90 which, if broken, could lead to a further slide.\n\nIf SOL fails to hold the $100 level, we could witness a steeper decline, with the next substantial support level at $90. A break below this could potentially open a path toward the $80 mark, especially if broader market sentiment remains negative.\n\nA bullish reversal could occur if SOL finds solid footing at the current support levels. For a shift in trend, SOL would need to break out of the descending channel, pushing past the immediate resistance near $110. This could indicate short-term bearish exhaustion and potentially signal the start of a recovery phase, targeting subsequent resistance levels at $120 and above."

        "title": "ETH/BTC Chart Analysis: Is Ethereum\u2019s Rally Against Bitcoin Ushering In the Altcoin Season? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 is proving to be an exciting era for crypto investors. While attention was majorly on Bitcoin in Q4 last year and in early January, interest has been gradually shifting to Ethereum and the altcoin market in general. The ETH/BTC chart analysis takes into account the changing dynamics, that could result in an unparalleled altcoin season.\n\nETH/BTC Chart Analysis: Ethereum Fires Up As Bitcoin Stalls\n\nThe ETH/BTC trading pair with a value of $0.0574 holds above an important support area highlighted by the 0.382 Fibonacci ratio around $0.0573. Slightly below the same demand zone is the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (the blue line on the chart).\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) neutral but sliding toward the midline and the oversold region, ETH/USD could push harder on the above support area. Holding firmly above the 0.382 Fibo would make Ethereum stronger, insinuating a larger breakout in ETH price. Ethereum will weaken against Bitcoin if the same support caves.\n\nThe technical structure on the daily chart is no different, with the ETH/USD pair expected to bounce off the 0.382 Fibonacci support level. A stronger Bitcoin in January butchered the demand area, causing a flash drop to $0.051, underscoring the importance of controlling sell-side pressure.\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade is likely the secret weapon Ethereum bulls have against Bitcoin. This upgrade has many benefits for Ethereum as a network and its underlying layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nAssessing ETH/USD Weekly Technical Structure\n\nSeveral key levels would determine where the ETH/BTC pair heads in the coming days or weeks. For starters, support highlighted by the green band on the weekly chart has been tested more than once \u2014 in May, in Dec/Jan, and in February.\n\nThat said, there is a high chance ETH/USD will rebound from the green-colored support area for another targeted attempt at the trend line resistance from September last year. Ethereum will emerge extremely bullish if this resistance is broken, paving the way for widespread rallies in the altcoin market.\n\nA potential spot Ethereum ETF is another key factor to keep in mind while trading the ETH/BTC pair, especially long-term. Experts anticipate the same bullish outlook for Ethereum if the SEC greenlights the products that allow traditional investors to seek exposure to ETH on the stock market without having to worry about the complexities of crypto including exchanges and storage.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin halving due in April may turn the tables around, bolstering BTC price rally toward the end of the year and subsequently in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, alongside Aztec, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and zkSync has announce the launch of the first ZK Grants Round. This grants initiative aims to enhance the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer 2 Ecosystem, with a total shared prize pool of $900,000.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, each contributor, including the Ethereum Foundation, raised $150,000 to support research and development for ZK proofs and standards.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. Established in 2014, the EF aims to promote Ethereum and related technologies without controlling or leading them. Instead, the EF serves as one component of a broader ecosystem.\n\nThe EF focuses on initiatives such as the Ecosystem Support Program, which provides both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the wider Ethereum community.\n\nA zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method used to prove knowledge about a piece of data without revealing the data itself. It allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a claim is true without disclosing any information other than the fact that the claim is true.\n\nZKPs are used to provide privacy guarantees and are employed in various blockchain use cases, such as identity management, authentication, and private transactions.\n\nAccording to a report from Protocol Labs, the zero-knowledge proof market is anticipated to generate $75 million in revenue by 2024 and is expected to surpass $10 billion by 2030. The report further highlights a projection of almost 90 billion zero-knowledge proofs being needed for web3 applications alone in the year 2030.\n\nApplication dates and deadlines for the funding\n\nEthereum Foundation also noted in the announcement that interested parties are invited to submit proposals by 11:59 UTC on March 18th, 2024. These projects can be in various stages of development, including ideas, proof-of-concepts, work in progress, and fleshed-out projects.\n\nThe focus of development includes enhancing multi-prover systems for validity, ZK, and fraud proof. It added that the funding is also open to projects that improve various proof systems, enhance efficiency and user-friendliness of ZK Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), and create security benchmarks for ZK Rollups (ZKRs) and bridges.\n\nAdditionally, teams can explore the development of tools and interfaces for ZK and validity-proof based Layer 2 solutions, creating transpilers between zkDSL and Solidity, and investigating hardware acceleration for ZK protocols.\n\nAll proposals are expected to be submitted in PDF format, English language, with detailed descriptions, budgets, timelines, an applicant profile, and a link to published work. Eligible projects must be open source, align with the round\u2019s goals, and benefit the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem as public goods.\n\nEvaluation criteria include impact on the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem, value to multiple Layer 2 solutions, documentation clarity, and proposing individual or team experience.\n\nEthereum Foundation revealed that ineligible projects involve illegal activities, financial products or services, art or social impact initiatives, retroactive funding requests, and those planning token launches or public funding rounds."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency universe witnessed quite the bustle today, February 22, following a slump in crypto prices, per data by CoinMarketCap. As the global market cap took a hit, plunging 1.62% to the $1.95 trillion mark, a bearish sentiment appears to be prevailing within the broader crypto market. Prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana collectively witnessed a price slump today. This appears to come due to the massive crypto market liquidation witnessed yesterday, per CoinGape Media\u2019s report. However, sentiment for bolstered prices looms over the crypto horizon even though Fed\u2019s stance on unchanged rates prevails. The crypto market appears to have witnessed the prior mentioned liquidation aligning with this.\n\nMajor Crypto Prices Today\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bitcoin price continued its downward movement post-liquidation today, falling 1.28% in the past 24 hours. The current BTC price rests at $51,411, with a market cap of $1.009 trillion. Meanwhile, the token also witnessed a substantial drop in its 24-hour trading volume, falling 9.45% and reaching $29.25 billion.

Per the report, others expressed concerns over the progress of inflation. Nevertheless, some policy makers say the economic outlook appeared firmer than the December projections.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\n\n\nFed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak https://t.co/J03IIvsmT5 pic.twitter.com/rEjWSwv3a7 \u2014 FXStreet News (@FXStreetNews) February 21, 2024\n\nFind detailed report here: Fed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak\n\nBitcoin price could revisit $48,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is almost showing a directional bias, breaking below the $51,335 support. Judging from the technical indicators, if BTC records a candlestick close below the aforementioned buyer congestion level, the king of cryptocurrency could roll over to the $48,000 psychological level. In a dire case, BTC could retest the order block between $45,556 and $46,691.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already registered a sell signal by crossing its signal line (yellow band), while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is dipping and could also cross below its signal line (orange band). Meanwhile, the MACD histogram bars are paling out.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls show resolve, Bitcoin price could recover, flipping $52,985 into support as it extends towards $55,000 or in a highly bullish case, $60,000 psychological level.

Specifically, XRP price faces overhead pressure due to the 200 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at $0.5643 and $0.5835 levels respectively.

If this level fails to hold as support, XRP price could slip through to the $0.4734 support floor, around 13% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls come in, enhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price recover. A northbound move could see the payments token overcome the 200 and 100-day SMAs, bring the $0.6000 psychological level within reach.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, XRP price could leap further to test the $0.6421 blockade, nearly 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple CEO criticizes SEC says regulator has lost lawsuits consistently; XRP price holds firm above $0.55"

        "title": "Block gained $207M on its Bitcoin Holdings and Ethereum Spot-Exchange Traded Fund - Tekedia",
        "content": "In its fourth-quarter earnings report released recently, fintech company Block reported a remarkable remeasurement gain of $207 million on its bitcoin holdings. As of December 31, 2023, Block held approximately 8,038 BTC for investment purposes with a fair value of $340 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings report highlighted a significant increase in bitcoin revenue, totaling $2.52 billion, representing a 37% year-over-year rise. This growth was driven by both an increase in the average market price of bitcoin and the price appreciation of Block\u2019s bitcoin inventory during the quarter.\n\nBlock\u2019s subsidiary, Cash App, played a crucial role in these gains. The platform generated a gross profit of $66 million on bitcoin sales last quarter, representing an impressive 90% increase year over year. The total sale amount of bitcoin sold to customers\u2014which Block recognizes as bitcoin revenue\u2014was $2.52 billion.\n\nShares of Block (NASDAQ: SQ) surged by 13% in after-hours trading, reaching $76. Overall, Block reported that its gross profit grew by 22% yearly, reaching an impressive total of $2.03 billion. Square, another subsidiary of Block, generated a gross profit of $828 million (up 18% year over year), while Cash App contributed $1.18 billion (up 25% year over year) to the company\u2019s overall performance. In summary, Block\u2019s strategic investment in bitcoin has paid off significantly, positioning the company as a major player in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEther spot-exchange traded funds (ETFs) may increase institutional investment and power the world\u2019s most-used blockchain, but they are unlikely to create euphoric price surges, according to some market observers. While interest in ether bets has risen significantly, an ETF could create sustained growth rather than explosive growth in the ether market.\n\nLast week, Ethereum\u2019s native token crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, rising 15% in a week and beating bitcoin\u2019s relatively modest 8% rally in the same period. Crypto circles on social application X expect such price action to continue after the expected issuance of ether ETFs later this year. The narrative is that these inflows could later find their way to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHowever, some believe an ETF could create sustained, rather than explosive, growth in the ether market. Jag Kooners, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, stated that \u201cEthereum ETFs won\u2019t cause bubbles.\u201d He further explained that institutional investment through an ETF could stabilize the Ethereum market, similar to what has been observed with bitcoin and gold ETFs, fostering sustained growth.\n\nKooners also highlighted that Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions which enhance scalability by enabling faster, cheaper transactions outside the main blockchain, play a role in fostering growth. Unlike bitcoin\u2019s security focus, Ethereum\u2019s L2 solutions prioritize rapid expansion, potentially attracting institutional investment and broadening application scope.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s status as a macroeconomic asset has made it increasingly sensitive to global economic developments. As institutional participation in Bitcoin grows, adverse macro events can impact its price significantly.\n\nRecently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern about high inflation, leading to expectations of faster stimulus unwinding. Additionally, Evergrande\u2019s debt crisis and IMF warnings have added to market jitters. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s deflationary asset credentials and its transition to ETH 2.0 have helped it remain relatively resilient.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that an ether ETF still faces regulatory headwinds. The classification of ether as a security or commodity remains a key hurdle despite ongoing regulatory discussions. Some traditional finance firms estimate a 50% chance of an ether ETF approval by May 2024 with ether considered the \u201conly digital asset other than bitcoin\u201d to get spot ETF approval in the U.S. Several companies have submitted applications.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Top 6 Altcoins That Will Benefit From Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade: Crypto Analyst - NewsBTC",
        "content": "As the Ethereum ecosystem braces for the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher provides an in-depth look at the altcoins poised for significant growth.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade is a critical hard fork aimed at enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and usability. Deutscher\u2019s insights reveal how specific Layer 2 (L2) solutions are uniquely positioned to benefit from the upgrade\u2019s introduction of Proto-Danksharding and other key enhancements.\n\nDeutscher explains, \u201cThe Dencun upgrade, especially with EIP-4844, represents a paradigm shift in how Ethereum will handle transactions. By drastically lowering gas fees and increasing throughput, we\u2019re looking at a more accessible, efficient blockchain.\u201d This upgrade is part of Ethereum\u2019s broader roadmap, known as \u201cThe Surge,\u201d focusing on scalability improvements.\n\nTop-6 Altcoins To Watch Prior To Dencun\n\n#1 Polygon (MATIC/POL): With its impending rebrand and investment in zk-technology, Polygon is at a pivotal juncture. Deutscher notes, \u201cPolygon\u2019s deep dive into zk-rollups could redefine its position in the L2 landscape, making MATIC an attractive asset for forward-looking investors.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\n#2 Arbitrum (ARB): As the leading L2 by TVL and transaction volume, Arbitrum\u2019s robustness is undisputed. \u201cArbitrum has cemented its position as a powerhouse in the L2 space, and the Dencun upgrade will only amplify its strengths,\u201d Deutscher remarks.\n\n#3 Optimism (OP): Positioned as a strong contender in the L2 space, Optimism\u2019s ecosystem is set to expand. \u201cThe announcement of Optimism\u2019s fourth airdrop is not just a reward for its community but a strategic move to bolster its ecosystem\u2019s vibrancy,\u201d says Deutscher.\n\n#4 COTI Network (COTI): With the launch of V2 and its innovative \u2018Garbled Circuits,\u2019 COTI introduces a groundbreaking privacy solution. Deutscher observes, \u201cCOTI\u2019s approach to privacy on the blockchain through \u2018Garbled Circuits\u2019 is a game-changer, potentially setting a new standard for private transactions.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\n#5 Mantle (MNT): Highlighting Mantle\u2019s rapid growth, Deutscher points out, \u201cWith $1.5 billion in ETH now staked as mETH, Mantle is not just growing; it\u2019s thriving, supported by strategic airdrops that reward its community.\u201d\n\n#6 Metis (METIS): Identified as a potentially undervalued project, Metis\u2019s upcoming initiatives are a beacon for investors. \u201cMetis\u2019s decentralized sequencer and the substantial METIS Ecosystem Fund are laying the groundwork for a robust, decentralized future, making it an intriguing prospect post-Dencun,\u201d Deutscher explains.\n\nBroader Implications For Ethereum\n\nDeutscher also casts a spotlight on Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea as projects to watch, emphasizing the widespread impact of the Dencun upgrade. He advises, \u201cThe ETH/L2 trade is increasingly compelling as we approach the Dencun upgrade. Shifting a significant portion of one\u2019s portfolio into the Ethereum ecosystem seems prudent, given the transformative potential of the upcoming changes.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH still traded just below the $3,000 mark.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock chart from TradingView.com"
