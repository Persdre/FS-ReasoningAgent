        "title": "What Is Ethereum (ETH)? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is a blockchain supported by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Established in 2015, Ethereum introduced the idea of smart contracts, which are bits of code written into the blockchain that can support various types of applications or even new cryptocurrencies. The native token of Ethereum is ether (ETH 1.09%), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. Read on to learn what Ethereum is, what you can do with the Ethereum technology, whether ether is a good investment, and the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC 1.98%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? What is Ethereum? The basic idea of Ethereum is that it\u2019s a platform that can execute and verify application code without the need for a central authority. It does this through an implementation of blockchain technology run across a decentralized network. Blockchain is a concept used to secure data on a network. Basically, it ensures nobody changes the data on the network without authorization from the majority of people using it. A decentralized network means there\u2019s no single point of authority, like a corporation or government, that can make changes to the data on the network. Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model to secure the blockchain. Network members must stake Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether, to verify blocks written to the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is also used to pay for work done on the blockchain. Some merchants and service providers will accept ether as payment.\n\nWhat can it do? What can Ethereum do? Ethereum and the concepts pioneered in its development form the backbone of many advancements in blockchain technology. Using smart contracts, which are bits of code written to the blockchain, has allowed people to build all sorts of applications, including: Stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce.\n\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce. Lending applications. You can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.\n\nYou can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest. Decentralized exchanges.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can create a unique token that can\u2019t be replicated, called a non-fungible token, or NFT. The token can represent anything from a piece of art or a deed to a house. There are dozens of other ways to apply smart contracts and blockchain technology. Is it a good investment? Is Ethereum a good investment? If you\u2019re interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether, is a good choice. Ethereum is the clear market leader in blockchain applications. Most new developments in decentralized finance or other uses for blockchain are built on the Ethereum network. That inherently gives ether value since it\u2019s needed to keep the network running and verifying the blockchain as well as paying for transactions on the blockchain. The shift to a proof-of-stake system from a proof-of-work system makes it more sustainable from an energy-use perspective. That opens the door for it to make advancements in processing speed, which can make smart contracts more broadly applicable. Ethereum has strong staying power (in the crypto world), so it\u2019s much more unlikely to provide the boom-or-bust results of other smaller currencies.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Ether and Bitcoin are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The currencies have a lot in common, but Ethereum builds on the underlying blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin\u2019s creator. The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a permissionless, decentralized digital currency. Its creator wanted a way to make payments that weren\u2019t backed by a central government or agency. As a result, Bitcoin is used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Ethereum had a much broader idea. The blockchain is used for all sorts of decentralized applications. While ether is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain, you can also have other cryptocurrencies built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin also use different protocols to secure their blockchains. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Under this system, every computer on the network is working to solve a complex math problem to write the next block to the blockchain. Once a computer solves the problem, the other members of the network verify the solution (which takes much less work), and a new block attaches to the chain. Ethereum used the same system until September 2022. It now uses a proof-of-stake system that requires network members to hold ether to validate the next block in the blockchain. Validators are financially incentivized to verify correct data because they risk losing their stake if they\u2019re a bad actor. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network. Transaction costs can vary more widely on Ethereum based on how many people are actively trying to write new data to the blockchain, i.e., transaction volume. Both have their use cases where they excel, and either ether or Bitcoin could be a viable investment choice for someone interested in buying and holding crypto."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair from Binance offers a glimpse into Ethereum's current market position \u2013 a position that, while seemingly bearish, may hold the seeds for a future rally against the digital gold that is about to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart presents a downtrend with Ethereum losing ground to Bitcoin, reflected by the downward slope of the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (black line) moving averages. This suggests that, in the short to medium term, Ethereum has been underperforming compared to the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThis underperformance can be linked to a subdued period for key Ethereum market drivers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With these sectors facing a downturn, Ethereum's price has not had the catalysts that could propel it forward, especially in comparison to Bitcoin, which often acts as a \"safe haven\" within the crypto market during times of uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the development activity within Ethereum's ecosystem tells a different story. Despite the lack of immediate market drivers, the consistent work being done on the platform could be laying the groundwork for a strong rebound.\n\nFor traders, the ETH/BTC chart is a vital tool for tracking market sentiment and volatility. A declining ETH/BTC ratio could indicate a period of risk-off sentiment where investors flock to Bitcoin's relative safety. Conversely, a rising ratio might signal a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to bet on Ethereum's growth prospects, which might also hint at the potential surge of altcoins in general.\n\nGiven the current chart trends, investors and traders may look for signs of stabilization or reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio as indicators of Ethereum's resurgence. Such a turnaround could be precipitated by a revival in the DeFi and NFT markets or by new developments and upgrades within the network."

FTX supply coming here eventually and I think this move up is to bait some buyers. Would just be patient on Solana. Note: I think that this one is going to go much much higher in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, investors should remain patient with Solana as the incoming cache of SOL tokens from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will add to its supply. However, the trader notes that during the last month, SOL has been consolidating.\n\n\u201cAlthough I think that you should still stay a bit patient given FTX supply is coming onto the market sometime (who knows when), Solana has also consolidated for a month in an overall macro healthy BTC (Bitcoin) upswing. In my opinion, this means you should at least be exposed now if you want in on this one.\n\nRecommend you do a swing trade on this one and have entries from here all the way down to sub-$50. It also works great as an investment too, where you just hold this for six months+ and let it ride. High percentage chance it\u2019s decently higher later.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $66.36 at time of writing, a 4.7% increase during the last day and an increase of over 550% from its price of $9.97 at the start of 2023.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Now, he\u2019s buying more.\n\nRichard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson is the CEO and co-founder of esports organization and lifestyle brand FaZe Clan. The gamer took to Instagram this week to report his latest crypto purchases and double down on his pro-crypto stance amidst a broader gaming industry where crypto remains a controversial topic.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be my typical normie homie and call me asking for plays a year from now when the mainstream media and your mom [are] talking about crypto again,\u201d Banks urged his 2.8 million Instagram followers Tuesday along with a note of Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,300, a yearly high.\n\n\u201cExpose yourself now,\u201d Banks continued in a post evangelizing crypto and arguing that potential buyers should look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBTC is the safest, ETH is about as safe with slightly more upside in my opinion. My personal favorite. A large percentage of my net worth is in Ethereum,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that in his view, Solana is the \u201criskiest\u201d of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cMy money is definitely where my mouth is on this one. Buy it and leave it alone. Chill,\u201d he added.\n\nLike many financial assets and purchases, though, it\u2019s important to note that buying or trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk\u2014and fans should be careful not to take financial advice from influencers or celebrities they follow online. It's often not clear what an influencers motivations may be in promoting a cryptocurrency, NFT project, or any financial asset.\n\nBanks also claimed that he recently spent $200,000 on four altcoins: Prime, Pepe, Mog, and Clouds, the last of which has not yet been officially released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrime is the sci-fi NFT card game Parallel\u2019s official token, Pepe is a frog-inspired meme coin which recently rose to a $666 million market cap, and Mog is a meme coin that\u2019s been swirling on Twitter among fans who have paired it with memes of people and animals wearing a specific pair of colorfully-tinted glasses. Clouds is an upcoming token from the Endless Clouds crypto startup that is developing the Treeverse gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThese are the first real plays I\u2019ve made since the big market crash,\u201d Banks said, who over the summer also hopped onto the \u201cSocialFi\u201d trend and made over $70,000 by signing up for Friend.tech.\n\nBanks did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment on his latest crypto purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that FaZe Clan\u2019s newly-appointed CEO has been in crypto for years now. Back in 2021, Banks was accused of allegedly pumping and dumping an altcoin he promoted, BankSocial.\n\nAnd a quick glimpse at a wallet connected to Banks called \u201cBanksfucks\u201d currently holds some NFTs from Azuki\u2019s collections, two Bored Apes, four Mutant Ape NFTs, a staggering 72 Otherdeed NFTs for Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse game, two Clone X NFTs, and one Doodles NFT, among others. He has also recently boasted of CryptoPunks holdings.\n\nWhile Banks is a crypto and NFT enthusiast, not everyone in FaZe Clan shares this view. The org\u2019s only current female member, Kalei Renay, previously told Decrypt in an interview at TwitchCon that she isn\u2019t a fan of NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs a community, everybody hates NFTs,\u201d FaZe Kalei said of gamers. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, do whatever, but I don\u2019t care for NFTs. I don\u2019t do crypto, I don\u2019t do any of that. I stay so far away from it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Some analysts predict that it could even return to its former heights over time; although this might take longer due to regulatory hurdles. Meanwhile, however, the Ethereum team has been hard at work improving the platform and creating new features; as well as making great strides forward with smart contracts \u2014 which should become key selling points of this coin in future.\n\nMany individuals and big companies alike are becoming interested in cryptocurrency technology, with JPMorgan Chase & Co embracing blockchain as evidenced by its creation of its own token on Ethereum blockchain for instantaneous bank-to-bank transactions. This shows an interest among more large firms to embrace it.\n\nNumerous projects rely on Ethereum blockchain, so as the price of Ethereum increases it will have a ripple-through effect to other projects built upon it. This phenomenon is known as the Ethereum effect and it can help attract investors by stimulating other projects built on this cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the Ethereum foundation is working on innovations which make blockchain technology safer and accessible to more users.\n\nAs more and more people utilize the Ethereum blockchain, its popularity will only continue to increase. Its promise as a platform for building decentralized applications is undeniable; furthermore, the Ethereum team are constantly improving the functionality of this decentralized ledger which should have an overall positive effect on ether prices over time.\n\nEven with these positive trends, investors should remain mindful of cryptocurrencies\u2019 risks before engaging. It is wise to conduct your own research prior to investing and never commit more money than you can afford to lose.\n\nLong term, most experts hold an optimistic view on Ethereum prices. They anticipate its value increasing to $2500 by the end o 2023 and $4000 by 2030 and $5000 by 2032 due to its solid foundation, established reputation, and planned updates; furthermore it stands an excellent chance of becoming a triple point asset: store of value, payment vehicle and form of wealth creation."

For example, PLX token holders receive regular passive income payments, access to exclusive rewards, and other benefits depending on the staked amount.\n\nThe token burn mechanism for Pullix\u2019s PLX token aims to stabilize and potentially increase the token\u2019s value. This is achieved by allocating a portion of the platform\u2019s daily profits to purchase and permanently remove (burn) 50% of these tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply.\n\nThe remaining 50% rewards users for staking their PLX, incentivizing long-term holding and active participation in the Pullix ecosystem. This deflationary approach is designed to align the platform\u2019s interests with those of its users and investors.\n\nThis innovative approach makes the PLX token not just a medium of exchange but a key player in the Pullix ecosystem. As Pullix\u2019s trading platform gains popularity, the value of PLX is expected to increase, making it an attractive investment for traders.\n\nAnd with Pullix at the start of its journey, investors can get in early and reap the benefits as the platform gains momentum. Someare already recognizing this opportunity and snapping up PLX tokens for $0.04 before the price rises in subsequent stages.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Backbone of Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum (ETH) has surged from $1,500 to $2,245 in under a month as investors continue to show confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. The $2,100 price mark has acted as resistance since May 2022, and traders expect a huge pump once this level is breached.\n\nEthereum is the cryptocurrency with the most utility in the market. It is not only a store of value but also the foundation for various decentralized applications (DApps). There are lending platforms, games, and even decentralized exchanges built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum faces competition from the likes of Solana and Radix, which offer lower fees and faster speeds. The upcoming EIP-4844 procotol upgrade is expected to solve the scalability issue, helping Ethereum maintain its dominance as the number one platform for DApps.\n\nInstitutional investors are now taking notice of Ethereum, with spot Ethereum ETF applications sent to the SEC for approval. Should these be approved, we could see an influx of institutional funds into the market, leading Ethereum to the coveted $10,000 price point.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\u2019s Potential New Use Case\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) took the crypto world by storm in early 2021 as Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 tweeted favorably about the memecoin. While Dogecoin has no real utility, it has a strong community, making it a popular choice for sending low-cost transactions.\n\nHowever, Dogecoin may soon have another use case \u2014 as an accepted currency on X (Twitter) for tipping. Elon Musk still has the Dogecoin logo in his Twitter bio and hinted that this integration could be coming soon.\n\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine Mission One is set to carry a physical Dogecoin token to the moon, marking a symbolic journey for Dogecoin. This move could garner more attention from mainstream media and potentially lead to retail investors flocking to buy Dogecoin as FOMO sets in.\n\nThe Dogecoin chart shows that there have been numerous attempts to break the $0.10 \u2013 $0.11 resistance area. A successful close above this level can open up room for further upsides, potentially seeing Dogecoin reach $0.20 during Q1 of 2024.\n\nFor more information about Pullix, visit the links below:\n\nSite: https://pullix.io/\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/pullixmarkets\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "ChatGPT Picked 5 Top Coins to Buy in December, and Why - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The Crypto Basic asked ChatGPT to provide insights on 5 top cryptocurrencies to buy in December. The AI\u2019s choices are presented alongside the reasons provided.\n\nAs a somewhat regulated AI chatbot, posing the question directly to ChatGPT met resistance as the application said it was not equipped to \u201cprovide specific financial advice, including recommendations on which cryptocurrencies to buy.\u201d\n\nUpon getting this answer, we decided to Jailbreak it, and here are the coins it suggested:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nAlmost everyone must have guessed that Bitcoin will top the list of assets ChatGPT will suggest. The chatbot said the digital currency is the pioneering digital currency and the most recognized asset in the industry.\n\nChatGPT states that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and decentralized nature \u201cmake it a reliable store of value, attracting investors seeking stability amid market fluctuations.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s choice of Bitcoin is ideal, seeing the coin has soared to a new year high above $44,000 on the sentiment of a likely approval of Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum made the list as a smart contract protocol whose capabilities open it up to welcome decentralized applications that can properly boost innovation and widespread adoption.\n\nChatGPT also named the Ethereum upgrades like The Merge that ushered in Ethereum 2.0 as a basis for this surge. The chatbot said these upgrades contributed to the scalability of the Ethereum protocol as a whole and might impact the price of the asset.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin is the native asset of the Binance ecosystem and also serves the BNB Chain protocol. ChatGPT added Binance Coin to the list for its \u201creduced trading fees,\u201d which typically \u201camplifies its utility and demand.\u201d\n\nThe success of Binance in incubating successful projects has also been named a factor that can influence the price of BNB.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano also made the ChatGPT list for its scalability and sustainability. ChatGPT highlighted Cardano\u2019s focus on providing proper scaling solutions in the Web3 world as well as its \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d drive as a key push for its relevance in the industry.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted the smart contract capabilities of Cardano as a gateway for DApps that can also boost investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe last pick on the list is Solana. The coin was chosen for its high throughput, relatively lower fees, and a hoard of DeFi projects running on it. Solana\u2019s ecosystem growth was also a major turn-on that ChatGPT believes can add to SOL\u2019s \u201cperceived value and potential future success.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that many experts and entities, including VanEck, share a similar sentiment that Solana is primed for an impressive surge in the long term."

        "title": "Brazil\u2019s Biggest Bank Unleashes Crypto: Offers Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading to Millions - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ita\u00fa Unibanco, the largest private bank in Brazil, has launched its crypto trading service to provide its clients with additional trading options, as reported by Reuters on December 4,\n\nGuto Antunes, Head of Digital Assets at Ita\u00fa, said that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the initial offerings. The bank also plans to add more crypto assets in the future in compliance with the country\u2019s regulatory requirements.\n\nKeypoints\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco, Brazil\u2019s largest private bank, has launched a crypto trading service for Bitcoin and Ethereum. More assets may be added later.\n\nAs a custodian, Ita\u00fa will hold and safekeep customers\u2019 crypto assets. Customers can\u2019t yet deposit/withdraw to external wallets.\n\nIta\u00fa has partnered with other major Brazilian banks on a central bank digital currency initiative called Drex.\n\nCrypto adoption is surging across Latin America, with Brazil as a top global crypto market. This is attracting companies like OKX to expand locally.\n\nBanks globally are exploring tokenization to improve efficiencies. JPMorgan\u2019s JPM Coin processes $1 billion in bank transactions daily, with expectations to reach $10 billion soon.\n\nBrazil Is A Massive Crypto Market\n\nAs a custodian agency, Ita\u00fa Unibanco provides the holding and safekeeping of customers\u2019 crypto assets, in addition to offering exposures to crypto trading. Antunes alternatively noted that customers can\u2019t deposit and withdraw assets to an external wallet at the initial phase.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that when you keep your money in the bank account, you will have the guarantee of Itau\u2019s balance sheet as security for the amounts invested,\u201d Antunes added.\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco has reportedly joined forces with other major institutions like BTG Pactual and Santander Brasil, to facilitate the national digital currency initiative Drex. Established in 2020 and officially launched in 2023, Drex is Brazilian central bank\u2019s project to explore the feasibility of central bank digital currency (CBCD).\n\nOther banks in Brazil like BTG Pactual and Nubank previously introduced their trading platforms that allow customers to diversify their portfolio. Nubank now offers 14 crypto options on its Nubank Cripto platform. The bank had also issued its own token Nucoin to foster loyalty programs and streamline client\u2019s access to digital assets.\n\nLike Nubank, BTG Pactual launched its crypto trading platform Mynt in late 2022. The bank initially focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum with future plans to release additional options for customers.\n\nCrypto adoption is one of the largest trends in Latin America, with Brazil leading the wave. As a top global crypto market, the country has attracted a number of industry figures to expand their local operations, including OKX.\n\nIn November, the crypto firm announced the launch of its crypto exchange integrated with Web3 wallet with exclusive focus on the Brazilian market. There may be more developments coming from the market.\n\nBanks Gear Toward Tokenization\n\nTokenization has become a hot trend among financial and banking institutions. Tokenization can streamline various financial processes, such as payments, settlements, and trade finance.\n\nBanks can potentially reduce the need for intermediaries, minimize transaction times, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The transparency of blockchain technology also contributes to reducing fraud and errors.\n\nJPMorgan announced last week its bank-backed token JPM Coin would be ready for interbank transactions. The blockchain token recently debuted on Partior, a multi-bank system backed by JPMorgan, DBS Bank, Temasek and Standard Chartered. Partior aims to enable quick multi-currency transactions across its members.\n\nAlthough the Singapore-based project is already operational, details about its inner workings and usage numbers remain unclear. According to Ledger Insights, DBS Bank is active on the platform, but other banks have yet to adopt it.\n\nJPMorgan secured a major position, surpassing other US-based banks that still need permission to deploy this solution. This came after the bank received a no-objection letter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for Partior\u2019s use case in May.\n\nThe inclusion of JPM Coin in Partior could potentially boost usage, given the scale and significance of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain token, which has a near-ubiquitous presence in banking markets. In October, Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan\u2019s Global Head of Payments, announced that the token was facilitating transactions worth $1 billion per day.\n\nIn November, Umar Farooq, JPMorgan\u2019s Head of Global Financial Institutions Payments, expressed expectations of these numbers soaring. He claimed that the network could achieve $10 billion in daily transactions within the next year or two."
