        "title": "Brief History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche curiosity into a mainstream financial phenomenon, transforming how we think about money, technology, and business. It began with the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency that promised a decentralized, secure, and immutable way to transfer value across the globe. Bitcoin's success paved the way for Ethereum, a platform that expanded the potential of blockchain technology with its smart contracts and decentralized applications. As the crypto landscape continued to evolve, new innovations like the BlockDAG Network emerged, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional blockchain architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article explores the fascinating history of cryptocurrency, from the inception of Bitcoin to the rise of Ethereum and the cutting-edge developments in BlockDAG Network, providing a comprehensive overview of the journey and the impact these technologies have had on the world.\n\nBitcoin: The Genesis of Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin, often hailed as digital gold, revolutionized the financial world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. The brainchild of a pseudonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's white paper was released on October 28, 2008. The document introduced a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, enabling digital value transfer between parties without intermediaries like banks. This system utilized a blockchain, a chain of transactions stored on multiple computers competing to process and store transactions. This process, known as mining, created new Bitcoin BTC tokens and ensured the network's security and decentralization.\n\nThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. At the time, 10,000 BTC was worth $41. As Bitcoin's value surged over the years, reaching peaks like $70,000 in March 2024, this transaction became a legendary story in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's journey from a cryptographic novelty to a multi-trillion-dollar asset involved overcoming significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and security breaches. However, its decentralized, immutable, and divisible nature made it a revolutionary global financial instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum: Beyond Currency to Decentralized Applications\n\nWhile Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced a decentralized platform for running smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's unique feature is its Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that run exactly as programmed without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. This innovation opened the door to numerous applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network by compensating miners for computational work and transaction validation. Despite facing volatility and security challenges, Ethereum has solidified its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network: The Next Evolution in Blockchain Technology\n\nThe traditional blockchain architecture, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, operates on a linear sequence of blocks. While effective, this model faces scalability issues, particularly with increasing transaction volumes. Enter BlockDAG Network , a novel approach that aims to address these limitations.\n\nBlockDAG has attracted investor\u2019s attention and capital as a decentralized network structure where transactions are arranged in a graph format rather than a linear chain. This architecture allows multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, significantly enhancing transaction throughput and scalability. Key characteristics of BlockDAG networks include parallel transactions, enhanced scalability, and improved security.\n\nNow BlockDAG Network has attracted even more attention within the industry with the release of its second keynote video, humorously titled \u201cFrom the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe project's presale has amassed over $40 million in record time for any cryptocurrency or digital asset initiative. This impressive funding surge underscores the rising interest in BlockDAG Network as a new store of value and passive income generator, akin to Bitcoin.\n\nThe momentum behind BlockDAG Network suggests that the $40 million raised is merely the beginning of what is poised to be a groundbreaking force in the digital market.\n\nThe Evolution of Crypto Assets and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's brief surpassing of $70,000 on Monday marked a peak amidst a fourth consecutive week of inflows into crypto investment products. CoinShares International Ltd. reported $185 million in inflows for the week ending May 31, with $2 billion invested in May alone. This surge underscored the growing institutional interest and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, characterized by its volatility, continues to evolve with significant developments like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe journey from Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network illustrates the rapid evolution and diversification of cryptocurrency technologies. From enabling peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized applications to enhancing scalability and security, these innovations are reshaping the financial landscape.\n\nThe digital evolution promises not only to disrupt traditional financial systems but also to democratize access to financial services, empowering users worldwide.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Should Ethereum Layer 2s Urgently Decentralize Their Sequencers? - Unchained",
        "content": "After Layer 2 network Linea halted block production this week, many demanded the sequencers be decentralized. But is it necessary?\n\nThe recent temporary halt of block production on Consensys\u2019 Linea network following a $6.8 million exploit on the Velocore DEX, has renewed the debate about decentralizing sequencers in Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Amidst this, on Wednesday, Optimism passed a proposal to implement fraud proofs. Although this wouldn\u2019t help decentralize the sequencer, it would propel the blockchain to what\u2019s referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d decentralization on layer 2s.\n\nSequencers\n\nin layer 2 solutions are entities that order and batch transactions before submitting them to the layer 1 blockchain, enabling more transactions per second at a lower cost. However, the centralization of these sequencers has raised concerns about security and censorship.\n\nLearn more: What Are Sequencers in Layer 2 Protocols?\n\nSteven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, which develops Ethereum\u2019s top L2, Arbitrum, told Unchained that it\u2019s important to properly contextualize when discussing sequencers: \u201cThe term \u2018sequencer\u2019 means different things in different protocols.\u201d The sequencer\u2019s role is to order transactions, thus the definition. While this centralized component allows for faster transaction processing, it could censor by delaying transactions, though it cannot alter account balances or post illegitimate transactions. This safeguard is ensured by a network of validators that can challenge any incorrect actions via a fraud-proof mechanism.\n\nTherefore, according to Goldfeder, while the sequencer is centralized, the validation process is not, involving entities like Offchain Labs, Consensys, and even Google. However, Goldfeder highlighted that the \u201choly grail\u201d is that everyone can validate. To achieve that, in the next couple weeks, they expect to roll out Arbitrum Bold, a new protocol for managing disputes on Arbitrum chains that enables permissionless validation. Goldfeder suggests that while decentralizing sequencers is an important problem, it is a \u201cbit smaller than what a lot of people might expect.\u201d\n\nChristine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy Digital, believes that decentralization is a spectrum and that fault-proof mechanisms alone do not ensure decentralization. \u201cRollups in general are significantly less decentralized and secure than the base layer, Ethereum.\u201d However, she thinks that having a working fault-proof mechanism does not mean that a rollup is more decentralized than another because \u201cworking fault proofs is not the only mechanism that rollups need to achieve higher levels of decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she told Unchained via email.\n\nHaseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly, concurs, noting that while Arbitrum has fault proofs, they are currently whitelist-only. \u201cThe important thing about sequencers is not decentralizing so much as making the sequencers more robust. That almost certainly comes first,\u201d he told Unchained.\n\nEven though fault proofs are not the only measure of decentralization for L2s, of the top five L2s by TVL, only Arbitrum has a fraud system in place. Optimism, Base, Blast and Mantle, currently lack fraud-proof mechanisms, meaning their sequencers have more power over transaction outcomes. \u201cBasically they have a dictator,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\n\u201cWe need fault proofs on OP Stack, and then we need fault proofs to be reliable enough that anybody should be able to submit them, and move away from security councils and multisigs,\u201d Qureshi said.\n\nKim argues that while optimistic rollups should work towards decentralizing their sequencers, they must also build working fault proofs, robust governance mechanisms, reduce reliance on admin controls, lower fees, and improve interoperability with other rollups. \u201cA decentralized sequencer may be one of the hardest initiatives for a rollup to work towards but certainly not the only important one in the near-term to improve a rollup\u2019s decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she added.\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "title": "The Base Ecosystem and Coinbase: Your Ultimate Guide to the Ethereum Layer-2 - CoinCentral",
        "content": "The Base ecosystem, incubated within Coinbase, is a Layer-2 solution designed to make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable, reduce transaction costs, and improve dApp user experiences.\n\nDespite ties to a centralized exchange, the project aims for progressive decentralization, which is critical for an open cryptoeconomy. Built on the OP Stack, Base ensures security, stability, and scalability for on-chain apps.\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Base has become one of the fastest-growing Layer-2 networks with nearly $2 billion in total value locked.\n\nNote: Base currently has no plans to introduce a new token; it uses ETH as its gas token. Be wary of potential scams offering fake Base tokens.\n\nThe following Base guide explores the ecosystem\u2019s growth metrics & potential, leading projects, and a step-by-step guide to use it.\n\nAbout the Base Ecosystem: The Vibe\n\nBase significantly benefits from its integration with Coinbase\u2019s large user base, which has helped usher in rapid user adoption and project integration.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in North America with nearly 100 million users. The integration with Base has enabled seamless fiat onramps and access to a large user base.\n\nBase operates as a decentralized network, and Coinbase does not intervene in its daily operations. While Coinbase supports the ecosystem, Base maintains its decentralized nature by operating independently, utilizing the OP Stack for scalability and security.\n\nThe benefits of the Base blockchain for developers are numerous. Beyond financial investments, the Base ecosystem fund frequently offers developer grants and organizes hackathons. So far, it has invested in projects like:\n\nAvanti, an oracle-based synthetic derivatives protocol, that allows users to trade crypto and real-world assets with up to 100x leverage and earn yield as a market-maker by providing USDC liquidity.\n\nBSX, a decentralized limit order book, that combines the best of CeFi and DeFi trading experiences, offering features like cross-collateralization, powerful cross-margining, and self-custody.\n\nOnboard , a project that provides an onchain, self-custodial path for users to onramp and offramp crypto in a peer-to-peer manner through their own MPC wallet and smart contracts, focusing on developing markets.\n\nOpenCover, t he first Layer 2 insurance aggregator that works with underwriters to protect DeFi users against onchain risks such as smart contract hacks and oracle failures.\n\nt Paragraph, an onchain creator platform that helps creators publish, share, and monetize their content using permissionless protocols, enabling novel onchain mechanisms like turning posts into collectibles.\n\nTruflation, an onchain financial oracle providing automated, independent daily inflation reporting by compiling data from millions of points and sources, offering a higher fidelity picture of inflation.\n\nBase\u2019s Coinbase link gets its foot in the door with potential partnerships with institutional investors, enterprises, and developer communities. These partnerships could lead to larger-scale projects and collaborations that drive substantial value for the ecosystem.\n\nAbout Base Ecosystem: The Numbers\n\nBase saw its first notable spurt of activity and TVL in September 2023, but its most significant in Q2 2024.\n\nBase\u2019s blockchain total value locked in 2024 is nearly $2 billion as of writing.\n\nBase saw its daily transactions jump from 500,000 in March 2024 to over 3 million in April 2024.\n\nAround the same time, Base broke the $1 billion in total value bridged and currently has about $2.1 trillion of total value bridged, with ETH taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nBy April 2024, Base had over 400,000 sign-ups and a cumulative trading volume surpassing $1 billion, driven by a memecoin frenzy.\n\nBase Explorer is the recommended chain explorer.\n\nAbout Base: The Tech\n\nBase, like other \u201coptimistic rollups,\u201d assumes transactions are valid initially, reducing computational overhead. Suspicious transactions undergo fraud-proof verification, maintaining low costs.\n\nDefinition: optimistic rollup (noun)\u2013 Transactions are initially assumed to be valid, hence \u201coptimistic,\u201d and are later validated on-chain. A fraud-proof mechanism is triggered to verify its validity if any transaction is suspected to be fraudulent. This allows for significant scalability and efficiency improvements while leveraging the underlying blockchain\u2019s security. Several other blockchain projects also utilize optimistic rollups for scaling, including the pioneering Optimism, Arbitrum, and Boba Network.\n\nBase is designed to seamlessly integrate with Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other chains. Base offers cost-effective EVM features, developer-friendly APIs, and smart contract wallets. As the second core dev team on the OP Stack, Base collaborates with OP Labs to build a robust, interoperable web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe Base RPC Endpoint is here: https://mainnet.base.org.\n\nNetwork information can be found here: https://docs.base.org/docs/network-information\n\nBase is a decentralized Ethereum scaling solution, helping boost transaction speed and reduce costs.\n\nUnlike traditional Layer-1 blockchains (like Ethereum), which handle transactions individually, Base consolidates them into batches, processing them more efficiently and economically before recording them on Ethereum.\n\nHow to Use Base\n\nUsing Base, or any Layer-2, requires jumping through a few hoops. Basically, you\u2019re going to move funds from the Ethereum base layer onto Layer-2.\n\nStep 1 Choose your Wallet: Use MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStep 2: Change/Add Network (top left corner)\n\nYou\u2019ll probably see Base pop up, but just make sure it matches the below criteria:\n\nRPC Endpoint: https://mainnet.base.org`\n\nChain ID: 8453\n\nCurrency Symbol: ETH\n\nStep 3 Bridge ETH: Bridge ETH from Ethereum or other EVM chains to Base once connected.\n\nDefinition: Bridge (noun, verb) \u2013 transferring assets, like ETH, from one blockchain network to another. This involves moving your cryptocurrency from its original network (e.g., Ethereum) to a new network (e.g., Base) so you can use it within the new ecosystem. The bridge ensures that the value of your assets remains intact while allowing them to be utilized on different blockchain networks.\n\n\ud83d\udca9Note: While the gas fees are significantly lower on Base, you still have to pay ETH\u2019s Layer-1 fees to bridge funds.\n\nBlock Explorer: Https://basescan.org\n\nFor more details, visit https://www.base.org.\n\nMost Popular Base Projects\n\nDeFi\n\nThe most active (based on unique active wallets) dApps in the Base ecosystem are decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, 1inch Network, SushiSwap V3, and Compound.\n\nAerodrome, a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base\u2019s central liquidity hub, is a stand-out infrastructure in the Base ecosystem.\n\nMemecoins\n\nMemecoins such as TOSHI, TYBG, NORMIE, and BRETT drive significant trading volumes and transactional activity on Base.\n\nAs of writing, the $BRETT memecoin is having its moment in the sun.\n\nOther Base Ecosystem dApps\n\nDmail Network is a social messaging platform offering email and marketing services; Dmail Network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient communication within the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nParallel is a popular trading card game that integrates social elements.\n\nFrens On Chain is a unique digital pet project featuring dynamic NFTs.\n\nFinal Thoughts: From Coinbase to Base\n\nThe Base ecosystem, while backed by Coinbase, is designed to be a cornerstone for the decentralized future of blockchain technology.\n\nCoinbase is already credited with advancing and advocating cryptocurrency adoption to a mainstream audience, and its contributions have undoubtedly helped shape the United States policy toward cryptocurrency.\n\nBase, a decentralized Layer-2, is an exciting move from the organization and one of its first forays with direct entrepreneurship and incubation in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also launched the USDC stablecoin, an ERC-20, through CENTRE, a Coinbase-founded organization, and in collaboration with Circle.\n\nMuch of the Base hype revolves around memecoins\u2013 similar to how Solana\u2019s ecosystem received a significant pump in activity and TVL in Q1 2024. However, given its growth within the Coinbase ecosystem and beyond, the project\u2019s potential shouldn\u2019t be overlooked."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst\n\nIn late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMany consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF\u2019s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching.\n\nThe firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin\u2019s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale.\n\nMany believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications.

        "title": "Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin to $100K: How Ethereum and Furrever Token Fit into the Picture - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, June 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement following a bold prediction from Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad.\" Kiyosaki forecasts that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $100,000 by June 2024. This bullish outlook has sparked widespread interest and speculation within the crypto community, highlighting Bitcoin's potential and drawing attention to other significant cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Furrever Token (FURR). Here's a detailed look at how these three cryptocurrencies fit into the evolving market landscape.\n\nBitcoin: The Path to $100K\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s prediction is grounded in several key factors that suggest a strong upward trajectory for Bitcoin. As of early June 2024, Bitcoin is trading near $68,500, with technical analyses indicating a symmetrical triangle pattern that could push its price to between $74,000 and $75,000. This bullish continuation pattern, coupled with a surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows and the post-halving supply dynamics, supports a potential breakout.\n\nMoreover, Kiyosaki's forecast is backed by historical trends and macroeconomic conditions. He has emphasized Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, taxation, and stock market manipulation, urging investors to trust in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Sandbox, an Ethereum metaverse game platform, announced Wednesday that it has raised $20 million in convertible promissory notes at a $1 billion valuation. That makes the long-running project the latest crypto \u201cunicorn,\u201d based on the billion-dollar valuation.\n\nThe latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox\u2019s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited. LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures also participated in the round.\n\n\"We are deeply honored by the continuing commitment to the vision of The Sandbox, and we're incredibly excited about the future of composable user-generated content games,\" said Animoca co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu, in a statement.\n\nWith the new funding in tow, The Sandbox\u2019s development team said that its key priorities include improving creator tools, adding new social and gameplay features, and developing a mobile version scheduled for 2025.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Sandbox is one of the most prominent blockchain games, thanks to partnerships with over 400 celebrities and brands\u2014including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, and Paris Hilton\u2014and previously immense demand for in-game land plots sold via NFTs. In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg\u2019s metaverse mansion in 2021.\n\nThe game\u2019s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko. However, the price of its NFT land plots has fallen sharply since metaverse hype peaked in early 2022\u2014from 3.9 ETH ($11,700) to 0.08 ETH ($300) today.\n\n\"Our mission at The Sandbox is to develop creative tools and technologies that bring fairness and new opportunities for all types of creators in the open metaverse,\" said The Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid, in a release.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Celebrity memecoins have been the latest craze to dominate the crypto space, but Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin says there needs to be more to these projects than what\u2019s currently on offer.\n\nVitalik Buterin would prefer if celebrity crypto projects more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since celebrity tokens broke into the crypto space, with famous personalities like Davido, Iggy Azalea, Rich The Kid, Trippie Redd, and Caitlyn Jenner all launching memecoins that saw large boosts of trading activity.\n\nIn most cases, these tokens associated with celebrities saw wild upswings in price, followed by a sharp and rapid plunge in value. One exception is Azalea\u2019s Solana-based MOTHER token which surged 2,260% after an initial decline and now sits at a market cap of over $100 million.\n\nThe frenzy around the token prompted a Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske to tweet that if MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation it would also be \u201cthe mother of this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation.\u201d\n\nBurniske\u2019s comments invoked a response from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said he was feeling \u201cquite unhappy with \u2018this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation\u2019 so far.\u201d\n\nIn order for a celebrity crypto project to gain his respect, Buterin said it would have to offer form of public-good end goal, rather than simply enrich the celebrity who issued the token and early adopters.\n\nIn his view, these projects would have more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\n\u201cAs much as I dislike token voting DAOs, at least they give *something* for people to do and organize around. The DAO should not fully decide the agenda, but it can have some influence,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cMake something that lasts 10+ years, rather than bubbling around for a few months and then being forgotten.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin doesn\u2019t have a problem with memecoins itself, saying in a March blog post on the subject that he valued people\u2019s desire to have fun, and would rather the crypto space swim with this current than against it.\n\n\u201cI want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just by \u201cbringing in users\u201d) get more mindshare,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nData from Kaito AI shared last month shows that memes were the most dominant crypto narrative after AI, growing its mindshare within the market by 53% from the start of the year until May."

        "content": "VanEck believes Ethereum (ETH) will be worth roughly $22,000 by 2030, the asset manager said in a comprehensive analysis published on June 5.\n\nThe forecast, developed by the firm\u2019s Digital Assets Research team, led by Matthew Sigel, highlights Ethereum\u2019s strong growth potential within both traditional and cryptocurrency-focused portfolios.\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis attributes the optimistic price target to Ethereum\u2019s expanding role as a high-growth, internet-native commercial system that could disrupt traditional financial sectors and Big Tech platforms.\n\nThe report emphasized Ethereum\u2019s significant user base and economic activity, noting that the network currently supports approximately 20 million monthly active users, facilitates $4 trillion in annual settlement value, and oversees $308 billion in digital assets.\n\n$2 trillion market cap\n\nVanEck\u2019s valuation model for ETH is based on a forecast of $66 billion in free cash flows \u2014 the amount of money generated by a blockchain network \u2014 by 2030, with a 33x valuation multiple on those cash flows.\n\nThe model considers Ethereum\u2019s potential to disrupt various business sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to the report, the Ethereum network is poised to capture substantial market share from traditional financial markets and technology giants.\n\nIf Ethereum maintains its dominance among smart contract platforms, VanEck sees a credible path to generating $66 billion in free cash flow \u2014 the amount of money generated by a blockchain network \u2014 for token holders \u2014 supporting a $2.2 trillion market capitalization and a $22,000 price per ETH by 2030.\n\nRevolutionary asset\n\nThe company emphasized ETH\u2019s broad use cases, stating:\n\n\u201cWe believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.\u201d\n\nVanEck cited ETH\u2019s role as \u201cdigital oil\u201d consumed in on-chain use and called it \u201cprogrammable money and a yield-bearing commodity.\u201d\n\nIt also referred to ETH as an internet reserve currency that prices activity and assets in Ethereum\u2019s $1 billion ecosystem and connecting blockchains.\n\nAccording to the report, Ethereum generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, surpassing some web2 apps like Etsy, Twitch, and Roblox. Meanwhile, its 20 million monthly active users surpass Instacart, Robinhood, and Vrbo.\n\nVanEck added that ETH offers cost-saving features, better interconnectivity for social applications, the opportunity to share earnings with end users, and a basis for AI applications.\n\nInvestment risks\n\nWhile the report is optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, it also emphasizes several risks associated with investing in ETH.\n\nOne major concern is Ethereum\u2019s reliance on speculative activities, which could lead to significant downside risk if market sentiment shifts.\n\nRegulatory changes pose another risk, as they could classify ETH as a security, thereby imposing stringent legal requirements on Ethereum-based businesses. The competitive landscape is also a threat, with emerging technologies like Solana challenging its market dominance.\n\nAdditionally, government actions to control non-sovereign financial systems could negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Shanghai Upgrade: How High Can Ethereum (ETH) Go? - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and the giant behind the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has always been a frontrunner in innovation from the get-go.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade, also known as \u201cShapella\u201d\u2014 a coinage of Shanghai and Capella, Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers, respectively\u2014implemented on April 12, 2023, marked a major leap forward by finalizing Ethereum\u2019s full transition to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) network. But this is also changing the staking and liquidity of ether (ETH) as we know it.\n\nETH\u2019s adoption growth was mainly driven by the Shanghai upgrade, which allows withdrawals of staked $ETH, and the popularity of liquid staking. pic.twitter.com/iepA0hCHh3 \u2014 Crypto.com (@cryptocom) January 26, 2024\n\nThe Technical Side of the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a \u201chard fork\u201d that introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4895 being the most notable. This proposal introduces a new system-level operation to streamline the process for validators to withdraw their staked ether (ETH), allowing for more freedom and flexibility. Gone are the days of the manual process, as EIP-4895 automatically funnels withdrawals from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) once they\u2019re eligible.\n\nValidators have staked about 16 million ETH to secure the network. Since September 2022, when Merge shifted Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, validators have played a critical role. Under the new rule, by staking 32 ETH, validators can participate in block validation, with each staked ETH increasing the chance of earning block rewards. However, the Merge required validators to lock up their ETH and rewards until a future update.\n\nEIP-4895 simplifies this process by automatically checking accounts for eligible excess balances every few days instead of requiring manual requests.\n\nIn a nutshell, validators, as key players in Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism, stake ETH to secure the network and validate transactions. Each staked ETH acts like a golden ticket, which enhances the odds of being chosen to propose the next block and earn rewards. Before the Shanghai upgrade, staked ETH and rewards were locked. Still, the upgrade now allows validators to withdraw their assets, which has considerable implications for Ethereum\u2019s liquidity and the staking dynamics.\n\nImpact on Staking and Liquidity\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade fundamentally changed the game for stakers.\n\nThe #Shanghai upgrade allows validators to withdraw staked $ETH locked in the Beacon chain\n\n\n\nAfter one year from that, explore the $ETH supply among the top LSD entities since the Shanghai upgrade\n\n\n\nNotable top 3\n\nLido: + 3.47M\n\nBinance: + 896K\n\nRocketPool: + 291K $LDO $RPL $ANKR\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5dY26Ob4Tw \u2014 Layer2Gather (@layer2gather) April 12, 2024\n\nWith staked ETH now unlocked, validators can freely withdraw their holdings or stakes and claim rewards freely. This newfound liquidity is a win-win for both investors seeking staking rewards and the Ethereum network itself, which benefits from increased security through staking.\n\nMoreover, liquid staking providers, which offer staking services to users with smaller ETH holdings, may see increased usage due to the ability to unlock staked ETH. These platforms, which charge a fee on staking income, could become even more popular.\n\nMarket Position and Ripple Effects\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade caused quite a stir in the crypto market at the time. The release of unlocked ETH potentially tipped the scales for Ethereum\u2019s position and price, as multiple reports have shown.\n\nIn all, during Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS, ETH\u2019s price hovered around $1,800. Right after \u201cShapella,\u201d ETH\u2019s price rose slightly, trading 1.4% higher within 24 hours. It jumped more than 6% immediately after the upgrade, crossing $2,000 for the first time in nearly a year.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0#DidYouKnow that Ethereum staking APY hit 8.76%, a historical high.\n\nAnd $ETH net deposit saw daily growth after Shanghai Upgrade.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc40Will the fact that the more staked $ETH & the less circulating pump $ETH price soon?\n\nStay close: https://t.co/OfKehFd4Vu pic.twitter.com/Fr5zZ927D5 \u2014 Gate.io (@gate_io) May 16, 2023\n\nCrypto trading advisor Laurent Kssis of CEC Capital predicted short-term volatility as traders who bought ETH in anticipation of the upgrade sold their holdings to cash out. Kssis suggested that this selling could lead to a strong supply of ether flooding the market, potentially causing the price to drop. At the time of his prediction, ETH was trading near $1,875, and he speculated that it could drop below $1,700 for the first time in two weeks as investors take profits.\n\nDespite short-term fluctuations, at the time, the long-term impact of the upgrade could be positive, particularly if institutional investors are attracted by the increased security and stability of the PoS system. This could boost institutional demand for Ethereum, potentially driving its price in the long run.\n\nMoreover, the Shanghai upgrade wasn\u2019t just about validator rewards. The upgrade also included proposals to address Ethereum\u2019s major weaknesses: slow transaction speeds and high fees. These issues have been a thorn in the sides of DeFi and NFT applications. The surge in DeFi activity has significantly increased the total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum chain, and the NFT boom from 2021 to early 2022 has further exacerbated these problems, leading to poor user experiences and high transaction costs.\n\nProposals EIP-3855 and EIP-3860, part of the upgrade, address these issues to make transactions faster and cheaper. This could reignite interest in DeFi and NFTs on the Ethereum network. While EIP-3855 should help address transaction speeds, and EIP-3860 hopes to reduce transaction costs, their broader effect on ETH transactions remains to be seen.\n\nEIP-4895: enables validators to withdraw their stake of 32 $ETH from the staking contract on the Ethereum blockchain since the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).https://t.co/x1mGqv9ZZR \u2014 IQ (@IQWIKI) April 3, 2023\n\nThese improvements might encourage ecosystems affected by high gas fees and slow transactions, which had moved to other chains like Solana or Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Polygon, to consider a comeback.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a watershed moment for the platform itself and the entire crypto landscape. By enabling validator withdrawals, the upgrade has not only boosted Ethereum\u2019s liquidity but also has the potential to shape its market position. As Ethereum progresses on its innovative path, it will be interesting to see how these developments shape the future of decentralized finance and digital ownership and ultimately influence the future of the entire crypto landscape.\n\nAuthor: Ayanfe Fakunle\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organisations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

        "content": "Ethereum price has been consolidating amid a bigger market structure\u2014the bull flag. Investors are watching closely for when the price of Ethereum decides to move higher, as 30% gains may be at stake if they miss the move. In the meantime, Bitcoin adoption continues to soar as BTC price seeks to break the previous all-time high price.\n\nETH price hovered around $3,811 during European trading hours on Friday, a 1.3% decrease in 24 hours and a 1.4% increase in 7 days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH/BTC Price Analysis: Ethereum Price Creeping Up Channel, May Breakout in Less than 1 Week\n\nEthereum price has been stuck in the current consolidation zone for the past eight days. Nevertheless, this chart pattern is part of a previously formed bull flag with massive profit implications if it breaks out.\n\nThe price of Ethereum is trending above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), signaling bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nAdditionally, ETH price action has been creeping up an ascending channel, which indicates a short accumulation phase before a breakout.\n\nExtending the channel shows ETH price may try a breakout in about 4 days if all factors remain constant. However, fundamental news can either make or break the current Ethereum market structure.\n\nOn the other side, Bitcoin price is also sporting a bull flag, but in a 4-hour timeframe. The price is also trending above the 50-day and 200-day SMA, a bullish signal for the asset. BTC price is currently en route to testing the upper boundary of the range.\n\nIf it manages to break out, we may see a $74,000 Bitcoin price in the coming days. $72,300 may push some resistance, but if the bulls are strong enough, they may slice through this barrier easily. On the flip side, strong support exists around $67,000 that may hold up the price.\n\nETH/BTC Price Future Outlook\n\nEthereum price went from $2,800 to $3,900 in one candle, and it is currently holding up well at $3,700 to $3,800. All this is happening before the S-1 applications are approved and an ETF is launched.\n\nWhile Bitcoin grinds up slowly, ETH price holds the keys to big gains after $4,000 with the ETF launch. The market is eagerly waiting for S-1 clarity as the 10-day window to revoke the ETF has elapsed.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s open interest hits a new high at 520,000 BTC, exceeding March\u2019s all-time high. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs are thriving with $488.1 million inflows.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto markets are full of speculation, which often proves accurate. The Bitcoin ETF represents the best-case scenario. As investors speculate on the ETA of the Ethereum ETF, there is a general sentiment that the SEC is stalling and that ETF approval is inevitable. Investors eagerly await the outcome of this ETF struggle.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Solana outperformed Ethereum in active addresses and trading volume.\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s growth, Ethereum\u2019s network activity and security position it as superior.\n\nMirroring the broader market trend, both Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] exhibited positive trading activity, with ETH experiencing a 1.4% increase and SOL showing a 4.64% hike in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, delving deeper into their performance revealed an interesting insight: Solana has surpassed Ethereum in activity metrics, boasting a higher number of active addresses and trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s active addresses surged above 1 million, while Ethereum\u2019s remained stagnant, highlighting a notable disparity between the two networks.\n\nFurther confirming this sentiment, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data revealed that SOL outperformed ETH in social dominance as well.\n\nWith such key metrics hinting at Solana\u2019s potential to overtake Ethereum, a fundamental question emerges: Which blockchain will emerge victorious in 2024 and beyond?\n\nEthereum vs Solana: The debate\n\nSharing their insights, Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake and Solana Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko engaged in a debate on Ethereum versus Solana on the \u2018Bankless\u2019 podcast.\n\nShedding light on what\u2019s good about Solana, Drake noted,\n\n\u201cI think what Solana is doing for Ethereum is that it is providing healthy competition. It\u2019s a sort of accelerationism and not only because of good execution but also because of contrarianism.\u201d\n\nIn response, Yakovenko, while praising ETH\u2019s decision to prioritize security over scalability, he said,\n\n\u201cPeople think Ethereum is moving slowly but if you look at the size of the network, its value\u2026I would be terrified of any changes to Solana if it was at that value.\u201d\n\nHe further went ahead and added,\n\n\u201cEthereum is at a point which I think every other L1 should be envious of, and try to get there as fast as they can. All of that I think puts it in a class in my mind actually above Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis highlights that Ethereum is still the winner in the L1 space owing to the most network effects, liquidity, maturity, and security, making it pre-ordained to surpass Bitcoin and become number one.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Drake justified that Solana could become the \u2018internet of value\u2019, justifying its $100 billion valuation.\n\nHe further added that SOL\u2019s developers are more focused on building user-targeting products rather than infrastructure, which contributes to its success.\n\nSOL a competitor to ETH?\n\nAdding to the fray, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor, drawing parallels with ETH\u2019s 2020 bull run highlighted Solana\u2019s emergence as a strong Ethereum competitor.\n\nHe best put it when he said,"

Fast. pic.twitter.com/8XLtyN5dv5 \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 5, 2024\n\nIn Q1 2020, Ethereum and its solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon had an average of over 250, 000 users daily. Fast forward to Q1 2024, and this number has grown to about 2. 25 million with Layer-2 solutions such as Optimism, Base, and zkSync among others.\n\nThis shift towards layer-2 solutions has seen Ethereum\u2019s mainnet user base reduced to 378,000 active users while Polygon alone has 1. 3 million users, with the other layer-2 networks having approximately 1. 5 million active users in total.\n\nLayer-2 scaling is considered by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as an essential component of Ethereum\u2019s development plan, comparing it to the sharding idea from the previous Eth 2 strategy. This strategy is to promote development in several subcultures of Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the issuer of one of the most popular crypto ETFs, VanEck, has raised its forecast for the Ethereum price to $22,000 by 2030 due to high revenue per user and the ability to attract financial market players and Big Tech.\n\nEther is currently at $3,862 and with the rumors of spot Ether ETFs in the near future, many people are expecting Ethereum to reach new highs. However, some warn that flows into these new crypto ETFs could be lower than that of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe extensive use of layer-2 solutions on Ethereum has increased the network\u2019s user base by more than 2. 25 million daily active users in the first quarter of 2024, which will significantly change the network\u2019s scale and openness."

This is the impressive forecast by VanEck for the native crypto of the Ethereum blockchain. This ambitious estimate draws the attention of experts and investors worldwide. But what justifies such an evaluation?\n\nVanEck sees big for Ethereum\n\nCurrently, ether is trading around $3,852, a value that may seem modest compared to VanEck\u2019s ambitious forecasts. The investment company, in its recent report, envisions a future where ether would reach the staggering sum of $22,000 by 2030. This prediction highlights the enormous growth potential of this crypto and its disruptive capabilities in the global financial landscape.\n\nVanEck, renowned for its sharp analyses and bold forecasts, anticipates a major transformation of the market thanks to Ethereum. This projection, though spectacular, is supported by current trends and notable advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem, positioning its native crypto as a key player in the evolution of the digital economy.\n\nThe arguments put forward by VanEck to justify this explosive growth\n\nOne of the main growth drivers for ether, according to VanEck, is its revolutionary aspect. Ethereum offers a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that can transform various sectors, including traditional finance, digital payments, and even artificial intelligence. This capacity to disrupt and innovate positions Ethereum as a potential leader in the new era of the digital economy.\n\nAnother key factor is the development of ether-based ETFs. According to VanEck, the approval and widespread adoption of Ethereum ETFs will facilitate institutional investors\u2019 access to this asset. This opening to large investors could significantly increase the demand and liquidity of ether, thereby consolidating its market position.\n\nFinally, the on-chain data analysis conducted by VanEck reveals promising financial indicators for Ethereum. The report highlights significant cash flows estimated at $66 billion and sustained network activity, reinforcing the robustness and long-term viability of the Ethereum blockchain. These observations enable VanEck to justify its optimistic prediction of $22,000 per ether by 2030.\n\nThe future of ether according to VanEck looks promising with a bold forecast of $22,000 by 2030. It remains to be seen whether these predictions will materialize in an ever-changing crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are accused of wire fraud and money laundering in what authorities called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nThe DOJ said the charges stemmed from a 2021 scheme to get NFT collectors to purchase one of \u201c10,000 unique\u201d Ethereum-based NFTs called Evolved Apes that could then be used in an online battle royale game. The defendants made off with 798 ETH, worth around $2.7 million at the time.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. \u201cThey allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Atcha and Waleedh aggressively promoted Evolved Apes, including hiring an unnamed social media influencer to shill the project.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThree United Kingdom nationals charged in connection with \u201cEvolved Apes\u201d NFT scam \ud83d\udd17: https://t.co/PWNHwklVmE pic.twitter.com/TArfjYdR8k \u2014 US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 6, 2024\n\nA pump-and-dump scheme is when investors are enticed to buy an asset based on misleading information.

When Waleedh was allowed to access the funds, the DOJ alleged, he transferred them to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Hassan.\n\n\u201cDigital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal. As we allege, thousands of people believed these false promises and were tricked into buying these NFTs, including here in the Southern District of New York,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNFT fraud is no game, and those responsible will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf convicted, the trio faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nRug pulls are rampant in the cryptocurrency space.

        "content": "London, England, June 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\n\n\nStakingFarm, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency staking industry, has released new insights from its CEO, Klajdi Toci, on the significant impact that staking has had on Ethereum (ETH) liquidity. According to Toci, staking has emerged as a major liquidity sink for ETH, a phenomenon that has drawn the attention of analysts and market observers alike.\n\nDespite the surge in Ethereum prices since Q4 of last year, the three-month circulating supply of ETH has not seen a meaningful increase. This stagnation in circulating supply, as noted by StakingFarm's analysts, underscores the profound effect that staking has on the availability of ETH in the market. As more investors lock their ETH in staking contracts to earn rewards, the overall liquidity of Ethereum decreases, influencing market dynamics and price movements.\n\n\"The surge in ETH staking has created a unique situation where a significant portion of the asset is effectively removed from circulation,\" said Klajdi Toci, CEO of StakingFarm. \"This reduction in liquid supply can have various implications for the market, including potential price volatility and changes in investor behavior.\"\n\nStakingFarm, known for its innovative staking solutions and user-centric platform, has observed these trends firsthand. The platform offers a range of staking opportunities, allowing users to lock their ETH and other cryptocurrencies in return for rewards. This practice not only supports the security and operation of blockchain networks but also provides a source of passive income for investors.\n\nHowever, the growing popularity of staking has led to a substantial amount of ETH being locked up, thereby reducing its availability in the open market. This trend highlights the dual-edged nature of staking: while it benefits individual investors through rewards, it also impacts overall market liquidity.\n\n\"Understanding the liquidity implications of staking is crucial for both investors and the broader market,\" Toci added. \"At StakingFarm, we are committed to providing our users with the information and tools they need to navigate these complex dynamics effectively.\"\n\nStakingFarm's analysis aligns with broader industry observations. Analysts have noted that the reduced liquidity resulting from increased staking activities can lead to heightened price volatility. As the circulating supply of ETH remains constrained, even minor market events can trigger significant price fluctuations, creating both opportunities and risks for traders and investors.\n\nIn response to these developments, StakingFarm continues to enhance its platform, offering advanced tools and insights to help users make informed decisions. The platform's commitment to transparency and user education ensures that investors are well-equipped to understand and manage the liquidity dynamics associated with staking.\n\nAs the Ethereum network and the broader cryptocurrency market continue to evolve, StakingFarm remains at the forefront of innovation, providing solutions that cater to the diverse needs of its users. By staying attuned to market trends and investor behaviors, StakingFarm aims to foster a more resilient and informed staking community.\n\nFor more information about StakingFarm and to explore Ethereum staking opportunities, please visit https://stakingfarm.com/.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\n\nName: Klajdi Toci\n\nPosition: CEO\n\nEmail: info (at) stakingfarm.com\n\nWebsite: www.stakingfarm.com\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Christine Kim, the Vice President on the Research team at Galaxy just took to the X platform to highlight the latest task that Ethereum (ETH) developers are undertaking regarding Pectra upgrade. The X post comes after the blockchain\u2019s All Core Developers Execution Call (ACDE) on June 6.\n\nEthereum Developers to Expand Pectra With 2 EIPs\n\nAccording to the Galaxy Researcher, Ethereum developers agreed to further expand the scope of the Pectra upgrade yesterday with the inclusion of EOF and EIP 7702 to the Pectra upgrade. The All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) Call #189 held over Zoom and was chaired by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Protocol Support Lead Tim Beiko.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe simultaneous integration of both solutions is likely to trigger delays in multi-client testing for the upgrade. Hence, the protocol developers plan to activate EOF on later-stage devnets. The developers are also considering conducting the activation on a different activation epoch from other EIPs, just like how developers plan on testing PeerDAS.\n\nThe feedback pooled from various EL client teams and the EF DevOps team suggest that they are in support of the integration of EOF on Pectra.\n\nEL EIPs CONFIRMED FOR PRAGUE:\n\n\u2013 EIP 2537\n\n\u2013 EIP 2935\n\n\u2013 EIP 7685\n\n\u2013 EOF\n\n\u2013 EIP 7702 pic.twitter.com/uGf6Fm6eFs \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) June 6, 2024\n\nThere was only one opposition view from Geth. Guillaume Ballet, one of Geth\u2019s developer said, outline notable fears bothering on Verkle functionality.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that the more we wait, the longer the Verkle translation will take. Is EOF really that urgent? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve read several the arguments for shipping it in Prague. The more I read those arguments, the more I realize, no, there\u2019s nothing that really justifies EOF,\u201d he said\n\nA significant percentage of the Ethereum protocol developers disagreed with this stance. One \u201cKamil Sliwak\u201d noted that EOF would be \u201ca huge improvement\u201d particularly for users interacting with the compiler for Ethereum\u2019s smart contract programming language Solidity.\n\nDevelopers Decide on the Integration of EOF\n\nIn the meantime, discussions are ongoing about the preferred approach for integrating EOF. Beiko\u2019s recommendation is that they aim to ship all Pectra EIPs including EOF in one client release. For the present purposes of testing, he encouraged developers to consider the use of devnet to stage the implementation of these code changes.\n\nFor these developers, the inclusion of EIP 7702 is as a replacement to EIP 3074, although there are still certain issues with the specifications for EIP 7702. Ethereum protocol developers are putting efforts and resources in separate breakout room to fix these challenges.\n\nThis potential additions could impact on the price of Ethereum. Noteworthy, the altcoin has been showing bullish signs since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted spot Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,790.62 with a 1.29% dip within the last 24 hours. Investors are hopeful that it would break through to $5,000 in keeping with projections from top analysts.\n\nRead More: Customers Bank Reportedly Debanks Crypto Hedge Funds Amid FDIC Alert\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "Crypto: Ethereum ready for Pectra in the first quarter of 2025 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 07 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThe crypto universe is buzzing. Ethereum is set to launch a major update to its technology in Q1 2025. Named Pectra, this update promises significant improvements for users and developers. Let\u2019s explore in detail what this evolution will bring and why it is so highly anticipated.\n\nPectra incorporates several technological innovations that will transform the crypto ecosystem. Among these innovations are the EVM Object Format (EOF) and EIP-7702, proposed by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEOF is designed to improve the security and efficiency of smart contracts on Ethereum. By integrating this format, Ethereum will enable safer and faster transactions, reducing the risks of bugs and exploits.\n\nEIP-7702 allows Ethereum account addresses to temporarily act as smart contract wallets during transactions. This feature will offer increased flexibility to users, allowing them to manage their crypto more efficiently and securely.\n\nThe Pectra update also aims to resolve persistent issues, such as high transaction fees on Layer 2 platforms. By integrating around 19 EIPs, Ethereum ensures that the user experience will be significantly improved.\n\nA Strategically Chosen Timeline\n\nEthereum developers have carefully planned the deployment of Pectra for Q1 2025. This decision was made after lengthy discussions and thorough evaluations.\n\nThe developers decided not to rush the deployment before Devcon, the largest developer conference in the Asia-Pacific region. By delaying the update, they ensure the full integration of all features, allowing crypto users to enjoy a stable and reliable version.\n\nBy avoiding deployment during Devcon, the developers can effectively monitor the execution of Pectra. This cautious approach aims to minimize risks and ensure a smooth launch.\n\nUpcoming Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWhile Pectra is a major step, it is only part of Ethereum\u2019s ambitious roadmap. Developers are already working on future improvements, such as the Osaka upgrade.\n\nPeerDAS will be integrated into Pectra to improve data availability on Ethereum. This improvement is crucial to strengthening the network\u2019s scalability and decentralization.\n\nThe Osaka upgrade, planned after Pectra, will include advanced features such as the implementation of Verkle Tree. This new data structure promises to further enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nThe Pectra update marks a new phase in Ethereum\u2019s evolution. By incorporating major technological innovations and improving user experience, Ethereum positions itself to remain at the forefront of the crypto revolution.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has finally broken through $70,000, setting itself up for further growth. As we can see, there is a good chance it will succeed at it, as the price is moving closer to $71,000 and trading volumes remain elevated.\n\nThis bullish momentum is easily visible on the daily chart of Bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar (BTC/USD). Bitcoin is currently trading around $70,977 with the price action showing a steady climb. A major turning point was reached recently when the market broke above $70,000, indicating fresh interest and optimism. This optimistic view is supported by several important technical indicators.\n\nThe 50-day and 200-day moving averages in particular are positioned in a way that indicates sustained upward momentum. A traditional bullish signal known as a golden cross formed when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average.\n\nVolume analysis supports this optimistic scenario even more. The recent price surge is accompanied by elevated trading volumes, indicating strong market participation and interest at these price points. Maintaining the present upward trend and possibly pushing Bitcoin above $71,000 require this volume support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore Bitcoin remains a favorable investment option given the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin's allure as a store of value and safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies is still great in light of persistent worries about economic stability.\n\nEthereum's weird position\n\nThe surge toward $3,800 was not expected by the market, yet we are here. However, Ethereum's activity raises a lot of questions as the asset's price is going through an extremely prolonged consolidation phase, and it is unclear whether or not it will come out as a winner from it.\n\nAfter the steep increase to $3,800, the price of Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range, as can be seen by looking at the daily chart of ETH against the USD. When buyers and sellers are evenly matched, the market is usually in a state of indecision, as indicated by this sideways movement.\n\nEthereum has tested $3,750 several times without breaking below what appears to be the key support level. A number of technical indicators shed light on Ethereum's present situation. A golden cross, or the potential continuation of a bullish trend, could be indicated if the 50-day moving average, which is approaching the 200-day moving average, crosses above it. However, the market continues to be cautious until such a crossover occurs.\n\nFurther more, the fact that trading volumes have been comparatively low during this phase of consolidation suggests that a sizable portion of market participants are holding off until a more distinct trend becomes apparent.\n\nSolana's market position\n\nSolana's path on the market was tough in the last few weeks, but things are changing rapidly, with Bitcoin bouncing toward $70,000 and investors gaining some of that positive sentiment back. However, fundamentally, Solana might not be doing as well as it used to.\n\nSolana shows a gradual but consistent recovery. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are supporting the modest uptrend that Solana is currently showing at about $172. 92.\n\nThough technical indicators point to a bright future, the larger ecosystem surrounding Solana paints a different picture. The Solana meme coin scene used to be a hive of activity and creativity, but it is not as active as recently.\n\nThere has not been much buying interest in Solana, as seen by the low trading volume. This is concerning because price movements need to be supported and maintained by sustained volume, which is probably the biggest issue for it right now."

        "content": "Baby Doge, a unique cryptocurrency that draws inspiration from the popular meme crypto Dogecoin, has made a significant announcement, capturing the attention of the broader crypto market. The proposal to renounce ownership of the token contract on both Ethereum & BNB Chain, which was initially suggested on May 29, has been successfully passed today, June 6.\n\nThis momentous event has sent shockwaves through the global crypto landscape, sparking a flurry of discussions in the community. Let\u2019s delve deeper into the development that aims to aid Baby Doge to branch out to Ethereum and BNB Chain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBaby Doge Multi-Chain Proposal Passes: What\u2019s The Scoop?\n\nZooming past to date, the voting has ended with the odds substantially tilted towards the proposal\u2019s passing. As per insights by \u2018snapshot.org,\u2019 the meme coin\u2019s voting results illustrate that the proposal gained 848 trillion votes, worth 99.53%, in favor, while 0.47%, worth 4 trillion votes, were against the development.\n\nThe voting started on May 29 and ended on June 05. According to Baby Doge\u2019s community\u2019s official announcement, this proposal\u2019s primary objectives include streamlining decentralization, security, and community trust, aligning with DeFi\u2019s true ethos.\n\nMeanwhile, the expected time for the renouncement process is approximately 1-2 weeks, \u2018including verification and community communication.\u2019 The completion of the process is expected to widen crypto\u2019s user appeal across the global crypto realm, potentially impacting price.\n\nAlso Read: 4 Must-Buy Gaming Crypto For Bullish June\n\nBabyDoge Price Jumps\n\nIn the interim, upon the news surfacing within the market, BabyDoge\u2019s price saw a 1.64% uptick in value in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.000000001968. The token appears to be witnessing an extended consolidation period, looking at broader time frame price charts. Its 24-hour lows and highs are $0.000000001913 and $0.000000001963, respectively.\n\nRenouncing ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on ETH and BNB Chain comes as a strategic mover to achieve complete decentralization and reinforce the crypto\u2019s commitment to transparency and security for users. This could potentially set the stage for significant price gains ahead as BabyDoge further revolutionizes its cryptographic journey.\n\nAlso Read: ECB Cuts Rate Signaling Crypto Rally Ahead, US Fed To Follow Suit?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum has a lot going for it as we approach the halfway point of 2024. It's comfortably the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and enjoys a lot of popularity in the community thanks to its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem. In addition, whether you\u2019re interested in swapping tokens, lending crypto, collecting NFTs or using stablecoins, chances are that the most exciting developments are happening on Ethereum first.\n\nIn addition to the general robustness of the Ethereum ecosystem, another thing that should make Ethereum investors happy is the fact that Ethereum will (very likely) soon be joining Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency that can be traded via a spot ETF in the United States. This will give it that much more legitimacy among investors and streamline access for institutional investors.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at Ethereum from multiple angles to help you determine if Ethereum is a good investment in 2024 or not. First, we\u2019ll begin by listing various reasons why Ethereum might be a good investment in 2024. Of course, we\u2019ll consider some of the downsides of investing in ETH as well.\n\nKey highlights: Ethereum's robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities make it the second-largest cryptocurrency with broad community support.\n\nThe upcoming potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF in the US could enhance its legitimacy and attract institutional investors.\n\nDeflationary pressures from reduced ETH issuance post-Merge and the EIP-1559 mechanism enhance its attractiveness as a long-term investment.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are mitigating Ethereum's scalability issues, maintaining its dominance in the smart contracts and DeFi space.\n\nHere\u2019s why Ethereum is considered a good investment\n\nIn September 2022, pretty much every ETH investor and user held their breath as the network underwent its most significant upgrade ever \u2013 the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm \u2013 dubbed \u201cThe Merge.\u201d While the price of ETH plummeted ahead of the upgrade, with investors fearing that it could have an adverse impact on the network, the price quickly recovered after it became obvious that the transition was a total success.\n\nNow, with the uncertainty of the Merge ever more distant in the rearview, there are several reasons that make Ethereum a good investment in 2024, including:\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is increasing\n\nDeflationary pressures are making ETH more valuable\n\nLayer 2 solutions are successfully mitigating Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues\n\nEthereum is retaining its smart contract dominance\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Ethereum is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Ethereum, so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nA substantial amount of ETH is staked even before withdrawals are enabled\n\nAt the time of writing, 27.6 million ETH, or about 23% of the ETH supply, is locked in the staking deposit contract. This is impressive, given that staked ETH is worth over $100 billion and that users can withdraw it whenever they wish (barring a short queue list). It's worth noting that the ability to withdraw ETH has rolled out with the Shanghai update in early 2023.\n\nThe fact that tens of billion of dollars worth of ETH had been staked even before there was a mechanism to withdraw the coins indicates that Ethereum investors had a lot of confidence in the project\u2019s ability to execute its roadmap. Now, a year later, the total value of staked ETH jumped to over $100 billion, which is an even greater vote of confidence from the market.\n\nThe number of staked ETH. Image source: Nansen\n\nThe fact that you can stake ETH is also one reason that can make Ethereum a good investment. If you\u2019re looking to hold your ETH over the long term, you can currently enjoy an APY of about 3.3% on your staked coins. While these are not earth-shattering gains, it\u2019s better than earning no yield at all if you weren\u2019t planning to sell your ETH anyway.\n\nDeflationary pressure on ETH supply\n\nWhen the Merge was close to happening, much of the discussion in the cryptocurrency community (rightly) revolved around Ethereum moving over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. However, there was one aspect of the Merge that perhaps got less attention than it deserves. Prior to the Merge, the Ethereum protocol issued about 13,000 ETH every day in order to reward miners. With the new Proof-of-Stake system, the protocol only needs to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to provide sufficient incentives to Proof-of-Stake validators to secure the network.\n\nThis change, combined with the EIP-1559 mechanism introduced in 2021, has actually turned ETH into a slightly deflationary cryptocurrency. According to ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by a total of more than 400,000 ETH following the Merge.\n\nThis deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH has made it a more attractive hold over the long term, as ETH holders effectively no longer need to consider inflation as a factor that could negatively affect the value of their coins.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not a certainty that ETH will remain deflationary, as this will depend on how much demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. More demand for transactions equals more burned ETH, as the base transaction fees for each transaction are being burned thanks to EIP-1559. While the deflationary aspect is a nice bonus, Ethereum is one of the best long term cryptos to buy, regardless of whether its tokenomics are slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary.\n\nEthereum layer 2s are making good progress\n\nIt\u2019s not secret that the current iteration of Ethereum has major problems with scalability. In 2021, when the crypto market was in the middle of a raging bull run, transaction fees on the Ethereum network skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. At points, users were paying north of $50 just to make a single transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is obviously not a sustainable situation if Ethereum is to become a widely adopted network. Thankfully, there are several solutions in sight. The Ethereum protocol itself will receive upgrades in the future, most notably sharding, which will allow it to process more transactions while keeping costs lower.\n\nIn addition to improvements on the protocol base layer, there are also a number of layer 2 scalability solutions that leverage the security of the Ethereum mainnet while processing transactions off-chain to keep costs low.\n\nThere\u2019s already a number of layer 2 platforms for Ethereum available. The most notable examples are Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are both based on optimistic rollup technology and offer much better transaction efficiency for the end user than the base layer.\n\nEthereum continues to dominate the smart contracts space\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of Ethereum competitors available on the market. Many alternative layer 1 chains have adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while others like Solana, Cardano and Aptos have taken completely different approaches.\n\nIn any case, no other blockchain has come even close to challenging Ethereum as the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are the main reasons why it tops the list of best altcoins to buy. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum has a 60% market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to the TVL (total value locked) metric. The next closest competitor, TRON, has a market share of about 7.2%.\n\nDeFi TVL market share among all blockchains. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe demand for using the Ethereum network is also evident based on the total fees paid to use it. As of early June 2024, users are paying a total of $9.6 million in fees daily for Ethereum transactions, according to data from cryptofees.info. Bitcoin is in second place with a daily average of $4.1 million in total daily fees.\n\nETH is still down from its all-time high\n\nEven though ETH kicked off 2024 with a rally, the Ethereum price is still down about 22% from its all-time high. This could make ETH a good investment at the moment, as it has already displayed the ability to reach higher prices in the past. In addition, several other major cryptos, including Bitcoin, BNB, and Toncoin, have managed to clinch new all-time high valuations this year, so Ethereum could be next.\n\nAs a side note, even if Ethereum were to surpass its previous ATH, there is virtually no chance that it could explode by 100x or post similarly impressive gains \u2013 its current market cap is just too large and the growth required to post triple or four digit gains is just not feasible.\n\nDespite being constrained from benefiting from 100x price increases, the 5-year Ethereum average return rate would still net investors an incredibly handsome sum in the span of 10 years, mostly due to the magic of compounding interest. Here\u2019s how a $5,000 investment in Ethereum with a monthly contribution of $100 would fare over the next 10 years, if we take the compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of ETH in the past 3 years as a basis.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Ethereum (with a $100 monthly contribution) in 2024 will grow to nearly $33,000 by 2034 if we assume Ethereum\u2019s CAGR over the past 3 years. Source: Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhat are the cons of Ethereum as an investment?\n\nHopefully, we have demonstrated that Ethereum has a lot going for it as an investment in 2024. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that buying ETH is a sure bet.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions promise to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes, they are still in their relatively early stages, with many taking compromises in terms of decentralization. Meanwhile, the Ethereum mainnet is still very expensive to use.\n\nAt the time of writing, a simple token swap will cost about $3.9 in fees, which makes it very difficult to portray Ethereum as a platform that targets a broad audience and enables financial inclusion. In addition, the fees get substantially higher whenever there is a surge in demand.\n\nIn addition, the macroeconomic situation might also not bode well for cryptocurrencies. After all, some economists are predicting a recession to happen in 2024. If these predictions materialize, the cryptocurrency market will be in uncharted territory, as it has never existed amid a global recession\u2014let\u2019s remember that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only became a significant asset a few years later.\n\nDepending on the severity of this expected recession, there could be a sell-off in the crypto markets due to investors getting rid of their risky assets, and ETH would undoubtedly also be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Ethereum is among the most established crypto projects, ETH is still a highly volatile asset when compared to traditional investments. Before buying any cryptocurrency, make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024: A new ATH brewing on the horizon?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Ethereum price to increase by +260% and reach a new ATH in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum will see a nice uptick in the second half of 2024. The world\u2019s largest altcoin is expected to start mounting a rally late in July, culminating in a new all-time high of roughly $5,450 in December.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction is based on the snapshot of technical indicators in early June 2024, with 28 indicators signaling bullish and 2 bearish signals. Keep in mind that the prediction could change considerably going forward if the underlying indicators change.\n\nThe bottom line: The future of Ethereum looks bright, but the macro environment could spoil the party\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d the current situation might be a good time to do so. As we can see, there are a lot of positive indications for the future of Ethereum that could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n\nA large number of ETHs are being staked even before the launch of withdrawals. EIP-1559 and the Merge have combined to drastically reduce the issuance of ETH, and Ethereum is continuing to dominate the smart contracts sector. In addition, ETH is trading below considerably its all-time highs while Bitcoin, BNB, and some other top coins are trading at the top, which means the current prices could represent an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nIn addition, the expected approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in the US in the near term could provide another boost that could push Ethereum above its previous highs.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto."
