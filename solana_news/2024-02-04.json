        "title": "GoDaddy and Ethereum Name Service Simplify Connecting Domain Names and Crypto Wallets for Customers - PR Newswire",
        "content": "Users can now connect their GoDaddy domain with their ENS name for free, seamlessly connecting DNS to ENS and the Web3 ecosystem\n\nTEMPE, Ariz., Feb. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY), a global leader in domain registration and web hosting is excited to partner with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a pioneer in blockchain-based naming systems, to enable domain name users to link their domains to ENS effortlessly, with no additional costs or technical experience required. This collaboration signifies a major step toward bridging the gap between the Domain Name System (DNS) and blockchain technology.\n\nDNS is a naming database that interprets readable addresses (domain names) into a unique string of numbers called an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Similarly, ENS simplifies complex wallet addresses into human-readable names. By connecting the two, it empowers domain owners with the combined security and reliability of GoDaddy, a globally recognized brand, along with the cutting-edge benefits of ENS's blockchain infrastructure.\n\n\"As a long-time domain industry steward, we are always looking for innovative enhancements that benefit our customers,\" stated Paul Nicks, president of domains at GoDaddy. \"Partnering with ENS presents our customers with a unique opportunity to experience the fusion of domains names and blockchain technologies, bringing some great benefits for users in both areas.\"\n\nWhile it has always been feasible to bring domain names over to ENS, barriers like high gas fees have limited the seamless transition. To help, ENS deployed new smart contracts to enable the resolution process of domain names in ENS, at the DNS top-level domain (TLD) level. This allows verification of DNS records, enabling a cost-free method for users.\n\nThis integration not only simplifies user experience but also fosters a sense of trust in digital identities. Domain owners and crypto wallet holders can now enjoy a newfound convenience, effortlessly linking their digital assets for efficient management.\n\n\"With this milestone, we are furthering our mission to build a more secure, decentralized and user-friendly internet,\" said Nick Johnson, founder of ENS. \"ENS, much like DNS, is a public good and a core part of the internet infrastructure. By pairing up ENS names and GoDaddy domains, we will streamline the way users interact with web domains, blending the familiarity of the DNS with the potential of blockchain technology.\"\n\nThis important advancement simplifies the use of digital properties, creating an environment of convenience and trust.

ENS addresses allow anyone to register a .eth domain which they can then connect to multiple wallets, and use across all of Web3. Founded with an Ethereum grant in 2017 by Nick Johnson, ENS quickly grew as the most widely used permissionless domain name protocol in the world. With over 2 million names registered onchain and over 4 million names offchain, the protocol aims to become the neutral naming protocol for all.\n\nSource: GoDaddy Inc.\n\nSOURCE GoDaddy Inc."

Similarly, ENS services convert intricate wallet addresses into easily readable names.\n\nThis latest integration with GoDaddy, one of the world\u2019s largest web hosting providers, will allow users to connect their simplified ENS wallet addresses with their DNS.\n\nBridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 comes with its own set of problems, however, like concerns around censorship.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs consider \u2018existential\u2019 upgrade to the EVM\n\nMost recently, Kubi Mensah, the co-founder of Gattaca, noted in a post on X that its domain was suspended indefinitely without any prior notice.\n\nAlthough the issue was resolved after escalating concerns to the senior management of the domain provider, the reason for the suspension was never made apparent.\n\n\u201cWe see this incident as a reminder that the fight against censorship is hard but worth every bit of our effort,\u201d Mensah wrote.\n\nGenerally speaking, due to the decentralized nature of Web3 domains, entities themselves can not suspend, take or control an ENS .eth domain, Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of ENS, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cENS .eth domains are censorship-resistant and tamper-proof by design; even the ENS DAO has no power to revoke or restrict a .eth domain,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHowever, this latest collaboration is a gateway for Web2 domain users to access blockchain technologies via their domains, and ownership of a DNS domain ultimately remains with the registrar.\n\n\u201cNames that are imported from DNS \u2014 using our new integration with GoDaddy or our legacy integration \u2014 remain subject to the registrar they are held with, and the rules imposed by the registrar and ICANN,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) rose by 3.74% on Friday to signal an increase in buying momentum. This built on the positive bounce from the $22.8 support level, as buyers look to reclaim the $30 price mark.\n\nWith the general crypto market still undecided on a trend direction, traders have adopted short term trading strategies. As such, ETC presents a good opening to embark on a bullish run with decent profit targets.\n\nBollinger Bands Support Bullish Thesis\n\nThe short term outlook for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price chart looked positive when examined with the Bollinger Bands (BB). The lower band at the $23.7 price range acted as a dynamic support over the past 48 hours, allowing ETC to break above the mid-way point of the band.\n\nThis opened up the Bollinger Bands with price expected to trend upwards. Furthermore, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) highlighted the growing bullish momentum, as buyers flipped the RSI positive with a strong push above the neutral 50 level.\n\nETC/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nWith price currently trading at $25, short to medium term traders can enter a long position with a first target level of $27.6 and a second target level of $31.2.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price continues to suffer in the hands of unmotivated traders.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: Crypto markets to turn volatile as AI steals the spotlight\n\nBitcoin price likely to fall 5%\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading within a range, consolidating between the centerline and the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $41,895 and $44,210, respectively. With the two Bollinger bands contracting, BTC could record an impulsive or rash move soon.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is closely bearish, teasing with a cross below the signal line (yellow band). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also appears subdued with miniature volumes on the histogram bars. This is also reflected in the Awesome Oscillator (AO), tilting the odds in favor of the bears.\n\nIf the bears have their way, Bitcoin price could descend 5% to find support due to the confluence between the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the horizontal line at $40,650. If this level fails to hold as support, BTC could extend the fall into the demand zone between $38,496 and $39,582. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $39,196 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, potentially going as low as the $37,800 support.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if bulls have their way, Bitcoin price could shatter past the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $44,210. This could see BTC climb to $48,000, or in a highly bullish case, tag $50,000, nearly 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price gains strength as GBTC outflows shrink\n\nEthereum price could drop to $2,200\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action is almost similar to that of BTC. It could fall 4% to $2,200 as overhead pressure due to the 50-day SMA continues to build. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token\u2019s price has made multiple attempts to breach this supplier congestion level to no avail.\n\nWith the RSI below 50, the AO and MACD in negative territory, and below the latter\u2019s signal line (orange band), the odds favor the downside. Ethereum price could slip past $2,200 to test the 100-day SMA at $2,203. In a dire case, the fall could see ETH dip into the demand zone between $2,059 and $2,118.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure could see Ethereum price overcome the 50-day SMA to confront the $2,388 barrier. Flipping this into support could restore Ether into the ascending parallel channel, a gateway to more gains.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum monthly transaction count climbs to highest level since July 2022\n\nRipple price looks for pullback as XRP holders show weakness\n\nRipple (XRP) looks ready to fall as it is stuck below the foothold of the midline of the descending parallel channel. Increased selling pressure could see XRP price retest the October lows around $0.4734, with technical indicators showing an unmotivated holder community. This is seen by the waning momentum on the RSI below 50 and the position of the AO and MACD in negative territory.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, enhanced buyer momentum could see XRP price breach the resistance due to the midline of the channel, bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price trades broadly unchanged leading up to crucial milestone in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts: Everything You Need to Know - Global Crypto",
        "content": "Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nEthereum, or ETH, as it is more commonly called, is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies out there. At $459.16 billion, it is the second biggest crypto by market cap, next only to Bitcoin. It holds 18.4% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. One Ether token is currently valued at $3,520.23. However, there are many more facts to know about Ethereum and its features. In this article, you can also get free Ethereum.\n\n6 Biggest Ethereum Facts\n\n1. It Was a Crowdfunded Project\n\nThe concept of Ethereum as a cryptocurrency came to life in 2013, just four years after the birth of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Ethereum was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who was a co-founder of the Bitcoin online news website at the time. However, funding was one big challenge to the Ethereum project at that time.\n\nIt came at a time when crypto and crypto trading were still relatively unknown, and only Bitcoin was in the game. In 2013, the almighty Bitcoin started at just $13, so it would have been tough for a newcomer to convince big investors to fund the project.\n\nThat same year, many companies, particularly start-ups, were turning to crowdfunding as an alternative funding source, and the Ethereum team did the same. Ethereum turned to the masses to fund the project. By the end of the crowdfunding period, which was on June 1, 2018, they had been able to raise $4,100,000,000, which is worth 7.12 million ETH. It became the biggest crowdfunded project ever. No one saw it coming, but they were able to pull it off. In the end, it was a win-win for everyone. Happy investors, happy Ethereum team!\n\n2. Ethereum Has No Limited Availability\n\nTo preserve the currency\u2019s rarity and value, many cryptos usually have a fixed number of coins that will ever be in circulation. Bitcoin, for example, has a maximum supply of 21 million, meaning that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist; no more can be created or mined. Binance Coin (BNB) has a limited supply of 166,801,148, and Solana (SOL) is limited to 488,630,611.\n\nWell, this does not apply to Ethereum. In other words, Ethereum does not have a limited supply. As of August 2022, over 121.97 million ETH were already in circulation, which means it had already passed Bitcoin\u2019s supply limit by 100 million coins. This is good news for anyone seeking to invest in ETH.\n\nOf course, the founders still put some limits on the supply of Ethereum; it\u2019s not exactly unlimited in the full sense. Like Dogecoin, which has a cap of 5 billion DOGE per year, Ethereum has a cap of 18 million ETH per year, which means only 18 million new ETH can be created in a year.\n\nMoreover, the amount of ETH in circulation is also expected to decrease over the years because of the EIP-1559 burn mechanism, which was designed to address congestion.\n\n3. Ethereum Has an Ice Age Feature\n\nEthereum has an Ice Age feature, but it\u2019s not what you think. This feature is not related in any way to the animated movie \u201cIce Age.\u201d It is a little bit more \u201ctechy.\u201d Ethereum\u2019s Ice Age feature is also known as \u201cthe difficulty bomb.\u201d It is a mining adjustment mechanism added to the Ethereum network to help them reach their goals of switching from Proof of Work Ethereum 1.0 to Proof of Stake Ethereum 2.0 by increasing the difficulty of mining new ETH over time. This Ice Age feature was originally added to the Ethereum 1.x blockchain in 2015.\n\nThe rationale for the inclusion of the Ice Age feature is that when Ethereum was first created, its founders initially wanted it to run on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. They tried to avoid Proof of Work altogether, but the technology was not quite there yet, and they had to settle for Proof of Work until they could sustainably move to Proof of Stake. However, Ethereum does not want to settle with Proof of Work forever, so they added the Ice Age feature to make things difficult for miners.\n\n4. Ethereum Is More Than a Crypto\n\nYes, Ethereum is the second biggest crypto, but the Ethereum network is much more. The network can host Decentralized Applications, or dApps, as they are popularly known. dApps are just like any other applications we use on our computers except for one thing\u2014they run on the Ethereum network. dApps are just software applications that run on a distributed network. They are not hosted on a centralized server but on a peer-to-peer decentralized network.\n\nThe rationale for dApps is that the current way of dealing with app information is a situation where the owners of the apps have access to information about your social life, health, finances, and everything you do on the internet in exchange for providing you with their services or letting you use their apps. These owners can even completely block you from accessing your information and end their services with you. But with dApps, nobody gets to control your information or monopolize it. dApps decentralize control of information to provide internet freedom and do it with Ethereum.\n\n5. Ethereum Is Inspired by Anime\n\nWhile Ethereum has evolved to become a very complex technological invention, it originated in anime. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, was inspired by Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s anime \u201cLaputa: Castle In The Sky,\u201d where one of the anime\u2019s heroes used a magic crystal called \u201cAethereum\u201d to extract energy from the air.\n\nThat\u2019s where the inspiration for the second biggest crypto was born.\n\n6. Ethereum Has Gone to Space\n\nBelieve it or not, Ethereum went into space in 2021. That year, SpaceChain launched the first Ethereum node in space through a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from NASA\u2018s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nSpaceChain launched its first Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite into space in 2018, claiming that the satellite switch is cheaper than geostationary monitoring.\n\nThey use these satellites as blockchain nodes to store, process, transmit data, and develop applications.\n\nExtending the Ethereum network to space is a way to increase blockchain technology\u2019s decentralization and improve its security and resilience.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has become one of the most prominent players in the crypto space, not by being average. What we have discussed in this article are only a few of its unique features; there are still more technological advancements that have made Ethereum stand out. But Ethereum is not stopping anytime soon. With Ethereum 2.0 and the help of the Ethereum community, we expect to see more."

        "content": "Gitcoin, an open-source software funding platform, has announced it will shift focus away from public goods funding and towards enhancing grants infrastructure designed for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSince its launch in May 2021, Gitcoin\u2019s organizational hierarchy has been relatively flat, with no CEO calling the shots. Workstreams, or focused groups dedicated to specific tasks or projects within the organization, have always required budgets to be approved through community voting \u2014 an often time consuming process.\n\nAs the DAO has evolved, however, it morphed from an impact-focused organization to something more technology-centric. Gitcoin executive director Kyle Weiss told Blockworks in an interview that this did not align well with the existing DAO structure.\n\n\u201cIt was too disjointed,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cIn a DAO environment where everyone is fully remote, we have folks contributing from nearly every continent \u2014 stability, operations, and software development is really important, you need a core group of individuals who have context.\u201d\n\nRead more: Gitcoin\u2019s co-founder wants to return from the sidelines\n\nAs part of the new restructuring plan, two business units have formed within Gitcoin. One unit will focus on coordinating product-specific work, while a subDAO will manage matters of community and governance.\n\nWeiss noted that over the years, the company has experimented with various products. He said that some of these have been distractions, while others have been valuable to its growth.\n\n\u201cA lot of 2024 is focusing on grants. We want Gitcoin to be much more associated with grants, whereas right now, our narrative has been around public goods funding, and that shift is because we\u2019ve moved from being an impact organization to a technology organization,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nFor this reason, Weiss explained the DAO will transition from independent workstreams towards a structure more akin to a \u201cLabs\u201d structure. This is something that is common among existing protocol development teams, similar to how Uniswap has Uniswap Labs or how Optimism operates with OP Labs.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure there is stability in the software development side and then give the DAO material scopes of work to own,\u201d he said.\n\nWeiss says that by granting software development teams greater leadership and more defined decision-making powers, the community can remain concentrated on achieving results through the grants programs via token voting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the token holders are the right people to decide on multi-year roadmap decisions on the technology side,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nGitcoin co-founder Kevin Owocki shared this sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not proven that DAOs can develop software, so the Labs team is designed to recognize that in our organizational structure, and make sure that we\u2019re building world-class software.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

On top of the public and decentralized Farcaster ecosystem, users can create (and have created) a slew of integrated apps that perform various social media functions.\n\nThe most popular app built on the Farcaster network is Warpcast, a Twitter-like platform for writing posts (called \u201ccasts\u201d), following other users, and liking or sharing (\u201crecasting\u201d) those users\u2019 posts. Though a slew of apps currently live on Farcaster, Warpcast accounts for almost half of all sign ups across the entire protocol, according to on-chain data from Dune.\n\nMost of Farcaster\u2019s most popular accounts are major players in the crypto space: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko, and Base creator Jesse Pollak.\n\nFarcaster shares its main selling points with other decentralized social media protocols: a lack of censorship, control over one\u2019s data, and seamless interoperability of accounts across all apps built on the network. That\u2019s opposed to, for example, the lack of interconnectivity between accounts on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nOne element that particularly distinguishes Farcaster from other social media protocols is the network\u2019s emphasis on eliminating bot activity. To sign up, users must pay a $5 sign-up fee, meant to prevent the creation of spam accounts. Further, users can only post a limited number of \u201ccasts\u201d on Farcaster apps, which are tied to packages called storage units.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStorage units, which go for $5 a piece, grant a user 5,000 casts, 2,500 reactions, and 2,500 links or photo posts within a one-year period. Users who wish to buy additional storage units to post more can do so via a fairly technical and complicated process. This storage unit structure was designed to prevent Farcaster apps from being inundated with the millions of bot comments and likes that plague traditional social media platforms like Twitter.\n\nBut far and away, the most popular innovation on Farcaster is called Frames\u2014and it upended the protocol\u2019s trajectory overnight.\n\nWhat are Frames?\n\nLaunched on January 26, Frames are a new Farcaster feature that allows users to perform a suite of functions, both on-chain and off-chain, within Farcaster apps\u2014without exiting to a third party.\n\nOn Warpcast, for example, users scrolling through a feed of casts can now click on a Frame posted by someone they follow, and perform a variety of functions\u2014including minting NFTs, browsing an art gallery, playing games, subscribing to newsletters, and making online purchases\u2014all while staying in their feed.\n\nSome popular Frames include \u201cGirl Scout Cookies,\u201d which enables one-click purchases of the popular dessert, \u201cNethria,\u201d a text-based monster combat game, and \u201cNFT Mint,\u201d a gasless NFT drop.\n\njust came across one of the coolest new features in social media that I've seen in a decade not being dramatic, it's actually genius@farcaster_xyz Frames TL;DR - you can embed an \"iframe\" (not fully) into your tweets (casts) and people can interact with them without leaving\u2026 pic.twitter.com/30e9lgGkfa \u2014 mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) January 28, 2024\n\nFrames is powered by Farcaster\u2019s EdDSA authorization system, which already underlaid the Farcaster ecosystem. According to Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero, that structure eliminates the possibility of wallet drains, spoofing, and other malicious crypto hacks.\n\nAn easy to miss part of frames is it's powered by Farcaster's EdDSA auth system. 1. UX \u2014 every Farcaster user already has an EdDSA in the app they are using whether Warpcast or Supercast or something else. Every Farcaster client supports frames under the hood. And for\u2026 \u2014 Dan Romero (@dwr) January 29, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, on-chain functionality for Frames is limited to Ethereum-affiliated networks. As soon as next week, however, Farcaster\u2019s founders have indicated the protocol will expand to support Solana.\n\nFarcaster is easily my favourite app in crypto right now and it's now coming to Solana \ud83d\ude31 colossal hint: with Farcaster Frames (embeddable actions into posts) \u2014 Solana is the **only** way to go from frames -> onchain without a backend OPOS pic.twitter.com/qrxte8okiy \u2014 mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) February 2, 2024\n\nWithin days of introducing Frames, Farcaster exploded in popularity. The ecosystem, which typically supported around 2,000 daily users in recent months, quickly shot up over 1,300% in activity, to an average of over 28,000 daily users by Monday, according to data from Dune.\n\nThe volume of casts and likes on the platform has increased exponentially over the same period, from an average of 100,000 daily engagements just weeks ago, to over 2.3 million on Monday.\n\nAll in all, just north of 125,000 users have signed up for Farcaster so far\u2014a statistic that pales in comparison to mainstream social media platforms, but nonetheless marks a substantial milestone for an on-chain network that has yet to cater to non-tech savvy users.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "During the weekend, it seems that some crypto wallets that collected a large supply of the Ethereum version of dogwifhat (WIF) pocketed over $1.3 million. The incident suggests that these are apparent \u201cinsiders\u201d of the project.\n\nEthereum Dogwifhat: 12 probable insider crypto-wallets of the project pocket over $1.3 million\n\nOn Saturday, it seems that the Ethereum version of dogwifhat (WIF) was pumped and then dumped within a few hours, showing some suspicious data.\n\nAnd indeed, it seems that there are 12 crypto-wallets that, thanks to their wide supply of the memecoin version Ethereum, have managed to pocket a whopping 1.3 million dollars.\n\nThe suspicions suggest that these crypto wallets are apparent \u201cinsiders\u201d of the project. This is confirmed by the on-chain analysis tool Lookonchain, which shows that these crypto wallets have purchased 24 million Ethereum WIF tokens for 3,000 dollars in ETH.\n\nThe purchase took place in the same block in which the deployer opened the negotiations, which implies that the trader knew exactly when the tokens would be issued and traded.\n\nAnyway, on Saturday, the Ethereum WIF went from prices of fractions of a cent to 30 cents in just a few hours, and then crashed by over 80%.\n\nEthereum Dogwifhat: word from the creator\n\nAlways on Saturday, on X, the issa account came forward, claiming to be the creator of the crypto dogwifhat.\n\nAs many of you know, I originally created the meme you all know as \"dogwifhat\". It recently gained a ton of traction within the crypto space, most notably through a coin named $WIF that launched on Solana, currently trading at $270M~ market cap.\n\n\n\nWith so many of you reaching out\u2026 \u2014 issa (@issa) February 3, 2024\n\n\u201cAs many of you know, I originally created the meme that you all know as \u2018dogwifhat\u2019. Recently, it has gained a lot of popularity in the cryptocurrency space, especially thanks to a coin called $WIF, launched on Solana and currently traded with a market cap of 270 million dollars. Since many of you have contacted me and the $WIF team has never recognized me as the original creator, I wanted to clarify that I have no affiliation with them and I have never owned or received any allocation. Today I officially announce that I will launch the REAL $dogwifhat, but on Ethereum. The website explaining the origin story of dogwifhat is directly linked below this text. If you are not familiar with the cryptocurrency space, please proceed with caution, this is not financial advice. All other tweets following this can be found on the official website @dogwifhat_eth\u201d\n\nIn practice, the Ethereum version of dogwifhat is not connected to Solana-based WIF, which was launched at the end of November.\n\nSeventh crypto in the \u201cMeme\u201d category\n\nMeanwhile, looking at the meme crypto ranking by market capitalization, the dogwifhat (WIF) based on Solana blockchain is in seventh place.\n\nWIF has a total market cap of over 217 million dollars, not far from the other meme cryptos like FLOKI (265 million dollars) and MEME (227 million dollars).\n\nOn the memecoin scene, the dominant one is Dogecoin (DOGE) with over 11 billion dollars of market cap, followed by SHIB with 5.2 billion dollars and BONK with 655 million dollars.\n\nIn the last month, WIF Solana-based has seen a price pump of 97%, with the price going from $0.09 to the current $0.21. However, during the month, its highest recorded price was $0.45."

        "title": "Mollars ICO & What You Need to Know About Ethereum Blockchain\u2019s New Bitcoin - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The official Initial Coin Offering [ICO] for the Ethereum blockchain token \u201cMollars\u201d launched on Monday, November 21st. The token price starts at $0.30 in the first phase.\n\nMollars is a hybrid cryptocurrency that will be an alternative to Bitcoin as it\u2019s a store of value tokens. There will be a difference, however, as it\u2019s starting a decade after BTC was first introduced to the world.\n\nWhat are Store of Value Tokens and Coins?\n\nLike Bitcoin, Mollars aims to be a store of value that\u2019s in high demand, and the founder will not hold tokens privately. Possibly as high as 99.5% of today\u2019s cryptocurrency founders have a personal stash of tokens that was likely introduced to investors through the \u2018fine print\u2019 in the crypto brand\u2019s whitepaper.\n\nIn Mollars whitepapers, it\u2019s clearly stated that no party involved in the development of this token will be given tokens. A complete 100% of the tokens generated by the founder and developer team will be put onto the crypto market and exchanges.\n\nAnother attribute that makes Mollars a store of value, like Bitcoin, is that it will be fully decentralized.\n\nThe founder will not own the brand. The creator of the token created infrastructure and formulas to give the token longevity, but the enigmatic figure will have no control over the token once it has been released on top crypto exchanges.\n\nMollars ICO and Potential Exchange Listings\n\nThe first exchange that Mollars will be listed on is Uniswap, the world\u2019s #1 decentralized crypto exchange. If the ICO reaches its goal of US$ 2 million dollars, it will have a listing day price of US$0.62.\n\nThe 62-cent listing would mean today\u2019s first-round ICO investors would get ROI Yields of over +200%.\n\nThe price of the listing day could be weaker if the US$2,000,000 milestone is not met with the Initial Coin Offering fundraising.\n\nWith 15,661 tokens sold since its debut on November 21st, the Mollars ICO listing is averaging a daily buy rate of just over 2,610 tokens. At this rate, it would take the Initial Coin offering a substantial amount of time to complete. However, the \u2018buzz\u2019 is building, and that daily buy rate is expected to increase.\n\nAnother reason users might begin buying more is the crypto token\u2019s founder\u2019s recent release of the white paper and mission statement. One of those statements includes a \u2018catalyst\u2019 to expand the Mollars brand via product.\n\nBitcoin Had a 10-Year Head Start\u2026 So Here\u2019s The Catalyst\n\nThe new ERC-20 token will be a necessity for those who wish to use Mollars developers\u2019 coming mystery web3 product. This decentralized app [dApp] will launch in early 2024 at the same time as the hybrid tokens launch on its first major crypto exchange.\n\nWhat exactly is the dApp Mollars will launch? It\u2019s not yet clarified but the web3 \u2018goody\u2019 is being believed to target P2E gamers and metaverse enthusiasts of the Ethereum blockchain world.\n\nMollars ICO in 2024\n\nThese claims by the new ERC-20 token\u2019s developers have left some analysts to believe today\u2019s first round ICO investors could generate more than just the typical listing day gains.\n\nAs the Mollars token is being offered at US$ 0.30 cents today, it will list on a major crypto exchange in second quarter of 2024.\n\nMany new tokens see gains when listed on new cryptocurrency exchanges, but having an actual product could lift the token.\n\nICO & Tokenomics\n\nSpecifics for the ICO launch and post-listing plans have been made clear based on the fundraising goal being met successfully. A total of 4,500,000 tokens will be sold. Mollars initial coin offering will have 4 funding rounds. The price of the token pre-exchange will increase with each round incrementally.\n\nFirst-round investors will have the best opportunity to buy Mollars tokens at the previously mentioned rate of US$0.30. After a modest 200,000 tokens have been sold, the second round will begin.\n\nThe ICO price for second-round token investors will be US$0.40, which is a substantial increase. A maximum of 300,000 tokens will be sold in this second stage before the price is bumped upward again in the third round.\n\nAs popularity grows, the supply available in the ICO\u2019s third round will more than double to 700,000 $MOLLARS tokens. By this third round, Mollars will have the first details and possibly a preview of their web3 product.\n\nIn the fourth round of the ICO, investors will have to pay half a dollar to buy tokens early.\n\nIn the 2 rounds following the fourth, the token presale will increase by US$0.05 each round. Specifically, 5th-round investors will have to pay US$0.55 per token, and 6th-rounders will have to buy tokens at a rate of US$0.60 each.\n\nThe total token supply that will be sold in the Mollars presale totals 4,000,000 crypto coins.\n\nAfter the ICO presale is completed, the $MOLLARS coin will appear on a top crypto exchange quickly \u2014 according to public plans.\n\nLearn more about the ICO and this new hybrid token at their official website \u2014 www.Mollars.com.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest and best-known cryptocurrency after bitcoin (BTC). This moneyland.ch guide explains how you can invest in Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin clearly dominates the cryptocurrency space by a wide lead. But when ranked with all other cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin, Ethereum holds first place. The cryptocurrency, which was first introduced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, currently has a market capitalization of 237 billion Swiss francs (as per February 1, 2024).\n\nStrictly-defined, the term Ethereum denotes the entire blockchain-based infrastructure. The cryptocurrency that enables transactions within the Ethereum platform is called Ether. However, the term Ethereum is widely used to describe the cryptocurrency as well.\n\nUnlike bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain does not limit the number of Ether that can be generated. Ether is used to settle payment transactions on the platform. Ethereum is best known as a platform for smart contracts \u2013 transactions that are performed automatically when predefined conditions are met, without the need for an intermediary.\n\nTable 1: The biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in Swiss francs\n\nCryptocurrency Market capitalization Bitcoin CHF 720 billion Ethereum CHF 237 billion Tether CHF 83 billion BNB CHF 39 billion Solana CHF 36 billion\n\nDate: 01.02.2024.\n\nHow can I invest in Ethereum?\n\nIf you are interested in investing in Ethereum, there are a number of different ways to do it:\n\nBuy Ethereum at ATMs or stores: A number of Swiss cryptocurrency service providers sell Ethereum at vending machines and in certain stores.\n\nA number of Swiss cryptocurrency service providers sell Ethereum at vending machines and in certain stores.

Contracts for difference (CFDs): CFD\u2019s based on the Ethereum price can be used to speculate on positive or negative price developments. Typically, CFDs use leverage, and this exposes you to a lot of risk. For this reason, CFDs generally are not recommended for inexperienced investors.\n\nWhat are the possible costs of investing in Ethereum?\n\nExchange rate markups: All Ethereum service providers and trading platforms use their own exchange rates to calculate the price of Ethereum in Swiss francs. The cost of buying Ethereum largely depends on how high the dealer\u2019s markup over the market price is. Make sure to compare the rate offered with the market price before you buy Ethereum. Even a platform that does not charge fees at all can still be more expensive than other platforms if it uses an unfavorable exchange rate.\n\nAll Ethereum service providers and trading platforms use their own exchange rates to calculate the price of Ethereum in Swiss francs.

The TER shows the ETN\u2019s ongoing fees, which detract from investment performance.\n\nHow can I buy Ethereum offline?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum at some brick-and-mortar stores and at special vending machines. Simplicity is the main advantage: You can buy Ethereum and pay with cash (or other payment methods, in some cases), without having to first open an account with a service provider. The main disadvantages of buying Ethereum at brick-and-mortar outlets are the high fees and the poor exchange rates.\n\nTypically, you receive a QR code which lets you access an Ethereum wallet that contains the Ethereum you purchased.\n\nTable 2: Swiss service providers for buying Ethereum offline\n\nService provider Are payments in\n\nCHF possible?

Date: 01.02.2024.\n\nWhat are Ethereum ETNs?\n\nThe principle of exchange-traded notes (ETNs) is similar to that of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Like an ETF, an ETN aims to replicate the performance of an underlying asset \u2013 Ethereum in the case of Ethereum ETNs. These notes enable you as an investor to participate in price growth without buying actual Ethereum. You can invest in ETNs using a stock brokerage account at a bank, as with ETFs. ETNs are passively managed and are best suited to investors who only want to participate in the price developments, without actually holding Ethereum.\n\nThe difference between an ETN and an ETF is that an ETN is not an investment fund, but a promissory note that gives you a debt claim against ETN\u2019s issuer. Your investments are not protected if the issuer goes bankrupt because unlike ETF shares, ETNs are not classified as segregated assets.\n\nThe titles of many ETNs include the abbreviation ETP, which stands for exchange-traded product. This is a broad term that covers many different assets that are traded on stock exchanges, including both ETNs and ETFs.\n\nWhich Ethereum ETNs are there?\n\nThere are many different Ethereum ETNs available to Swiss investors, but the selection varies depending on which stock brokerage account you use.\n\nTable 4: Ethereum ETNs ranked by costs (TER)\n\nETN ISIN Domicile of ETN issuer TER CoinShares Physical Ethereum GB00BLD4ZM24 Jersey 0.00% 21Shares Ethereum Core ETP CH1209763130 Switzerland 0.21% WisdomTree Physical Ethereum GB00BJYDH394 Jersey 0.35% Global X Ethereum ETP GB00BLBDZW12 Jersey 0.65% SEBA Ethereum ETP CH0587418630 Switzerland 0.75% VanEck Ethereum ETN DE000A3GPSP7 Liechtenstein 1.00% Ethereum Staking ETP CH0454664027 Switzerland 1.49% ETC Group Physical Ethereum DE000A3GMKD7 Germany 1.49%\n\nDate: 01.02.2024.\n\nThe ETNs included in Table 4 all use physical replication, meaning the issuer holds actual Ethereum as collateral.\n\nApart from the TER, you should also pay attention to the brokerage fees and custody fees charged by your bank. Typically, the fees for ETNs are the same as those for ETFs.\n\nCan I invest in Ethereum using ETFs?\n\nUnlike bitcoin, there are not yet any ETFs that replicate the market price of Ethereum. Currently, you only have the option of investing in Ethereum futures ETFs, which speculate on future price developments. These ETFs invest in futures.\n\nWhat are the risks of investing in Ethereum?\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum can potentially yield high returns, but it more closely resembles a lottery than a genuine investment. The prices of cryptocurrencies are very volatile, and there is no sure way to predict future price developments. Substantial losses are possible over both short terms and long terms, and a total loss cannot be ruled out. Ethereum can be used as an additional component to further diversify your investment portfolio. But it should never be a major part of your portfolio.\n\nYou should be especially careful with leveraged CFDs. Using these is identical to betting on the Ethereum price. Because a part of the investment is paid using a loan, you can end up losing more money than the amount you invested. These products are generally not suitable for inexperienced investors.\n\nMore on this topic:\n\nHow to buy bitcoin in Switzerland\n\nHow to pay with bitcoin in Switzerland\n\nShould I invest in bitcoin & Co?\n\nHow to invest money in Switzerland"

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, finds itself in the middle of a myriad of critical events that are likely affecting its price and future outlook. Here is a glimpse into the recent billion-dollar sell-off, the SEC\u2019s stance on a major ETF proposal, and a brief technical analysis for a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum\u2019s current landscape.\n\nA Billion-Dollar Sell-Off Causing a Stir in the Ethereum Market\n\nA recent large-scale sell-off involving 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, by crypto financial services firm Celsius sent shockwaves through the Ethereum ecosystem. This massive transaction, primarily directed towards Coinbase Prime and Paxos Treasury, has raised concerns about Ethereum\u2019s price stability and liquidity. While Celsius retains a significant ETH reserve, the market is reacting cautiously while observing how Ethereum absorbs this major outflow.\n\nSEC Holds the Cards while the Ethereum ETF Debate Continues\n\nTo add another layer of uncertainty, the SEC has hit pause on BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF. This delay in the decision that was initially targeted for February indicates the SEC\u2019s cautious approach towards crypto investment offerings. The future approval or rejection of this ETF is perceived to hold significant weight as it will likely influence investor sentiment and market movements.\n\nAnalyzing Potential Paths for ETH\n\nLooking at the technical side, Ethereum\u2019s current indicators paint a mixed picture. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) suggests neutrality, while the stochastic %K hints at some bullish momentum. The CCI (Commodity Channel Index) leans towards a growing bullish trend, but the low ADX (Average Directional Index) indicates a lack of strong trend direction. Meanwhile, MACD and Awesome Oscillator readings are further confirming current bullish signals.\n\nSupport levels of $2295.48 and $2375.39 stand ready to cushion potential price dips, while resistance looms at $2573.47 and $2691.64. The 10-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) at $2226.37 and $2358.42, respectively, suggest there may be a possible consolidation phase.\n\nPrice Predictions- Where Does Ethereum Go From Here?\n\nPredicting Ethereum\u2019s price movements would require circumnavigating a complex interaction of technical indicators and fundamental developments. The SEC\u2019s eventual decision on the ETF proposal and potential commissioner comments regarding the pending approval will no doubt have a significant impact on investor sentiment.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, immediate support and resistance levels will play a crucial role. A bullish scenario could see Ethereum test $2691.64, possibly reaching $2700 if the ETF receives approval. On the other hand, the recent sell-off and ETF delays might push prices toward $2375.39, with a further break likely to test $2295.48.\n\nHope vs. Caution for Ethereum- Final Thoughts\n\nOverall, Ethereum stands at a critical stage. Technical indicators present a balanced picture with hints of potential growth, particularly if the ETF receives a green light. However, the billion-dollar sell-off and regulatory uncertainty stress upon the need for caution. Investor sentiment and regulatory decisions will ultimately determine Ethereum\u2019s path forward, keeping everyone on their toes for the time being.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that this information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.
