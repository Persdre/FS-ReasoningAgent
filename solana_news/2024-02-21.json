        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Fulfilling Its Potential as an Incredible Disruptor? 3 Reasons I'm Bearish - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This innovative crypto gets a lot of attention, but investors need to ask pressing questions.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.92%) was born from the perceived limitations to adding functionality to Bitcoin. Launched in July 2015, Ethereum has skyrocketed nearly 93,000% in value since its public release, even though it remains more than 40% off its peak price.\n\nIs the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a current market cap of about $350 billion, fulfilling its potential as an incredible disruptor? I'm not so sure. Here are three reasons I'm bearish on Ethereum.\n\nHuge promise\n\nLet's first try to understand why there's so much hype surrounding Ethereum and its long-term potential. Thanks to the blockchain network having functionality for smart contracts, many bulls believe that Ethereum can disrupt numerous industries, particularly those that depend on expensive intermediaries, by giving power and value back to the users.\n\nIn other words, smart contracts can automate a lot of functions that are slow and cumbersome, and that might not add much value. The end result, as many hope, is a better and cheaper user experience.\n\nViewed in this light, it might be encouraging to see Ethereum's complex roadmap. With scalability, security, and sustainably as the top priorities, the network's developer community has laid out different sets of upgrades to accomplish certain milestones. The latest event, known as The Merge, changed Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, significantly reducing its energy usage.\n\nViewed as the world's decentralized computer, Ethereum's ultimate goal is to change the entire structure of the economy, mainly as it relates to how individuals can have greater control in an internet-enabled world.\n\nReasons to be skeptical\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Ethereum's promise. There are more than 250 million unique wallet addresses. It has the most total value locked by far of any other crypto, which measures the amount of assets locked in a specific DeFi protocol. And sure, there are thousands of decentralized applications.\n\nBut I view things with a critical perspective. I think Ethereum is still primarily used as a tool for financial speculation, not actual utility. Even if spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds get approved, it proves that investors only want price exposure, instead of using Ethereum tokens in some dApp setting.\n\nAnd are dApps really better than services provided by well-known businesses? Marketplace and platform-like businesses, such as Meta Platforms, PayPal, Uber, and Airbnb, have billions of users combined who find value in what they have to offer. They work just fine as is.\n\nAnother reason I'm bearish is that I view Ethereum as another venture start-up, which defeats the entire purpose of crypto aiming to be decentralized and give power to the people. There are still a few head developers, most notably Vitalik Buterin, who have outsized influence on the direction of the network. And these founders stand to gain the most financially should things work out as planned.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said that Bitcoin is the only crypto that's a commodity, and that others are essentially securities. This supports the argument that Ethereum is just another profit-seeking enterprise.\n\nAnd the last bear case rests on the belief that Ethereum is a solution looking for a problem. In fact, this is probably true for nearly all cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nAll of the focus and discussion centered on the complex technicalities of the underlying network sound exciting. However, one really has to question if more and more people will engage further with Ethereum and use its dApps in the future. I'm not confident in this outcome.\n\nIt might make some bullish Ethereum supporters uncomfortable to challenge their beliefs about the cryptocurrency. But I think healthy criticality is necessary to set realistic expectations about its future."

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ethereum. Analysts see four drivers behind an even bigger surge - DLNews",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

However, an on-chain data trail of funds inflows trickling down to Solana from the Ethereum (ETH) network this week could spark a SOL price rebound toward $150.\n\nSolana price dips 12%, falling below market average\n\nIn the first half of February 2024, Solana was at the forefront of the crypto market rally, with SOL price soaring 26.8% and adding nearly $11 billion to its market capitalization. But that market trend flipped on Feb. 15 as investors began to take profits once the SOL price reached the 2024 peak of $118.\n\nSolana (SOL) price performance vs. Total3 Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC and ETH) | Source: TradingView\n\nAt press time on Feb. 21, Solana is trading at $103, down 12% from its Feb. 15 peaks.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast, the total altcoin market has grown by 5% during that period. Solana\u2019s negative price performance seems driven by insiders and existing holders\u2019 booking profits rather than macro factors.\n\nSolana receives $25 million in inflows from Ethereum\n\nHowever, while some SOL traders are taking chips off the table, the Solana network has continued to make some giant strides this week, which could trigger an early price rebound.\n\nIn the past week, Solana has received significant inflows from Ethereum as investors increasingly look to leverage Solana\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective defi services.\n\nBetween Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, investors transferred funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum to Solana, per on-chain data from Wormhole bridge Explorer.\n\nFund Outflows Ethereum (ETH) to Solana (SOL), Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 21 | Source: Wormhole Bridge\n\nThis indicates that Solana continues gaining traction among developers and defi users due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. Hence, this rising flow of funds bridged into Solana-hosted decentralized applications (dApps) is a bullish indicator of its growing adoption and utility.\n\nSolana defi TVL hits $2 billion milestone\n\nInvestors transferring funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum into the Solana ecosystem, despite the 12% decline in Solana\u2019s price over the last seven days, shows an evident divergence between short-term price movements and long-term investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL) Total Value Locked (TVL) hits $2 billion, Feb. 21, 2024 | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nThe latest wave of fund inflows has now propelled Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Solana network above the $2 billion milestone for the first time since June 2022.\n\nThis further underlines that the ongoing SOL price pullback is not driven by any discernible deterioration of Solana\u2019s fundamental network growth metrics.\n\nIf the trends persist, the rising demand for Solana defi service could eventually evolve into market demand for native SOL tokens and ultimately trigger a bullish price reversal towards the $150 territory in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s trip to $3,000 may have been short-lived, but on-chain data and the state of the wider ecosystem suggests that there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the digital asset.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) hit a near two-year high ahead of $3,000 on Tuesday \u2013 the first time it has traded at this level since April 2022.\n\nThe second largest digital asset by market cap rallied over 12% in the last week and briefly changed hands at $3,031, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, ether had failed to gain momentum towards a move higher, suggesting that this resistance level won\u2019t be so easy to breach.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this recent rally could also have some traders on their toes, given the last time ether rallied to this level in the weeks leading up to April 3, 2022. At the time, ether rallied from $2,520 over three weeks to a high of $3,580, but its price plummeted 46% over the next 40 days that followed.\n\nIn its most recent review of the crypto market, onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that while Bitcoin dominance still remains significant, there are early signs of more investor capital rotating into other ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe note that following the approval of the bitcoin ETF, ether has started to outperform bitcoin, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023,\u201d said the Glassnode analysts.\n\nIt is also likely that major inflows into ether will only materialize over the coming weeks, as they tend to lag relative to bitcoin inflows on account of investors looking for confirmation that digital asset markets are growing.\n\n\u201cIn the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into bitcoin occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ether,\u201d said Glassnode analysts.\n\nOptions market data suggests that a retest of some crucial price levels might come sooner rather than later. Coinalyze data points to more bullish bets on the price of ether, showing that 59% of traders were in long positions over a 24-hour time frame."

        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 projects.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Turner tells the 2.41 million channel subscribers that ETH\u2019s Dencun update may cause layer-2 projects to go on massive rallies and he names his top four picks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, which is expected to roll out in March, aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and data availability on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nSays Turner,\n\n\u201cAs the Dencun upgrade draws near, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s are about to take off.\u201d\n\nFirst up, the trader says that Arbitrum (ARB) could maintain its upward momentum.\n\n\u201cARB recently hit an all-time high of $2.40 on the 12th of January, and hasn\u2019t really shown many signs of slowing down either in large part due to the anticipated effects of Dencun. This is because Dencun\u2019s impact on layer-2 transaction speeds and costs will likely see more and more people adopting Arbitrum as an even cheaper way of interacting with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is trading for $1.83 at time of writing, down 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says Optimism (OP) has a lot of upward potential due to its aim to build a \u201csuperchain\u201d ecosystem that promotes collaboration across multiple layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\n\u201cOne of the first entrants to the \u2018superchain\u2019 ecosystem was none other than Coinbase\u2019s very own layer-2 solution, Base\u2026\n\nThis superchain could quickly become a reality after Dencun.\u201d\n\nOptimism is trading for $3.68 at time of writing, down more than 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAnother scaling solution on the trader\u2019s radar is Immutable X (IMX), which he believes could become more popular in the GameFi industry.\n\n\u201cImmutable could see a rapid acceleration in blockchain gaming development as network efficiency is supercharged. With Immutable being positioned as a big player in the GameFi narrative, many more gaming developers will be turning their attention to the best environment to launch their products in, and Immutable will be a top contender in that regard.\u201d\n\nImmutable is trading for $3.33 at time of writing, down more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Polygon (MATIC) could rise in value due to its own planned network upgrade called Polygon 2.0.\n\n\u201cMATIC hit an all-time high of $2.92 on the 27th of December 2021. At the time of shooting, it\u2019s still at 66% down from this price point. However, this could all change with 2.0.\u201d\n\nMATIC is trading for $0.93, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Reach $4,000 In March On 4 Factors Including Spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January turned the spotlight on Ethereum price, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Investors believe Ethereum has a high probability of receiving a spot ETF, especially with several proposals already with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDespite the growing optimism, ETH clawed back some of the gains it accrued earlier this week, falling from slightly above $3,000 to $2,900. The pullback came upon increased volatility in the market, with Bitcoin (BTC) rejecting $53,000 for a sweep at $50,500.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBesides Ethereum, other altcoins such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also pulled back to gather more liquidity. This could account for the modest price gains in the market on Thursday.\n\nEthereum price is one of the most uniquely placed projects, considering its standing as the second-largest crypto, the largest smart contracts platform, and its upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nThis article looks at these factors and more to determine the role they are likely to play in ETH\u2019s recovery journey in the short term.\n\n1. The Dencun Upgrade Scheduled For March\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comprised of two separate upgrades \u201cDeneb\u201d and \u201cCancun,\u201d is a major improvement for the Ethereum network that will increase its scalability and efficiency when implemented.\n\nIt will introduce proto-danksharding, a feature that will reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, which are faster and cheaper than the main chain. The upgrade has been tested on three testnets: Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.\n\nWith the final launch expected in March 2024, Ethereum price is already showing signs of an incoming rally. The token surged to highs slightly above $3,000 this week, backing positive sentiment.\n\n2. The Spot ETF\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been referred to as a major development for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to validating Bitcoin as a global mature asset, ETFs allow traditional investors who are not interested in the complexities of crypto to get exposure to BTC.\n\nMoreover, the move opened the door to fresh speculation regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Two years after the approval of Bitcoin futures ETF, Ethereum got its futures ETF. Experts say that the wait could be much short-term for the spot ETF.\n\nLike Bitcoin the hype surrounding the ETF could be a major catalyst for Ethereum price in the coming months.\n\nRecommended: Ethereum Price Rally Gains Momentum for $4000, Here Why?\n\n3. Staking\n\nValidators in the Ethereum ecosystem are required to stake at least 32 ETH. This condition significantly reduces the circulating supply. Ether becoming a PoS network through the Merge in 2022 allowed investors to freely stake and withdraw liquidity.\n\nContrary to expectations, the transition to PoS made staking even more attractive to investors, who have so far locked in $46.65 billion worth of ETH in smart contracts, according to Defi Llama.\n\nUnlike 2022 and 2023 when Ethereum experienced a persistent drop in staked assets, 2024 is looking positive, implying that investors have a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAn increase in staking translates to reduced sell-side pressure. Holders stake tokens they do not intend to sell in the near future, expecting the price will rise with time.\n\n4. Ethereum Price Dons Bullish Technical Structure\n\nDespite the correction from $3,000, Ethereum still holds above key indicators like the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Besides, support at $2,900 stopped the decline on Wednesday, realigning ETH with the upward trajectory.\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that dips are profitable. So until support at $2,800 flips, traders may want to consider buying ETH and in the process contributing to the momentum targeting $4,000 in March or before Bitcoin halving. The Ichimoku Cloud also affirms Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent post titled \"ETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive,\" on the X platform, Fred Krueger, known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, delivered a harsh critique of Ethereum (ETH), highlighting concerning trends and indicating a bleak outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over ETH's declining user activity\n\nKrueger began by pointing out that despite Ethereum's soaring price, indicative of a robust ecosystem, the actual usage of the Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a notable decline. He highlighted that while ETH has surged to $3,000, the number of Daily Active Users (DAUs) on the Ethereum network has dwindled from 120,000 in 2021 to a mere 66,000 in the past year.\n\nThe decline in active users is further exemplified by the dwindling numbers on Uniswap V3, Ethereum's leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. With just 16,000 DAUs, a stark contrast to the 60,000-plus seen in 2020, Krueger noted that Ethereum's utility as a transactional platform seems to be eroding.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right?\n\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\nEth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\nThis statistic is particularly alarming considering Ethereum's role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its aspirations to become the backbone of various decentralized applications (dApps), especially in the face of the upcoming Dencun Upgrade.\n\nEthereum: Meme coin in disguise?\n\nKrueger likened Ethereum's current state to that of a \"meme coin,\" drawing parallels to assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB). He emphasized that despite its soaring valuation, Ethereum's utility seems to have dwindled, particularly in comparison to other blockchain networks such as Solana, Avalanche and Near, which offer cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism regarding the possibility of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval, citing concerns about regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), unlikely to greenlight an Ethereum ETF due to potential issues surrounding its premined nature, Krueger cautioned against banking on such an approval as a catalyst for Ethereum's growth."

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade: Which Layer-2 Platforms Will Benefit the Most? - CoinGape",
        "content": "As investors keep a close watch on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, attention is currently directed towards the imminent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Scheduled for March 13, this upcoming enhancement is anticipated to wield significant influence, potentially bolstering various players within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring the potential ripple effects, let\u2019s delve into how the Ethereum Dencun upgrade stands to benefit other Layer-2 platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum Dencum Upgrade\n\nGet ready for the \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade, set to roll out on March 13, marking a significant hard fork update aimed at boosting the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and user-friendliness. As part of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap initiative, dubbed \u2018The Surge,\u2019 this upgrade is a pivotal step forward in scalability enhancements.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can expect from the Dencun upgrade:\n\nEIP-4844: Boost scalability.\n\nEIP-1153: Cutting down on-chain data storage expenses.\n\nEIP-4788: Elevating security and functionality.\n\nEIP-5656: Fine-tuning EVM performance\n\nEIP-6780: Improving network security.\n\nThe standout feature in Dencun is the implementation of Proto-Danksharding. With EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), a new transaction type called \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 is introduced, reducing transaction costs for both L2 users and ramping up Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher explains that the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will reduce transaction fees on Layer-2 platforms by a considerable magnitude. The analyst also emphasizes the increased commercial viability for dApp developers and users. This shift will position L2s as more appealing options compared to alternative L1s, offering a positive catalyst across various sectors such as DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and on-chain trading.\n\nLayer-2 Platforms That Benefit From Dencun Upgrade\n\nAlthough several Layer-2 platforms will benefit from the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, Miles Deutscher shares his coveted list of those platforms that he thinks will benefit the most.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Deutscher noted that $MATIC currently finds itself in a compelling position. It\u2019s on the verge of rebranding to POL. Despite lagging behind other L2s, there\u2019s been notable investment in implementing zk technology. Considering these factors, Deutscher believes $MATIC could emerge as a strong performer in the weeks or months ahead. Arbitrum: Arbitrum\u2019s metrics remain impressive, solidifying its position as a preferred chain for launching new dApps. Maintaining its status as the top L2 in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Arbitrum also boasts transaction volume that outpaces other L2 solutions. Optimism: Optimism ranks as the second-largest L2 by Total Value Locked (TVL), closely following Arbitrum, and it has demonstrated robustness in transaction processing. Recently, the platform unveiled its fourth airdrop, which is expected to reignite interest and activity within the ecosystem. COTI Network: COTI has unveiled V2, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution focused on privacy, featuring the introduction of \u2018Garbled Circuits.\u2019 This innovative technology offers an efficient method for maintaining privacy, marking the blockchain\u2019s maiden implementation of such a feature. Mantle: Mantle is currently among the rapidly expanding Layer 2 solutions. With over $1.5 billion worth of ETH staked as mETH (Mantle Staked ETH), it ranks as the third-largest LSD (Layer 2 Staked Deposit) after Lido and RocketPool. Moreover, mETH stakers can anticipate some promising airdrops in the near future. Metis: Metis is experiencing a wave of favorable developments that are propelling its growth forward. Notable among these is the establishment of the 4.6 million $METIS Ecosystem Fund, signaling a significant injection of $400 million into the ecosystem. Additionally, the upcoming launch of the decentralized sequencer alpha mainnet in March promises to further enhance the platform\u2019s capabilities and usability. Moreover, the implementation of the LSB (Liquid Staking Blitz) campaign is poised to bolster participation and engagement within the Metis community.\n\nMiles Duestscher stated that he\u2019s keeping a close watch on other Layer-2 Networks such as Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, alongside Aztec, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and zkSync has announce the launch of the first ZK Grants Round. This grants initiative aims to enhance the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer 2 Ecosystem, with a total shared prize pool of $900,000.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, each contributor, including the Ethereum Foundation, raised $150,000 to support research and development for ZK proofs and standards.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. Established in 2014, the EF aims to promote Ethereum and related technologies without controlling or leading them. Instead, the EF serves as one component of a broader ecosystem.\n\nThe EF focuses on initiatives such as the Ecosystem Support Program, which provides both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the wider Ethereum community.\n\nA zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method used to prove knowledge about a piece of data without revealing the data itself. It allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a claim is true without disclosing any information other than the fact that the claim is true.\n\nZKPs are used to provide privacy guarantees and are employed in various blockchain use cases, such as identity management, authentication, and private transactions.\n\nAccording to a report from Protocol Labs, the zero-knowledge proof market is anticipated to generate $75 million in revenue by 2024 and is expected to surpass $10 billion by 2030. The report further highlights a projection of almost 90 billion zero-knowledge proofs being needed for web3 applications alone in the year 2030.\n\nApplication dates and deadlines for the funding\n\nEthereum Foundation also noted in the announcement that interested parties are invited to submit proposals by 11:59 UTC on March 18th, 2024. These projects can be in various stages of development, including ideas, proof-of-concepts, work in progress, and fleshed-out projects.\n\nThe focus of development includes enhancing multi-prover systems for validity, ZK, and fraud proof. It added that the funding is also open to projects that improve various proof systems, enhance efficiency and user-friendliness of ZK Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), and create security benchmarks for ZK Rollups (ZKRs) and bridges.\n\nAdditionally, teams can explore the development of tools and interfaces for ZK and validity-proof based Layer 2 solutions, creating transpilers between zkDSL and Solidity, and investigating hardware acceleration for ZK protocols.\n\nAll proposals are expected to be submitted in PDF format, English language, with detailed descriptions, budgets, timelines, an applicant profile, and a link to published work. Eligible projects must be open source, align with the round\u2019s goals, and benefit the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem as public goods.\n\nEvaluation criteria include impact on the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem, value to multiple Layer 2 solutions, documentation clarity, and proposing individual or team experience.\n\nEthereum Foundation revealed that ineligible projects involve illegal activities, financial products or services, art or social impact initiatives, retroactive funding requests, and those planning token launches or public funding rounds."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could make a 5% trip south to the $48,000 psychological level.\n\nEthereum price likely to revisit $2,770, a 5% fall with a sell signal already in play.\n\nRipple price eyes a 7% fall amid growing overhead pressure.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is flashing red, alongside most altcoins, coming after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes revealed that some members think that interest rates could have topped out. Per the report, others expressed concerns over the progress of inflation. Nevertheless, some policy makers say the economic outlook appeared firmer than the December projections.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\n\n\nFed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak https://t.co/J03IIvsmT5 pic.twitter.com/rEjWSwv3a7 \u2014 FXStreet News (@FXStreetNews) February 21, 2024\n\nFind detailed report here: Fed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak\n\nBitcoin price could revisit $48,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is almost showing a directional bias, breaking below the $51,335 support. Judging from the technical indicators, if BTC records a candlestick close below the aforementioned buyer congestion level, the king of cryptocurrency could roll over to the $48,000 psychological level. In a dire case, BTC could retest the order block between $45,556 and $46,691.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already registered a sell signal by crossing its signal line (yellow band), while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is dipping and could also cross below its signal line (orange band). Meanwhile, the MACD histogram bars are paling out.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls show resolve, Bitcoin price could recover, flipping $52,985 into support as it extends towards $55,000 or in a highly bullish case, $60,000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 17% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to fall but MicroStrategy\u2019s $12 billion market cap makes it a possible S&P 500 candidate\n\nEthereum price could fall 5%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price, like BTC, is responding to a sell signal executed on the RSI. Traders heeding this call could see ETH drop 5% to the $2,770 support, coinciding with the midline of the ascending parallel channel. The paling MACD histogram bars accentuate this bearish thesis, solidified by the topped out MACD which is now deviating south.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a recovery among the bulls could send Ethereum price north, first clearing the range high of $3,033 before creating a local top above it.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price scrapes $3,000 psychological threshold after 20 months, inspiring conjecture on altseason\n\nRipple price subdued by growing overhead pressure\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains within the confines of the descending parallel channel, a status made worse by growing overhead pressure. Specifically, XRP price faces overhead pressure due to the 200 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at $0.5643 and $0.5835 levels respectively. These features, coupled with the sell signal that the RSI has just executed, tilt the odds in favor of the downside.\n\nAccordingly, Ripple price could make a 7% drop to $0.5001, levels last tested on February 7. If this level fails to hold as support, XRP price could slip through to the $0.4734 support floor, around 13% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls come in, enhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price recover. A northbound move could see the payments token overcome the 200 and 100-day SMAs, bring the $0.6000 psychological level within reach.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, XRP price could leap further to test the $0.6421 blockade, nearly 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple CEO criticizes SEC says regulator has lost lawsuits consistently; XRP price holds firm above $0.55"

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Sharp Rejection Near $3,000 As Profit-Taking Sentiment Rises! What\u2019s Next For ETH Price? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "After [ccpw id=60415] soared past the $50K milestone, traders eagerly anticipated [ccpw id=60480] to mirror this success by crossing the $3K threshold. This expectation came to a conclusion as Ethereum shattered its two-year peak by breaking the $3,000 milestone, setting off a wave of short liquidations. This breakthrough has triggered bullish outlooks, prompting a rise in Ethereum accumulation by investors who are now gearing up for potential further price surges. Nevertheless, with the increase in profit-taking behavior around that mark and the exit of both long-term and short-term holders near the peak, this led to a steep decline in the ETH price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Becomes Positive\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has climbed to $53,000, but Ethereum has outpaced BTC\u2019s gains, reaching $3,000 for the first time in almost two years. These price increases have put highly leveraged traders on alert, leading to total liquidations of around $300 million.\n\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s price is now undergoing a significant drop as many investors sold their stakes near the $3,000 peak. Notably, Ethereum saw total liquidations nearing $8.6 million, with a substantial $8.5 million of those being buyer liquidations. The week started off on a slower note, but Bitcoin made an aggressive move to $53,000, hitting this level for the first time since late 2021.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Netflow metric for ETH has moved into the positive territory, indicating that the volume of inflows now exceeds that of outflows. This shift points to a rise in exchange reserves, increasing the likelihood of sales and thus exerting downward pressure near resistance levels. The Netflow metric currently registers at +20,470 ETH.\n\nMoreover, the volume of large transactions has doubled recently, jumping from a low of 1.08 million ETH to 2.26 million ETH. This increase signals a rise in activity by major investors or \u201cwhales.\u201d In the event of such a market rejection, these whales could lose confidence, potentially triggering a wave of selling pressure that may drive the ETH price down to its immediate support levels.\n\nHowever, the bullish sentiment continues as ETH\u2019s network is poised for a pivotal enhancement called \u201cDencun,\u201d scheduled for March. This update is set to deploy \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d to the blockchain, which is expected to boost its performance and lower transaction fees.\n\nA Bloomberg analyst has projected a potential rise in ether\u2019s value to $4,000, drawing parallels with bitcoin\u2019s rally preceding the approval of spot ETFs. On the other hand, TD Cowen and JPMorgan express skepticism; TD Cowen questions the immediate approval of spot ether ETFs by the SEC, while JPMorgan assigns a probability of less than 50% for such approval by May.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther rebounded off the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that buyers are attempting to solidify this level as a foundation of support. Consequently, this boosted the buyers\u2019 confidence, enabling them to surpass the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels and break past the $3,000 mark. Currently, the price of ETH stands at $2,948, marking an increase of over 1.1% from the previous day\u2019s value.\n\nAlthough the price managed to breach the immediate barrier of $3,000, it couldn\u2019t maintain its surge as sellers initiated a pullback. Nonetheless, buyers are keen on maintaining the upward momentum with hopes of driving the price towards the critical resistance level at $3,100. Achieving this could set the stage for a move towards $3,500.\n\nThe recent price rejection has plunged the Relative Strength Index (RSI) toward 58, hinting at the possibility of a minor correction or a consolidation phase looming. For a short-term peak to be indicated, sellers would have to send the price below the 20-day EMA."

It allows users to make profiles, share messages, connect with others, and establish communities, offering a similar user experience to popular social networks like X and Reddit. However, the main distinction is its decentralized design, which guarantees that individuals have control of their accounts and connections, allowing them to switch between applications effortlessly.\n\nFarcaster addresses some critical issues of traditional social media platforms, including censorship, privacy breaches, and centralization. The technology, specifically the underlying Optimism infrastructure, guarantees transparency, security, and decentralization. This setup minimizes data breaches and censorship risks by not relying on centralized servers.\n\nMeanwhile, Farcaster's focus on interoperability is refreshing, enabling the smooth exchange of information and assets across various platforms. This feature also allows for multiple social media decentralized apps (DApps) to be run on top of its protocol. What's more, smart contracts support social interactions within the network, adding a layer of programmability and customization to the social networking experience.\n\nFarcaster's commitment to decentralization is emphasized by its principle of \"sufficient decentralization,\" where two users can find and communicate with each other regardless of the rest of the network's preferences.\n\nPut simply, Farcaster unifies access to multiple decentralized social networks in a single space and allows users to interact across these platforms under a single decentralized ID. This approach places greater control in the hands of the user and reduces the influence of individual actors, namely those developing specific social networks.\n\nTo further incentivize adoption, Farcaster introduces innovative economic models and features like \"Frames,\" which are interactive mini-applications that enhance user engagement. Farcaster's charging of a $5 sign-up fee for new users also aims to reduce bot engagement and promote a more genuine and interactive user experience. The recent addition of Frames has dramatically increased its users, highlighting the platform's rising popularity and ability to change how people interact on social media. As of February 22, 2024, Farcaster was attracting almost 28,000 new users every week.\n\nFarcaster's unique blend of blockchain technology, emphasis on user privacy and security, and innovative use of smart contracts and economic models sets it apart from other social networks.

This feature allows users to incorporate NFTs into their feeds for others to interact with or create. It also introduces Warp points, an in-app currency that unlocks various benefits and privileges, making the user experience more engaging and interactive on the platform.\n\nFarcaster's 'channels' feature provides an area for individuals to sort through posts based on various topics, similar to a combination of conventional social media feeds and forum-style conversations about specific subjects. This function enables more structured and targeted conversations, catering to the varied interests of its users.\n\nOverall, the registration process through Warpcast is straightforward, with a nominal annual fee ($5 for 5,000 posts, 2,500 reactions, and 2,500 followers) which, alongside reducing spam, supports maintenance and development of the network.\n\nWarpcast demonstrates the capabilities of Web3 technologies in our online connections and interactions, empowering users to have greater authority over their data and interactions within a secure and innovative setting.\n\nThe technology behind Farcaster\n\nFarcaster adopts the Ethereum blockchain to offer a smooth and practical user experience via a hybrid structure that incorporates both on-chain and off-chain components.

        "title": "Q1 2024 Crypto Price Predictions: Near Protocol, Meme Moguls, Ethereum - What\u2019s in Store for These Tokens? - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 will be a wild ride for many altcoins, such as Near Protocol (NEAR) and Ethereum (ETH). Today, we look at some price predictions for these hot tokens. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - a Stage 5 presale star, has been making waves in the meme coin space. Many analysts even have it pegged as the next 100x meme coin in 2024. Let\u2019s see why.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR): Price Soars Around 22%\n\nRecently, Near Protocol (NEAR) has been showing bullish signs. For instance, the Near Protocol price increased from $2.90 to $3.53 in the past 30 days. Its market cap also grew from $2.91B to $3.67B in that time. Not only that, Near Protocol experienced 17/30 green trading days.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, this number will increase as Near Protocol trades above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Furthermore, this altcoin has 24 technical indicators in the green. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Near Protocol price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.95 within Q1 of 2024 for NEAR.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): To Rule the Meme Coin Market\n\nThe Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale is garnering a significant amount of attention and investment. This project has already raised nearly $2.5M in its presale performance, aiming to make waves in the booming meme coin sector. With real utility and an experienced team behind it, there is no reason why MGLS cannot become a blue-chip token.\n\nWhat sets Meme Moguls apart is its commitment to blending meme coin dynamics with tangible utility. Unlike most meme coins, MGLS serves a dual purpose as a governance token and the in-game currency for the upcoming Meme Moguls play-to-earn (P2E) game.\n\nIn the P2E game, players will participate in virtual stock trading experiences, gaining insights into wealth-building and investments. They may even try to \u201cBeat the Market\u201d - a game mode where you can compete against indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nThe Meme Moguls ecosystem is built on the MGLS token. Currently priced at $0.0036 during Stage 5 of its presale, early adopters are already up by 90%. And since it\u2019s set to be listed on Uniswap in Q1 2024, experts are predicting a 100x pump. At this moment, there\u2019s also a 30% deposit bonus, which adds to the overall appeal of this game-changing meme coin.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe Announces a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has also been making headlines. For instance, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe remains bullish for this altcoin. In other words, Poppe made a new tweet stating that a price increase would come after the Dencun upgrade or from a short-term peak of BTC. He claims that Ethereum will also reclaim 0.06.\n\nIn terms of the Ethereum price movement, it has jumped from $2,488 to $2,901 in the past week alone. Its market cap also grew from $299B to $348B during that time. Additionally, Ethereum is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. As a result, experts predict that this altcoin will hit $3,629 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Meme Moguls Outpace Near Protocol and Ethereum?\n\nMeme Moguls hold a solid chance of outpacing giants like Near Protocol and Ethereum. With a modest market cap of $10.8M, Meme Moguls can reach heights faster by requiring fewer new funds. Thus, MGLS is one of the best meme coins to invest in if you wish to see fast returns.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) is a \u201cshitcoin\u201d without purpose that has no distinct advantage over competitors, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\n\u201cWho gives a fuck? Zero?\u201d said Hayes when asked \u201cWhat about Cardano?\u201d in an interview with Coin Bureau published on Sunday.\n\nCardano Is A Shitcoin, Says Hayes\n\nContinuing to describe the cryptocurrency \u2013 a top ten digital asset by market cap \u2013 Hayes did not mince words: \u201cThe first wannabe Ethereum, and probably the first one to go to be irrelevant,\u201d he said.\n\nTypically, the popular crypto essayist and trader is well known as one of the loudest long-term Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) bulls, and often expresses interest in small-cap cryptos for short-term trading.\n\nDuring the same interview, Hayes even expressed interest in the memecoin \u201cdogwifhat\u201d calling it the \u201cbest dog money of this bull cycle.\n\n\u201cI love Rare Pepe\u2019s\u2026 I think we\u2019re going to see a resurgence of NFT trading volumes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe writer\u2019s unique callout of Cardano ruffled some feathers online \u2013 especially with the network\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson. On Tuesday, Hoskinson asked Hayes why he was \u201cthrowing shade\u201d at Cardano.\n\n\u201cCause your coin is a piece of shit man,\u201d Hayes replied. \u201cJust buy some ETH and chill.\u201d\n\nWhat Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nMuch like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform for developing decentralized applications. It also popularized as one of the first well-developed proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, which use crypto rather than energy to secure its network.\n\nHowever, many popular blockchains today now use the same mechanism, with Ethereum undergoing a massive upgrade in 2022 to adopt proof of stake. In terms of both market size and DeFi TVL, Cardano is still outsized by competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Hayes published a list of the world\u2019s most popular Dapps, and asked which of them had originated or grown most popular on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n\u201cFrom my very limited knowledge, it looks like none of them do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why ADA is dog shit.\u201d\n\nOn Bitcoin, however, Hayes remains a bull, expecting strong money printing from the Federal Reserve to drive the asset\u2019s price up soon.\n\n\u201cWhen printing money happens and you debase the value of time and human labor, we rejoice and say great, fuck you, we\u2019re gonna take Bitcoin to a million,\u201d he told Coin Bureau.\n\nLate last year, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would reach between $750,000 and $1 million by the end of 2026."

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has crossed the $3,000 threshold for the first time since April 2022 yesterday. However, amidst the celebratory fireworks in the crypto community, Fred Krueger, a renowned Bitcoin ETF expert, has voiced a starkly contrasting opinion. Krueger, a Wall Street veteran and prop trader, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his skepticism about the current valuation of ETH, stating, \u201cETH is completely detached from reality.\u201d\n\nWhy Ethereum Is \u201cCompletely Detached From Reality\u201d\n\nKrueger\u2019s comments come at a time when the crypto market is witnessing a resurgence in investor interest, with Ethereum at the forefront due to its recent price rally. Despite this, Krueger points out a concerning trend in the usage of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\n\u201cETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K active daily users in 2021, to just 66K over the last year. The top app, Uniswap V3 is only getting 16K DAUs. I remember, back in 2020 this number was 60K or more,\u201d he noted, emphasizing a decline in the platform\u2019s direct utility and engagement.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Receives Nod Of Approval From Berstein: ETH Price Will Reach $10,000 7 months ago\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF expert further criticized the valuation of Ethereum, drawing parallels to meme coins like Shiba Inu due to its inflated market cap, which stands at $361 billion despite the fall in active users. \u201cIt really has become a type of meme coin, similar to Shiba Inu,\u201d Krueger remarked, pointing to the stark contrast between Ethereum\u2019s high market cap and its diminishing direct use.\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum is not only overvalued but also faces stiff competition from other blockchains that outperform it in terms of transaction costs and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly cheap ($1.50 per transaction), or fast. If you are just interested in reward points for games, or casino-style DeFi apps \u2014 Solana, Avalanche, Near etc.. all crush it.\u201d\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism about the future regulatory landscape for Ethereum, particularly concerning the potential for an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cFinally, I don\u2019t think Gensler is going to allow an ETH ETF\u2026 I just don\u2019t think Gary wants to make his second ETF a massive pre-mine. Sets a very bad precedent,\u201d he stated, reflecting on the challenges Ethereum faces in gaining mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe Crypto Community Reacts\n\nIn response to Krueger\u2019s critical take, the crypto community on X provided mixed reactions. One user challenged Krueger\u2019s analysis by pointing to Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap and the misleading nature of using mainnet daily active users (DAU) as a metric for the platform\u2019s health. Krueger, however, remained unconvinced, stating, \u201cEven L2s like Arbitrum have been in decline for the last 12 months. This is not the case that all is well in ETH-land.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnother user attempted to highlight the cyclical nature of DeFi and the broader crypto market, suggesting that the current downturn is a temporary phase of risk aversion. Yet, Krueger dismissed these arguments, reiterating his lack of interest in speculative DeFi activities and emphasizing his belief in Bitcoin as the true revolutionary cryptocurrency. \u201cI am not interested in degen ape games. Have fun,\u201d he stated.\n\nKrueger\u2019s critique extends beyond Ethereum to the broader landscape of cryptocurrencies, questioning the long-term viability and value proposition of altcoins, including Layer 1 solutions other than Bitcoin. He argues that these platforms are unlikely to become significant value generators in the long term, likening their control mechanisms to fiat currencies but with central figures like Vitalik Buterin in place of traditional central bankers.\n\nKrueger\u2019s overall stance on Ethereum and the broader crypto market is clear. \u201cMy position on ETH. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is the revolution\u2026 Every other cryptocurrency is fighting for some other much smaller use case,\u201d he explained, underscoring his belief in Bitcoin\u2019s unique value proposition as a decentralized, finite currency system.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price surpassed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (at $2,922), trading at $2,935. A weekly close above this threshold could confirm another leg up for the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "A crypto investor, Fred Krueger, thinks Ethereum is overvalued at spot rates. Referring to X, Krueger added that Ethereum supporters are \u201cdetached from reality\u201d after ETH, the native currency, recently broke above $3,000.\n\nThe investor pointed to the general declining on-chain activity, fierce competition from alternatives like Solana and Avalanche, for instance, and regulatory uncertainty that makes holding the coin risky.\n\nEthereum Is Slow And Usage Is Shrinking\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum\u2019s on-chain transactions could be faster and cheaper. In the current landscape marked with scalable and low-fee alternatives, either built on Ethereum or existing as independent chains, the chain\u2019s challenges no longer justify ETH trading at spot rates of about $3,000.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAVAX Slips, Adding Tension To $365 Million Avalanche Token Unlock Drama 7 months ago\n\nBeyond scaling and throughput challenges, the investor also refers to the sharp decline in daily active users (DAUs) on the mainnet. Since 2021, Ethereum and altcoin prices have peaked, and active DAUs have fallen from around 120,000 to approximately 66,000 in February 2024.\n\nThough network supporters said there had been developments like layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum pinning their security on Ethereum, Krueger notes that even the most active and largest protocols by total value locked (TVL) have seen user losses.\n\nTo illustrate, Uniswap V3, the third version of one of Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralized exchanges, Uniswap, now records around 16,000 daily active users, significantly lower than previous years.\n\nAlternatives Like Solana Offer Better: Is ETH Expensive?\n\nThe investor argues that the decline in DAUs, pointing to active usage, sharply contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s rising market capitalization and spot rates. In Krueger\u2019s opinion, this emerging state of affairs is why Ethereum has become a bloated \u201cmeme coin like Shiba Inu,\u201d looking at its high market cap.\n\nIt in the investor\u2019s assessment that faster and cheaper alternatives like Solana, Avalanche, and Near Protocol offer better value for specific use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and games.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nKrueger also took issue with the lack of regulatory clarity on Ethereum. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) batch. Primarily, this is because SEC officials recognize Bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nGary Gensler and the SEC have failed to classify ETH in the same category as BTC. Accordingly, though the broader crypto community is optimistic about the eventual authorization of a spot Ethereum ETF, Krueger thinks it is unlikely.\n\nStill, time will only tell how Ethereum and its market valuation will evolve in the coming months. Supporters are optimistic, despite criticism, that rising adoption and ETH\u2019s deflationary nature will lift prices towards 2021 highs of $5,000.\n\nFeature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The Merge NFT is a unique dynamic NFT collection that was created by a digital artist called Murat Pak and featured on the leading NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in December 2021.\n\nThe collection that commemorates Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism netted over $91.8 million during its brief 48-hour sale. This makes The Merge not only the most expensive NFT collection ever sold, but also the most expensive art piece sold by a living artist on a public sale.\n\nThe artwork that accompanied The Merge NFT drop on Nifty Gateway. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is The Merge NFT and how does it work?\n\nThe Merge is a unique and dynamic Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection that made headlines and broke sales records in December 2021. After the sale was concluded, Nifty Gateway minted all 312,686 purchased tokens, also referred to as units of \u201cmass\u201d.\n\nWe're kicking off minting of mass tonight, anyone who purchased mass should see their NFT within the next few hours. We will also be putting a hold on moving mass out of your accounts momentarily to make the secondary market fair for everyone \u26ab\ufe0f @muratpak pic.twitter.com/bkdXu4uFFU \u2014 Nifty Gateway ? (@niftygateway) December 7, 2021\n\nThe artworks of The Merge NFTs are very basic as each token is represented by a simple white or yellow circle on a black background. The visuals are generated fully on-chain based on the formulas included in the smart contracts and not hosted off-chain as is the case with many other NFT collections.\n\nWhat sets The Merge apart from all other NFT collections is the concept behind the collection, which utilizes a unique mechanism that causes the collection to change and develop over time. The collection\u2019s smart contract prevents one address from holding multiple NFTs from the Merge collections \u2013 as soon as two NFTs from the collection are held in the same wallet, the masses of the two tokens merge. The result is one newly minted NFT with the combined mass of both pre-existing NFTs, which is depicted by a bigger circle on a black background.\n\nThe Merge NFTs in circulation diminishes as they are transferred between wallets (more precisely, bought by someone who already holds an NFT from the collection in the wallet), and their average mass increases. The total mass, however, remains constant.\n\nAn illustrative artwork depicting the merging of two mass tokens on the left and an equation explaining how the merging principle works on the right. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Merge?\n\nAs already mentioned, The Merge NFT collection commemorates the Ethereum Merge, which was a historical event in Ethereum\u2019s history that concluded the network's transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe transition process started with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the Serenity upgrade, on December 1, 2021, when the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain (the chain that currently acts as the central coordination layer for the entire Ethereum 2.0 network) was activated. While ETH 2.0 staking deposits were enabled shortly after, the PoS and the PoW networks ran simultaneously up until September 15, 2022, when the transition concluded with The Merge event. Since then, the Ethereum network is secured solely by staking.\n\nThe move to proof-of-stake enabled Ethereum to address its scalability issues, which often caused extraordinary spikes in gas prices while the network still relied on PoW. In addition, the network had become more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable as the energy consumption was reduced by more than 99% when the PoW chain was made obsolete.\n\nHow much money The Merge NFT sold for in December 2021?\n\nThe Merge NFTs were sold in an open edition style (the opposite of a limited edition sale) from December 2 to December 4, 2021. The starting price for the public sale of The Merge tokens was set at $575 per unit, with the price increasing by $25 every 6 hours, so the ones who bought the tokens in the last few hours of the sale had to cash out $750 per token. The number of tokens each participant could acquire was unlimited.\n\nThe Merge NFT sale saw participation from 29,983 unique address owners who bought a total of 312,686 tokens. The Merge NFT sale ended up netting an exceptional sum of $91.8 million. This crowns The Merge NFT as the most expensive artwork ever publicly sold by a living artist.\n\nNevertheless, this record is a bit controversial as it is only valid if we consider the whole collection as a single piece of art. While many claim that The Merge is actually a collection of artworks, it could one day, if all the NFTs are merged in one wallet, become one NFT and thereby one single unique art piece.\n\nHow much is The Merge NFT worth now?\n\nSince its initial sale, the price of The Merge NFTs has fallen significantly. At the time of writing, one unit of mass has a floor price of $125, which is about 0.0428 ETH. Using this floor price puts the total market capitalization of the NFTs in circulation at slightly below 803 ETH (worth around $2.3 million).\n\nStill, quite a few tokens get sold above the floor price, which means that the total value of the whole collection would likely be higher in the end. In addition, the price of an NFT from The Merge collection also depends on its mass. There are currently 8,210 unique addresses that are holding The Merge NFT, meaning that there are only that many distinctive NFTs in circulation and many of them have a mass larger than 1.\n\nTop 4 The Merge NFTs with the largest mass that are currently being sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT marketplace and their respectful ask prices. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nThe Merge: Regenesis NFTs by ConsenSys\n\nPak's Merge collection is not the only NFT collection that pays tribute to the Ethereum merge. Ethereum development studio ConsenSys has released a collection called The Merge: Regenesis, which was also designed to celebrate Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe collection was available for minting over a period of 72 hours and features three types of artworks, each commemorating one aspect of Ethereum's move to PoS: scalability, security and sustainability.\n\nDue to the sheer amount of NFTs minted, this collection has a very low floor price of only about 0.0007 ETH ($2.05 at the time of writing).\n\nThe bottom line: The Merge is the most expensive NFT collection ever sold\n\nAlthough The Merge NFT collection is not as valuable as it used to be when it was initially dropped on the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the sale of this unique dynamic NFT collection still represents a record-breaking event in the history of digital art and art in general. The Merge NFT collection sold for $91.8 million, surpassed Jeff Koons\u2019 sculpture titled \u201cRabbit,\u201d which sold for $91.1 million by a hair's breadth and became arguably the most expensive artwork sold publicly by a living artist.\n\nIn addition, The Merge NFT reigns on top of the list of the most expensive NFT collections. Even so, The Merge tokens have not made it to the list of the most expensive single NFTs ever sold just yet. Interesting and unique NFTs from collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, have a tendency to soar much higher as far as the price of a single non-fungible token is concerned.\n\nWe will conclude this article with a hard snap back to reality as those of us without ETH holdings worth millions of dollars in our digital wallets would likely find an article on how to find and participate in free NFT drops much more useful."
