        "content": "EigenLayer, the highly-anticipated Ethereum restaking protocol that has attracted billions of dollars worth of customer deposits, went to mainnet Tuesday afternoon.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s data availability solution, named EigenDA, also went live as an actively validated service (AVS) built on top of EigenLayer.\n\nThe launch came with training wheels of sorts, however, as critical components of EigenLayer are not set to go live until later this year.\n\nEthereum is secured by ether (ETH) that is staked, or pledged to earn yield in return for accurately verifying transactions. EigenLayer takes this a step further with restaking, which allows staked ETH be restaked and used to secure and run AVSs, which are various blockchain-based platforms built on EigenLayer.\n\nRead more: Restaking platform EigenLayer \u2018flips\u2019 Aave in TVL\n\nWith the mainnet launch, restakers can now delegate their restaked balance to EigenLayer operators, who can then run AVSs.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has raced above $13 billion in the past few months, making it the second-largest DeFi protocol according to DeFiLlama. EigenLayer\u2019s offering of points for depositors, which some speculate will determine allocation in a future token, played a major part in the rapid growth.\n\nIt has also benefited from the popularity of liquid restaking tokens that restake deposits and issue liquid tokens in return, similarly to how Lido\u2019s stETH works.\n\nRead more: DeFi \u2018points\u2019 farming has reshaped the crypto investment landscape\n\nSome have expressed concerns over potential risks that could stem from restaking, which until now was a totally unproven model for Ethereum security.\n\nAny risk that EigenLayer could create \u201cfeels very systemic,\u201d Sebastian Higgs, chief operating officer of Cordial Systems, told Blockworks prior to the mainnet launch.\n\n\u201cIf there is an issue, the knock-on impact could be far reaching and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m proceeding very cautiously and I still have more questions than answers at this point,\u201d said Higgs.\n\nWhatever those risks may be, they aren\u2019t likely to surface quite yet. In an X thread announcing its mainnet, EigenLayer said it would allow its marketplace to \u201cdevelop and stabilize\u201d before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing later this year. In this case, slashing refers to an EigenLayer operator being financially punished for not adhering to rules set by an AVS.\n\nIf payments are enabled before slashing, operators and liquid restaking tokens would likely support every AVS, Ian Unsworth, co-founder of Kairos Research, told Blockworks. \u201c[B]ut once slashing gets implemented, we will see a \u2018de-leveraging\u2019 so to speak, as the stake gets re-delegated to reflect the actual risk.\u201d\n\nThe mainnet launch means some large venture bets will start to play out. A16z invested $100 million into Eigen Labs in February, adding to the $50 million it raised in early 2023. Multiple recently-funded startups are also teed up to become AVSs, including shared sequencer marketplace Espresso and restaked rollup provider AltLayer.\n\nRead more: Espresso lands $28M to become marketplace for shared sequencing\n\nElsewhere, investors have seemingly taken a liking to liquid restaking projects like ether.fi, which announced its $23 million Series A in February.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn 2024\u2019s largest crypto raise so far, Monad Labs, the firm behind the upstart layer-1 network Monad, secured a whopping $225 million in funding on Monday from a round led by crypto venture juggernaut Paradigm.\n\nThe raise, which was also supported by crypto VC Electric Capital and the tech investment firm Greenoaks, constitutes a significant show of faith by crypto mainstays that Monad\u2014which has yet to launch\u2014will become a speedy, affordable, and dependable decentralized finance (DeFi) alternative to both the Ethereum ecosystem and layer-1 networks like Solana.\n\nFounded in 2022 by Jump Crypto alum Keone Hon, Monad is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network that is seeking to fill what is sees as a gap in the current crypto landscape: A blockchain able to easily interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, that is distinctly more capable of accommodating extremely high traffic while remaining speedy, cheap, and secure.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchains out there that would argue they already fit that criteria, to be sure. Following the landmark Dencun upgrade last month, Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have seen transaction costs plummet to near-zero. If any of those networks were to see massive upticks in usage, however, their gas fees would almost certainly spike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNon-Ethereum layer-1 networks, particularly Solana, have ballooned in popularity in recent months\u2014particularly for DeFi users\u2014due to their speed and lower fees. But Solana has also suffered repeated outages as it attempts to scale to become a linchpin of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBy offering full capability with EVM\u2014the software that powers Ethereum, and all networks built on top of it\u2014Monad appears to be tapping into the dominant influence Ethereum has over crypto users and developers, while simultaneously attempting to build a more streamlined version of the network from the ground up.\n\nIt also looks like a play for attracting top-level developers. According to a January report from Electric Capital, some 90% of crypto developers working on multiple chains work with EVM.\n\nOther EVM-compatible layer-one networks are already out there, most notably Avalanche and BNB Chain, the latter of which was created by Binance. But Monad Labs\u2019 fundraise today marks the flashiest entry into the crowded blockchain ecosystem in some time\u2014certainly since the crypto crash of 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are excited about Monad because it solves one of the critical bottlenecks in scalability for the Ethereum ecosystem: the Ethereum Virtual Machine,\u201d Electric Capital Managing Partner Avichal Garg told Decrypt. \u201cMonad\u2019s parallelized EVM can unlock a 100x improvement in throughput in the EVM ecosystem and make consumer-grade, decentralized applications possible.\u201d\n\nPrior to today\u2019s news, Monad Labs previously raised a $19 million seed funding round in early 2023, led by Dragonfly Capital.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is winning the payments race, global investment firm AllianceBernstein declared today.\n\nFirm analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a Tuesday note that stablecoin use was growing again during the current bull market.\n\nSolana, the blockchain behind the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency, SOL, is leading the charge among stablecoins that are being used for cross-border payments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe big change this cycle has been the dominant market share of Solana (43% highest share) in value of stablecoins transferred vs. prior cycle market leader Ethereum,\u201d the report read.\n\nData from crypto data platform Artemis shows that as of yesterday, Solana\u2019s market share of stablecoins transferred stood at $63.6 billion of the $116.7 billion total. Ethereum came in second with $26.6 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum still wins in terms of actual stablecoins on its blockchain by market cap\u2014but a lot of that capital is not being used.\n\nThe Bernstein report added that despite Solana\u2019s growth and overtaking Ethereum\u2019s market share for value transferred, the project still has a long way to go\u2014especially when it comes to scalability.\n\n\u201cFurther, scalability requirement for consumer payments would require 15-20 fold growth from here,\u201d the Bernstein analysts noted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite Solana being a fast blockchain, it has struggled with congestion issues as of late. Increasing user activity is putting strain on the network, and stakeholders are pondering on what to do to improve its usability.\n\nStablecoins are used in the crypto ecosystem to move around funds without the risk of them suddenly dropping or going up in value\u2014like assets Bitcoin and Ethereum do. Such coins and tokens are backed by something stable like the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies.\n\nThey run on a number of different blockchains: Ethereum, Tron, and Solana, being examples.\n\nSolana became hot again last year after payments giant Visa said it would use the blockchain\u2019s tech to speed up credit card payments. Then, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain.\n\nThis is likely why Solana is taking up so much of the market share of stablecoins moving around the crypto ecosystem compared to Ethereum.\n\nBut despite being used by the big names, the blockchain still hasn\u2019t broken into more mainstream consumer or B2B payments, the analysts noted.\n\nSome in the industry expected Solana to crash and burn because it was favored by convicted crypto criminal Sam Bankman-Fried and his now-collapsed FTX empire.\n\nBut the opposite happened and its market cap grew\u2014bringing SOL\u2019s price with it. The price of SOL now stands at $174.52, according to CoinGecko. It is still over 33% below its November 2021 all-time high of $259.96.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Transitioning to Proof-of-Stake\n\n\n\nChallenges and Uncertainties for Web3\n\n\n\nThe Decentralization Dilemma\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead: A Web3 Future in Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nBlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has been quoted today in the media stating that even if Ethereum (ETH) is classified as a security, a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) might still be possible. The recent launch of several Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) was a positive step for the crypto industry, offering investors a clearer path to participate in the virtual digital asset class. This regulatory progress has fueled optimism within the crypto space, with many anticipating a similar green light for Ethereum ETFs in the near future.The success of Bitcoin ETFs, alongside the ongoing price rally, has undeniably instilled a sense of excitement about the potential of Ethereum and the broader blockchain landscape.Amidst these, the recent media reports about SEC reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH) \u2019s potential classification as a security, raises critical questions about the impact on Web3, the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem built on Ethereum's blockchain technology.Ethereum, conceived by the visionary Vitalik Buterin in 2013, introduced a revolutionary concept: a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its impact has been profound, fueling the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and a myriad of other innovations that comprise the Web3 industry.Previously Ethereum relied on a proof-of-work system to secure its network. Like in Bitcoin, in Ethereum computers competed to solve complex puzzles, with the winner earning newly minted Ethereum tokens. Every time a transaction is carried out on the Ethereum platform, one has to pay a gas fee or a transaction fee, irrespective of what the nature of that transaction might be. The gas fees previously were high, going up to $150 per transaction.To solve this problem and after years of testing to replace energy-intensive mining, Ethereum switched on its proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022. The new proof-of-stake system eliminated this competition. Instead, users \"stake\" their existing Ethereum holdings to validate transactions and earn rewards. This shift is estimated to have reduced Ethereum's energy consumption significantly. The ecosystem carried out another upgradation recently, called the Dencun upgrade, as a result of which transaction fees are expected to plummet to almost zero. Dencun achieves this by reducing rollup fees through the introduction of \"blobs,\" larger data packets that enable more efficient handling and storage of transaction-related information.Does staking constitute an investment contract, a key characteristic of a security?Since the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, a debate among regulators and industry experts has sparked: could Ethereum's new model classify it as a security? The US SEC, for instance, in the past suggested this model could grant excessive control to the network's developers, potentially undermining its core tenet of decentralization.The potential classification of Ethereum as a security could have significant ramifications for the Web3 industry, raising critical questions about decentralization, regulation, and accessibility. It might lead to overly broad regulations, potentially impacting trading platforms, investor participation, and the overall market dynamics within the crypto space.Ethereum is the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects. These applications, ranging from DeFi to NFTs rely heavily on Ethereum's Layer2 Of late, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi ecosystem has experienced a significant resurgence, reaching a milestone of $100 billion, Ethereum leads the space with over 60% market share.A security designation for Ethereum could create regulatory hurdles for dApps built on its network, potentially stifling innovation and growth within the Web3 space.Decentralization is a core principle of Web3, aiming to create a more transparent and user-controlled internet experience. However, the SEC's potential classification of Ethereum as a security could centralize control, as exchanges may delist the asset or restrict trading for certain investors.The inherent decentralization of Ethereum, or for that matter any blockchain, presents a significant challenge to the potential enforcement of any forthcoming regulations. The ability of the SEC, or any national regulatory body, to effectively implement restrictions would be limited by the global nature of the crypto market.The ramifications extend beyond Ethereum itself, encompassing the broader crypto space. If Ethereum is classified as a security, it sets a precedent that could potentially impact other blockchains operating on similar principles.Currently, DeFi boasts 15 million daily transacting users, a number projected to surge to 100 million by 2025. The prospect of mass adoption of blockchain technology looms large, and the recent upgrades in Ethereum network were certain to incentivize developers to build even more innovative use cases. While regulations aim to protect investors, and rightly so, finding a balance between investor protection and fostering innovation will be crucial.As we confront these questions, one thing remains clear: navigating a new and innovative space like Web3 requires ongoing collaboration and a commitment to fostering responsible growth. Ethereum holds a significant place in the broader decentralized ecosystem and any such regulatory decision will have profound implications for the future of Web3 and shaping the next chapter of the digital revolution.(The author is Co-Founder, CoinDCX & Okto)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

        "content": "Amid a broader market recovery, Ethereum has shown strength, pumping over 7% today.\n\nMeanwhile, eco-friendly AI crypto eTukTuk is also outpacing the market, recently crossing the $2.8 million total raised mark.\n\nEthereum Jumps as Analysts Continued Gains\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $3.6K, up 7.6% today as it recovers from last week\u2019s sell-off. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is up by 4.6%, illustrating that ETH has outperformed other cryptos.\n\nHowever, analysts are bullish on the second-largest crypto, anticipating it could continue to surge in the coming months.\n\nETH has largely been overshadowed by SOL this year, up 95%, while SOL is up 787%. However, a recent mishap on Solana due to high network activity has damaged its user experience, with many transactions failing.\n\nAs such, Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap has overtaken Solana\u2019s leading DEX Jupiter in 24-hour trading volume after weeks of Jupiter\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis has impacted Solana\u2019s price performance against Ethereum, as evident on the SOLETH price chart.\n\nSOL\u2019s recent pullback against ETH creates a rejection of its macro resistance level, a bearish sign for SOL but bullish for ETH.\n\nProminent analyst Captain Faibik expects a bullish continuation for Ethereum. He predicts a move toward $4,800 and notes that \u201cEthereum hasn\u2019t hit an all-time high yet,\u201d a nod that Ethereum could catch up to Bitcoin, given that the market leader has already created an ATH this cycle.\n\nSimilarly, Jacob Canfield anticipates Ethereum will outpace Bitcoin on the four-hour chart.\n\n\u201cBTC made a massive push this morning to break range high resistance plus diagonal downtrend. But the real thing to watch is ETH, as it just put in a massive reversal candle on ETHBTC,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReed Carlson also foresees notable upside for Ethereum, noting that it currently trades at \u201cmacro range lows.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analyst also highlights the bullish implications for the broader altcoin market as Ethereum\u2019s price rises, speculating that \u201caltcoins are ready for a strong rally.\u201d\n\nAccording to analysts, one of the most promising emerging altcoins is eTukTuk. It is currently in its presale and could explode following its IEO.\n\nGreen AI Presale eTukTuk Raises $2.8M and Offers 94% Staking APY\n\nPresale cryptocurrency eTukTuk unlocks a new paradigm of innovative transportation, combining blockchain, AI, and electric vehicle technology into one protocol.\n\nWidely anticipated to be the next crypto to explode, analyst Jacob Bury recently dubbed it a \u201cNew 10x potential green AI crypto.\u201d\n\nThe project will strategically place AI-powered electric vehicles and charging stations in developing nations worldwide, starting with Sri Lanka.\n\nIn a display of commitment to its goal, eTukTuk has already partnered with Capital Maharaja Group, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest privately held company.\n\nAdding to its legitimacy, the eTukTuk team is doxxed and consists of well-versed specialists with experience across a slew of industries.\n\nThe project will integrate AI to ensure the efficiency and longevity of its vehicle fleet, helping with route optimization and predictive maintenance.\n\neTukTuk also boasts a Play-to-Earn game, which provides a high-octane way for users to generate rewards while bolstering the $TUK token\u2019s utility.\n\nIn a two-pronged approach to user rewards, the platform offers a staking mechanism, currently providing a 94% APY. However, this will decrease as more tokens are staked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the current presale price is $0.0295, but this will rise throughout the campaign, with the next uptick in two days.\n\nVisit eTukTuk Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin has seen its price jump by 16% since reaching its lowest point. Now, it is near the highest price it has been all year at $0.22. Some people who watch the market think this rise might not last, and the price could fall again.\n\nLooking at the price chart, Dogecoin has been doing quite well lately. It has been staying above $0.179, which is the growth threshold for the asset. If it can stay above this price level, we might see the rally continue, as it coincides with the point at which a reversal begins.\n\nDogecoin's future depends a lot on whether continue keep being interested in it. It has become popular before, especially with the help of social media and some famous people talking about it. But it is difficult to tell if it will keep being popular and if people will start to think it is not just for fun but also useful for other things.\n\nRight now, Dogecoin looks like it might be ready to try for its highest price this year. But people who want to invest should be careful. There are two important price levels \u2013 $0.155 and $0.11 \u2013 that could help stop the price from falling too much. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 59.97, which tells us that there is room for growth, but the fuel for it is yet to be found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum stays relevant\n\nEthereum is getting close to the $3,600 price, which has been tough for it to get past before. This time, Ethereum might just be able to push through.\n\nEthereum's price has gone up and down, testing how strong its support levels are and if the people buying (the bulls) can keep the price going up. The $3,600 mark is important because Ethereum has struggled to get past it before. Now, everyone's watching to see if it can finally do it.\n\nWhen we look at Ethereum's price chart, we can see it is really trying to get over the $3,600 mark. It looks like it is getting ready to make a big move up. There is a sign on the chart that if Ethereum can close above $3,600 solidly, the price might jump up.\n\nThe chart shows us some important prices that have helped Ethereum to not fall too much. One is at $3,474, and an even bigger one is at $3,056, which is where the 50-day moving average is. These prices are like a trampoline for Ethereum \u2014 they could help it bounce higher.\n\nWhat happens next for Ethereum might depend on if it can keep up the good work and get over the $3,600 hump. If it does, it could mean the start of a time when the price goes up even more.\n\nSolana stands out\n\nSolana is drawing attention for the wrong reasons. While other cryptocurrencies are gaining value, Solana's price is dropping. This is surprising to many because the overall mood in crypto is quite positive.\n\nPeople are now trying to understand why Solana is falling behind, and it looks like some technical problems with the network are to blame. These issues are causing transactions to fail because of too much traffic, and this has caused the outflow from the network.\n\nWhen we look at Solana's price chart, we notice that its value is around $184.02, which is lower than it has been at recently. This decrease might be related to worries about the network's transaction issues. These concerns have led to some uncertainty about when Solana will be able to sort out these troubles."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies Other Than Bitcoin to Buy Ahead of the Halving - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum and Solana stand out as potential cryptos that could soar in value after the Bitcoin halving.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin (BTC -1.80%) halving just two weeks away, crypto investors are lining up to buy Bitcoin. This makes sense, given the historical correlation between halving events -- when the reward for mining the crypto is cut in half -- and Bitcoin price gains. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen in 2024.\n\nSo, buying Bitcoin ahead of the halving is basically a no-brainer at this point. But are there other cryptocurrencies that could also see a price spike after the halving? By analyzing a few key metrics, it's possible to come up with a short list of potential investment prospects. Let's dig in.\n\nFavorites of institutional investors\n\nGiven that there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, we need a quick, easy way to narrow down potential investment targets to a short list of high-quality names. As a general rule of thumb, we're looking for cryptos that are seeing strong interest from institutional investors.\n\nThe good news is that it is possible to narrow the list of potential investment targets significantly since most institutional investors are not interested in cryptos with less than a $2 billion market cap. That shrinks the list of 20,000 potential cryptocurrencies to a pool of about 50. While not all of these cryptos may be household names, they all have significant upside potential if institutional investors decide to load up on them.\n\nWe can go one step further by looking at where institutional investors are actually moving their money. CoinShares, for example, produces a Weekly Crypto Asset Flows report showing inflows and outflows for the top cryptocurrencies. Since the flows are tracked weekly, monthly, and year to date, it's possible to see which cryptos are gaining or losing momentum with investors.\n\nBased on the most recent CoinShares numbers, only five cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin seem to be garnering any sort of interest this year: Ethereum (ETH -1.33%), Solana (SOL 0.14%), Litecoin (LTC -1.57%), XRP (XRP 4.62%), and Polkadot (DOT -2.28%). You can think of these as the five favorites of institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin correlations\n\nNext up, we'll want to look at a cryptocurrency correlations matrix to see which of these five cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with Bitcoin. The logic here is simple: If we expect the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket after the halving, then we want cryptocurrencies that can go along for the ride and capture the maximum potential upside. The higher the correlation, the more upside they should be able to capture.\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies are correlated with Bitcoin to some degree, given that they are all part of the same asset class, some have historically shown very high correlations. Of our potential list of five cryptocurrencies, three particularly stand out: Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. For example, Ethereum has a 0.82 correlation with Bitcoin, Polkadot has a 0.73 correlation, and Solana has a 0.67 correlation. By way of comparison, XRP has only a 0.44 correlation, while Litecoin has a 0.61 correlation.\n\nAnd the two winners are...\n\nAs a final filter, we'll want to focus on Layer 1 blockchain networks, which are the building blocks of the blockchain world. Of the three remaining cryptos on our list, only Ethereum and Solana make the cut. These two Layer 1 blockchains are well diversified and do a little bit of everything, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming to decentralized finance (DeFi). As such, they are best positioned to benefit from mainstream crypto adoption.\n\nPolkadot, alas, is what crypto enthusiasts refer to as a Layer 0 blockchain -- it's not so much a blockchain to build on top of as it is a sort of connecting glue for other blockchains. I've always viewed Polkadot as a way of hedging your bets if you're confident about the future growth of blockchain technology but not confident enough to actually predict a final winner.\n\nWith that in mind, my two winners are Ethereum and Solana. If you favor stability and a proven track record that extends back to 2015, Ethereum is the clear choice. If you favor innovation potential and long-term future upside, Solana is your pick. Either way, both cryptos should be on your investment radar ahead of the Bitcoin halving."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF approval odds have dropped below 25% in Polymarket.\n\nVijay Boyapati forecasts ETH ETF May rejection could benefit BTC.\n\nThe overall market is leaning toward a possible US spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF applications rejection in May.\n\nAccording to the prediction markets platform, Polymarket, the bets for ETH ETF May approval have dropped 68% and stood at a 24% chance at press time.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who correctly predicted the US spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF approval, have echoed Polymarket\u2019s sentiment.\n\nIn a recent post on X, Seyffart highlighted SEC\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d and \u201cno feedback\u201d to recent ETH ETF filings as \u201cviolence\u201d to clients.\n\n\n\n\u201cEric said \u201cSilence is Violence\u201d on a client call last week in regards to the #ethereum ETFs and I loved it.\u201d\n\nSeyffart was reacting to Balchunas\u2019 statement that SEC wasn\u2019t giving \u201ccritical feedback\u201d even during in-person meetings. This meant that odds for May approval were still low.\n\nWill BTC benefit from Ethereum ETF May rejection?\n\nWith May fast approaching and approval odds seeming elusive, Vijay Boyapati, commentator and author of \u201cThe Bullish Case for Bitcoin,\u201d claimed that,\n\n\u201cAll the hot money that flowed into ETH because of ETF hopium is going to go back into Bitcoin once the Ethereum ETFs are all rejected.\u201d\n\nFor Boyapati\u2019s prediction to happen, ETH market dominance will need to drop considerably as BTC\u2019s surge.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC\u2019s market dominance was 52.4% at the time of writing, mainly due to strong ETF flows in the past three months. ETH\u2019s market dominance stood at 16.5%.\n\nShould Boyapati\u2019s thesis be confirmed, ETH market dominance could slip below 16% or 15% as the market re-adjusts to ETH ETF rejection in May. If so, the capital rotation could induce BTC momentum.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH was above a crucial weekly bearish order block (3.2K\u20143.5K). It was consolidating around the Q1 2022 local top. A slump below 3.2K could cause bears to overwhelm the market, especially if ETH ETF applications are rejected."

        "title": "Ethereum Electra Upgrade: Here Are The 4 Code Changes Embedded - CoinGape",
        "content": "The next consensus layer-focused hardfork coming to Ethereum is the Electra upgrade and developers have been busy reinforcing the upgrade with certain EIPs that offer specific functions. The 4 key EIPs were teased by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim.\n\nEthereum Electra Upgrade Sees Multiple Implementation\n\nThe Ethereum Electra protocol is billed to go live on the testnet very soon. From discussions held during the last All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) bi-weekly meeting spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Researcher Alex Stokes, Ethereum developers are integrating EIP 6110, EIP 7002, EIP 7251 and EIP 7549 into the Electra upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo far, these are the 4 code changes going into Electra \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n-EIP 6110 (Supply validator deposits on chain)\n\n-EIP 7002 (Execution layer triggerable exits)\n\n-EIP 7251 (Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE)\n\n-EIP 7549 (Move committee index outside attestation) pic.twitter.com/XXfYkkvCO2 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) April 9, 2024\n\nEIP 6110 which was created as far back as December 2022, is poised to supply validator deposits on-chain. According to the Ethereum Foundation (EF), \u201cThis EIP allows for an in-protocol mechanism of deposit processing on the Consensus Layer and eliminates the proposer voting mechanism utilized currently.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, the EIP 6110 will contribute to improving Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nEIP 7002 can also be referred to as the Execution layer triggerable exits. It would allow validators to trigger exits via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. There are still considerations from developers to make minor adjustments to this EIP that will equally trigger a change in Engine API.\n\nEIP 7251 is tagged \u201cIncrease the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE\u201d as it aims to allow validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. Noteworthy, EIP 7002 is a prerequisite for this EIP, hence, there are speculations that the implementation of EIP 7002 and 7251 in the same upgrade will trigger some complexities.\n\nDeveloper\u2019s Concern Highlighted\n\nFor EIP 7251, Lighthouse developer \u201cethDreamer\u201d coined two questions of concerns that would need to be addressed before the implementation. First, he is concerned about whether custom ceilings for partial withdrawals for validators with an effective balance greater than 32 ETH will be included.\n\nSecondly, he wants to know if consolidation of validators as a CL or EL-initiated operation should be enabled. Answers to these questions are expected from the next Ethereum developers\u2019 breakout meeting.\n\nEIP 7549 moves the committee index outside of the signed Attestation message. This is one of the most recently created EIPs.\n\n\u201cThis proposal aims to make Casper FFG clients more efficient by reducing the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. While all types of clients can benefit from this EIP, ZK circuits proving Casper FFG consensus are likely to have the most impact,\u201d a statement from EF detailed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is undergoing intense evolution and Electra Upgrade is the next major after Dencun Upgrade which went live on the mainnet earlier this year.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s futures open interest show that the coin will reclaim its all-time high in the mid-term.\n\nIts key indicators also confirmed the rise in bullish sentiment in the coin\u2019s spot market.\n\nLeading coin Ethereum [ETH] may be poised for another significant rally in the mid-term, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted in a new report.\n\nThe report assessed the coin\u2019s futures market and found that despite the general market consolidation in March, ETH\u2019s funding rates have remained positive, and its open interest has continued to climb.\n\nFunding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that the contract price stays close to the spot price.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s contract price is higher than its spot price, traders who hold long positions pay a fee to traders shorting the asset. Funding rates return positive values when this happens.\n\nConversely, when the contract price is lower than the spot price, short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions, leading to negative funding rates.\n\nAccording to the analyst, as ETH attempts to reclaim the $4,000 price mark, there has been a \u201ccorresponding spike in the funding rates metric.\u201d\n\nThe report added,\n\n\u201cThis indicates an aggressive execution of long positions by participants.\u201d\n\nCoinglass data showed that the coin\u2019s funding rate was a positive 0.024% at press time. When an asset\u2019s funding rate is positive and grows, more traders hold long positions. This means more market participants are expecting the asset\u2019s price to rise in the short/mid-term than those anticipating a decline.\n\nRegarding the coin\u2019s futures open interest, its double-digit price rally in the past week has caused this also to grow. Per Coinglass data, ETH\u2019s futures open interest was $15 billion as of this writing. In the last seven days, this had grown by 7%.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cConsidering these metrics, the market appears poised for another significant move in the mid-term, with the potential for long positions to be reinstated in the perpetual market. This suggests a favourable outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory, potentially pushing it towards its all-time high.\u201d\n\nAre the bulls regaining their strength?\n\nMarch was significantly marked by bearish sentiments, which caused ETH\u2019s price to consolidate within a tight range.\n\nHowever, readings from some indicators observed on a 1-day chart showed that the rally in the coin\u2019s price in the last week confirmed that the bulls are now attempting to re-enter the market.\n\nFor example, for the first time since 15th March, ETH\u2019s MACD line rested above its signal line.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s MACD line crosses above its signal line, it suggests that its shorter-term moving average is starting to move upward quicker than its longer-term moving average. This indicates an increase in bullish momentum in the short term.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAlso, ETH\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed that its positive directional index (green) crossed above its negative index (red) on 7th April.\n\nThis confirmed the change in sentiment from bearish to bullish."

        "title": "$70 million in 24 hours: Can Ethereum crack $4,000 thanks to whales? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum has seen significant consecutive increases in the past 48 hours.\n\nWhales have bought over $70 million worth of ETH within 24 hours.\n\nOn 7th April, Ethereum experienced its highest returns for the month. This positive uptrend coincided with a recent increase in the volume bought by certain whales.\n\nAdditionally, it occurred while the network\u2019s overall volume remained relatively stable, with Layer 2 (L2) solutions handling most of the transactions.\n\nEthereum increased by 7%\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum daily timeframe chart revealed that on 7th April, it closed trading with an increase of over 3%, reaching above $3,400. This price trend was notable because Ethereum had experienced significant declines before, making this the first major uptrend observed.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, Ethereum was experiencing an even larger uptrend with over a 4% price increase. The chart indicates that ETH was trading above $3,600 with this recent surge.\n\nObserving the chart, it was noted that the highest point reached this year was around $4,000. Given the current trend, surpassing this record in the coming weeks is possible.\n\nFurthermore, a study of the chart revealed that the price rise effectively reinstated Ethereum into a bull trend. Data from its Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that ETH was now above the neutral zone, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nWhales mop up more Ethereum\n\nAs the Ethereum price continues upward, recent data showed increased buying activity from certain whales. According to Spot on Chain, within the last 24 hours, two whales collectively spent over $35 million to purchase ETH.\n\nSpecifically, these whales acquired 10,322 ETH at an average price of around $3,400.\n\nAdditionally, as the price climbed to approximately $3,455, two more whales withdrew 11,657 ETH, valued at over $40 million, from an exchange. This movement by the whales suggests heightened accumulation, likely in anticipation of further price appreciation.\n\nMore cash flows into ETH\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum Open Interest trend on Coinglass indicates a recent decline over the past few days. However, there was a slight uptick at the time of writing, with over $13.3 billion in open interest observed.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis suggests that more capital was flowing into Ethereum, potentially acting as a catalyst for further price increases.\n\nWhen considering the current behavior of whales and the uptick in Open Interest, key metrics display positive signs, indicating that a new price level may be imminent."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Price Correction Might Not Sustain As Accumulation Increases! Here\u2019s The Next ETH Price Level - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "As Bitcoin again gained momentum ahead of the halving event, the market is facing increased accumulation from whale investors. As a result, Ethereum has triggered notable surges as it regained its buying demand. Interestingly, several on-chain metrics for ETH have now turned bullish and are defending the ongoing correction on the price chart, aiming to send the ETH price toward resistance channels.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Defends Price Correction\n\nAfter the BTC price rallied toward $72K, Ethereum witnessed its price surpassing the $3.7K level in no time, resulting in a massive short-liquidation. However, since the Dencun Upgrade in mid-March, Ethereum\u2019s price has struggled to climb back over the $4,000 mark, facing a sharp sell-off.\n\nHowever, with the Bitcoin halving event approaching in less than 10 days, Ethereum traders are showing a notable uptick in leverage use. On April 8, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a 7% increase, sending the leverage ratio to 0.29%, a peak not seen in the past 45 trading days since February 25. This surge in leverage during an uptrend indicates that traders are increasingly borrowing to enhance their positions, betting on Ethereum\u2019s continued rise.\n\nIn the past few hours, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been dropping significantly. Coinglass reports that there has been nearly $21 million worth of long liquidations in the last four hours alone. Despite the drop, there\u2019s a noticeable increase in accumulation from holders as data from IntoTheBlock indicates that the Netflow metric dipped into the negative region, reaching -17.75K ETH. This suggests that more ETH is being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, particularly after the price of ETH surged above $3,600.\n\nThis behavior is somewhat unusual during a surge, as holders typically deposit more ETH when they intend to sell, rather than withdrawing it. However, this could potentially strengthen the support levels for ETH\u2019s price, making it challenging for sellers to plunge the price.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nBulls failed to hold the price above $3,700 level as sellers defended the resistance level strongly and plunged the price below immediate Fib channels. ETH price is currently declining heavily and is aiming for a retest of the $3,400 level. As of writing, ETH price is trading at $3,506, declining over 3.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe ETH/USDT pair has dropped below the crucial mark of $3,500, warranting close attention. Should sellers successfully hold the price below this barrier, the pair may gain bearish momentum, potentially rallying towards $3,200-$3,300. However, anticipation persists for a bullish comeback at this level as a rebound above the EMA trend line might send the price to retest $3,700.\n\nIf ETH price successfully breaks above $3,700, it will trigger increased purchasing power, resulting in a jump toward $4K. A successful consolidation might strengthen confidence, resulting in further surges for ETH price toward $4,500."
