        "title": "Danksharding and Proto-danksharding Explained - Ledger",
        "content": "Danksharding and Proto-danksharding Explained\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 The Ethereum network is working towards improving its scalability, as blockchain apps are heavy to run which slows down transaction times.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Danksharding aims to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issue but introducing it will take several upgrades.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, lays the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s future by introducing a new type of transaction and a way to store temporary data.\n\nIf you know anything about the Ethereum network, you probably know that it\u2019s the hub for decentralized applications (dApps) accessible through an Ethereum wallet due to its capability to host smart contracts. Ethereum is still the most popular network for blockchain apps today, and as such this puts the network under huge amounts of pressure. Unfortunately, hosting so many platforms, protocols, apps and tokens slows down its transaction finality and causes exorbitant fees.\n\nTo combat this scalability issue, the Ethereum roadmap includes several upgrades. With the Merge, Ethereum became a proof-of-stake chain, greatly reducing its power consumption and opening the door to innovations only possible on PoS networks. But to achieve cheaper and faster transactions, Ethereum still has a way to go.\n\nOne plan for the network was to implement sharding, a way to reduce network congestion and fees by splitting the massive Ethereum blockchain into smaller partitions. But the current solution it has found is danksharding: a way to make transactions much quicker and cheaper than they are currently.\n\nHowever, upgrading the Ethereum network isn\u2019t easy. Its high network activity and the sheer number of apps relying on the network means big updates to the network\u2019s consensus can take months or even years to implement. As such, it needs a custom solution. Enter proto-danksharding: it\u2019s essentially a step between Ethereum as you know it today and its danksharding future.\n\nBut before we get into the details, what is danksharding in the first place? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nWhat Is Danksharding?\n\nDanksharding introduces a way to communicate with existing Ethereum layer two solutions, which is much easier to implement than sharding the whole Ethereum network. It also introduces a way to process more data per block, allowing for more complex transactions without slowing down the network or raising its gas fees.\n\nEssentially, it\u2019s all about making blockchain rollups more efficient.\n\nTo understand how it works, let\u2019s first dive into how blockchain rollups interact with the Ethereum blockchain currently. Today, rollups batch and process Ethereum transactions on their Layer 2 chain, then transmit a \u201cvalidity proof\u201d on the Ethereum main chain. While this method does save costs, over 90% of rollup transaction costs still go directly to the Ethereum mainnet for posting that proof.\n\nDanksharding will allow the Ethereum network to process these bundled transactions from layer two rollups without storing all of their data immutably. This essentially means the Ethereum mainnet is less burdened by data in the long term.\n\nWhat Is Proto-danksharding (EIP-4844)?\n\nProto-danksharding is a proposal, which when implemented, would provide the foundations to introduce danksharding to the Ethereum network. The concept was proposed in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), and named after Ethereum researchers Dankrad Feist and Proto Lambda. Soon, EIP-4844 is due to be implemented as part of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade scheduled for March 13th, 2024.\n\nHow Does Proto-danksharding Work?\n\nIn preparation for danksharding, proto-danksharding introduces a new transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d and its associated data type \u2014 \u201cblobs\u201d. Essentially, these two features allow the Ethereum network to process data from blockchain rollups more effectively. Let\u2019s see how they work:\n\nWhat Are Blobs (Binary Large Objects)?\n\nBinary Large Objects (blobs) are a temporary store of data. Although new to the Ethereum network, blobs are already common in computer science. You can see them across programming languages like Javascript and Python.\n\nTo understand their significance in crypto though, it\u2019s important to know that Ethereum currently stores all of its data on every node in the network\u2014and this data lasts forever. It does this using its persistent memory store, calldata, however, this method of storing data is heavy on the system, and it\u2019s also very expensive.\n\nBlobs, on the other hand, are cheaper to maintain since they have an expiry date of 4096 epochs, (approximately 18 days). This drastically reduces their storage cost. Each blob can store up to 128 kb of data, and each block can contain up to 16 data blobs. This is a lot of data storage available for more temporary means. In the long run, it means the Ethereum network is storing less data per block.\n\nWhat Are Blob-Carrying Transactions?\n\nBlob-carrying transactions are a new type of transaction on the Ethereum network designed specifically for handling blobs. Essentially, they carry a validity proof which allows the Ethereum chain to verify their authenticity without reading the blob itself.\n\nTo do this, it uses a mechanism named a KZG commitment scheme. Using Zero-Knowledge proofs, the mechanism guarantees the EVM can view a commitment to a blob, but not the blob data itself. Blob-carrying transactions have their own mempool separate from the EVM. This keeps data safe while optimizing block space.\n\nAnd of course, as a new type of transaction, there\u2019s a new fee mechanism to match. Derived from EIP-1559, the pricing structure for blob-carrying transactions is dynamic; based on supply and demand. Typically, more than three blobs per transaction cause higher fees, varying by approximately 12.5% from block to block.\n\nPros of Danksharding\n\nReducing Transaction (Gas) Fees\n\nThe first benefit of danksharding is reduced transaction fees. To explain, high gas fees on the Ethereum network are primarily caused by network congestion. This can occur when there are huge numbers of people accessing blockchain apps and platforms on the Ethereum network. And, as you know, Ethereum is the home of the majority of dApps, meaning network congestion is a frequent issue users face. By allowing the network to process rollups more easily, danksharding will help Ethereum avoid congestion. This will improve gas fees on the wider Ethereum network\u2014not just using a layer two chain.\n\nFaster Transactions\n\nAnother benefit of danksharding is that it allows Ethereum to process transactions much faster than was previously possible. By introducing a way to store data temporarily, it helps the network\u2019s nodes. Previously, each node would store an entire copy of the blockchain\u2019s history which is a heavy burden. With danksharding, the nodes store and process much less data, allowing them to work more efficiently. This means that your transactions become much faster.\n\nCons of Danksharding\n\nSecurity\n\nWhile danksharding may be the answer to Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns, there are some concerns about its security.\n\nWhile this method is much easier to implement on the network than the previous plan, sharding, Danksharding involves validating blob-carrying transactions off-chain. This is a security risk, as less popular rollups may become targets for bad actors. To explain, the smaller and less experienced the chain, the easier it is to attack. This could mean that blob-carrying transactions from malicious sources could end up on the Ethereum mainnet. While rollups have security measures to defend against this, they are not as robust as the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Future of Proto-Danksharding\n\nAs the largest smart contract blockchain, Ethereum has faced significant challenges in scaling its infrastructure to meet the growing demand. However, ongoing scaling efforts such as sharding and the Ethereum Dencun upgrade represent promising steps toward improving the network\u2019s capacity and performance.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade, which includes proto-danksharding, went live on the Goerli testnet on Jan 17th, 2024. The final test on Holesky testnet concluded successfully in Feb 2024, and in theory, it will go live at on March 13th.\n\nHowever, remember: it might be a while before the Ethereum mainnet integrates danksharding itself. The future of the Ethereum chain likely lies in blockchain rollups, and danksharding is just one way it is accommodating that potential."

        "content": "COTI\u2019s privacy-focused Ethereum L2 development reached a critical milestone by successfully integrating its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol. Its token price surged approximately 55% following this technical achievement.\n\nMPC is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows several parties to work together on a computation using their private data without revealing that data to each other. COTI confirms that the successful implementation of the MPC protocol represents the first in a series of technical goals they will meet before COTI V2 is fully deployed.\n\nCOTI V2 architecture and MPC integration.\n\nCOTI V2 architecture hinges on MPC technology, ensuring the privacy of its Layer 2 computations on Ethereum over private inputs executed without compromising data confidentiality. Participants supply encrypted data to an MPC\u2019 black box\u2019, which executes specific computational processes. MPC results are delivered in a way that safeguards data integrity throughout, even amidst potential external scrutiny. Each MPC entity, dubbed an \u201cMPC endpoint,\u201d will later integrate into the project\u2019s custom Extended-EVM execution module.\n\nMPC endpoints facilitate collaborative computation without sacrificing data privacy. This advancement significantly improves EVM functionality, unlocking support for more diverse dApps within a framework offering transparency alongside essential privacy capabilities. This integrated MPC architecture provides greater privacy and security for complex computations on-chain, potentially fueling wider adoption of Ethereum technology as use cases expand.\n\nTo facilitate MPC use, users first establish cryptographic key material. Next, data is submitted in encrypted form for safe storage. Users then submit workloads in secure MPC bytecode, with operations like addition and multiplication taking place on confidential data without exposing those original values. Workloads can generate public outputs or outputs specifically encrypted to remain accessible only to chosen users.\n\nTesting and future plan.\n\nPer COTI, a simulated state was tested within MPC modules as they collaboratively generated a \u2018garbled circuit.\u2019 This cryptographic concept represents a specific computational function and has inherent security, being inherently single-use. This provides forward and backward secrecy through design.\n\nThis first development milestone includes completing the protocol, including design and algorithms. Importantly, COTI developers demonstrated the capability to securely input and output data using distributed keys, enabling advanced encryption and decryption functions without compromise.\n\nThe achievement of this privacy-focused landmark emphasizes the progress towards COTI\u2019s ambitious Layer 2 solution. A COTI blog post states,\n\n\u201cThe creation and implementation of a secure MPC protocol is the first of many development milestones we\u2019ll reach throughout the year. Stay tuned for further COTI V2 updates as development continues.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEstablished token standards for Ethereum include fungible ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs). Now an experimental and unofficial new token standard, ERC-404, aims to combine elements of both into a single \"semi-fungible\" digital asset.\n\nWhat is ERC-404?\n\nERC-404 is a new token standard for digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain developed by pseudonymous creators \"ctrl\" and \"Acme.\"\n\nToken standards are formal sets of rules and protocols that determine the behavior of tokens on blockchain networks such as Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ERC-404 token standard combines features of ERC-20 and ERC-721, enabling the creation of \"semi-fungible\" tokens that employ features from fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\nHow does ERC-404 work?\n\nNFTs are non-fungible, meaning that they are unique and indivisible; you can't own fractions of an NFT.\n\nERC-404 circumvents this limitation by using token mint and burn mechanics to enable fractional transfers of an NFT.\n\nIssued tokens are linked to an NFT. If you buy a full token, the linked NFT is minted to your wallet. If you sell a fraction of the token, the linked NFT is burned. If a wallet holding fractions of a token purchases enough fractions to hold a complete token, a new NFT is minted automatically.\n\nWhat's so special about it?\n\nThe ERC-404 token standard enables native fractionalization of NFTs, creating new primitives and new mechanics built atop them. This, in turn, allows for experimentation with NFTs and the trading of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe token standard's creators suggest that the goal is to create an NFT with \"native fractionalization, liquidity and encourages some aspects of trading/engagement to farm unique trait sets.\"\n\nThe team behind Pandora, a project using ERC-404, claims that it effectively enables NFTs built using the standard to \"effectively have a token price that reflects a floor price in real-time\" because it allows for \"actual native liquidity.\" Rather than needing a single counterparty to buy their NFT, holders of ERC-404 tokens can sell at a time of their choosing if there's a liquidity pool.\n\nFurthermore, instead of having to lock up or wrap NFTs and issue shares against them, fractionalization of NFTs can be achieved natively without relying on third-party protocols and solutions.\n\nAnother possible use case suggested by the Pandora team is gaming NFTs that incorporate randomization into the destroying and reminting of NFTs.\n\nERC-404 projects\n\nPandora: Pandora is one of the first projects to employ the ERC-404 token standard. It comprises 10,000 PANDORA ERC-20 tokens and 10,000 linked \"Replicant\" NFTs.

That means it hasn't been submitted for review as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) or undergone a full external audit. This means it could have undiscovered flaws, introducing a significant risk to token holders.\n\nThe team states that, \"While these two standards are not designed to be mixed, this implementation strives to do so in as robust a manner as possible while minimizing tradeoffs,\" though they concede it is a \"non-standard\" implementation of ERC-721.\n\nBecause ERC-404 is an unofficial token standard, many NFT platforms and marketplaces do not support it by default\n\nThe team behind the token standard plan to submit it as an official Ethereum Improvement Proposal, a potentially lengthy process. However, their decision to circumvent the standard approval process for token standards could encourage other projects to do the same\u2014which could lead to more unaudited token standards going to market, with the attendant risks to users that entails.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Top 9 smart contract platforms to consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts let users write executable code that encodes business logic and runs on a blockchain or other type of decentralized ledger. Depending on your goals, there are many ways to use smart contract platforms to push these powerful apps into production.\n\n\"Smart contract platforms are decentralized systems that enable self-executing contracts on a blockchain,\" said Sanjiv Maewall, CTO of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte Consulting. These platforms support secure, transparent and tamper-proof execution of predefined conditions, according to Maewall, which makes them ideal for trustless applications such as finance, supply chain management and voting systems.\n\nThere are four main kinds of smart contract platforms: large blockchain platforms; smaller ones optimized for improving smart contract execution speed or cost; private smart contract frameworks; and specialized tools for crafting and managing smart contracts across trusted partners.\n\nThese tools were selected based on their prominence across the various smart contract platforms; conversations with industry experts; and, in the case of the public smart contract platforms, their market cap and trading volume.\n\nWhat are smart contract platforms, and how do they work? Before diving deeper into the different types of smart contract platforms, it's helpful to define what a smart contract is and what it does. Lata Varghese, digital assets and blockchain practice leader at Protiviti, said she likes to think of a smart contract as \"a digital form of a traditional contract where contractual agreements between counterparties are inscribed as a piece of code.\" A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required by an agreement when predetermined terms and conditions are met. It ensures trust between the involved parties without needing a central authority. A smart contract platform is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that lets users create and execute smart contracts. A blockchain is not in and of itself a smart contract platform. Developers must extend it with tools to store smart contract code in a secure and tamper-proof form. They also add tools that enable decentralized and autonomous execution of smart contract code correctly, securely, transparently and deterministically. It's also important for the state transition from smart contract code execution to be verified by consensus of the nodes in the blockchain network before recording the state change in the blockchain ledger. The blockchain-based cryptocurrency Bitcoin supported the first digital, permissionless and tamper-proof smart contract, but it was of limited scope. Varghese said the major breakthrough came when the developers of the Ethereum blockchain added support for programmable smart contracts. They also introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as the computation engine that manages the state of the blockchain and enables smart contract functionality. \"Ethereum continues to be the most popular platform for smart contracts due to its highly decentralized security as well as a large community support,\" Varghese said. One caution for enterprise users is that smart contracts are not legally binding. Within the Web3 community, the term is used differently than enterprises looking to automate contract processes in a traditional sense. In parallel, lawyers and governments are developing frameworks for what are called smart legal contracts, which might or might not use decentralized ledger technology. Automated procurement platforms, such as SAP Ariba and B2B marketplace platforms, can sometimes be used to automate contractual processes through ERP integrations. Contract lifecycle management platforms (CLMs), such as the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, are also exploring ways to integrate smart legal contracts into enterprise workflows.\n\nLayers and levels of smart contract platforms Several blockchain technology platforms have been used for executing smart contracts. They're usually characterized as Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) platforms. L1 platforms are blockchains on which smart contracts are executed directly on the main core platform. Prominent examples are Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and BNB Smart Chain. L2 platforms execute the smart contracts on a parallel space so they can run more efficiently and quickly; they then roll up changes to the core platform. Examples of L2 platforms include Ethereum ZK-Rollups, Ethereum Optimistic Rollups and Polygon. Many of the newer offerings support both L1 and L2 capabilities. \"There is continuous innovation occurring in these technology platforms to address blockchain scalability challenges and become the platform of choice to build Web 3.0 applications,\" Varghese said, referring to the future blockchain-based generation of the web, often called Web3. The newer blockchain platforms almost uniformly have support for smart contracts, she said, and many are EVM compatible. That means a decentralized application (DApp) that runs on Ethereum can also run on them. Other prominent platforms Varghese has explored include Avalanche, Tezos, Algorand, Polygon, Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron, Near and Cardano. In addition, some blockchain platforms, such as Avalanche, Cosmos and Polkadot, are being adapted for private, permissioned smart contract implementations. Several smart contract platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and Hyperledger Besu have supported enterprise blockchain implementations for at least five years. Purchasers should investigate a platform's protections against these smart contract security risks.\n\nKey factors to consider in a smart contract platform When choosing a smart contract platform, Maewall suggested examining a platform's security features, track record, scalability potential, performance, cost and strength of the associated developer community. \"Each platform has its unique offerings and tradeoffs, so choose one that best aligns with your project's requirements,\" he said. These platform elements also come with compromises. For example, Ethereum has the strongest developer community, but it also has the highest cost per transaction -- called gas in the blockchain community -- Maewall said. Similarly, some platforms are Turing complete. They can simulate every function of a Turing machine, a mathematical model of computation, which means users can write more expressive applications. But this flexibility comes at the expense of security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.\n\nUnderstanding the different approaches In some ways, smart contract infrastructure is comparable to that of cloud computing, which has many nested and sometimes overlapping platforms. On one level are the large infrastructure platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The application software layer includes Salesforce, ServiceNow and other platforms. In addition, private clouds enable enterprises to deploy workloads running on Docker containers that can move across public and private cloud infrastructure. Similarly, in the smart contract arena, Ethereum is like AWS before Microsoft and Google came along. Several newer competitors, including Cardano, Solana and Tron, provide alternatives to Ethereum. Another tier of platforms that includes Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Tezos mimics private cloud infrastructure. Development management platforms, such as Kaleido and Casper Labs, are designed to make it easier for partners to create and manage their own smart contract infrastructure. Additionally, CLM platform vendors are extending their tooling to support smart legal contract development management capabilities that span decentralized ledger and CLM capabilities, such as DocuSign Smart Agreements. There are nuances in how the various platforms approach the problem of smart contract development and deployment. For example, apps might run on EVMs, low-level VMs, Docker containers or other infrastructure. It's also important to consider your reasons for building decentralized apps before choosing a smart contract platform. Differences in platform features and capabilities can determine what an app can do and what users can accomplish by using it. For example, platforms such as Ethereum and Solana make it easier to incentivize infrastructure creation with cryptocurrency tokens. However, private trading partners might be happy to build or rent their own infrastructure. They are more motivated to streamline transactions and improve transparency. Much like in the cloud industry, there are dozens of smart contract platforms, and the field is evolving rapidly. Rather than surveying all of them, it's more helpful to focus on the top categories and the biggest or most interesting players. With this in mind, let's look at some of the top smart contract platforms across key categories.\n\nTop tier Ethereum Ethereum pioneered flexible smart contracts when it was launched in 2013. It supports Solidity, a variant of the JavaScript programming language that was immediately accessible to front-end developers and quickly grew a massive base of developers and financial supporters. Ethereum also pioneered the EVM, which has become a standard for other smart contract platforms. Ethereum's stock market capitalization is far and wide above competitors. In early 2024, it was $277 billion -- several times more than all the other smart contract platforms combined. The main benefit of a large market cap is that successful smart contract apps have the potential to grow faster in a much larger virtual economy. Ethereum is the top choice for developers who want to game the largest smart contract ecosystem with a bright new idea. Some observers say Ethereum's performance is not as fast as some of the upstarts. Smart contract mistakes can be expensive and difficult to unwind; in some cases, this can require a fork, a usually temporary split in the Ethereum network to allow major technical upgrades or changes. The blockchain has also been undergoing a constant pace of forks, merges and upgrades. The Shanghai upgrade in mid-2023, called Shapella, supported a more efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and faster transaction processing.\n\nSecond generation The success of Ethereum smart contracts revealed some fundamental disadvantages of the platform. For one thing, it's not particularly fast compared to modern transaction processing infrastructure -- a few dozen transactions per second compared to 24,000 for the Visa payment network. Hackers also discovered new security bugs in Ethereum smart contracts that were difficult to resolve. For example, a hack of the first Ethereum distributed autonomous organization, a type of management structure built on a smart contract, resulted in the DAO losing a third of its value. Eventually, Ethereum was hard forked -- permanently split in two -- to undo some of the damage. A second generation of open blockchain networks has sprung up to address such shortcomings. BNB Smart Chain The BNB Smart Chain is built on the BNB coin. It was previously the Binance Coin by Binance and was migrated to a separate Smart Chain in 2019 to create a native coin. In early 2024, the BNB coin had a market cap of about $47 billion. The platform supports a proof-of-stake authority consensus mechanism architected to optimize speed and keep transaction costs low. The network currently supports a million daily users and more than 2,000 active DApps. It is also popular among the gaming community, with over 287,000 weekly active gamers. The platform supports several popular development languages, including Solidity, Go, Java and Swift. One potential concern for developers is that Binance, the company behind the chain, has suffered legal problems that could impact the rollout of smart contract apps in the U.S. In November 2023, Binance pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and agreed to pay over $4 billion in fines. Solana The Solana blockchain ecosystem has recently grown to be the third largest public smart contract platform with a market cap of about $44 billion as of early 2024. Some experts consider it more efficient than Ethereum and many other public blockchains. Factors contributing to the speed include support for a low-level virtual machine for deploying smart contracts as well as the use of C and Rust programming languages for writing them. That makes it a good bet for developers looking to combine high transaction rates with the economic opportunities available on a public blockchain. Cardano Cardano was introduced as a more energy-efficient alternative to Ethereum in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, who also helped start Ethereum. In 2021, it introduced its Plutus feature for building smart contracts. The community has also created several programming languages for creating smart contracts on Cardano, including Marlowe, Aiken, OpShin and plu-ts. Cardano is a newer platform with less functionality and fewer developers than others on this list. However, it has the fourth-largest market cap at about $19 billion, making it an interesting option for developers who want to take advantage of a large token economy outside of Ethereum.\n\nPrivate blockchains Private blockchains are similar to open source cloud development platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift and Cloudify but for smart contracts. The code itself is open source; a variety of expert service firms provision it on private hardware in data centers or on top of cloud services. Private blockchains are a good fit for businesses and government organizations that want to streamline transactions between trusted partners. They're a good choice for improving the efficiency of things enterprises already do, with mechanisms to update contracts or roll back transactions when problems are discovered. The most common use of private blockchains is scaling trust across enterprise boundaries. Hyperledger Fabric IBM developed Hyperledger Fabric and then handed it off to the Linux Foundation to create an enterprise-grade blockchain platform with modular architecture and various consensus mechanisms. It enables fine-grained control of data visibility and confidentiality so only authorized people can access data. It also supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Go and Java, and is designed to handle high transaction volumes. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain network. That means only authorized individuals or devices can participate in transactions, which is important from a trust, compliance and regulatory perspective. Corda Corda was created to model and automate real-world transactions in a legally enforceable way. Private channels let participants transact directly to improve the confidentiality of transactions. Numerous integrations have been built for the finance, healthcare and supply chain industries."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ERC-404 is a new token standard that has taken the market by storm.\n\nThe new experimental standard combines the best of fungible and non-fungible tokens standards, ERC-20 and ERC-721, respectively.\n\nPandora, the first token that uses ERC-404, has skyrocketed 5.400% since its launch on February 2.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has remained lull despite the Ether ETF applications. But the launch of ERC-404 could be a key catalyst that kickstarts a rally for ETH.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price poised for gains as Dencun upgrade goes live on the testnet\n\nWhat is ERC-404?\n\nERC-404 is an experimental token standard built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to combine the functionalities of ERC-20 tokens (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 tokens (non-fungible tokens, or NFTs) into a single standard. This means that ERC-404 tokens can be both fungible and non-fungible, depending on the specific implementation.\n\nIn a nutshell, ERC-404 is a new way of defining digital assets like tokens or collectibles on the internet.\n\nERC-404 key features breakdown:\n\nHybrid functionality: ERC-404 tokens can represent both fungible and non-fungible assets, offering flexibility for various use cases.\n\nNative liquidity: Unlike traditional NFTs, ERC-404 tokens have built-in liquidity mechanisms, allowing for easier trading and fractional ownership.\n\nProgrammable scarcity: The supply of ERC-404 tokens can be dynamically adjusted through code, enabling innovative tokenomics models.\n\nHow does ERC-404 work?\n\nOne NFT of the underlying project is awarded to the wallet that has a full ERC-404 token. When the token is sold, the NFT is automatically burned. Both the tokens and NFTs can be traded independently.\n\nIs ERC-404 safe?\n\nERC-404 is not vetted, hence an experimental standard. Its development has not followed the traditional route \u2013 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIPs). Additionally, it has not undergone a full external audit, but it has been tested extensively.\n\nThe only similarity ERC-404 and other ERC standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721 share is the name \u201cERC,\u201d which stands for Ethereum Request for Comments.\n\nProjects using ERC-404 token standard\n\nPandora and DeFrogs are the only two projects that have implemented the ERC-404 token standard. The latter project\u2019s token, DEFROGS price, is up 21% in the last hour, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nCtrl, the team behind the launch of the experimental token standard, has also launched Pandora. PANDORA token started trading on February 2 at $212 and is currently trading at $21,000.\n\nPANDORA/WETH 4-hour chart\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Crypto markets to turn volatile as AI steals the spotlight\n\nWill ERC-404 push Ethereum price higher?\n\nIt is unlikely that the launch of projects based on ERC-404 standards will push Ethereum price higher. Since Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it is highly correlated with Bitcoin price and is unlikely to be influenced by the new narrative.\n\nBut with the tides turning bullish for Bitcoin price, the outlook could get optimistic for not just Ethereum but ETH-related altcoins as well.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets primed, await directional bias from BTC"

        "content": "Fri 09 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation recently announced the deployment date of the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet. Scheduled for March 13, 2024, this long-awaited hard fork will bring significant structural changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum, Technical Improvements Brought by Dencun\n\nTechnically, Dencun introduces several notable new features to the Ethereum blockchain:\n\nTransition to a proof of stake consensus to validate blocks, replacing energy-intensive mining with validators. This is a fundamental change in the protocol, ending the use of intensive computing power to secure the network in favor of a system based on holding ETH.\n\nTransaction fees significantly reduced, divided by 100 thanks to Dencun. The Ethereum network becomes much more affordable for end users and improves its competitiveness against competing blockchains.\n\nImproved scalability achieved through larger blocks and solutions like sharding. The goal is to support 100,000 transactions per second compared to only 15 currently. This increased capacity is crucial for Ethereum to meet growing demand.\n\nEnhanced security thanks to new EVMs and \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d These technical changes will make smart contracts and transactions on Ethereum more robust against exploits.\n\nThese technical improvements prepare Ethereum to welcome many more users and decentralized applications. They significantly modernize the infrastructure to make it more efficient, secure, and scalable.\n\nThe Economic Impact of the Hard Fork\n\nBeyond its technical implications, Dencun will also have significant economic repercussions on Ethereum:\n\nEnd of new ETH issuance through mining, replaced by only 900 ETH created each day. This drastic reduction in the network\u2019s native inflation strengthens the scarcity of Ethereum (ETH) and favors an increase in its price by eliminating mining sales.\n\nDestruction of transaction fees, made possible by the EIP-1559 mechanism. This mechanically reduces the total number of ETH in circulation when network activity is high. A positive deflationary impact.\n\nAnnounced end of the triple halving of issuance with each major fork. Dencun will be the last fork to divide the issuance by three. In the long term, ETH becomes increasingly scarce.\n\nStaking rewards encouraging Ethereum holders to participate in securing the network, with an estimated yield between 5 and 15%. A much less inflationary model than mining.\n\nWith its Dencun upgrade, Ethereum enters a new decisive technical and economic era on March 13, 2024. These fundamental changes position the blockchain as an ideal infrastructure for Web3 and decentralized finance, and the anticipated positive impact on the value of ETH also generates considerable interest from investors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "ERC404 tokens have exploded on Ethereum, led by Pandora's $230 million volume.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects contributed 12% to Uniswap\u2019s 24 hour volume on Ethereum.\n\nThe frenzy has raised concerns about rug pulls and high gas fees.\n\nLess than a week since the creation of ERC404, trading volumes on Ethereum are now dominated by these hybrid tokens.\n\nThe top ERC404 collection, Pandora, has experienced over $230 million in total volume since launching on February 2.\n\nThe PANDORA/WETH liquidity pool on decentralised exchange Uniswap is now the number three pool by volume, only behind stalwarts USDC/ETH and USDC/USDT.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects \u2014 Pandora, MNRCH and DeFrogs \u2014 have registered a combined $113 million worth of trades over the past 24 hours, accounting for 12% of Uniswap\u2019s Ethereum trading volume.\n\nERC404 is a token standard on Ethereum that combines characteristics of both cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It greatly improves the liquidity \u2014 availability of funds \u2014 for NFTs, which are typically highly-illiquid assets.\n\nWhen a user holds at least one token of an ERC404 project an NFT is automatically minted. The user can then either sell the token, thereby burning the NFT, or they can list the NFT on a marketplace like Opensea.\n\nBut the frenzied trading around ERC404 tokens comes with consequences.\n\nThere have already been a number of rug pulls \u2014 situations where the address that created a token pulls liquidity leaving investors with nothing \u2014 and rising gas costs on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe ERC404 frenzy\n\nAs traders flock to the ERC404 token standard, some have started to take advantage of the frenzy. On Wednesday, a token trading under the name Punks, rose from $350 to over $20,000 in just two hours. Now, it\u2019s almost worthless.\n\nThat\u2019s because the wallet that created the token used a malicious contract that allowed the creation of an infinite number of Punks tokens. Shortly after Punks hit $20,000, the wallet\u2019s controller executed the contract, minting thousands of tokens which were then sold into the PUNKS/WETH Uniswap pool.\n\nUsers who invested in this token lost everything while the creator\u2019s wallet walked away with a gain of 42 Ether \u2014 or about $100,000.\n\nSimilar incidents occurred with four other ERC404 collections using variations of the Punks name in the last two days.\n\nERC404\u2032s are also contributing to rising gas costs on Ethereum. Given the standard is so new, it has not yet been optimised for gas costs.\n\nEthereum gas fees spent trading the Pandora ERC404 token. (Chocolate Chungus)\n\nGas fees on Ethereum are payments made by users in order to send transactions. Ethereum is designed to increase the cost of transactions during busy periods to protect the network from spam attacks.\n\nThe founder of the Pandora collection recently stated in the project\u2019s Telegram chat that the next ERC404 improvement should reduce gas costs by 300 to 400%.\n\nThis will likely be welcomed by Ethereum mainnet users. Gas fees on the network have averaged 53 gwei over the past 24 hours, while the average for the previous seven days was 29 gwei.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "title": "Latest Ethereum price predictions: $5,000 by the end of 2024. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we see the latest forecasts on the future price of Ethereum offered by the fintech company Finder, which conducted a survey with 40 experts in the cryptocurrency industry in January 2024.\n\nThe emerged results speak clearly: the majority of experts are super bullish on the price of ETH, with predictions for the next 6 years talking about figures higher than four zeros.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum could experience a real rally as soon as it breaks the long-term downtrend, which has been ongoing since August 2022, in the chart against Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nFinder\u2019s predictions on the future price of Ethereum\n\nAccording to a panel conducted in January 2024 by the analysis company Finder, in which 40 fintech market specialists were interviewed, the price of Ethereum could soon skyrocket if it were to meet the announced forecasts.\n\nAccording to the average of the responses obtained from the participants, by the end of the year ETH could reach $5,000 per token, approaching $4,887, thus increasing its current value by over 100%.\n\nThere are even those who have gone so far as to imagine a fiery scenario for Ethereum, hypothesizing a price of $17,000 by the end of 2024. At the same time, there are also those who, going against the tide, support the crypto market bears and predict a price of $1,333.\n\nApproximately 23% of the interviewed speakers believe that the price of ETH will rise in the range of $4,000 to $4,999 at its maximum before the end of 2024, while another approximately 23% believe that we will see the price of ETH within the range of $3,000 to $3,999 in the same time frame.\n\nExpanding our horizons, we see that forecasts indicate a potential growth of the cryptocurrency that could reach $7,492 in 2025, while by 2030 we could reach $19,190.\n\nThese numbers, obtained as a simple average of the responses provided by industry experts, are significantly higher compared to those recorded in a similar survey conducted by Finder in October 2023.\n\nThe analysts interviewed by Finder also contributed to explaining the reasons for their bullish or bearish biases, providing technical support to the market forecasts provided.\n\nIn particular, we see how Damian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor of Finance Magnates, believes that the fate of Ethereum largely depends on the performance that Bitcoin will record:\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum will reflect what happens with Bitcoin. If I believe in a historical high by the end of 2024 around $70,000 for BTC, I also believe that ETH will reach its historical high, testing the $5,000 level.\u201d\n\nEven Jonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of ARIA Algorithmic Ratings & Investment Analysis, agrees with Chmiel\u2019s thesis. He notes a very strong correlation factor between the two assets, but emphasizes that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could have the upper hand this year:\n\n\u201cGiven the strong correlation between bitcoin and ether, it is likely that ether will benefit from bitcoin catalysts such as spot ETFs [bitcoin] and [the halving]. However, I believe that ether has greater potential due to its current market price. There is a general perception that ether offers a better opportunity for higher multiple profits compared to bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to a slightly less optimistic forecast by Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler SA, the price of ETH is expected to increase in 2024 without breaking any previous highs.\n\nAccording to his vision, Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure will capture a lot of value in the coming years due to its advantageous technology, but at the same time, competitors will grow alongside it:\n\n\u201cIn the long term, the price of assets will increase because Ethereum is the main ecosystem for blockchain projects. However, competition with other blockchain ecosystems will intensify.\u201d\n\nTechnical analysis of ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts\n\nAt this point, to complete the overall picture of the future price predictions of Ethereum, let\u2019s take a look at the ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts to identify potential starting points for the next predicted increases in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nCurrently, the cryptocurrency is priced at $2417, well above the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, with the macro trend reversing after the declines of 2022 and becoming clearly bullish since January 2023.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum has had some difficulty in surpassing the $2500 mark, never managing to close candles above the fateful level.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Ether has attempted to break out against the dollar, but without managing to surpass the $2800 high.\n\nTo give more space to the optimism of the bulls, it will be necessary to break the $2500 mark as soon as possible, trying to break into the area around $3000 as well. The volumes have not yet returned to 2020 levels but are gradually growing.\n\nThe RSI indicator is at a medium-high level in the channel but leaves fertile ground for other potential bullish climbs.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USDT)\n\nAs for the ETH-BTC chart, we notice that the situation is quite different.\n\nPrices are currently below the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, indicating a more bearish outlook.\n\nSince August 2022, the currency of the world\u2019s most famous smart contract platform has recorded a downward trend against the market king Bitcoin, losing about 40% from the highs to the lows of the last 2 years of trading.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Ethereum has consolidated within the range of 0.05-0.055, increasing the chances of a trend reversal and fueling positive predictions on the price of the crypto.\n\nIf the bottom has really been reached in recent months, then we can expect a year of strong rebounds both for ether and for many altcoins, which will benefit from the loss of power of BTC.\n\nCurrently, the most optimistic scenario involves a recovery of 0.07 by mid-2024, with the remaining 6 months of the year in which we could witness an attempt to remove one zero from the chart and bring ETH back to one-tenth of the value of BTC.\n\nThe most important resistance is located at 0.085 zone, which has acted as a peak in the chart for the past 5 years, preventing any return to the crazy levels reached during the bull run of 2017.\n\nWe are waiting to find out ETH\u2019s next move towards BTC, in order to update price forecasts and identify the most likely targets."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a stunning display of trading acumen, an Ethereum (ETH) trader managed to secure a profit of approximately $166,000 within just two days, starting with an investment of merely 0.26 ETH (equivalent to $613). This remarkable feat was achieved through strategic transactions involving DeFrogs (DEFROGS), a new cryptocurrency that has recently captured the attention of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to details shared by Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, the trader embarked on this lucrative journey by initially investing 0.08 ETH ($190) to purchase 100 DEFROGS tokens. This transaction was executed despite the high gas fees at the time, which amounted to 0.178 ETH ($423). The decision to bear such significant transaction costs early on underscores the trader's confidence in the potential of their investment.\n\nIn just 2 days, this trader made $166K with only 0.26 $ETH($613)!\n\n\n\nThis trader spent only 0.08 $ETH($190) to buy 100 #DEFROGS using a high gas of 0.178 $ETH($423), then sold 60 #DEFROGS for 27.8 $ETH ($67K).\n\n\n\nHe currently has 40 #DEFROGS($100K) left, the total profit is ~166K! pic.twitter.com/g0VtlKoKGM \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 8, 2024\n\nThe strategy began to bear fruit when the Ethereum trader sold 60 of their DEFROGS tokens for a staggering 27.8 ETH, translating to approximately $67,000. This sale not only recouped the initial investment and associated costs but also yielded a substantial profit. As of the latest update, the trader still holds 40 DEFROGS tokens, valued at around $100,000, bringing their total profit to the vicinity of $166,000.\n\nMeme coin craze\n\nThis trading success story coincides with a significant surge in the value of DeFrogs (DEFROGS). The cryptocurrency has experienced a remarkable 111.91% increase in its value over the last 24 hours, with its price currently standing at $3,335 per token.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu token has recently slipped below a critical support level at $0.000009. This drop signifies a potential pivot point for the asset, with the next critical support level now in the spotlight, highlighted by the stark blue line on the trading chart.\n\nThe loss of the $0.000009 support level is implying a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. Traders often view such breaches as a signal for a potential downward trend, leading to increased selling pressure. The market seems to be in a precarious position, where the demand at the subsequent support level must hold to prevent further declines.\n\nFor SHIB, the next critical support level is now set around $0.0000087, highlighted by the blue line. This level represents a psychological and technical threshold, which, if breached, could intensify bearish momentum. The resistance level to watch is currently at $0.0000095, a boundary that SHIB needs to surpass to negate the current bearish outlook and potentially signal a reversal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if SHIB can consolidate above the current support and break through the resistance at $0.0000095, it could lead to a relief rally, attracting buyers back into the market. This could be driven by positive news, market sentiment or broader crypto market recovery. In this case, a move toward the next resistance at $0.000010 could be in the cards, potentially rekindling investor interest and speculative trading.\n\nEthereum gains confidence\n\nEthereum has seen a resurgence of momentum, possibly catalyzed by the recent outage on the Solana network. Investors are increasingly favoring stability, and Ethereum's uninterrupted service during Solana's downtime may have reinforced its position as the go-to platform for developers and investors seeking reliability.\n\nThe Ethereum network has maintained its operations without significant issues, which stands in stark contrast to the outage experienced by Solana, often touted as an Ethereum competitor. This reliability has not gone unnoticed. Amid fears of potential future outages, Solana's instability has inadvertently highlighted Ethereum's robustness, possibly triggering a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum.\n\nA look at the Ethereum price chart suggests a bullish trend, with the asset recently rebounding off the 50-day EMA, currently at around $2,331. The next resistance level to watch is around the $2,367 mark, which, if surpassed, could pave the way for further gains.\n\nThere has been speculation in the past that individuals with significant market influence, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, have contributed to network instabilities to benefit their trading platforms. While these rumors have been persistent, the recent Solana incident appears to be the result of a genuine surge in activity, rather than any malevolent interference.\n\nAs Ethereum continues its climb, support levels have solidified, particularly around the $2,206 line, aligning with the 100-day EMA. This level is crucial for Ethereum to maintain its current momentum and avoid a retracement toward lower supports.\n\nXRP's issues with volatility\n\nXRP is now facing a period of stagnant volatility and waning interest. With the ongoing SEC case showing no signs of progress and market participants shifting their focus elsewhere, XRP's trading volume and network activity have significantly dwindled.\n\nA glance at the XRP price chart reveals a constrained trading range, with the cryptocurrency struggling to make decisive moves. Currently languishing around the $0.50 mark, XRP finds itself trapped between the immediate support level at $0.49 and a faint resistance near $0.56. This tight range indicates a lack of enthusiasm from traders, with minimal volume to suggest any forthcoming change in this dynamic.\n\nThe decreasing volatility is symptomatic of broader market sentiment toward XRP. Without substantial developments in its legal challenges or breakthrough use cases that rekindle interest, XRP remains in a state of limbo. The once vibrant and highly speculative asset now sees days of minimal price change."

        "title": "Ethereum Insider: China's ETH Stake 'Jeopardizes Crypto' - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum, has publicly voiced concerns about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) alleged dominance over the ETH blockchain. His comments, made on X (formerly Twitter), echo the investigative findings of TruthLabs, an on-chain sleuth.\n\nAccording to TruthLabs, the CCP is speculated to control approximately 66.6% of ETH supply. This claim, if accurate, presents significant implications for the decentralization, security, and regulatory standing of Ethereum.\n\nThe CCP has taken over Crypto by being Ethereum's largest hidden whale, with an ownership estimation on my end of near 66.6% of the Eth supply today. They've clearly compromised the SEC, and CFTC, with Prometheum being given the ONLY Special Purpose Dealer Broker license for\u2026 pic.twitter.com/C5eCrGUH7d \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) February 8, 2024\n\nNerayoff\u2019s statements bring to light the potential deep-seated vulnerabilities within the ETH ecosystem. The CCP\u2019s stake in Ethereum jeopardizes the entire crypto world. It\u2019s inevitable. Ethereum has vulnerabilities\u2014that\u2019s a fact. The SEC and other entities are compromised. We can\u2019t ignore this; we must confront the corruption, hold key figures accountable, and keep advancing this constantly evolving industry,\u201d Nerayoff stated, underlining the urgency of addressing these issues head-on.\n\nA focal point of these allegations is Prometheum, a company that recently received a Special Purpose Dealer Broker (SPDB) license from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a controversial step towards potentially classifying Ether as a security. Nerayoff\u2019s critique extends to this development, emphasizing the implications of such a classification.\n\n\u201cPrometheum\u2019s declaration of Ethereum as a security extends beyond regulatory semantics; it\u2019s a move by entities with deep CCP ties, aiming to control the narrative and the crypto space,\u201d he remarked, highlighting the strategic influence exerted by the CCP through entities like Wanxiang, which is deeply involved with Prometheum.\n\nIn his comments, Nerayoff also referenced TruthLabs findings about the SEC filings that underscore the pivotal role of Wanxiang in the operation and development of the Prometheum Network.\n\n\u201cThe company (Prometheum) uses Wanxiang (CCP) as their SOLE project developer and relies on Wanxiang\u2019s ability to create and maintain a successful platform. The loss of the services of Wanxiang could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to Develop, Operate, or maintain the Prometheum Network,\u201d TruthLabs quoted, spotlighting the ties with China.\n\nIs Ethereum Really Infiltrated By China\u2019s CCP?\n\nTruthLabs has been at the forefront of uncovering these unsettling dynamics, alleging that the CCP\u2019s influence over Ethereum and entities like Prometheum could compromise the privacy and security of American citizens. The researcher\u2019s analysis suggests that the CCP\u2019s involvement enables direct access to sensitive information of US consumers, a claim that amplifies the call for scrutiny and accountability within the crypto industry and regulatory bodies.\n\nTune in at 1:10 and tell me @prometheuminc isn't eager to sell you their Wanxiang, deep CCP tied, Crypto. Why is Gary Gensler giving this company access to our markets, and to American consumers? How did this CCP front company get the only approval and US companies did not? Now\u2026 https://t.co/0FcfqHvv3i \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) February 9, 2024\n\nMoreover, Nerayoff\u2019s direct challenge to prominent Ethereum figures, including Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, underscores the gravity of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable now. Your day of reckoning approaches\u2026 Vitalik Buterin, Joseph Lubin, Ethereum Foundation,\u201d he warned, signaling the need for a concerted effort to address and mitigate the alleged corruption and external influence that threaten the ethos and integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported, Nerayoff is currently preparing a fraud lawsuit with the help of TruthLabs against the Ethereum Foundation, Buterin and Lubin. It is not yet known when the lawsuit will be filed in a US court.\n\nOver the past few months, Nerayoff has made numerous serious accusations against the Ethereum founders and submitted an old audio recording as evidence. Neither the Ethereum Foundation nor Buterin or Lubin have yet commented on any allegations, something Nerayoff and TruthLabs interpret as an admittance of guilt.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,454.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin price could hit $48,000 this weekend if BTC decisively closes above $45,451 mean threshold.\n\nEthereum price could reclaim $2,717 range high as ETH leads altcoin\u2019s revival recourse.\n\nXRP could reclaim $0.5500 as Ripple price breaches midline of the descending parallel channel.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price started moving after a prolonged consolidation, and with it Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices. The general outlook is revival recourse, with markets flashing green as the Chinese Lunar Year of the Dragon sets in this weekend. It is a special year, representing strength.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to do the Year of the Dragon, because it\u2019s a very powerful year and very auspicious,\u201d said local board member of the Organization of Chinese Americans, Anna Wong, adding, \u201cand everyone feels lucky when they\u2019re in the Year of the Dragon.\u201d\n\nWith this optimism, crypto markets could rally this weekend as Chinese investors feel lucky.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price shows strength as US BTC ETF flow percentage beats AUM in most regions\n\nBitcoin price could make it to $48,000 this weekend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has forayed past the midline of the supply zone at $45,451. The supply zone extending from $44,235 to $46,715 is an order block characterized by aggressive selling. If BTC manages to close above its midline, it could extend the gains to $48,000 this weekend, or in a highly bullish case, extend the gains to $50,000. Such a move would denote a 5% climb above current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is northbound, pointing to rising momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in positive territory with histogram bars flashing green to show a strong bullish wave.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with the RSI above 70, BTC is in overbought territory and a correction may be looming. Another threat to Bitcoin price upside potential is early profit-taking, which could see BTC fall back into the range between $40,650 and $43,750.\n\nIf selling pressure sends BTC all the way to $37,800, the cliff could see Bitcoin price roll over to $30,000, below which the bullish thesis would be invalidated.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC targets $52,000, will New Moon trigger a pullback first?\n\nEthereum price could reclaim its $2,717 range high\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is on a sustained uptrend, and could extend the climb past $2,600 to tag $2,717, levels last tested on January 12. This would constitute a 9% climb above current levels.\n\nThe RSI position at 63 shows there is more room in the north before ETH is overbought, with the inclination of the momentum indicator showing rising buying strength.\n\nThe MACD histogram bars are also green to show the strong presence of bulls in the market. Enhanced buyer momentum could see Ethereum price shatter past the range high to hit $2,800.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if traders start cashing in, Ethereum price could drop. While a break below $2,388 would harm ETH holders, the prevailing bullish outlook would only be invalidated if ETH crosses and closes below $2,280.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price tops $2,400 as 25% of ETH supply is staked and ETF applicants amend filings\n\nRipple price could take back $0.5500\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken above the midline of the descending parallel channel. With momentum rising, XRP price could extend the gains 5% to the $0.5500 level. In a highly bullish case, the price could extend the climb, shattering the 50, 200 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at $0.5633, $0.5730 and $0.5970, respectively. This could lay the path for XRP to hit the $0.6000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the bears have their way, Ripple price could dwindle, potentially retesting the $0.4734 support.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Price faces threat of fall below $0.50 as XRPLedger AMM amendment is uncertain"

        "content": "ThorChain (RUNE) price is trading with a bullish bias, completing a full swing V-shaped recovery after the steep dip in the first four days of February. It comes amid an altcoin revival recourse, inspired by Bitcoin (BTC) price breaking past the $45,000 psychological level.\n\nDespite the Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval, BTC price failed to rally as anticipated. The news of ETF inflows and outflows, caused a widespread panic among investors, which led to a brief pause. But lately, things are starting to improve with regard to ETF inflows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action is showing strength and volatility after seven weeks of consolidation. The current weekly BTC candlestick has already registered a 9.30% gain and is likely to close on a positive note.\n\nAmong the top 10 most capitalized cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has outshone its peers, marking the strongest performance with a 7% increase over the week. As market analyst for FXStreet Mike Ermolaev noted, the ETH price recently peaked at $2,706 and, even despite a pullback, many are eagerly eyeing the potential for Ethereum (ETH) to breach the $3,500 mark in the near future.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Bitcoin has notably rebounded, soaring to heights not seen since mid-January, yet the reduced social interest in Ethereum and Dogecoin persists.\n\nSuch calmness could be a harbinger of stability. A muted social landscape may decrease the likelihood of reactionary sell-offs, which can shield the prices of these assets from potential drops in the near term.\n\nEthereum and Dogecoin's distinct market positions further color this phenomenon. Ethereum, a platform famed for its smart contract capabilities, sits at the heart of the DeFi and NFT revolutions, underpinning a vast ecosystem of applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin, on the other hand, started as a meme and has since captured a cult following, often riding waves of celebrity endorsements and social media trends. Despite their differences, both currencies experience the ebb and flow of investor and media attention, impacting their market behavior.\n\nThe subdued social volume for these cryptocurrencies could imply a period of accumulation by large investors, or it might reflect a market consolidation phase, as attention pivots to newer or more volatile assets.\n\nEthereum and Dogecoin may not share the limelight, but they share the resilience of navigating through quiet periods of social volume. This tranquility could provide a more stable foundation for future growth, unaffected by the rapid sentiment changes often fueled by social media discourse."

        "title": "Should You Invest In PIXEL? - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "I spent the morning playing a video game.\n\nWhile I wasted a lot of time, I did earn some Popberries. And I learned a little something about the new generation of play-to-earn (P2E) games.\n\nPixels is a P2E game similar to the classic farming game Stardew Valley. It\u2019s an open world where you develop plots of land, farm various crops, then buy and sell your crops in marketplaces to obtain more exotic items and skills.\n\nLike real farming, it\u2019s a lot of work.\n\nThe \u201cwork\u201d comes from spending a lot of time in the game. Like, a lot. You\u2019ve got to plant seeds, water them, wait for them to grow, harvest the fruits, take the fruits to the town square, sell them, buy more seeds, and repeat. (And that\u2019s just the farming.)\n\nYou can always buy your way to faster farming, but if you want to start from the beginning, get that index finger warmed up, because you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time clicking.\n\nI got interested in Pixels when I read they were doing a cross-promotion with Binance, as Farmer Barney kept reminding me every time I talked to him.\n\nBinance is allowing users who stake their crypto in Binance Launchpool to earn PIXEL tokens, which can be used to buy stuff within the game \u2026 and which may go up in value as the game grows more popular.\n\nWhat I wanted to know: Should I invest in PIXEL?\n\nP2E Games: How They Work\n\nP2E games reward players for their time and effort in the game. You defeat monsters, complete quests, or (in the case of Pixels) farm several thousand acres of Popberries.\n\nIn return for your work, you receive some kind of in-game token, which you can often sell outside the game on crypto exchanges.\n\nThe P2E market is rapidly growing, with billions of dollars invested in 2023. Some games \u2013 like Axie Infinity and Decentraland \u2013 have seen significant token price appreciation, attracting players who want to make money.\n\nOn the other hand, the market is also volatile. Many games struggle to retain players long-term, especially since the perceived value is based on the token price, not on how much fun it is to play.\n\nThere are currently about 1,000 P2E games, with over a million daily active users, according to DappRadar. The top games, like Axie and The Sandbox, have market caps worth over a billion dollars, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt is tempting to write off P2E games as another weird crypto thing, like memecoins. But I think there is something more at play. As Chris Dixon said, \u201cThe next big thing will start out looking like a toy.\u201d\n\nIf you think of the underlying technology behind P2E games being something more like redeemable reward points, it is an extremely valuable innovation.\n\nYou can see brands like Starbucks or Marriott \u201crewarding\u201d customers for completing certain \u201cquests,\u201d like ordering new menu items or staying at a collection of properties \u2013 all using blockchain-based rewards points.\n\nThat\u2019s not so different from a P2E game, except that games currently have to do it at scale, with thousands or even millions of players making real-time transactions 24/7. And most blockchains are not built to handle that.\n\nWhich is where Ronin comes in.\n\nRonin: Scaling P2E Games on Ethereum\n\nCreated by the team behind Axie Infinity, Ronin was developed as a sidechain to Ethereum (though not technically accurate, it\u2019s easiest to think of it as a Layer-2 solution).\n\nThe goal of Ronin is to make transactions faster and cheaper than working directly with Ethereum. Gas fees are significantly lower, making gameplay more affordable.\n\n(If you\u2019re wondering why you wouldn\u2019t just build your game on a faster Layer-1, building on Ethereum gives you access to everything built on Ethereum. For example, Pixels allows you to bring in your Ethereum-based NFTs into the game as playable characters.)\n\nOf course, Ronin also has its own token, RON, which saw a lot of hype at launch, then promptly crashed to pennies before recently seeing a significant uptake after Pixels announced their deal with Binance:\n\nI feel the same way about RON that I do about every other Layer-2 solution. I don\u2019t know which of them will win, or if they\u2019ll even be needed in the long term. Investing in L2s is like a bet-on-a-bet: you have to bet on Ethereum as the winning L1, then Ronin as the winning L2.\n\nWhy not just simplify, and invest in Ethereum?\n\nAfter all, any value that is generated by any P2E game built on Ethereum will accrue to Ethereum. Every Ethereum game means more Ethereum wallets, more Ethereum users, and a bigger Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe easiest way to invest not just in Pixels, but every Ethereum-based P2E game, is just to buy and hold ETH. It\u2019s like an index fund in the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLess Payola, More Playability\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the time and curiosity, play a bit of Pixels. Unlike most blockchain apps, it works right out of the box, directly in your browser, with no complicated setup. The usability is something every blockchain developer should strive for.\n\nOn the other hand, I kept running into limitations in the game where it wanted me to buy bigger plots of land, or NFTs, or access to a VIP room in the \u201csauna\u201d area:\n\nTo me, traditional games like Fortnite strike the perfect balance between fun and money. Fortnite is free to play, and you can use the default characters forever. But if you want to upgrade your character, you buy V-Bucks (with real dollars), which is Fortnite\u2019s revenue stream.\n\nUpgrading your Fortnite character is more about the flex. It doesn\u2019t give you new skills, or make the game run any differently. Playing as Iron Man or a giant banana is just more fun. And that is worth paying for.\n\nI get the appeal of Pixels, but if I\u2019m playing a game, I still want less commerce and more fun. Less payola, more playability.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in the potential of these games \u2013 not just as games, but as reward mechanisms for any company that wants to incentivize customers to do something (try a new product, take a test drive, or use new features or products).\n\nBut for my money, ETH is still the best investment of all. If P2E games hit the mainstream, ETH will be the real in-game reward.\n\nHealth, wealth, and happiness,\n\nJohn Hargrave\n\nPublisher, Bitcoin Market Journal"

        "title": "Bain Capital Crypto leads $5.2 million seed round for Ethereum-focused DEX aggregator Flood - The Block",
        "content": "Flood, an Ethereum ecosystem-focused decentralized exchange aggregator, has raised $5.2 million in a seed funding round.\n\nBain Capital Crypto led the round, with Archetype and Robot Ventures participating, Flood said Thursday. The round closed in the summer of 2023, Flood co-founder and CEO Francesco told The Block, adding that it was structured as equity with token warrants. He declined to comment on valuation but said there was also a \"small\" funding round one year ago with the same investors and a few angel investors.\n\nFrancesco, a former software engineer at UMA Protocol, declined to share his and his co-founder Jan's full name. Jan is a crypto developer and the author of Neuronika, a rust machine learning library, Flood said.\n\nAs part of leading the round, Bain Capital Crypto has one observer seat on Flood, Francesco said.\n\nWhat is Flood?\n\nFlood is a DEX aggregator that is currently live on Arbitrum One and is planning to expand to Ethereum, Base and Optimism in the coming months.\n\nFrancesco said Flood's key unique proposition is optimal routing that fills trades mathematically at the best prices. \"Most aggregators are moving toward an RFQ [request for quote] model; we see that as a suboptimal model, as people can collude to fill trades at a bad price,\" Francesco said.\n\nFlood users will be able to independently verify in the future that they received the best price with an easy-to-compute proof, Francesco said. \"This is similar to what is done for zero-knowledge proofs; verifying the proof is easy, but producing it is not,\" he said, adding, \"We are coming up with some custom computations.\"\n\nFlood also operates its own DEX, FloodSwap. Flood went live last November and has seen over $1.3 million in trading volume, according to a Dune data dashboard.\n\nGasless trading and MEV-free features\n\nFrancesco said other key features of Flood include gasless and maximal extractable value-free trading.\n\n\"Flood is wholly intent-based, meaning users state their desired outcome, and fulfillers take care of executing their trades at the optimal price. This means users don't need to send transactions themselves. Instead, they just sign a message which does not require them to pay gas fees directly,\" he noted. \"And because our routing is optimal, trades on Flood don't open the door to any profitable backrunning.\"\n\nIf there is any arbitrage in the network when a Flood user trades, the Flood optimal fulfiller will try to capture it and return it to the users in the form of a \"surplus,\" Francesco said.\n\nFlood users captured over $8,000 of surplus last month, according to the Dune dashboard.\n\nWhile Flood remains focused on the Ethereum ecosystem in the short term, it is open to exploring more chains in the future, Francesco said.\n\nThere are currently six people working for Flood, and with fresh funding in place, the project plans to hire more people across business development and engineering functions, Francesco said.\n\nThis article has been updated after Flood said Bain Capital Crypto solely led the round, with Archetype participating."

        "content": "Ed Prinz is co-founder and CEO of Loob.io, a digital marketplace for blockchain assets, and chairman of DLT Austria, a non-profit organization promoting blockchain technology. This is the second part of his three-part series on \u201cCrypto Trends 2024\u201d. Find Part I of the biggest crypto trends here.\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of crypto assets, two giants are in focus: Bitcoin and Ethereum. These two pioneers have not only fundamentally changed the digital financial landscape, but also continue to actively shape the future of the crypto sector. In this article, we highlight the latest developments and challenges of both crypto assets, examine their role in the global financial system, and take a look at the upcoming innovations and updates expected in 2024. As Bitcoin establishes itself as a dominant investment and store of value assets and prepares for the next halving, Ethereum is focused on breakthrough technological advances to improve its scalability and efficiency. Both continue to have a decisive influence on the dynamics and progress in the crypto sector.\n\nWe start our analysis with Bitcoin, the most valuable digital asset, followed by a detailed look at Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin: The Road to the Fourth Halving\n\nBitcoin has established itself as an important investment and store of value assets in the financial system since 2009. Its value benefits from limited availability, the most secure blockchain, and increasing adoption, making it particularly attractive in uncertain economic times. Technological advances like the Lightning Network and the Taproot update address challenges in scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe launch of the Bitcoin Spot ETF on January 10, 2024, and the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, expected around April 20, 2024, depending on the block time, mark significant events with potentially significant impact on the market. These milestones, complemented by regulatory developments, represent a turning point for Bitcoin that could encourage further growth and expansion in the financial sector.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into the main event, Bitcoin Halving, let\u2019s take a closer look at Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin mining and network dynamics\n\nBitcoin mining is a central process for generating new Bitcoins and securing the blockchain. Miners verify transactions and create new Bitcoins by solving mathematical problems known as \u201cproof of work\u201c. This activity ensures the integrity and security of the network, with miners receiving new Bitcoins and transaction fees as a reward.\n\nMining difficulty adjusts to maintain network stability, and the miner rewards halves approximately every four years, an event called \u201chalving.\u201d Despite the high energy consumption, there are efforts to use even more renewable energy for mining. There are concerns about the centralization of mining through large mining pools, but the network structure minimizes such risks.\n\nBitcoin mining companies face technical and economic challenges. Market volatility impacts profitability while increasing mining complexity requires higher computing and energy costs. Many companies are responding to environmental concerns through the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nScaling offers opportunities and challenges but requires significant investment. Technological innovations are crucial to remain competitive. Ahead of the halving, which will halve rewards, companies are optimizing their operating costs and improving the efficiency of their hardware.\n\nTechnological development plays a crucial role in Bitcoin mining, both in terms of increased efficiency and more environmentally friendly practices. Innovations in mining hardware and software, such as more powerful ASICs and advanced algorithms, increase overall efficiency and reduce energy consumption. The use of renewable energies and the use of waste heat are other important aspects. These technological advances are expanding opportunities not only in mining but also in other industries such as finance and supply chain management. Overall, these developments are of great importance for the digital economy by making mining more efficient, profitable, and environmentally friendly and opening up new areas of application.\n\nThe maximum supply of Bitcoins is set at 21 million units, of which approximately 19.1 million are in circulation so far. New Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which a new block is added to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average, with each block generating 6.25 Bitcoins. This results in around 900 new Bitcoins every day.\n\nAn interesting facet of Bitcoin is the phenomenon of lost Bitcoins. Estimates suggest that between 3 and 4 million Bitcoins have been irretrievably lost, due to various reasons such as losing private keys or forgetting wallet passwords.\n\nIn the future, when the maximum supply of Bitcoins is reached, there will be no new block rewards for miners. Instead, miners will derive their revenue from the transaction fees that users pay for each Bitcoin transaction. This transition represents an important moment in Bitcoin\u2019s development as it represents a shift from creating new entities to maintaining and securing the network through transaction processing.\n\nAfter the halving, market consolidation could occur, with efficient miners surviving and the Bitcoin price supported in the long term by the reduced supply. Successful companies in the mining sector are those that use challenges as opportunities and act in an economically and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nBitcoin Halving 2024\n\nA crucial aspect of Bitcoin mining and a significant event for the entire network is Bitcoin Halving. Approximately every four years, the block reward that miners receive halves, which has a direct impact on Bitcoin\u2019s economic ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin Halving is a pre-programmed process embedded in the design of the Bitcoin blockchain. It reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated and is a crucial factor in Bitcoin\u2019s deflation mechanism, contributing to the asset\u2019s value stability.\n\nThe halving has a significant impact on the supply of new Bitcoins, which in turn affects the market price. The reduced availability of new Bitcoins drives their scarcity and is often discussed in the context of stock-to-flow theory. Historical data shows that halvings often resulted in significant price increases, leading to speculative bull markets and increased public interest.\n\nEach halving marks a turning point for Bitcoin in terms of market value and public perception. Historical pattern recognition shows that halvings were often accompanied by specific market reactions that resulted in similar chart patterns and price movements.\n\nThe next halving, expected in 2024, is highly anticipated and could trigger similar market reactions to previous cycles. However, it is important to consider current market conditions and external factors and not simply project past trends into the future.\n\nBitcoin mining and halving are two inextricably linked aspects of the Bitcoin network. While mining ensures the ongoing security and functionality of the blockchain, halving is a key mechanism that ensures long-term value stability and scarcity of Bitcoin. Both elements play a central role in the development and economic ecosystem of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving phenomenon, which occurs every four years, has proven to be a crucial turning point for Bitcoin, both in terms of market value and public perception. Historical observations suggest that each halving brings significant price increases and associated bull markets, as well as increased public interest.\n\nHalvings at a glance\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin experienced its first halving on November 28th at block 210,000, with SlushPool generating the historic block using a Radeon HD 5800 miner. The reward dropped from 50 to 25 BTC per block. On the day of the halving, Bitcoin price was around $12.35 but rose to around $127.00 over the next 150 days.\n\nThe second halving took place on July 9, 2016, at block 420,000, conducted by F2Pool, with the reward reduced from 25 to 12.5 BTC per block. Bitcoin price was around $650.63 on the halving day and increased to around $758.81 in the following 150 days.\n\nOn May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred at block 630,000, with AntPool generating the crucial block. The block reward halved from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. The price on the halving day was around $8,821.42 and rose to around $10,943.00 in the next 150 days.\n\nThe fourth halving is expected on April 20, 2024, at block 840,000, with a reward reduction to 3,125 BTC per block.\n\nBy 2140, all 21 million Bitcoins will have been generated, with over 98% of them created by 2030. An average of 144 blocks are created every day, which corresponds to 900 new Bitcoins per day.\n\nDuring halvings, some miners turn off their equipment due to lower profits, resulting in slower block production. In response, the Bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of mining. After the halving, many miners are upgrading to more efficient machines, which improves network performance.\n\nAdjusting hash rate and mining difficulty ensures that the network remains stable even during halvings by ensuring an average block time of around 10 minutes. Although mining becomes more challenging over time, it remains feasible. After halvings, hashrate typically sees a 20-35% decline but usually recovers within 6-12 months.\n\nThe Bitcoin network, with its fixed monetary supply and the cooperation of millions of miners, is based on mathematical principles and the social consensus that all participants follow the same rules.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving is a pivotal event in the Bitcoin economy that has a profound impact on miners, Bitcoin supply, and market value. Halving the block reward will immediately reduce miner revenue, impacting the profitability of mining and leading to possible market consolidation that could eliminate less efficient miners. In the long term, this could lead to centralization of mining activities among larger and more efficient players. The halving plays an important role in Bitcoin\u2019s supply dynamics and acts as a catalyst for important price movements and market cycles. It is a multidimensional event that touches on the technical, economic and social aspects of Bitcoin and aims to avoid inflation and increase the scarcity of the currency. Understanding and analyzing the halving is crucial for anyone involved with Bitcoin and the crypto asset landscape.\n\nAfter each Bitcoin Halving, the market goes through specific phases that provide in-depth insights into market cycles and investor behavior. The first phase, the consolidation phase, begins immediately after the halving. During this time, the market builds a support structure that serves as a foundation for future upward movements. This is followed by the stabilization phase, during which the market processes the reduced Bitcoin supply and the changed market conditions without reaching new high prices. These observed patterns and phases after the halving are not only indicators of market behavior but also crucial in predicting future market movements and price trends of Bitcoin. Halving is therefore a complex and multi-stage process that has far-reaching effects on the entire crypto market.\n\nSince 2012, there have been recurring patterns in the market\u2019s reaction to Bitcoin halvings, manifesting themselves in similar chart formations and price developments. Two noticeable patterns are the \u201cBull Flag\u201d and the \u201cGolden Cross,\u201d which occur frequently and indicate impending price increases.\n\nExamining the market cycles after the halvings reveals characteristic phases:\n\nThe consolidation phase immediately follows the halving. During this phase, a supportive base structure is formed that serves as a foundation for future price increases. In the stabilization phase, the market price further consolidates. New high prices are typically not reached while the market processes reduced supply and changing circumstances.\n\nThe upcoming halving in 2024 raises high expectations and speculation. Historical patterns suggest similar responses to previous cycles, but with the caveat that each cycle has its own unique characteristics. The media plays an important role in shaping public perception, and it is crucial to distinguish informed analysis from unfounded speculation.\n\nInvestors should focus on non-emotional, fact-based decisions by conducting their own research and consulting various sources of information. Consideration of long-term trends and market cycles is essential for a realistic assessment of the halving effects.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving is more than just an event; it is a complex, multi-step process with profound implications for the crypto market. The recurring patterns following halvings provide important insights for future predictions and highlight the central role of halvings in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term performance. A balanced view, taking into account historical data, current market trends and rational considerations, is crucial to understanding and leveraging the halving.\n\nNow we turn our attention to Ethereum, the first smart contract platform, and take a closer look at the current developments and plans for 2024.\n\nEthereum at the center of crypto expansion\n\nAs 2023 comes to a close, the crypto world\u2019s attention is increasingly turning to Ethereum. This leading smart contract platform and the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has established itself as a key element in crypto expansion. Ethereum is known for its flexibility and ability to support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), making it a central pillar in the blockchain technology ecosystem.\n\nA new wave of crypto expansion is expected in 2024, which has the potential to lead the industry into a new bull market. Ethereum is at the forefront of this, not only because of its current market position but also because of the comprehensive network updates planned. These updates are critical as they aim to overcome some of Ethereum\u2019s fundamental challenges, such as limited scalability and high transaction costs.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest problems \u2013 its limited speed and high costs \u2013 is set to be addressed with a massive update in early 2024. This update promises to improve scalability by 10x. Improving scalability is crucial as it directly impacts Ethereum\u2019s ability to efficiently process a larger number of transactions, making the platform more attractive to use for developers and users.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability improvements are not only technical milestones but also have profound long-term implications for the crypto market. With increased efficiency and reduced costs, Ethereum is expected to attract an even larger user base and solidify its position as the leading platform for dApps and smart contracts. This development could have a significant impact on the entire crypto market as it could lead to increased trust, acceptance and possibly rising prices for Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto asset.\n\nAs we look forward to 2024, Ethereum is positioning itself as a central player in the upcoming crypto expansion. With planned network updates that promise significant improvements in scalability, Ethereum is on the cusp of significant changes that have the potential to transform the entire crypto landscape. These developments make Ethereum a key player in the eyes of investors, developers, and crypto enthusiasts, all of whom are eagerly awaiting the next chapter in the evolution of this revolutionary technology.\n\nThe development and future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap has stabilized significantly in recent years, which is reflected in a concretization of plans and a response to new challenges and insights. In the past, changing circumstances and new ideas led to adjustments in the roadmap, but currently, a clearer and more consistent development plan is emerging.\n\nA key focus is on centralizing staking. It was recognized that the current structure with different pools and the difficulty of solo staking is not ideal. There is a great opportunity to redesign the staking system in a way that both reduces centralization issues and increases efficiency. For example, it is considering reducing the number of signatures required per slot to simultaneously increase efficiency and improve decentralization.\n\nIn terms of scaling and data availability, Ethereum continues to move along the expected path, albeit a little slower than initially expected. A trend toward off-chain data solutions is evident as demand is so high that even Ethereum\u2019s expanded data availability cannot fully meet it. The security that can be achieved through off-chain solutions has proven to be higher than initially assumed.\n\nEthereum is continually working to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and implement new features. There are no major new changes at the functionality level, apart from the off-chain data integration mentioned, but this is by definition outside Layer 1.\n\nThe Ethereum community recognizes that the roadmap must be dynamic and responsive to new information and changes. There are different levels of ideas within Ethereum, with some more entrenched than others, such as blockchain immutability and the transition to Proof of Stake.\n\nEIP 4844, an important step towards full \u201cthanksharding\u201d, is planned for early 2024. This step will lay the foundation for further scaling efforts, with subsequent changes primarily being parameter adjustments or data collection improvements.\n\nThe Ethereum roadmap shows constant development to improve scalability, promote decentralization, and increase efficiency. While the first steps on this roadmap are challenging, the road ahead promises to be a smoother ride that will significantly improve the way Ethereum works. The roadmap also reflects the need to respond flexibly to new developments and challenges while preserving Ethereum\u2019s core principles.\n\nEthereum Scalability Revolution\n\nOne of the key issues Ethereum has faced since its launch concerns scalability. The platform, which supports a variety of decentralized applications and smart contracts, struggles with limited transaction speeds and high fees. These limitations have proven to be barriers to wider acceptance and application of the technology.\n\nA significant update to Ethereum is planned for 2024, promising a revolution in the scalability of the platform. This update, known as EIP 4844 or \u201cProto-Danksharding,\u201d aims to significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity and reduce costs for users and developers. This improvement is expected to increase scalability by ten times.\n\nThe core idea behind the update is to implement a more efficient way of handling transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, the idea is to create a special area in each block that is specifically reserved for Layer 2 transactions. These transactions, which take place on a secondary layer (Layer 2) and are anchored on the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1), can therefore be processed more efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nLayer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism and ZK Sync that aim to reduce the load on the main blockchain will directly benefit from this update. By creating dedicated and optimized storage space for Layer 2 transactions, these networks can conduct transactions at significantly lower costs. This enables a larger number of transactions and makes using Ethereum-based applications more attractive and accessible.\n\nThis update has the potential to fundamentally change Ethereum. With the significant reduction in transaction costs and increase in processing speed, Ethereum could usher in a new era of adoption and innovation. These improvements are expected to make the platform more attractive to a broader user base and lead to increased usage of Ethereum across various sectors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability revolution, scheduled for 2024, could represent one of the most significant developments in the platform\u2019s history. By improving efficiency and reducing costs, Ethereum not only becomes more attractive to existing users but also opens the door to new use cases and markets. This update could therefore mark a turning point in the evolution of Ethereum and the entire blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum and the future of the crypto industry\n\nEthereum has established itself as a definitive platform in the crypto industry, and with upcoming scalability improvements in 2024, it is on the cusp of a new era of technological advancements. These developments could have far-reaching implications for the entire digital currency ecosystem and put Ethereum at the center of crypto expansion.\n\nThe planned scalability improvements are not only important for Ethereum users but also have the potential to transform the entire crypto industry. By reducing transaction fees and speeding up processing, Ethereum could accommodate a larger volume of transactions and dApps. This is expected to lead to greater adoption of Ethereum, both among existing crypto users and newcomers to the market.\n\nThe update also has a potential impact on the investment market. As its technical fundamentals improve, Ethereum could become even more attractive to investors, which could lead to an increase in its market value. Anticipating and implementing the update could lead to increased market activity and positive price developments in advance.\n\nAnother major factor contributing to Ethereum\u2019s prominence in 2024 is the potential launch of Ethereum-based ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). Such financial instruments would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible way to invest in Ethereum. This could lead to a significant influx of institutional capital into the Ethereum economy and further increase demand for Ether.\n\nWhile the future looks bright for Ethereum, challenges also remain. The platform must continue to adapt and evolve to keep up with the rapidly changing needs of the crypto industry. Competition from other blockchain platforms also presents a challenge that Ethereum must overcome to maintain its leading position.\n\nEthereum is at a pivotal point in 2024 that could impact not only the future of the platform but also the direction of the entire crypto industry. With major technological upgrades and growing adoption in both retail and institutional sectors, Ethereum has the potential to play a central role in the next phase of crypto expansion. Ethereum\u2019s ability to continually evolve and face new challenges will be critical to how it shapes this promising future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our outlook for 2024 trends in Bitcoin and Ethereum, we cannot ignore the standout event: the fourth Bitcoin Halving, which is expected to take place on April 20, 2024. This key event in the Bitcoin economy is expected to have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry. Halving, which halves the reward for mining, increases Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and has often led to significant price movements in the past. This event will not only reignite interest in Bitcoin but could also impact market conditions for Ethereum and other crypto assets as it represents a fundamental shift in the supply and perception of Bitcoin. It\u2019s a moment of enormous significance for both investors and the industry as a whole, and one that could significantly shape the direction of the crypto industry in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn the third part of our series we focus on the currently leading altcoins: Solana, Polygon and Cardano.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Here\u2019s How High AI Thinks ETH Will Go After the 2024 Bitcoin Halving\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nEthereum price is forecasted to surge over +82% in the next 6 months to around $4,496 following the 2024 Bitcoin halving based on historical patterns.\n\nEthereum has historically performed well after previous Bitcoin halvings, with gains of 1.8% after 2016 and 88.6% after 2020\n\nUpcoming protocol upgrades like the EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding are expected to enable Ethereum to scale from 15 TPS initially to an estimated 1,000 TPS.\n\nExperts remain bullish on Ethereum's future, with price targets as high as $15,000 by the end of 2024. The ongoing developments make ETH well-positioned for the next crypto bull market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Here\u2019s How High AI Thinks ETH Will Go After the 2024 Bitcoin Halving\n\nRecently within the crypto space, all eyes are on the highly anticipated 2024 Bitcoin halving event. The upcoming halving is expected to usher in a new crypto bull market and have wide-reaching impacts across the industry. According to our algorithm, one digital asset poised for enormous growth following the 2024 halving is Ethereum.\n\nIt's not news that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, with a current market cap of over $200 billion. Powering billions in decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, the digital asset has firmly established itself as the leading smart contract platform.\n\nOur algorithm has forecasted that Ethereum could surge over +82% in the next 6 months to achieve a new high price of $4,496 following the 2024 Bitcoin halving. This bullish outlook is based on several key factors outlined below.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving Cycle\n\nFirst, let's review the Bitcoin halving and its historical effects. Bitcoin's code was designed to cut the block reward for miners in half every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every 4 years. This halves the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation.\n\nThe first halving was in 2012, the second in 2016, and the third in 2020. After each halving, Bitcoin has seen a dramatic surge in price over the following 12-18 months. For example, Bitcoin rose over 8,000% in the year after the 2012 halving.\n\nThis pattern has held true over the last decade, with each halving igniting tremendous momentum. Most industry experts anticipate the 2024 event will kick off Bitcoin's next major bull run. This macro tailwind could also lift prices across the crypto sector, including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's Price Performance After Previous Halvings\n\nAlthough a relatively new asset, Ethereum already has an impressive track record following Bitcoin's halving cycles.\n\nHowever, Ethereum was launched in 2015, so it wasn't around during the first Bitcoin halving but experienced the second halving in 2016. At that time, ETH was trading around $11. In the year following the halving, Ethereum's price surged a bit by 1.8% to around $11.7.\n\nThe second halving occurred in 2020, with ETH trading near $211. Over the next 3 months, Ethereum climbed over 88.6% to its all-time high above $398\n\nThis data shows Ethereum has benefited from the increased crypto activity surrounding past halvings. Even modest percentage gains would boost ETH significantly from today's price of approximately $2,426.\n\nRecent Developments Strengthening Ethereum's Outlook\n\nBeyond historical patterns, Ethereum's tech improvements and adoption metrics point to a very bullish future.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain underwent its largest upgrade ever, called the Merge. This transitioned Ethereum from an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus to a much greener proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nThe Merge paves the way for massive scaling upgrades like sharding. Lower fees and faster speeds which made Ethereum more usable for global mass adoption.\n\nAdditionally, developers are working on implementing EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. According to a report, the upcoming upgrade will introduce a new transaction type that can carry blobs of data. By attaching this additional data to blocks, EIP-4844 will increase throughput from 15 TPS to an estimated 1,000 TPS initially.\n\nFull danksharding based on EIP-4844 is expected to scale Ethereum to over 100,000 TPS, according to researchers. This major protocol upgrade demonstrates the ongoing innovation of Ethereum developers to meet the demands of global adoption.\n\nEthereum retains its dominance in crucial areas like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Billions of dollars worth of value flow through Ethereum dApps daily, indicating the network's maturity.\n\nMajor multinational corporations are also launching Ethereum-based initiatives, further demonstrating its advantages as an enterprise blockchain solution.\n\nExpert Price Predictions Support Ethereum's Outlook\n\nIn addition to AI forecasts, expert analysts in the crypto space also view Ethereum very favorably ahead of the 2024 halving.\n\nIn a recent report, JPMorgan analysts set a bullish target for ETH in 2024, saying, \"While we are cautious on overall crypto markets into 2024, we are looking for Ethereum to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies next year helped by the forthcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding\u201d.\n\nFinally, Crypto YouTuber and analyst Lark Davis predicts Ethereum could reach up to $15,000 by the end of 2024 and make a lot of people millionaires through Ethereum Layer-2-2assets.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nBottom line: The Key Takeaway on Ethereum's Future\n\nWhile short-term volatility in crypto markets will continue, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears decisively bullish. Driven by the 2024 Bitcoin halving, ongoing technological progress, and maturing global adoption, Ethereum is firmly on the path toward capturing greater value."

        "content": "Key Takeaway\n\nCOTI achieved a major development milestone by successfully integrating MPC protocol into its upcoming COTI V2 architecture.\n\nMPC enables private computation on sensitive data, providing privacy benefits needed for enterprise/consumer adoption.\n\nCOTI's MPC implementation distributes encrypted user data across endpoints that collaboratively compute results.\n\nThe integration of MPC lays the groundwork for COTI V2's enhanced privacy, security and compliance capabilities.\n\nCOTI V2 aims to leverage technologies like MPC and zk-Rollups to maximise performance, scalability and privacy on Ethereum Layer 2.\n\nCOTI, a digital payment network looking to upgrade into a privacy-focused Layer 2 on Ethereum, recently achieved an integral milestone that advances its development roadmap.\n\nAfter months of work, COTI successfully completed designing and integrating a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol into its upcoming COTI V2 architecture. MPC refers to a sophisticated cryptography technique that allows a group of parties to jointly compute results from private data without exposing the underlying data.\n\nThis privacy-preserving functionality will serve as a core component powering the COTI V2 network. By leveraging MPC, COTI V2 will enable developers to build decentralised applications that handle sensitive user information securely and competently.\n\nImportance of Privacy for Blockchain Adoption\n\nCOTI's push into MPC signals a growing focus on privacy across the blockchain industry. As enterprises and consumers look to leverage blockchain technology, concerns around data exposure have frequently arisen as obstacles to adoption.\n\nIntegrating privacy enhancements like MPC aims to remove these adoption barriers by proving blockchains can offer confidentiality guarantees comparable to traditional systems. The ability to compute sensitive information without compromising data could open up a wide range of valuable use cases.\n\nHow MPC Protects Data Privacy\n\nMPC involves distributing data inputs across endpoints controlled by different parties. These endpoints encrypt the data in a collaborative process that maintains confidentiality while still allowing computations to occur.\n\nIn COTI's implementation, user data gets submitted to MPC endpoints in an encrypted state. The endpoints run computational workloads on this data to produce outputs that may be public or encrypted for specific users. No single endpoint ever has full access to the plaintext inputs or sensitive intermediate data.\n\nCOTI relied on advanced cryptography, like garbled circuits, to realise this complex choreography. These one-time executable structures translate pseudo-contracts into encrypted computational blueprints. After use, the garbled circuits get destroyed to prevent potential misuse.\n\nIntegrating MPC into the COTI Tech Stack\n\nCOTI's push into MPC highlights the technology's growing popularity as projects search for \"best of both worlds\" solutions that merge public blockchains and private data. MPC unlocks this hybrid model through its mathematical assurances of data confinement during off-chain computations.\n\nThe company emphasised that this milestone is only the first of many on its stacked development roadmap for 2023. COTI plans to share more updates as work progresses on other components, like its extended EVM module and revamped staking model.\n\nThe scope of upgrades in the works signifies COTI's ambitious vision for its Ethereum L2 rollout. By zeroing in on features like MPC and zk-Rollups, the project aims to offer users some of the highest performance, scalability, and privacy available on Layer 2.\n\nCOTI first emerged in 2017 as a fintech-focused payments network built on its own bespoke blockchain. Its native token currently boasts a market cap of over $150 million.\n\nThe pivot to an Ethereum sidechain optimises COTI's positioning and technology stack for the maturing Web3 landscape. It also opens up integration opportunities with the thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystems on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe road to COTI V2's launch remains long and challenging with its intense development schedule and demanding requirements. However, progress like the latest MPC milestone provides promising indicators that the team's lofty architectural ambitions can materialise into reality."
