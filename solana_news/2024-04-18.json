        "title": "BlobScriptions: A New Type of Inscription on Ethereum - Unchained",
        "content": "BlobScriptions made waves in the Ethereum community as a new type of inscription, similar to Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum blockchain underwent the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, introducing a concept called Blobs. Blobs are a novel data storage concept intended to lower transaction costs on layer 2 scaling solutions. While the concept was intended primarily to lower costs, some creators used blobs to develop \u201cBlobScriptions.\u201d\n\nRead on to learn what BlobScriptions are, how they work, and their similarities to Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\nWhat Are BlobScriptions?\n\nBlobScriptions are Ethscriptions that use EIP-4844 blobs to store additional data. Blobs, or binary large objects, were introduced to the network in the latest Ethereum network upgrade in March as a cost-effective solution for storing data on-chain. However, their \u2018misuse\u2019 is now dubbed BlobScriptions.\n\nTom Lehman and Michael Hirsch developed the concept by launching BlobScriptions.io, a platform enabling anyone to inscribe data onto a blob.\n\nTheir proposal, ESIP-8, was to use blobs to store data within the Etherscriptions Protocol, enabling data storage and allowing users to access blob data alongside other blockchain data currently utilized by the protocol.\n\nLehman said the idea was a means of democratizing blobs, making them available for everyone. For a fee of about $20, anyone, potentially including bots, can submit a BlobScription since blobs have made data storage on Ethereum 10x to 100x cheaper.\n\nHow Do BlobScriptions Work?\n\nBlobScriptions function similarly to Bitcoin inscriptions, allowing users to store various data types on Ethereum\u2019s blobs, including images, text, and even tokens. Blobs are unique because they don\u2019t interact with smart contracts, and nodes only need to store them for up to 18 days, making them cost-effective.\n\nWhen sharing data using blobs, one requires the content itself and the content type. Initially, data URIs were used to achieve this, but to make BlobScriptions cheaper; its creators implemented CBOR, which natively supports binary data.\n\nOnce the BlobScription payload is prepared, it needs to be split into one or more blobs, each consisting of 32-byte segments. These blobs are then sent as transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethscriptions indexer, Ethereum RPC, and the Beacon API are then used to retrieve blobs. Using their versioned hashes, the blobs can be associated with individual transactions.\n\nAfter retrieving a transaction\u2019s blobs, they can be decoded and concatenated into a single binary value using Viem\u2019s \u201cfromBlobs\u201d method. This decoded data includes the content and content type, forming an \u201cEthscription Attachment,\u201d also called a BlobScription. The indexer can then serve the attachment content via its API.\n\nRegarding the concern about blobs being removed from storage after 18 days, Ethscriptions indexers and other decentralized data stores retain the data, ensuring that as long as someone has it, the BlobScriptions can still be used.\n\nHow to Create a BlobScription on Ethereum\n\nTo create a BlobScription on Ethereum, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Visit the BlobScription Website\n\nYou need to first visit the BlobScription website to begin the process. Click on \u201cCreate a burner for me.\u201d This creates a new wallet and imports the private key to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.\n\nAfter importing, double-check if the displayed address matches your own.\n\nStep 2: Enter the Initial Owner\n\nThe next step requires you to specify the individual or entity credited with creating the BlobScription on the blockchain.\n\nStep 3: Choose a File\n\nYou will then select the data you want to store on the Ethereum blockchain via the BlobScription.\n\nStep 4: Create BlobScription\n\nClick the \u201cCreate BlobScription\u201d button to finalize the process, and you have successfully created your first BlobScription!\n\nBlobScriptions vs. Bitcoin Inscriptions: Similarities & Differences\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the similarities and differences between BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions.\n\nHere are some of the aspects in which they are similar:\n\nData storage purpose: BlobScriptions and Ordinal inscriptions allow users to embed data directly onto the blockchain. This data could include text, images, or any other digital content.\n\nImmutable storage: Once data on BlobSriptions and Ordinal inscriptions is embedded, it becomes part of the blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger. Hence, the data cannot be altered or deleted.\n\nStill, BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions have several differences, as outlined in the tale below.\n\nFeature BlobScriptions Bitcoin Inscriptions Blockchain Ethereum Bitcoin Data storage On Ethereum\u2019s blobs On the Bitcoin blockchain Introduced After Dencun upgrade in March 2024 After Taproot upgrade Transaction type Data is inscribed onto blobs Data is attached to individual satoshis (sats) Cost Cost-effective as blob transactions have lower fees compared to calldata transactions Bitcoin Inscription fees depend on the size of the data being inscribed Permanence Data is temporary on Ethereum\u2019s main network and may be preserved by external indexers Data remains on the Bitcoin blockchain indefinitely\n\nFinal Word\n\nMany Ethereum enthusiasts anticipate that the hype and use of BlobScriptions will be short-lived.\n\nAccording to Jim McDonald, co-founder of Ethereum staking provider Attestant, there\u2019s an expectation that the pricing of blobs for layer 2 solutions will become more reasonable for their intended purpose over time. This could render Ethereum too costly for those seeking to utilize it merely as a \u201cgraffiti wall.\u201d\n\nHowever, if BlobScriptions continue to gain traction or remain stable, the price of layer 2 solutions, significantly reduced by the March software upgrade, might increase more rapidly than anticipated. This could necessitate the development of new tools, and additional upgrades could be needed to lower the prices."

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Drops Below $60,000, Ethereum (ETH) Says Goodbye to $3,000, Solana (SOL) Strength Disappears: Is Bull Market Over? - U.Today",

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bitcoin roller coaster has taken another dive, breaking below the $60,000 mark and unsettling the market. This recent dip sees the cryptocurrency dipping its toes into the $58,000 territory, the least-expected move by the market. The fall through what many considered a solid support level at $60,000 is causing some panic.\n\nThis unsettling movement could have been seen as a dark cloud, but there is a silver lining that has the crypto faithful watching the calendar: the Bitcoin halving. Slated for around April 20, this event is historically known for shaking up the market in unexpected ways. The halving could tighten supply and potentially swing the pendulum back in favor of higher prices.\n\n\n\nLooking at the charts with a magnifying glass, we can see that Bitcoin's next support test lies at $58,572, just a stone's throw from where it is currently. If it fails to hold this line, the descent might continue toward the $50,319 area, where the next safety net lies.\n\nBut let's not write off Bitcoin just yet. If it can rally back and crack through the $60,000 ceiling again, it might just push back to its recent comfort zone. The first sign of recovery will be reclaiming ground above this critical level, with eyes then set on the $68,789 marker \u2014 a formidable resistance that could block the path to its previous highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's farewell\n\nEthereum's slide below $3,000 is more than just a number \u2014 it is a signal. It tells us that the confidence that was pushing prices up is shaky. The drop has been steep enough to make even the staunchest supporters a bit nervous about what's coming next.\n\nWe have spotted some levels that could tell us where things might head. Right now, Ethereum is testing the waters below the $3,000 line. If it does not climb back up soon, the next floor might be around the $2,800 mark, a point that could offer some resistance to the fall. On the chance that Ethereum finds its feet again, watch out for the $3,200 ceiling \u2014 it is the next battle to win for recovery hopes.\n\nThere is a real chance that ETH could keep dropping, especially if it does not get back above $3,000 quickly. But with the halving in play, it is too early to count it out. A surge of inflows to the market might change the situation in favor of bulls quicker than anticipated.\n\nSolana remains suppressed\n\nSolana, the cryptocurrency that has been on many investors' watchlists, is showing signs of strain. After a period of growth, SOL has slipped through what was a strong support level at around $130, and now folks are worried. If prices keep heading south and pass below the $100 mark, it could spell real trouble.\n\nKey indicators that many traders look to for signs of healing, like RSI and moving averages, have been breached. Currently, Solana struggles to find a proper footing for the price.\n\nThe situation looks tense. With the support at $130 now a thing of the past, the next checkpoint is at $100.\n\nYet, not all hope is lost. There is still a chance for a turnaround. Growth could be around the corner if Solana manages to rally and break through resistance levels, particularly around $150, which could act as a ladder to climb back up from its current position.\n\nThe future of Solana is not set in stone. If it finds strength and pushes above these resistance levels, it might just regain its previous momentum. But if it continues to fall, the drop below $100 could be a hard reality check for the coin and its investors."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong Could Lead to 'More Progressive' Policies in China: OSL - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAt the start of the week, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were conditionally approved in Hong Kong. Alongside this news, digital assets platform OSL announced it will be a \u201csub-custodian partner\u201d for both the China Asset Management, also known as ChinaAMC (HK), and Harvest Global Investment ETFs.\n\nLooking forward, OSL's CEO believes that these ETFs could lead to a wave of \u201cmore progressive\u201d regulation in China and potentially cause a ripple effect across the region.\n\n\u201c[It] is likely to set a precedent for other financial markets in Asia,\u201d Patrick Pan, Chairman of the Board and CEO of OSL, told Decrypt. \u201cFor China, this development in Hong Kong solidifies Hong Kong\u2019s place as a unique financial center for innovations and may influence future regulatory considerations and market openness towards crypto, potentially leading to more progressive policies aligned with global standards.\u201d\n\nChina has a long and rocky history with cryptocurrencies\u2014effectively banning crypto multiple times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresently, there are rigorous regulatory controls over cryptocurrency transactions, expressly prohibiting the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges within its territory,\u201d Thomas Zhu, the ChinaAMC (HK) head of digital assets and head of family office business, told Decrypt.\n\nBut with Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region controlled by China\u2014which has been called a \u2018testing ground\u2019 for China\u2014its financial decisions may set the table for future movements on mainland China.\n\nLooking at the wider continent, both firms see the approval of spot ETFs as a catalyst for regulatory evolution.\n\n\u201cIt may prompt regulators to accelerate their own frameworks to accommodate such products, which may lead to a broader acceptance and deeper integration of cryptocurrency into the Asian financial landscape,\u201d Zhu said, \u201cpotentially setting the stage for a new era of digital asset trading and investment in the region.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, crypto-friendly countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore could be the first to be influenced, Zhu suggested.\n\nThe United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January\u201411 years after the first application for a U.S. Bitcoin ETF was filed. This is a stark contrast to Hong Kong\u2019s process, which OSL said has only taken four months.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., where the legal framework and regulatory landscape have been highly fragmented\u2014and at times, vulnerable to highly polarized political cycles\u2014the journey for spot crypto ETF products has been far more arduous.\u201d Pan told Decrypt. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s framework has managed to prove once again that it can be mobilized quickly to innovate, while ensuring robust investor protection, setting a benchmark for crypto-related financial products in Asia.\u201d\n\nDespite this, the U.S. still beat Hong Kong to the punch. That means Hong Kong regulators and potential ETF issuers have been able to study the impact that spot crypto funds might have on the market. One primary lesson: ETFs significantly drive demand. The firms that spoke to Decrypt think it will be no different this time around.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a similar uplift in Hong Kong,\u201d Pan said. \u201cGiven the structured and familiar investment mechanism of these ETFs, akin to those in traditional finance, they are likely to facilitate education and adoption among local investors. This positions the Hong Kong market to potentially experience substantial growth, tapping into a deep well of enthusiasm and capital.\u201d\n\nWith Hong Kong\u2019s population a fraction of the size of the U.S., its impact on the wider crypto ecosystem is likely to be less pronounced than January\u2019s spot ETF approvals. But the ripple effect it could have on China and the rest of Asia may dwarf anything the U.S. could muster.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott and Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Uncertain Rally, Ethereum (ETH) Dips Amid Whale Moves, Furrever Token (FURR) Offers Up to 15X Returns - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape constantly evolves, investors and market observers are closely monitoring several key developments that could shape the sector's future. Among these are Bitcoin's upcoming halving event, Ethereum's current price fluctuations due to significant whale activity, and the rise of new players like Furrever Token (FURR), which seeks to carve out a niche with its unique approach and potential high returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Cautions Against Expecting a Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving Event\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community braces for this year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, scheduled around April 19-20, JPMorgan has issued a less than optimistic forecast. Contrary to the significant price surges that followed previous halvings, the banking giant predicts that Bitcoin might not only fail to rally but could potentially see a decline in value.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin halvings have been pivotal moments that typically led to bullish market behavior. The process involves halving the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This mechanism serves as a counter to inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, such events have boosted the cryptocurrency's market price significantly within a year of occurrence. For instance, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin's price increased from $12 to $135 over the next 300 days.\n\nHowever, this year's scenario presents a unique backdrop. According to JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, the current market conditions are \"overbought\". Bitcoin's price, hovering around $61,200, is well above the $45,000 mark when adjusted for volatility in comparison with gold. This elevated baseline, combined with the peak price reached a month before the halving\u2014a first in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2014suggests a different outcome might be unfolding this time around.\n\nAdding to the cautious outlook, Goldman Sachs has also advised prudence. The firm highlighted the unpredictable macroeconomic factors currently at play, which could influence Bitcoin's performance differently compared to past cycles. Despite previous patterns of price appreciation post-halving, Goldman Sachs warns against assuming similar outcomes this year, given the distinct global economic conditions.\n\nThis tempered expectation marks a significant shift in sentiment among financial giants regarding the crypto market's behavior following the halving. As the event nears, the cryptocurrency community and investors are keeping a watchful eye, prepared for a range of possibilities that diverge from the historical norm.\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Continues as ICO Whale Offloads Significant ETH Holdings\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently experiencing heightened volatility, underscored by a recent 4% drop in price amid broader crypto market fluctuations. This latest dip has triggered a wave of speculation about the future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKey to the current market unrest is the activity of an ICO whale who has significantly reduced their holdings, selling off 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at a rate of $2,997 each. This move comes after additional transactions where the same whale offloaded 5,110 ETH on various platforms, with the price per ETH approximately at $2,545. Despite this large-scale sell-off, the whale still possesses about 29,700 ETH, which currently values approximately $89.4 million, held primarily across staking platforms.\n\nAdding to the market\u2019s unease, Whale Alert has flagged more Ethereum moving towards exchanges. Notably, an unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH to Coinbase, worth roughly $32.13 million, followed by another transaction of 10,726 ETH to the same exchange, valued at around $31.90 million.\n\nThese substantial movements to a major exchange like Coinbase are raising alarms about potential further increases in Ethereum\u2019s price volatility. However, amid these concerns, some analysts maintain a cautious optimism, buoyed by positive developments such as the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which may indicate a rebound or stabilization in the market soon.\n\nMoreover, with the cryptocurrency community looking forward to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, there is anticipation that this might also spur positive movements in Ethereum's price.\n\nAs the situation develops, Ethereum's current trading price stands at $2,978.31, marking a decrease of 3.45% from the previous day, with a trading volume that has risen by 10.77% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, Ethereum's price has seen a substantial 16% decline over the past week and an 18% drop over the last month, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty and the speculative nature of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Emerges as a Strong Contender Against Established Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) is carving out a niche for itself with a current price of $0.000564 and promising features that could potentially outperform major players like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON). What sets Furrever Token apart is its unique appeal rooted in the universal love for cute kitties, aiming to create a delightful and engaging experience for its users.\n\nThe charm of Furrever Token extends beyond its cat-themed aesthetics, encompassing a range of stickers, emojis, and visuals that enhance the user interface. This strategy not only enriches the community experience but also strengthens the bond among its members, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nOperating on the BNB-20 blockchain, the Furrever Token is designed with favorable tokenomics. About 65% of its tokens were made available during the presale, with the remainder distributed between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the development team. This distribution strategy promotes fairness and ensures the longevity and stability of the project.\n\nFinancially, Furrever Token is not just about the novelty; it offers significant return potential, boasting up to 15X returns which highlights its attractiveness as an investment. To secure its platform and user investments, the token has undergone rigorous audits, emphasizing its commitment to security and compliance.\n\nThe project\u2019s dedication is further evidenced by its active community engagement and transparent communication, critical factors that contribute to its growing legitimacy and appeal as an investment.\n\nAs Furrever Token continues to evolve and attract attention in the crypto market, its innovative integration of fun elements with serious financial prospects positions it as a formidable alternative to well-established cryptocurrencies like Solana and Toncoin. With strong community support and distinctive features, Furrever Token is poised to make a significant impact on the future landscape of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Crashes to Three-Month Low, ETH Price Recovers to $3,100 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Earlier today, amid news of the escalating geopolitical tensions and the Israel-Iran conflict, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market faced severe selling pressure. However, this dip once again met with a strong buying interest from investors. With the Ethereum price dropping to $2,877 earlier today, bulls are staging a strong recovery once again to $3,100.\n\nEthereum Gas Fee Drops to 3-Month Low\n\nRecent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals a notable decrease in transaction costs on the Ethereum network. The cost of conducting a transaction on Ethereum has plummeted to $2.07, marking a significant reduction from the $15.21 recorded on March 4th during a period of heightened demand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts at Santiment suggest that transaction fees on the Ethereum network often reflect prevailing sentiments within the cryptocurrency market. During periods of extreme bullishness, characterized by the belief that crypto assets are poised for significant price increases (\u201cTo the Moon\u201d), transaction fees tend to peak. Conversely, during phases of pessimism when sentiments lean towards the belief that cryptocurrency markets are in decline (\u201cCrypto is Dead\u201d), transaction fees typically revert to lower levels.\n\nThis pattern of transaction fees mirroring market sentiment underscores the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets. Peaks in transaction fees often coincide with price tops for Ethereum, while periods of low transaction costs are observed around price bottoms.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Layer-1 competitors like Solana have witnessed a huge surge in DeFi activity along with the recent meme coin frenzy. This competition has also led to network decongestion on Ethereum thereby keeping the gas fee on the lower side.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum made another attempt at recovery but encountered resistance near the $3,100 mark, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s struggles. Despite stabilizing above $3,000 initially, a bearish sentiment prevailed, pushing the price below this support level to briefly dip below $2,900. The bottom was established at $2,867 before a rebound ensued.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is in the process of recovering from its losses, having surpassed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement from $3,278 to $2,867. However, it continues to trade below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nThe immediate hurdle for Ethereum lies near the $3,020 level, followed by a significant resistance zone around $3,070, coinciding with both the 100-hourly SMA and a key bearish trend line forming on the hourly ETH/USD chart. Further resistance is anticipated around $3,120, aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A successful breach above $3,120 could pave the way for a potential upswing towards the $3,200 mark.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Eyes All-Time High: Changelly Analysis Predicts Surge After Bitcoin Halving - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Despite Hong Kong\u2019s ETF approval, Ethereum sees increased liquidations and bearish sentiment, with shorts rising by 54%.\n\nEthereum faces price volatility due to geopolitical tensions and regulatory concerns, dipping below $3,000 briefly this week.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced significant price volatility this week, briefly dipping below the $3,000 mark. This downturn followed a combination of geopolitical tensions and market sentiments surrounding regulatory developments.\n\nTensions between Iran and Israel contributed to market jitters, suppressing the positive impact of Hong Kong\u2019s approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as previously reported by Crypto News Flash. Investors exercised caution across the cryptocurrency landscape, with Bitcoin and other altcoins also experiencing losses. Notably, Ethereum saw a 20% decrease in risk reversals on Tuesday, indicating heightened nervousness among investors.\n\nData from Santiment revealed a surge in Ethereum liquidations, totaling over $81.9 million within 24 hours. Long positions accounted for the majority of liquidations, totaling $67.4 million. The largest liquidation, valued at $6 million, stemmed from an ETH-USD swap. Moreover, discussions surrounding Ethereum intensified after the Hong Kong ETF was approved, making it the most trending token among traders. However, bearish sentiment persisted, as evidenced by a 54% rise in ETH shorts.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Issuance Reduction Proposal\n\nDespite recent developments, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s proposal to reduce ETH issuance garnered attention. Glassnode\u2019s report highlighted ongoing criticism of the proposal despite clarifications emphasizing its aim to maintain Ethereum\u2019s status as a form of currency and balance governance power within the network.\n\nGlassnode also addressed the rise of restaking and liquid restaking tokens, impacting Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate and holders. These tokens, offering significantly high yields, facilitate a wealth transfer from non-staked ETH holders to staked counterparts. Consequently, there is a potential shift in the \u201creal yield\u201d and the role of money within the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially favoring projects issuing derivative tokens.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis conducted by Changelly, a prominent cryptocurrency data provider, Ethereum could experience a notable surge in price following the Bitcoin halving. Changelly predicts that on April 21, 2024, just one day after the halving event, Ethereum could reach a price of $3,171.61. This forecast has sparked optimism among Ethereum investors, who eagerly anticipate the potential for significant gains.\n\nChangelly\u2019s analysis extends beyond the immediate aftermath of the Bitcoin halving, offering a bullish long-term outlook for Ethereum. By June 2025, Changelly suggests that Ethereum could surpass its previous all-time high and reach an impressive price of $4,964.07. Such a milestone would mark a new record for the cryptocurrency, signaling continued growth and potential for further appreciation.\n\nEthereum Struggles to Break Key Resistance\n\nETH\u2019s price trajectory has been marked by challenges in surmounting key resistance levels, particularly the $3,200 mark. The cryptocurrency remains below this critical threshold, along with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, signaling persistent bearish pressure. Additionally, a notable bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD, sourced via Kraken.\n\n\n\nFollowing a brief period of consolidation, Ethereum experienced a minor recovery attempt, briefly surpassing the $3,000 resistance zone. However, this upward momentum was stifled as bears asserted control near the $3,280 resistance zone, resulting in a subsequent downturn. The price retraced below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move from the $2,536 swing low to the $3,278 high, underscoring the prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "content": "Chainwire Telos Partners with Ponos Technology to Develop Hardware-Accelerated Ethereum L2 zkEVM Network Telos collaborates with Ponos Technology to create a hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network, aiming to significantly enhance scalability and data protection through innovative Zero Knowledge technology integration. Chainwire \u00b7 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more \u203a\n\nDubai, United Arab Emirates, April 19th, 2024, Chainwire \u2013 The Telos Foundation today announced that it will work with Ponos Technology, the leading Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) research and development firm, to develop an end-to-end optimized, hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network featuring SNARKtor, the Telos-developed decentralized recursive proof aggregator. The teams will take a hardware-software co-design approach that will help unlock new possibilities in terms of massive scalability, greater data protection and trustless interoperability for Ethereum users globally.\n\nPonos Technology provides end-to-end optimized solutions for ZK proving, which is essentially achieved by leveraging FPGA acceleration, thus maximizing business value streams through cost-performance optimized computation by matching hardware-software co-designed modules and dedicated execution environments. The team includes a unique blend of experienced scientists and highly skilled industry experts that have accumulated deep technical knowledge on all aspects of ZKPs.\n\n\u201cZero Knowledge technology is going to become increasingly mainstream and can open the door to increased efficiency and security across so many industries,\u201d said Slobodan Lukovic, CEO and co-founder, Ponos Technology. \u201cSimilarly to AI, steady enhancements in algorithms coupled with advancements in underlying hardware infrastructures will enable commoditization of ZKPs and result in the technology being widely adopted in the near future.\u201d\n\nTelos will also be working with several other new partners during the development cycle, including:\n\nDigital M.O.B. \u2013 One of the strongest Ethereum developer teams in the world, having worked on projects including MetaMask, MakerDAO and Gnosis, among others.\n\nATKA \u2013 A Paris-based end-to-end Web3 incubator that has helped incubate world class projects such as Morpho and Mangrove, and whom Telos announced a strategic partnership with in March 2024.\n\nCometh \u2013 An award-winning dev team led by ETH France President Jerome de Tychey, who joined Telos as a technical EVM advisor also in March 2024.\n\nTelos Executive Director John Lilic, who helped lead pioneering teams at Consensys and Polygon in addition to maintaining his role as a Top 50 Web3 angel investor, will help coordinate and support the transformation. He will work closely with Alberto Garoffolo, Head of ZK technology at Telos and co-author of the SNARKtor whitepaper, and Jesse Schulman, CTO and Head of Engineering at Telos.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, Ethereum will need to take a hardware-software co-design approach in order to realize zkEVM performance at tremendous scale,\u201d said Lilic. \u201cThat\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking with Ponos Technology and our growing partner network as we build a hardware-accelerated zkEVM L2. We believe that this formula, alongside the exciting work our team is doing with recursive proofs via SNARKtor, is going to offer compelling services to the Ethereum community and beyond.\u201d\n\nTelos was created in 2018 through a fair drop network launch that did not include an ICO nor token sale. Over the past six years, the Telos Foundation has helped steward the development of two primary networks \u2013 Telos EVM and Telos Zero \u2013 and will now also focus on building a highly performant and succinctly provable L2 zkEVM.\n\nAdditional details on the Telos L2 will continue to be announced in the lead up to EthCC in July, for which Telos is a primary sponsor. Live in Brussels from EthCC, the Telos team plans to broadcast its first-ever demo of SNARKtor to the world as a precursor to the official launch of the Telos L2.\n\nAbout Telos\n\nTelos is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that includes Telos EVM, which tested as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine globally, and its high-speed consensus layer, Telos Zero. The project is also focused on expanding its capabilities with novel Zero Knowledge technology through the development of a hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network powered by SNARKtor, which promises to enhance privacy and scalability for global use cases. Telos is overseen by The Telos Foundation, an ownerless foundation dedicated to advancing the Telos blockchain network and its community.\n\nContact\n\nThe Telos Foundation\n\n[email protected]\n\nShare"

        "content": "Ethereum could fall under the $3k psychological support zone soon\n\nMetrics flashed a strong buy signal, but there\u2019s more that investors need to consider\n\nLately, Ethereum [ETH] has seen bearish sentiments strengthen behind it. In fact, a Santiment post on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that both Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum saw a hike in bear posting ahead of the halving.\n\nNegative engagement on social media saw a positive change on 18 April when BTC bounced to $64.1k and ETH to $3,094. AMBCrypto analyzed other metrics to understand if investors should be buying ETH now.\n\nDrop in gas fee could be a disguised threat\n\nAMBCrypto noted that the Open Interest behind Ethereum has slid dramatically over the last ten days. It fell from a peak of $7 billion on 9 April (Ethereum priced at $3638) to $4.6 billion, at press time (Ethereum priced at $2997).\n\nThe sharp decline in OI meant speculators feared going long and lacked bullish conviction. It conveyed bearish sentiment. The 1-day RSI was also below neutral 50 for the most part since 18 March. This implied that momentum has favoured the sellers for a month now.\n\nThe average fees on the network have also been in decline. A recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that although it is a positive for users, it also points to a drop in demand for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nAddressing the buying opportunity\n\nThe $3k psychological support zone would have been a fantastic buying opportunity a month ago. It still might prove to be. The 90-day MVRV ratio was below zero at press time, showing an undervalued asset and holders at a loss.\n\nHowever, the mean coin age has adamantly trended higher for three weeks. Together, they signalled investors to buy Ethereum.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAnd yet, the dormant circulation saw a massive spike on 18 April. This highlighted a flurry of token movements and could foreshadow a wave of selling. Moreover, Bitcoin was barely hanging on to the $61k support zone at the time of writing.\n\nPatience and prudence could be extremely beneficial for investors. The likelihood of another sell-off is still high. The possibility of another month or two of consolidation following the halving, in light of recent overheated market conditions, is high too."

        "content": "The Ethereum price faces turbulence as it witnesses a decline of nearly 4% amid the broader crypto market fluctuations. Meanwhile, the recent dip in the ETH price has fuelled discussions in the crypto market, with investors speculating over the potential price movements in the coming days.\n\nNotably, the recent whale activities, especially from an ICO whale, have heightened speculations about Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, adding to investor concerns.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Activities Sparks Concerns Over Ethereum Price\n\nThe Ethereum price has witnessed a notable decline over the last few days, especially after the U.S. SEC potentially delayed approving the Ethereum ETF approval. In addition, the investigation by the U.S. SEC over Ethereum\u2019s security status has further dampened the investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the topsy-turvy scenario in the market, Spot On Chain, an on-chain data provider, revealed significant activity from an Ethereum ICO participant. This participant sold 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at $2,997, indicating a sizable offload of Ethereum assets.\n\nNotably, the whale, who initially acquired 33,213 ETH during Ethereum\u2019s Genesis ICO in 2015, has already deposited 5,110 ETH to Kraken or sold via DEX at approximately $2,545. However, despite this sell-off, the whale still holds approximately 29.7K ETH, valued at $89.4 million, across three wallets, primarily within staking platforms.\n\nIn addition, Whale Alert reported additional Ethereum transactions suggestive of potential whale dumps. An unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH, worth $32.13 million, to the Coinbase exchange, while another whale moved 10,726 ETH, valued at around $31.90 million, to the same exchange.\n\nThese sizable transfers to the leading crypto exchange have intensified concerns among investors regarding increased volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. However, amid these worries, analysts are cautiously optimistic about a potential market resurgence, driven by anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event.\n\nAlso Read: Cardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson Believes RFK Jr Is The Best Presidential Candidate\n\nPrice Performance & Market Sentiment\n\nIn a noteworthy development, the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong has injected optimism into the market. This regulatory milestone has uplifted sentiment among market participants, offering a glimmer of hope amid the current market turbulence.\n\nWhile uncertainties loom over Ethereum\u2019s short-term performance due to whale activities, the broader crypto market remains buoyed by positive developments such as regulatory approvals and anticipation of significant events like the Bitcoin Halving. It\u2019s worth noting that several analysts have also warned about potential short-term volatility during the Halving event.\n\nMeanwhile, as of writing, the Ethereum price traded at $2,978.31, down 3.45% from yesterday, while its trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 10.77% to $18.58 billion. Notably, the Ethereum price has plunged over 16% over the last seven days, while noting a monthly decline of around 18%.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s L2 Merlin Chain Unleashes Half of MERL Airdrop Tokens at TGE\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "ETH has corrected as much as 17% over the week, and could fall further below $2,400.\n\nThe market sentiment for ETH was neutral as of this writing.\n\nEthereum [ETH] dipped below $3,000 in the last 24 hours, following a 3.24% fall in its price, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency has corrected as much as 17% over the week, as bulls struggled to overcome the downward volatility in the broader market.\n\nHowever, market participants seem to be reacting differently to the ongoing slump, with some profit-taking on their investments while others accumulating ETH at lowered prices.\n\nTo buy or to sell?\n\nAccording to on-chain tracking data platform Lookonchain, a whale known for dip-buying, purchased 3,279 ETH, worth $9.75 million at prevailing prices, on Wednesday.\n\nThe influential investor has been doubling on their ETH investments lately, and held a whopping 86,457 ETH tokens as of the 17th of April.\n\nTo the contrary, a whale who was an active participant in the initial coin offering (ICO) in 2o15, sold 2,000 ETH at a selling price of $2,997, data from Spot On Chain showed.\n\nThe whale received 33,213 ETH as part of the ICO, at a price of $0.31.

        "content": "Bitcoin price update: After taking investors on a rollercoaster for the last two weeks, the crypto market started to move up on Friday, hours before Bitcoin halving. Investors who had been anxiously waiting for the green light rallied behind BTC price and also the altcoins, most of which are witnessing modest gains.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network, is up 1.6% in the last 24 hours and trading at $3,105. Similarly, Solana moved in tandem with the rest of the market, with its value rising by 6.5% to $145.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana plummeted to $120 last weekend as geopolitical tensions ravaged through the market, leaving behind liquidations in billions of dollars and investors counting losses.\n\nThe cumulative market cap has gone up by a staggering 5.4% to $2.47 trillion in just a day, underscoring the bullish outlook in the wider market. Select altcoins moved in double-digits like Toncoin\u2019s 17% surge to $7.20 and Internet Computer\u2019s 11% increase to $13.\n\nBitcoin price Update: Is The BTC\u2019s Sudden Move Topping $65,000 Sustainable?\n\nAs Bitcoin halving approaches, the buzz in the market catches momentum, encouraging investors to bet on further movement toward the $70,000. From a 24-hour low of $59,651, Bitcoin price sits above $65,000 toward the end of the European session on Friday.\n\nA sizeable 15% bump in the volume upholds the improving sentiment and rising interest among traders. Another 5% surge in the market cap to $1.28 solidifies BTC\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBased on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the four-hour chart, the ongoing movement seeking higher support above $65,000 could be sustainable in the short term, especially if the hype around the halving continues.\n\nMeanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is in line to prevent BTC from correcting significantly below $65,000. However, it is wise to prepare for a short-lived sweep for fresh liquidity at the black ascending trend line.\n\nA daily close above $65,000 would signal another confirmation of the uptrend eyeing $70,000 post-halving. The red band on the chart represents potential selling pressure and may delay the rally.\n\nBitcoin ETF Net Outflow Volume Shrinks\n\nRising net outflows in the Bitcoin ETF have been putting pressure on the price and the market, adding to the uncertainty due to the tensions in West Asia. Iran for the first time in history directly attacked Israel, sending over 300 ballistic missiles in its airspace.\n\nIf the war in West Asia escalates due to Israel\u2019s potential retaliation to Iran\u2019s attack, the global risk asset markets including crypto could suffer even more.\n\nHowever, SoSoValue shows that the total daily net outflow volume in the ETF market declined to only $4.39 million on Thursday. Grayscale is still posting the highest outflow volumes, with $89.99 million withdrawn from GBTC ETF on April 18.\n\nThere has also been a shift in the best-performing ETFs, with Fidelity leading the net inflow with $37 million and BlackRock coming second with $18.76 million.\n\nThe Bitcoin price rally in Q1 to a new ATH of $73,737 as seen on CoinGecko was mainly fuelled by growing demand for the ETF.\n\nExperts say that demand for the ETF coupled with the impact of Bitcoin halving on the supply of the scarce digital asset would be the ingredients like to make the next bull run. Bitcoin price is expected to peak above $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "You Might Be Surprised By the 2 Cryptos That Billionaire Mark Cuban Is Buying for His Portfolio - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The search is on for cryptocurrencies with real-world utility.\n\nFor many investors, billionaire Mark Cuban may be best known as one of the investors on the popular ABC program Shark Tank. But for crypto enthusiasts, Cuban is best known as a champion of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin during the previous crypto bull market rally.\n\nSo what is Cuban buying during the recent crypto bull market? The names might surprise you. He's expanding beyond just the two big cryptocurrencies -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- in search of utility coins that promise to deliver real-world use cases. Let's take a closer look at what he's adding to his portfolio.\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon (MATIC -2.23%) is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, helping it to run cheaper, faster, and more efficiently. You can think of Polygon as a secondary blockchain that sits on top of the core Ethereum blockchain. By doing so, it can mitigate some of the pricing and congestion issues typically faced by Ethereum users.\n\nThat's a clear example of utility, and it's easy to see why Cuban is all aboard the Polygon train. After Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin laid out the blockchain's strategic roadmap for 2024, he made it a point to highlight the growing role played by Layer-2 scaling solutions. Right now, the future growth story for Ethereum is all about enabling these Layer-2 scaling solutions to do even more. So if Polygon can hitch its growth to that of Ethereum, it should be good news for investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that the Layer-2 blockchain niche has become especially crowded during the past 12 months. As a result, Polygon hasn't seen the types of price gains initially expected by investors. Around the time of Ethereum blockchain update knowns as The Merge in 2022, Polygon was trading near the $1 mark. But in the 18 months since, Polygon has dropped below $1 . It is currently trading for less than $0.70, and is down more than 30% for the year. Nonetheless, with a $6.6 billion market cap, it remains one of the top 20 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nInjective\n\nInjective (INJ 2.62%) is a Layer-1 blockchain that was purpose-built for decentralized finance (DeFi). In theory, core DeFi activities -- such as being able to create new DeFi lending protocols, or swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges -- should be faster, cheaper, and easier on Injective than on rival blockchains. In terms of utility, Injective is the blockchain you use if you want to build new financial applications or participate in DeFi.\n\nAnd, indeed, as measured by one important metric, total value locked (TVL), Injective is gaining ground in the DeFi world. In February, Injective set a record with more than $110 million in TVL, suggesting that more and more crypto users are embracing Injective as an on-ramp to DeFi. Right now, there are more than 100 projects on the Injective blockchain, and a reported 150,000 community members.\n\nBut, as with Polygon, the results just haven't been there this year for Injective. After soaring in price from $1.25 in January 2023 to over $50 in March 2024, Injective is now down about 35% year to date. With a $2.4 billion market cap, though, Injective still ranks as a top 50 crypto in terms of valuation.\n\nThe ongoing search for utility in crypto\n\nDuring a January AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\") on X (formerly known as Twitter), Cuban shared an important insight about investing in crypto: \"I hate the speculation but love when there is utility.\" Like many longtime crypto investors, he's seen the extreme volatility in the crypto market, and has warned against believing too much in the hype and speculation surrounding certain coins.\n\nTo mitigate some of that risk, one option is to focus on utility. If you don't understand what a crypto does, or what purpose it serves, it might just be that there is no purpose. If that's the case, then you probably shouldn't be adding it to your portfolio. Trying to chase a speculative meme coin may be fun, but it will rarely be profitable. There's no guarantee that you will be profitable with utility coins either, but understanding the core use cases of a crypto can help you make smarter long-term investment decisions."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s disregard of L1s raises questions once again.\n\nLayer 2 security concerns challenge Ethereum\u2019s decentralization commitment.\n\nAmidst the ongoing crypto bloodbath, Ethereum [ETH], the leading altcoin, mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] downward trajectory, with its daily and weekly charts awash in red.\n\nWhile it records a modest 3% dip in one day, the past week has seen more significant losses, with double-digit declines exceeding 16%.\n\nHowever, amidst these volatile swings, an unexpected question arises: Does Ethereum\u2019s architecture hold the top spot?\n\nConcerns surrounding ETH\u2019s architecture?\n\nIn a recent article, David Hoffman, co-owner at Bankless, highlighting the lasting impact of the Bitcoin block size wars on today\u2019s crypto community said,\n\n\u201cA lot of people\u2019s arguments about how you should build crypto or what crypto should look like can be characterized as like a big blocker or a small blocker argument.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, outlining the modern-day scenario he added,\n\n\u201cSolana is the big blocker and Ethereum is the small blocker.\u201d\n\nThis underscores the ongoing debate wherein Solana [SOL] advocates for L1 scalability, aiming for instant, free transactions. While Ethereum prioritizes L1 decentralization, emphasizing L2 scaling.\n\nFurthermore, delving into the concept of block complexity, comparing blockchains with and without a virtual machine, Hoffman said,\n\n\u201cAll chains before Ethereum were missing this key element, and instead tried to add functionality as individual op-codes, rather than a fully expressive virtual machine.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, reiterating the importance of finding a balance between scalability and decentralization, Vitalik Buterin, in his 2019 article noted,\n\n\u201cKeep layer 1 simple, make up for it on layer 2\u2033 is NOT a universal answer to blockchain scalability and functionality problems.\u201d\n\nButerin said this because this approach fails to consider that L1 blockchains themselves must have a sufficient level of scalability and functionality for this \u2018building on top\u2019 to be possible\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s more to it?\n\nNeedless to say, this has resulted in ETH becoming less affordable for individual users but more suitable for entities like chains, exchanges, and funds.\n\nRemarking on the same, @RyanSAdams highlighted,\n\n\u201c\u2019Ethereum is too expensive\u2019 is a really bad take.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, comparing Ethereum L2 solutions with the Cosmos chains, Sam Hart noted,\n\n\u201cCosmos isn\u2019t a technology or an ecosystem, it\u2019s the choice to build a sovereign application that seeks to interoperate with others.\u201d\n\nIn fact, recent allegations of top Layer 2 solutions potentially mishandling user funds have raised doubts about Ethereum\u2019s commitment to decentralization, echoing concerns voiced by Justin Bons,\n\n\u201cETH gives decentralization lip service, but actions speak louder than words.\u201d\n\nAll this brings forth a question: Does Ethereum\u2019s architecture need a revamp?"

        "content": "In comparison to Ethereum and Base, where the average transaction values are $1,867 and $170, respectively, Degen Chain sees a notably lower average transaction value of $0.27.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Degen Chain, a recent addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, has achieved the highest transaction per second (TPS) rate among Ethereum layer-3 networks.\n\nOn the last day, Degen\u2019s transaction per second (TPS) count surged by over 68% to reach 37.12 TPS, surpassing its underlying blockchain, Base, which stood at 30.81 TPS, as reported by L2BEAT\n\nArbitrum One, Ethereum, and zkSync Era completed the top five rankings.\n\nWith Degen\u2019s 35.7 TPS multiplied by 86,400 seconds in a day, the memecoin chain handled a total of 3.08 million transactions during that period.\n\nDespite its high transaction throughput, Degen Chain recorded only $846,191 in trading volume over the last day, ranking it 41st out of 66 blockchains tracked by CoinGecko.\n\nDespite its widespread use in measuring a blockchain\u2019s scalability limits, transactions per second (TPS) is considered by many industry leaders as a flawed metric.\n\nThis is because TPS fails to account for the computational size of each transaction, which can vary significantly and impact the network\u2019s overall performance. This oversight suggests that TPS alone may not fully represent a blockchain\u2019s capacity or efficiency.\n\nThe Degen (DEGEN) token, which was initially conceived as a tipping token for users engaging with Degen\u2019s channel on the Farcaster platform, has evolved beyond its original purpose.\n\nIt now serves as the primary currency of a memecoin that has transitioned into its own blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, Degen Chain currently holds $4.1 million in total value locked, while the DEGEN token, which is only three months old, commands a market capitalization of $326 million.\n\nDegen Chain, regarded as an ultra-low-cost, application-specific layer 3 blockchain, was constructed using Arbitrum Orbit and utilizes Base\u2019s settlement layer, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nRead also: Sora Ventures & Metaplanet partner for \u2018Asia\u2019s Microstrategy\u2019"

Created by Worldcoin Foundation, this platform is designed to prioritize real human users over bots by offering them priority in block space allocation and complimentary gas allowances. This innovation not only bolsters the Worldcoin ecosystem but significantly enhances transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability for its users.\n\nAs I shared in my recent tweet, Worldcoin, envisioned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is gearing up for the summer launch of World Chain. This platform is set to enhance scalability within the Superchain ecosystem and will operate under the security framework provided by its role as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution.\n\n#Worldcoin, the brainchild of# OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is gearing up to unveil World Chain this summer! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd17 This innovative project is set to be safeguarded by #Ethereum as an L2 solution and designed for scalability within the Superchain ecosystem. It's going to be\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9lZ7cw4JZ8 \u2014 Marcel Knobloch aka Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) April 17, 2024\n\nThis initiative emphasizes Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to open-source development and its ambition for community-led governance in the future.\n\nEnhancing User Experience with World ID\n\nAccording to a recent YouTube video from CNF, World Chain will further integrate with World ID\u2019s Proof of Personhood, which uses iris scans to verify individual identities, subsequently rewarding verified users with WLD tokens. Amidst increasing regulatory scrutiny, Worldcoin is also enhancing privacy protections. These enhancements include more robust personal data management options and the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs to ensure network integrity without compromising privacy.\n\nScaling and Interoperability Advancements\n\nAs highlighted in a recent TradingView post, World Chain is engineered to expand capacity and streamline transactions, reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. The integration of World ID allows users to anonymously prove their identity, securing priority processing and even complimentary gas.\n\nIn alignment with a recent CNF post, Worldcoin has introduced an \u201cunverify\u201d function aimed at giving users greater control over their personal data. This feature, which was developed in response to heightened regulatory scrutiny, allows users to manage their data privacy proactively. Despite these changes, Worldcoin (WLD) has managed to maintain a stable market position.\n\nFurthermore, the blockchain community, including the Optimism team, has expressed enthusiasm for the introduction of World Chain. Notably, Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 network, Base, also utilizes the OP Stack, underscoring the growing acceptance and implementation of these advanced scaling solutions within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe project\u2019s success could serve as a pivotal moment for Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions and their role in broader blockchain adoption. Current trading data shows Worldcoin (WLD) at $4.83, marking a 3.73% decrease over the past day and a 27.30% drop over the last week, reflecting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nNo coins selected\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

Get ready, the Saga saga is just beginning.\n\nThe spotlight is on Saga, the layer 1 blockchain shaking up the gaming world. Their latest announcement? An airdrop campaign so massive that they\u2019ve named it: Power-Level Over 9000!

The winners will receive batches of tokens and NFTs to be distributed in the coming months, according to the announcement.\n\n\u00ab At Saga, we are immensely proud to promote collaboration and unity within the Web3 gaming community. With partners from various ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Polygon, and Avalance, our airdrop campaign serves as a testament to our unwavering commitment to bringing together the Web3 gaming community. \u00bb\n\nEach airdrop is a treasure in itself, offering a variety of prizes from several partner crypto projects. Gaming heavyweights such as Avalanche\u2019s Shrapnel, Ethereum\u2019s The Sandbox, and Ethereum\u2019s Wilder World are already on the list, with more expected to be revealed in the coming days.\n\nA network in full boil\n\nSaga, a layer 1 network, is ushering in a universe where developers deploy their own chains, dubbed \u201cchainlets\u201d. This innovative concept supports an internal dynamic of support among chainlets within the Saga ecosystem.\n\nRenowned for its prolific airdrop campaigns, Saga has set records with 13.4 billion dollars staked on Binance to get SAGA cryptos.

        "content": "Worldcoin to get its L2.\n\nWLD has remained in the $4.7 price zone despite the latest announcement.\n\nWorldcoin [WLD] has a knack for the dramatic, and this trend continued with its recent announcement.\n\nFollowing the controversy surrounding iris scanning, the platform has announced plans to launch its Layer 2 (L2) solution. Did this latest announcement move the price of WLD in any way?\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s Layer 2\n\nIn its announcement on the 17th of April, Worldcoin revealed the launch of what it termed the \u201cWorld Chain.\u201d This new platform is described as a Layer 2 solution built on the network.\n\nNotably, the World Chain will be secured by Ethereum [ETH]. The announcement also mentioned the presence of bots on the platform, with some deemed necessary.\n\nTo address potential network congestion caused by unnecessary bots, Worldcoin plans to leverage World ID to distinguish between bots and human users.\n\nAdditionally, the post highlighted the prominent role of WLD, Worldcoin\u2019s native token, which will be utilized for gas fees alongside ETH.\n\nDid Worldcoin react?\n\nThe latest announcement from Worldcoin introduced a new utility for WLD, yet it failed to prevent the observed decline.\n\nAnalysis of the daily timeframe chart reveals that WLD concluded the day with a negative performance despite the announcement.\n\nBy the end of the trading session on the 17th of April, WLD experienced a decline of over 6%, trading around $4.7.\n\nAt the time of writing, it fluctuated between gains and losses, exhibiting a less than 1% increase while still trading around $4.7.\n\nThe long Moving Average (blue line) currently acts as support around $4. Still, a breach below it could initiate a more significant decline.\n\nFurthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirmed a bear trend, with the RSI below 40, indicating a strong bearish sentiment.\n\nThis trend suggested that WLD had its trajectory, and the recent announcement failed to generate any positive impact.\n\nActive addresses show reduced activity\n\nBesides the price movement, analysis of the 24-hour and 30-day active addresses metrics indicated a lack of excitement surrounding Worldcoin.\n\nRead Worldcoin\u2019s [WLD] Price Prediction 2024-23\n\nAccording to Santiment, the 24-hour active addresses metric shows no significant change between the 17th of April to press time, with a slight decline observed.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are 321 active addresses. Additionally, the 30-day active addresses metric reveals significant declines over the past few weeks, with only 6,483 active addresses at the time of writing."

        "content": "Dogecoin20, an Ethereum-based alternative to Dogecoin, skyrocketed over 100% on Uniswap debut.\n\nDogecoin20 (DOGE20), an Ethereum-based token positioned as an alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE), experienced a rapid surge in value, rallying over 100% within an hour of its listing on the decentralised exchange (DEX) Uniswap.\n\nThe surge in trading activity was primarily attributed to the anticipation surrounding Saturday, 20 April 2024, a day significant within the crypto community due to the scheduled Bitcoin halving and International Doge Day celebrations.\n\nOriginally slated to conclude on 20 April, the DOGE20 token claim went live at 10am UTC following a successful initial coin offering (ICO) that raised over $10 million throughout March.\n\nThe decision to conclude the ICO earlier than planned was driven by the substantial demand observed and the strategic alignment with Doge Day.\n\nUpon its listing on Uniswap, DOGE20 witnessed a remarkable price surge, climbing by 101% to reach $0.0003632 USD within a 45-minute timeframe.\n\nSubsequently, the token experienced a slight retracement as early investors capitalised on profits, although it maintained a trading level above its initial launch price, consolidating for potential future fluctuations.\n\nBUY AND STAKE $DOGE20 TODAY AND JOIN THE BULL RUN!\n\nDOGE20 distinguishes itself from Dogecoin by leveraging the Ethereum network\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, allowing for the implementation of smart contracts and enabling various decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s infrastructure provides efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to networks using older technologies like Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.\n\nA notable feature of DOGE20 is its staking mechanism, offering a substantial annual percentage yield (APY) of 41% for participants who engage in token staking. This aims to incentivise long-term holding and community engagement, with a significant portion of tokens already staked, reflecting strong commitment among holders.\n\nAdditionally, DOGE20 maintains a capped total supply of 140 billion tokens to ensure scarcity and potential value appreciation.\n\nDespite its relatively modest market capitalisation of less than $30 million, DOGE20 has attracted over $1 million in liquidity on Uniswap, facilitating seamless trading for investors seeking exposure to this emerging Ethereum-based meme coin.\n\nTRADE $DOGE20 ON UNISWAP\n\nAs Doge Day approaches, investors are presented with an opportunity to participate in the DOGE20 ecosystem, leveraging its listing on Uniswap to access the token\u2019s trading liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, DOGE20\u2019s rapid surge on Uniswap underscores growing interest in meme coins and Ethereum-based tokens. The project\u2019s listing on a prominent DEX provides accessibility to traders seeking exposure to innovative projects within the crypto space.\n\nWith Doge Day coming up, this will be the investor\u2019s last chance to buy $DOGE20 at its current low price."
