Watch the video with English captions on YouTube.\n\nIntroduction to BlockDAG - a technology that can go hand-in-hand with blockchain but also acts as a new meta-technology that challenges it.\n\nAs of today, there are over 24 layer-1 blockchain projects just within the first 100 listings in coinmarketcap.com. Guess, what? Each of them claims to be the \u201cnext-big-thing\u201d, still they are just a broken iteration of one other.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language. It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThe mother of DeFi is Etheurem, but the true DeFi platform the world needs now is Bitcoin-based, which follows the original idea of Satoshi Nakomoto.\n\nIn this post we'll look at 10 affordable NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\ntldr; Below is a hefty and yet still somehow high-level overview of Ethereum. The roughly 5-year-old project has emerged as one of the most exciting and proven projects in the cryptocurrency space while somehow still encompassing the most risk and arguably, upside of any crypto-project. This dichotomy has allowed Ethereum to act as a sort of magic mirror for those in the industry. Fanboys and detractors alike can look into the project and see what they want to see: the 2nd-most successful crypto-project with product-market fit and an army of developers behind it or a nascent, experimental Frankenstein so complicated it would make Rube Goldberg blush.\n\nImage Credit: UnsplashThe endless possibilities of cryptocurrencies have seen a lot of businesses show interest in the token economy and the overall blockchain space.\n\nMost of the applications on Ethereum are micro-financial ones where the price per ticket ranges from $100 \u2014 $1000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply is becoming scarce while demand is rising. Here's what you need to know.\n\nHow the Internet Computer promises to serve as a decentralized, scalable layer for Web3 and blockchain-based gaming.\n\nThe future is now, it's 2020 and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are experiencing a Cambrian explosion.\n\nTypically in an enterprise, you have top-down hierarchies as the mechanism of control. Let's look at a quick example of how a DAO works differently in action.\n\nImagine you\u2019re building a startup, except at this startup, there is a clear sense of organization without humans organizing other humans. It all runs organically, and it's generative in nature, meaning it evolves, innovates and experiences high growth from within.\n\nLeaderless leadership!\n\nHow is such a way of working together achieved?\n\nThrough active participation from interested parties who share common values, missions and objectives. People-driven autonomous organizations happen mostly through voting on decisions that are proposed by other community members.\n\nYou can propose, vote and discuss decisions as a team without having to have a singular authority to report to. Resulting in new ideas being seeded and proposed from within the organization to solve mission-critical challenges that the DAO is facing.\n\nIt's really a synthesis of innovation and ambition, it's great!\n\nWith that said there are certainly some balanced benefits and drawbacks about this model that we should explore.\n\nFor the moment DAOs function in a fairly binary nature, you vote on proposals that you or others have submitted, typically these votes take place on blockchains by signing a transaction with your crypto wallet. That means the current state of DAOs is experiencing the highest growth in the blockchain industry. So whilst DAOs are now, they might be somewhat gravitating around the future of money.\n\nHowever crypto-centric it is right now, it is definitely laying out an exceptional framework that any organization type could be built upon. We are seeing many other non-crypto DAOs emerge too, using platforms like Aragon to create a DAO in minutes on the blockchain. This is achieved by creating a Governance Token on the Ethereum blockchain. When users hold these Governance Tokens they can vote on proposals put forward to the community.\n\nThese communities can even have treasuries where the DAO can organize their finances. For example, members that hold these Governance Tokens can suggest making a payment, creating a vote inside the community so it can be approved or denied collectively.\n\nThere are many lessons to learn about how to coordinate large groups of self-interested people.\n\nI recently wrote an article, \"Failure shows us the way\", where I outlined my thesis on how I think we can even coordinate groups who don't explicitly share the same values, they instead just share the same mission. It's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds with the DAOs that are experimenting right now.\n\nWhy are DAOs exploding right now?\n\nBasically there is an entire unstoppable movement happening because of projects offering up a Governance Token as a bonus to those who are using some Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nI've heard many stories from folks achieving incredible results in less than 5 days. For example, \"With YFI I earned like $3.5k on $24k\", one community member shared with me.\n\nThat example is a 14.58% increase in capital in just five days, no wonder it's getting attention.\n\nWait, how are people making money from these Governance Tokens?\n\nIn the DeFi world, there is a new meme known as Yield Farming \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf3e its technical name is Liquidity Mining.\n\nThis is where a user deposits crypto stablecoins like USDC, DAI & USDT to earn a reasonably safe and secure return, which lately seems to be roughly 8% APY. As well as this, these DeFi applications which have newly formed their own DAOs to oversee their protocols, are rewarding users with Governance Tokens when they have funds deposited into their various DeFi products.\n\nThis has added rocket fuel to the DeFi community, with an explosive $3 Billion USD flowing into projects in just the last couple of weeks. This doesn't stop here either, there are many more DAO innovations that will be made known during this wave of Governance Tokens. One example is Referral Yield Farming, where you can earn Governance Tokens for referring people to DeFi platforms without having to deposit any funds of your own.\n\nArt101 announced a Vitalik Buterin NFT collection 'Based Vitalik'\n\nThere is no doubt that the crypto space is growing at a very rapid pace, but no one can ignore the scams that are prevalent in this ecosystem. If we just go back a few years, more than 80 percent of the ICOs were identified as outright scams in a study conducted by the ICO advisory firm Statis Group.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin is the most well-known name in the Ethereum space, the birth of Ethereum was a collaborative effort, as were later developments like ERC-20. Fabian Vogelsteller is one-such early Ethereum developer and thought leader on blockchain technology. He has built many Ethereum user and developer-facing projects including the Ethereum Mist browser, the Ethereum Wallet and web3.js - the Ethereum\u2019s space most used JavaScript library.\n\nTogether with Vitalik Buterin, he proposed the ERC20 token standard, which initiated the world ICO wave and redefined investment and crowd ownership as we know it. Today Fabian is leading the concept, design, and development of the LUKSO Blockchain.\n\nPolkadot is a radically different approach to blockchain scaling. But have solutions like Binance Smart Chain already made it unnecessary?\n\nDue to a clogged network, Ethereum just got an expansion \u2014 but at what cost? Here's everything you need to know about the ethereum gas limit debate.\n\nThe other day I got myself in a situation where I needed to communicate with the Ethereum network using python in an environment where getting web3.py to work seemed pretty much impossible. Since I still needed to talk to the network, I resorted to using the JSON-RPC API provided by Ethereum, which all web3 libraries are built on top of. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty interesting! So, let\u2019s get started!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for a while, then you\u2019ve surely heard the phrase \u201cwe just need a killer app\u201d to get crypto into the mainstream. Now, as you\u2019ve most likely also noticed, many of the current decentralized applications that are out there have great ideas backing them \u2014 perhaps even revolutionary ones \u2014 so why aren\u2019t any of these dApps achieving widespread use? Why aren\u2019t they, or one of them, the \u201ckiller app\u201d that we need? I certainly don\u2019t think the gambling dApps topping the daily usage tracking charts would constitute such an app.\n\nCompanies can determine whether they should invest in blockchain by focusing on specific use cases and their market position.\n\n\u201cI need a no-code platform to build my own web3 product!\u201d Is that you? If so, discover the right tool for the job from creators of a no-code web3 platform.\n\nBlockchain is a part of a trustless digital solution.\n\nBlockchains depend heavily on network effects, i.e. the notion that networks such as telecommunication services, the Internet, or social networks become more valuable when their number of users grows. This is why ecosystem building is one of the main factors that drives the value of a Layer 1 blockchain enterprise. Here is a comparison of how different blockchain projects handle this.\n\nzkEVM is said to be the crown jewel of Ethereum scaling schemes.

Despite being a gateway into the world of decentralized finance, centralized exchanges are very\u2026well\u2026centralized in nature and hide many of its intrinsic mechanics from the scrutiny of public blockchains. Not surprisingly, ten years after the creation of Bitcoin, the internal architecture of centralized exchanges remains a mystery to even the top experts in the crypto market.\n\nPhoto by Cl\u00e1udio Luiz Castro on Unsplash\n\nCentralized exchanges are, arguably, one of the most challenging components to analyze in the crypto-asset markets. While the behavior of many actors in the crypto space is transparently recorded in distributed ledgers, centralized exchanges still operate largely off-chain only publishing subset of the activity to the corresponding blockchains. Without a doubt, centralized exchanges introduce a level of opacity that challenges even the most sophisticated analytic techniques. And yet, the analysis of the behavior of centralized exchanges can yield many interesting benefits for crypto investors and traders. Imagine that you are able to effectively track large crypto transfers between exchanges that can anticipate a large position on a specific crypto asset. All that, however, requires understanding the underlying patterns in centralized exchanges.\n\nThe global healthcare crisis caused by COVID-19 has severely impacted the financial markets. From stocks to commodities, industries are in disarray.\n\nCryptographically, the brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all.\n\nThis article is about a Web3 company called YellowCard that has a crypto exchange app platform for bitcoin, ethereum and others, based for the African market.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss Grim Reaper's crypto story, the reason for his anonymity, crypto mining, EIP 1559, and more.\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed a dramatic slowdown in the Ethereum network, you\u2019re not alone.

Technically, it is true. However, if you try to make an EOS transaction you will eventually find out that you need to put some of your EOS coins on hold.\n\nDecentralized fundraising and the ability to raise money \u201cindependently\u201d from VCs and funds has always been a deeply rooted ideal in the crypto sphere.\n\nDeFi or decentralized finance is a growing sector in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space that defines an ecosystem of decentralized applications providing financial services with no governing authority.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make a DAO! Anyone can make their own DAO with Aragon or DAOstack, or just by forking Molloch. Even better, you can use an augmented bonding curve to fund your DAO, thanks to the amazing work by the Commons Stack folks, and there you have it! A fully-functioning DAO with just a few days of work!\n\nAfter the global economic crisis of 2008, the question of trust in the modern international financial system arose globally. The answer to this request was the emergence of the first decentralized Internet system \u2014 Bitcoin, which from \u201cdecentralized\u201d money turned into a valuable financial asset by 2020.\n\nI guess the first question is, Why? Why should an internet community become a DAO?\n\nAll but the simplest of Ethereum applications are composed of several smart contracts. This is because of a hard limit of 24KB in any deployed contract, and because your sanity will slip away as the complexity of a smart contract grows.\n\nCentralized crypto exchanges are the most important black box of the crypto ecosystem. We all use them, we have a love-hate relationship with them, and we understand very little about their internal behavior. At IntoTheBlock, we have been heads down working on a series of machine learning models that help us better understand the internal of crypto exchanges. Recently, we presented some of our initial findings at a highly oversubscribed webinar and I thought it would be elaborate further in some of the ideas discussed there.\n\nThe following are not my beliefs, but a compilation of notes from conversations I had with a self-described Bitcoin \u201cmutant\u201d, named Edan Yago, contributor to Sovryn. Letting him ramble on about Bitcoin resulted in mesmerizing, mythical, and fascinating ruminations about Bitcoin\u2019s destiny. So for one, I myself believe in Bitcoin as a digital store of value. It is a huge chunk of my portfolio, and I believe it will outlast 99% of the cryptocurrencies we have today. There is no better symbol of scarcity and hard money in crypto to date. However, I feel just about the same level of admiration for Ethereum, as it is opening up so many use cases through DeFi and DAOs. I am putting my biases aside to explain a very rare (and what I find fascinating) point of view. I present you Part 1 of The Hero\u2019s Journey of Bitcoin:\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s called Vyper, not Viper.\n\nThe go-to blockchain for decentralized finance is still Ethereum (ETH). It has the great advantage of being a first mover, so plenty of investors are already aware of ETH and its use cases. ETH tokens also played a role in the tokensale bonanza of 2017 and 2018, and are now becoming highly active again in their new role as the backbone of the DeFi market.\n\nAbout the writer\n\nMoney is a social tool to achieve cooperation among a group of people.

Ethereum was designed with a broader vision, as adecentralized or world computer that attempts to marry the power of the blockchain, as a trust machine, with a Turing-complete contract engine. Although Ethereum borrows many ideas that were initially introduced by bitcoin, there are many divergences between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine and smart contracts are key elements of Ethereum, and constitute its main attraction. In Ethereum, smart contracts represent a piece of code written in a high-level language(Solidity, LLL, Viper) and stored as bytecode in the blockchain, in order to run reliably in a stack-based virtual machine (Ethereum Virtual Machine), in each node, once invoked. The interactions with smart contract functions happen through transactions on the blockchain network, with their payloads being executed in the Ethereum virtual machine, and the shared blockchain state being updated accordingly.\n\nblockchains offer the simplest means of keeping self-audited immutable records without having to use any third party service.\n\nMany of us have come to know about decentralized finance (DeFi) and have faced this sector with many doubts, understanding its potential, especially given the interests and the APR and APY it provides to those who interact with the various protocols.\n\nThe #creatoreconomy is changing quickly with the influence of #NFT #Crypto and #blockchain.\n\nThe two latest thrilling things in the Ethereum ecosystem are NFT and DeFi. Until 2020, these \"Money LEGOs\" were quite isolated from each other but became the arena of many new projects, innovations, and volume records. And I'm sure that there's more room to grow and blend.\n\nNowadays, binary options trading has transformed into one of the most popular financial products of the Internet era.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s first and dominant smart contract platform, has the largest dapp ecosystem with more than a million deployed smart contracts and hundreds of millions of dollars in monthly transactions\n\nThree example configurations for the new OpenZeppelin access control contract.\n\nEthereum's native crypto asset Ether will increase from $3,077 to $32,468 in the next five years, representing a 10.6x ROI.\n\nDemystifying the EVM Through Interactive Puzzles - A Walkthrough.\n\nThe State of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Job Market in 2019-2020\n\nBuilding a custom authentication flow using Amazon Cognito and MetaMask\n\nSupply elasticity is a property of money that allows the supply to expand and contract on an as-needed basis in order to meet demand. Well established monies like gold, as well as modern age cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, do not have this property.\n\nThe whole fintech industry is built around the interactions of various institutions. Fintech products can be as advanced and complex as you want them to be; they can solve essential problems for their customers, but in the end, the focal point is always some bank happily sitting on money. Thus, centralized finances are the banks and their subsidiaries. Many things in fintech are controlled by bureaucrats and most fintech apps function only because they are allowed to.\n\nThank you for checking out the 271 most read stories about Ethereum on HackerNoon.\n\nVisit the /Learn Repo to find the most read stories about any technology."

        "content": "The percentage of long-term ETH holders has skyrocketed this year to surpass Bitcoin for the second time ever. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has done pretty well in its percentage of long-term holders this year, with over 70% of investors currently holding on to their assets for more than a year, a new milestone for the blockchain.\n\nETH Long-Term Holders Now Top BTC\n\nEthereum\u2019s price activity has largely underperformed this year when compared to Bitcoin. But this isn\u2019t surprising, as Bitcoin has led the entire industry in bullish metrics and investor confidence this year. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggest more Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH for the long haul, hopefully with the belief that it will continue to rise substantially in value over time.\n\nLong-term holders are investors who refuse to sell their crypto even during times of market volatility and price depreciation. They are particularly important in maintaining the overall health of any blockchain, as they help to provide stability and reduce price volatility.\n\nHistory has shown Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin as regards this metric only once before. It\u2019s important to note that the last time this happened, ETH would go on to lead in this metric over the subsequent months.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, In/Out of the Money metric by IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin leading Ethereum in terms of profitability. At the time of writing, 82.25% of all BTC addresses are making money at the current price, compared to 76.10% of ETH addresses.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high profitability can be linked to a huge number of early Bitcoins assumed to be lost forever. As a result, the percentage of holders who bought at the current price metric puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $1.6 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAround 63% of ETH addresses who bought around the current price of $1,948 and $2,641 are still in profit compared to BTC\u2019s 52% of addresses that bought between $35,729 and $48,402.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $2,285 and is up by 91% this year. However, the asset\u2019s price has largely underperformed in comparison to major altcoins like Solana and Cardano, who are currently up by 925% and 145% respectively this year.\n\nInterestingly, this hasn\u2019t stopped bullish predictions from coming in regarding Ethereum. One of these is a prediction from BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, who estimated an astounding $5,000 price for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Raoul Pau also looked at price history to predict ETH outperforming BTC becoming a key macro trend of 2024. The first step in achieving this would be to break above the $2,380 price level.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026 I think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nFeatured image from Pexels"

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more \u2018Cypherpunk\u2019 hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world.\n\nMentioned in this article"

transactions executed.\n\nIn the last 30 days, Zksync has recorded a total of 34.7 million transactions compared to Ethereum\u2019s 34.2 million.\n\nThis is mainly due to the new trend of inscriptions, which after targeting the Bitcoin network, is now expanding within the EVM chains sector.\n\nWe will see if the attention on this type of digital products will remain high even in 2024.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nZkSync, a privacy and scalability-focused rollup, outperforms the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the trend of inscriptions\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup ZkSync, which focuses its efforts on optimizing scalability and privacy, has managed to outperform the Ethereum blockchain, which it relies on as a second-layer solution.\n\nIn the last 30 days, according to L2Beat data, there have been a total of 34.7 million transactions on ZkSync, while on its main network there have been 34.2 million transactions, resulting in a positive difference of approximately half a million transactions.\n\nWith this record, L2 ranks first in the EVM network ranking that has recently recorded the most tx, ahead of competitors Arbitrum, Optimism, DyDx v3, Base, and ImmutableX.\n\n\n\nThese data are justified by the recent introduction and diffusion of \u201cinscriptions\u201d, which is a metadata registration feature originating from Bitcoin, on all networks that support the Ethereum virtual machine, including the vast Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nRegistrations allow you to obtain alternative NFT to the classic resources generated through smart contracts, adding information such as text, images, videos, and even additional code within the ID of a transaction, all without losing the advantages of privacy and security.\n\nThis, although it may seem more cumbersome and sometimes even obsolete, allows you to save fees when it comes to including complex data within a smart contract and therefore is preferred by developers and users.\n\nThe data from L2Beat shows that the zkSync blockchain recorded its largest increase in monthly transactions on December 16th.\n\nIt was then that the synchronization registration was launched on the network and accounted for 4.6 million out of the 5.3 million transactions on that day alone, according to Dune\u2019s data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nIt is rare for an L2 network to surpass its main network in on-chain metrics, but given the interest and development that has been revolving within the Ethereum rollup sector lately, and the increasingly captivating narrative of inscriptions, it is possible that in the future these opportunities will become more frequent.\n\nThe ZkSync Cryptographic Ecosystem\n\nThis is not the first time that the layer-2 blockchain Zksync has made headlines, having become the protagonist of several records in the last year, thanks above all to a growing cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup solution was launched in March and has immediately succeeded in scaling the Ethereum mainnet, without compromising the security and privacy of the infrastructure.\n\nIn a short time, it has established itself as one of the leading players in the EVM chain sector, reaching a significantly high Total Value Locked.\n\nSpecifically, as of today ZkSync has a TVL of 581 million dollars, second only to Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s optimistic rollup versions, which have locked values exceeding one billion dollars, and to competitors Metis and Base.\n\nIt is not excluded that the cryptographic solution of Matter Labs will be able to further climb the rankings in the coming months, reaching the top 3 of the most used L2s in the world, especially if a gas token is launched to support its growth.\n\nLooking closer at the composition of this blockchain, we see that the protocols that have contributed the most to its growth are mostly DEX, which allow on-chain cryptocurrency exchange through an AMM (Automated Market Maker) platform.\n\nAmong these, the favorites of DeFi users have been ZKSwap, SyncSwap, Mute.io, Maverick, Velocore, Space.Fi, IziSwap, Pancakeswap, and ZkSwap Finance.\n\nOverall, DEXs on Zksync encompass the majority of TVL managed on the network, channeled into a multitude of decentralized pools that allow for the free exchange of cryptographic resources.\n\nThe category that has had the most impact on the success of ZkSync is the Lending platforms such as Reactor Fusion, Zero Lend, and ZkLend.\n\nFinally, we find decentralized applications for derivative trading such as Derivio, Holdstation, Satori, Rollup Finance, and Fulcrom.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to consider the boost of on-chain activities that has been given thanks to the narrative of crypto airdrops, which have encouraged Ethereum rollup users to prefer this blockchain precisely because of the possibility of a reward for its early adopters.\n\nWith $458 million raised in funding from external investors, Zksync promises to carry out one of the largest airdrops in the history of the blockchain world.\n\nThis factor, together with the new trend of inscriptions, could bring the L2 network to another level, where imagination still cannot reach."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Signature Reduction - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Signature Reduction Zach Anderson Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures for validators in the PoS system to simplify the system, address technical issues, and enhance network security.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, recently proposed a significant change to the Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The core of his proposal is to reduce the number of signatures that validators must process. Currently, Ethereum's PoS mechanism involves around 895,000 validators processing approximately 28,000 signatures per slot, which results in a heavy load on the network\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Need for Change: Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency\n\nThis high number of validators and the associated signature load come with major technical downsides. It limits quantum resistance, complicates forking, and challenges scaling signatures through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the high minimum of 32 ETH for becoming a validator remains prohibitive for many, limiting widespread participation\u200b\u200b.\n\nButerin suggests that reducing the signature requirement to about 8,192 per slot, down from the current 28,000, would offer several benefits. It would simplify the consensus mechanism, make the blockchain more quantum-resistant, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH), a mechanism to enforce good behavior among validators\u200b\u200b.\n\nExploring Alternative Approaches: Decentralized Staking Pools and More\n\nButerin outlined three potential approaches for this change:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: This method involves increasing the minimum ether required for staking, encouraging smaller validators to form pools. This shift would reduce the number of individual validators\u200b\u200b. Dual-Layer Staking System: A 'heavy' layer would require a higher ETH stake (4,096 ETH) for participation in finalization processes, while a 'light' layer would have no minimum requirement, creating a balance between security and accessibility\u200b\u200b. Rotating Validator Set: This approach would involve a rotating set of 4,096 validators for each slot, adjusting the set during each slot to ensure network safety\u200b\u200b.\n\nAddressing Security Concerns\n\nButerin also pointed out the limitations of the committee-based security model used in other blockchains. This model, which randomly selects a group of validators for each slot, lacks accountability in the event of a 51% attack. Ethereum's current system, which imposes severe penalties for such attacks, is effective but might be excessively punitive. A balanced solution maintaining high slashable Ethereum while making concessions on validator accountability is needed\u200b\u200b.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Google Trends data suggests that Solana's search interest is set to peak during the week of December 24 to 30, with a score of 100.\n\nUsers searching for Solana also showed interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk (BONK) is the leading Solana memecoin that reached a peak market cap of $1.9 billion after being listed on Binance and Coinbase, while Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, after surpassing Magic Eden in trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s DEX Volumes and NFT Sales Surpassed Ethereum\u2019s\n\nOn December 23, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and non-fungible token (NFT) sales.\n\nDEX volume on Solana surged to over $10 billion, surpassing Ethereum's $8.8 billion for that week. Meanwhile, Solana also processed $109 million in NFT sales in that week, eclipsing Ethereum by $30 million.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is leading in terms of DEX volumes, with $10.12 billion compared to Solana\u2019s $8.71 billion. However, Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume is still ahead of Ethereum\u2019s, although Bitcoin is leading due to the recent Ordinals frenzy.\n\nThe current frenzy on Solana is partly driven by memecoins, particularly BONK, which has skyrocketed by 300% in December and has a market cap of over $1 billion. Another Solana-based memecoin, Dogwifhat, has also gained 428% in the past week.\n\nSolana Flipped BNB in Market Cap Momentarily\n\nOn December 22, Solana surged by 18% to overtake BNB (BNB), propelling it to 4th place in terms of market capitalization. SOL traded at a market cap of $41.9 billion, surpassing BNB, which had a market cap of $41.8 billion.\n\nThis surge came after SOL overtook XRP in market cap on December 21. However, BNB has since regained its position after gaining over 17% in the past week. BNB is currently trading at a market cap of $47.8 million, compared to SOL\u2019s market cap of $43.7 million.\n\nSOL gained over 71% in the past month, outperforming many large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, which has only gained 12.4%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reason Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana's recent price surge can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\nIncreased User Activity\n\nActive addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% in the last three months, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s in mid-November. This suggests an exceptional increase in retail activity, with crypto users likely migrating to Solana for its lower transaction costs, increased speculative activity, airdrop farming and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirdrops and Memecoins Caused Surge in DEX Volume\n\nRecent airdrops on Solana, particularly the Jito (JTO) airdrop worth five figures, have resulted in more users flocking to other Solana-based protocols in hopes of securing a future airdrop. Furthermore, memecoins trading craze, led by the Bonk memecoin, have boosted speculative user activity, causing the DEX volume on Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s for a week. Other memecoins on Solana, like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Silly Dragon (SILLY), also saw millions in daily volume on-chain, contributing to the rise in DEX volumes.\n\nInstitutional Capital Flows Into Solana\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nSolana-based investment funds attracted $156 million in institutional inflows as of December 16, making it the crypto asset with the highest inflows behind only Bitcoin, suggesting robust institutional interest in Solana."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has presented three potential solutions to address what he identifies as a looming systemic complexity within Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a detailed post on the Ethereum Research forum, Buterin highlighted the challenges posed by the increasing number of signatures required for validators to keep the network operational.\n\nThe heart of the problem lies in the extensive workload placed on validators, who are essential for maintaining the network\u2019s functionality. As the number of validators continues to grow, the burden of generating signatures essential for proper network operation escalates, putting a strain on the system. Upcoming upgrades are expected to exacerbate this issue by significantly increasing signature requirements.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin Unveils Signature Solutions: Simplifying PoS Complexity 3\n\nButerin\u2019s Fixes: Simplifying Ethereum\u2019s PoS\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed solutions revolve around the common goal of reducing the required signatures to 8,192 per slot in the Ethereum blockchain. Each solution introduces a distinct approach to tackle the complexity associated with the current PoS design.\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: One approach involves the establishment of decentralized staking pools. By increasing the minimum amount of ether required to run a validator, individual validators are encouraged to collaborate and pool their resources. This would distribute the workload and alleviate the strain on the system.\n\nTwo-Tiered Staking: The second proposed solution suggests implementing two layers of stakers with different requirements. A \u201cheavy\u201d layer with higher requirements would participate in finalization, while a \u201clight\u201d layer with lighter requirements adds an additional layer of security to the block finalization process.\n\nRotating Participation: The third solution introduces a rotating set of participants, where a random group of validators is selected for each slot. While this would diversify the workload and reduce the overall number of required signatures, Buterin acknowledged the added complexity associated with this approach.\n\nAccording to the blog post, Buterin emphasized the current challenges posed by Ethereum\u2019s commitment to supporting a high number of validators for the sake of decentralization. The immense number of required signatures per slot creates technical challenges, including intricate attestation propagation mechanisms and potential quantum resistance issues.\n\nTo address these challenges, Buterin suggests moving away from the expectation of an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot. He proposes a philosophical pivot to expand the PoS design space, simplify technical implementations, enhance security, and tackle quantum resistance issues effectively.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also explored the drawbacks of a committee-based approach used by some blockchains, emphasizing the importance of accountability in Ethereum\u2019s current system.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal aims to establish a clear expectation of 8,192 signatures per slot, providing technical implementers and the Ethereum community with a more predictable future. The decision on which solution to adopt will involve careful consideration of trade-offs, particularly regarding liquid staking and other related issues.\n\nRelated Reading | Tim Draper Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $250,000 In 2024 Amid Enthusiasm And Regulatory Anticipation"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale has recently made a huge purchase of 25,674 ETH; however, this action could backfire if the price of ETH falls below a specific threshold, triggering a liquidation event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom all indications, it appears that the whale obtained the said ETH from MakerDAO. This decentralized lending platform allows users to mint stablecoins (DAI) by locking up their crypto assets as collateral.\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,257, the smart money will be in danger of liquidation.\n\n\n\nThe healthy ratio on #Maker is as low as 1.03.\n\n\n\nThe smart money once again spent 61M $DAI to buy 25,674 $ETH, and then sold 5,851 $ETH for 14M $DAI, making ~$99K.https://t.co/yGkFI6qpnj pic.twitter.com/VRmstUCngE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 29, 2023\n\nLookonchain reports that the whale had spent 61 million DAI to buy 25,674 ETH; however, the whale shortly after sold 5,851 ETH out of this stash for a value of 14 million DAI, of which they made a profit of $99,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the whale had made some profits from this strategy, they also faced the risk of liquidation. If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin talked about the blockchain\u2019s future in his recent blog.\n\nUsage of network remained high, however, its price saw a correction.\n\nEven though multiple altcoins have followed suit after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] rally, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price has not seen much growth in the recent past.\n\nDespite this developments have ensued on the network with founder Vitalik committed to the vision of Ethereum.\n\nHas Ethereum lost its Cypherpunk?\n\nIn a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Vitalik Buterin outlined a promising future for the network, driven by significant developments across various fronts.\n\nHe stated that scalability solutions, such as rollups, are addressing Ethereum\u2019s historical scalability challenges, allowing for more efficient transaction processing. Second-generation privacy solutions, including projects like Railway and Nocturne, are enhancing user confidentiality.\n\nHe also mentioned the concept of account abstraction is gaining traction, enabling users to interact with smart contracts without the need for native cryptocurrency holdings, making Ethereum more accessible.\n\nProgress in the development of light clients is reducing resource requirements and increasing network accessibility. Zero knowledge proofs, once considered a distant technology, are becoming more developer-friendly, offering enhanced privacy and verification capabilities.\n\nThe blog post also emphasizes a return to core values within the crypto community, including open global participation, decentralization, and a cooperative mindset.\n\nThese updates collectively aim to address scalability concerns, reduce transaction fees, and bolster privacy and security.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum may experience improved efficiency, making it more appealing to a wider user base and enabling a broader array of applications.\n\nHowever, the success of these changes depends on community adoption and effective implementation.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nComing to the state of the protocol, it was seen that the gas usage on the network has remained consistent.

        "content": "The Ethereum Layer 2 transactions skyrocketed by over 330% in 2023 compared to the last year. In recent months, Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions have experienced a notable uptick in interest, marked by the frequent introduction of new Layer 2s (L2s).\n\nOne of the latest players in this dynamic landscape is Coinbase\u2019s Base L2, which gripped the attention of crypto enthusiasts. While Base had a significant share in these transactions, Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) emerged as the largest contributors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum L2 Transactions Overview\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock analytics, the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recorded a total of 583.53 million transactions in 2023. This suggests a staggering increase of 332.08% from 2022\u2019s figure of 135.05 million. The largest contribution in the 2023 transactions was made by Arbitrum which accounted for a 64.01% share.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism and Base held a share of 22.22% and 13.77% share, respectively. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting that the 2023 Ethereum L2 transaction data indicates an unprecedented growth from 2021. Since the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem was fairly new in 2021, the number of transactions was recorded to be 6.24 million, which indicates a whopping increase of 9,251% since then.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nFurthermore, in a recent post on X, IntoTheBlock highlighted that the weekly transactions since 2021 have increased by 90 times. The weekly transactions hit a high of 18 million in 2023 while in 2021, it was less than a million.\n\nArbitrum And Optimism\u2019s Recent Performance\n\nOwing to the growing popularity of the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem, the ARB and OP prices have gained significantly lately. In the past seven days, the ARB price locked in profits of over 8% while OP surged by 13%. In addition, the ARB crypto soared by more than 43% in the past month whereas OP skyrocketed by 117%.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, both these digital assets saw a significant drop in value due to the ongoing bearish trend of the market. At press time, the ARB price was recorded at $1.45, plunging by 5.56%. The ARB market cap stood at $1.84 billion, down by 5.72%. Moreover, the 24-hour trade volume slumped by 23.54% to $617.02 million.\n\nWhilst, the OP crypto price dipped by 2.41% to $3.65. The crypto\u2019s market cap was recorded at $3.32 billion, marking a decline of 2.43%. However, the 24-hour trade volume registered a significant increase of 11.73% to 589.94 million.\n\nAlso Read: Optimism And Immutable Price Rally Continues With Monthly Gains Of Over 75%\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Fri 29 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nWith its SOL token back well above 100 dollars, Solana marks a resounding comeback and positions itself as a formidable opponent to Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Let\u2019s dissect the mechanisms of this resurgence.\n\nDoes Solana\u2019s Shadow Loom Over the Realm of Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana bets everything on speed. Its blockchain can process 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a mere 15 for Ethereum. A considerable advantage for attracting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2021, this argument captivated the masses. SOL surged spectacularly, from $1 in January to $260 in November. Its proponents even announced that Solana was on track to overtake Ethereum in the smart contracts market.\n\nHowever, the FTX debacle changed the game. The crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2018s platform, closely linked to Solana, sent SOL below $10. The blockchain also faced criticism for its technical vulnerabilities. Its future seemed uncertain.\n\nA Spectacular Comeback\n\nYet, the tide began to turn at the start of 2023. SOL rebounded sharply to $20 after the FTX collapse, and then surpassed $100 in mid-February.\n\nSeveral factors explain this rebound. On one hand, investors are returning to cryptocurrencies after difficult months. On the other hand, new projects are emerging on Solana, attracted by its low transaction fees.\n\nTrading volumes are surging, fueled by risky speculation. Last weekend, Solana even overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of spot transaction volume in SOL/USDT, reaching an impressive $1.037 billion on Binance.\n\nDoes this spectacular comeback mean that Solana is threatening the dominance of Ethereum? Not yet. With 29 billion dollars of assets locked, Vitalik Buterin\u2018s blockchain remains well ahead. Solana is worth 15 times less, at 1.5 billion according to data from DefiLlama, despite its rapid growth.\n\nNevertheless, this contender poses a serious threat. Solana continues to attract projects thanks to its low fees and record speed. If it overcomes its stability issues, it could continue to gain market share from Ethereum in the coming years. Their rivalry promises to be thrilling.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "content": "Google Trends Highlight Solana's Surging Interest\n\nIn an intriguing turn of events within the cryptocurrency sector, Solana has garnered significant attention, surpassing Ethereum in Google search interest for the first time in 2023. This surge in curiosity reflects the dynamic movements within Solana's ecosystem and hints at changing trends in the crypto community.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum: A Shift in Search Dynamics\n\nThroughout most of 2023, Ethereum maintained a considerable lead over Solana in terms of search interest. However, the period from December 17 to December 23 marked a pivotal change, with Solana achieving a search interest score of 56 compared to Ethereum's 50. Google Trends forecasts that Solana's search interest will reach a peak score of 100 between December 24 and December 30, indicating \"peak popularity for the term.\"\n\nInterestingly, the surge in Solana's search interest is more pronounced in countries like Spain and the Philippines, while Ethereum continues to dominate in regions such as Indonesia, Taiwan, and Morocco.\n\nAssociated Search Trends and Market Movements\n\nUsers searching for Solana have also shown interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk, a dog-themed memecoin, overtook Pepecoin in market capitalization on December 8 after witnessing a 370% monthly gain. Tensor, a Solana-based nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, has created the Tensorians NFT collection, which also experienced significant gains in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana's increased search interest may be partly attributed to the recent rise in the price of its token. On December 20, Solana's market capitalization surpassed Ripple's XRP, with the token price increasing by 13.8%, reaching over $82 for the first time since May 2022. This surge briefly positioned Solana as the fourth-largest crypto token by market cap, surpassing BNB on December 22. However, by December 29, BNB regained its position as Solana's token prices returned to levels seen before Christmas."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has shown impressive performance this year, with significant growth in price and market capitalization, making it one of the top digital currencies in the market.\n\nFuture growth potential for SOL hinges on factors like technology adoption, overcoming past network issues, regulatory developments, and potential strategic partnerships, which could enhance its market value and utility.\n\nDespite its progress, SOL\u2019s market cap is still behind major players like Ethereum, but it has surpassed them in certain metrics like trading volume and NFT sales volume in recent times.\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Progress Even More Next Year?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has been a top performer this year, with its price reaching almost $125 earlier this week. The token has skyrocketed by over 1,000% since January 1, while its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $50 billion mark and is currently standing at around $48 billion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThis uptrend has made SOL the fourth-largest digital currency in the entire market, outpacing Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nIn the following lines we will take a deeper dive and check whether the asset\u2019s progress could continue next year with SOL becoming the biggest alternative coin in the realm.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a scenario is not out of the cards but hinges on on multiple elements. One major factor is the possible adoption of the asset\u2019s technology and network. Solana is known for its low costs and fast transaction speed, which makes it a preferred ecosystem for decentralized applications.\n\nThe AI-powered chatbot also estimated that SOL\u2019s future success depends on coping with some issues that have caused reputational damage to the blockchain protocol in the past. Recall that Solana has experienced numerous network outages in the last few years.\n\nRegulatory development was also outlined as a vital factor. According to ChatGPT, the implementation of favorable rules in the crypto industry could have a positive impact on SOL.\n\nLast but not least, the chatbot pointed out possible partnerships that the blockchain entity might strike up with prominent organizations. Such strategic collaborations could enhance SOL\u2019s utility and adoption, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nDespite its rapid recent progress, SOL\u2019s market capitalization is still far from Ethereum\u2019s (almost $270 billion) and the one of USDT ($91 billion), meaning it has a long way to go before being throned as the largest altcoin.\n\nSolana has Already Surpassed Ethereum in These Metrics\n\nIt is worth noting that Solana has performed better than its rival for the top \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 in some aspects. According to DefiLlama, trading volume on Solana has surged above $1.3 billion in the past few days. For the most part of the month, Ethereum was lagging behind.\n\nSolana has also performed quite well in the non-fungible token space, registering an NFT sales volume of over $88 million in the last week. Ethereum has fallen behind with approximately $74 million for the same period.\n\nWhat is more, Solana flipped Ethereum in terms of search volumes on Google, which is a testament to the growing interest in the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "JAKARTA - Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared plans for the Ethereum roadmap for 2024. He acknowledged that there were only minor changes compared to last year.\n\nIn a series of posts on platform X (formerly Twitter), Buterin explained that the focus continues for Ethereum in 2024 centered on six main components.\n\nFurthermore, in a detailed graph with annotations and diagrams, Buterin outlines these six elements the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nHe pointed out that, as Ethereum's technical direction became clearer, there were only a few minor adjustments compared to the 2023 road plan. \"As Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are relatively few changes,\" he said.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KUG\n\nThe Merger is highlighted as a key part of the road plan, aiming to maintain a simple and long-lasting proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge took place, integrating the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake blockchain, Banyak Chain.\n\nFollowing the merger, the most significant observation on Ethereum is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that consumes high energy to PoS, resulting in a huge drop in network total energy consumption.\n\nHe also noted developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF). The finality aims to ensure that changes to blockchain block cannot be reversed without burning at least 33% of the total Ether at stake.\n\n\"The role of the single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvements is getting stronger. It is clear that SSF is the easiest path to solve most of the current Ethereum PoS design weaknesses,\" he said.\n\nThis comes after Cointelegraph recently reported that Buterin wanted to restore the original idea of a \"cypherpunk\" revolution to blockchain.\n\nCypherpunk refers to someone who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing computer networks, especially from government authorities.\n\nIn a post blog, Buterin explains that Ethereum was originally idealized as a \"public decentralized shared drive\" that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage.\n\nHowever, the vision began to fade in 2017 by turning towards financialization on Ethereum.\n\nButerin highlighted that rollups, proof of zero knowledge, account abstraction, and second generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream. He noted that this could support certain values related to the principle of cypherpunk.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.
