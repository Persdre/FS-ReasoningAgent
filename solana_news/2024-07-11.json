        "title": "How to Convert (Swap) Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) - Finance Monthly",
        "content": "Imagine standing at the crossroads of the digital currency universe, where two of the most influential cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), intersect. This is not a mere intersection, but a gateway, a portal that allows you to convert one cryptocurrency into another. As a result, the question of how to swap ETH to BTC arises. Today, we will guide you on the journey of ETH to BTC swaps.\n\nThis journey is not just for the seasoned crypto navigators but also for those who have just set sail in the vast ocean of digital currencies. Knowing how to convert Ethereum to Bitcoin is like having a magic key that can unlock new opportunities for investment and diversification. Follow this guide to navigate the process and learn all about the exchange of two major players on the market - ETH to BTC.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is not just a cryptocurrency but more of a decentralized global computer. It was funded through crowdfunding, making it decentralized from the start. Ethereum is in the process of a significant change from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. With a market cap of $198 billion, Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain network in the world. It hosts nearly 6,000 decentralized apps (DApps) and functions as the base infrastructure for several crypto trading platforms, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin, although less mysterious and more widespread, also has some intriguing aspects that are not widely known. For instance, a bug in 2010 led to the accidental creation of 184 billion BTC, far exceeding the intended maximum limit of 21 million. However, this issue was quickly rectified, and the maximum limit was reinstated. Another interesting fact is that the smallest unit of bitcoin is called a \u201csatoshi,\u201d which is equal to 0.00000001 BTC. Together, all these make the question of how to swap ETH to BTC even more important.\n\nWhy Do Users Swap ETH to BTC?\n\nUsers might look for ways to convert ETH to BTC for various reasons. One of the primary reasons is portfolio diversification. By holding a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, investors can mitigate risk across different assets. Due to the high volatility in cryptocurrency values, maintaining a variety of assets can safeguard investments against market fluctuations.\n\nWhere to Swap ETH to BTC?\n\nThere are several platforms where users can swap ETH to BTC. These include places like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and more. However, the majority of our readers prefer SimpleSwap as a convenient way to convert ETH to BTC. The platform stands out as a reliable and user-friendly platform for swapping ETH to BTC\n\nHow to Swap ETH to BTC: Swapping Guide\n\nOne solution for those wondering how to transfer ETH to BTC is through a platform like SimpleSwap.\n\n1. Choose the crypto pair.\n\nSelect ETH in the \u201cYou send\u201d section and enter the amount you wish to exchange. Then choose BTC in the \u201cYou get\u201d section. Click \u201cExchange\u201d.\n\n2. Add the recipient\u2019s address.\n\nEnter the recipient\u2019s address. The ETH will be sent to this address after the exchange.\n\n3. Send the deposit\n\nYou\u2019ll see an address to send the indicated amount of BTC to continue your swap.\n\n4. Get cryptocurrencies\n\nAfter receiving your deposit, SimpleSwap will convert it and send the ETH to the wallet address you provided.\n\nHow the Exchange (Swap) Process Looks Like\n\nBefore we delve into the specifics of how to exchange ETH to BTC, let\u2019s pause to comprehend the procedure. By following a well-defined and organized approach, you can facilitate the exchange process with ease and efficiency. It\u2019s important to note that this procedure is not exclusive to the method to buy Bitcoin with Ethereum - it can also be applied to any crypto pair.\n\nBenefits of Exchanging ETH to BTC\n\nSwapping the two can offer several benefits, some of which are discussed below:\n\nDiversity of Your Cryptocurrency Portfolio\n\nThe exchange allows you to distribute your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies, taking advantage of the distinct strengths and opportunities each coin presents. This strategy can reduce the impact of volatility in any one cryptocurrency and potentially improve the overall performance of your portfolio.\n\nPotential for Higher Returns\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has demonstrated higher returns than Ethereum. While past performance does not guarantee future outcomes, many investors exchange ETH for BTC with the aim of benefiting from Bitcoin's market trends and its potential for high returns. However, it\u2019s crucial to understand that higher potential returns also come with greater risk.\n\nLarger Market Volume and Broader Application\n\nBitcoin, being the first and most widely adopted cryptocurrency, has a larger market volume and broader application than Ethereum. This means Bitcoin is accepted and recognized by more businesses and individuals worldwide, making it potentially a more liquid and versatile investment. Swapping ETH to BTC could therefore offer more opportunities for use and potential appreciation.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nBitcoin transactions generally have lower fees compared to Ethereum, especially during periods of high network congestion. This can make Bitcoin a more cost-effective option for frequent transactions. However, transaction fees can vary and should be checked at the time of the transaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the choice of how to convert ETH to BTC can be a strategic move both in the short term and in the long term. While the process may seem complex at first, platforms like SimpleSwap make the process straightforward and accessible. As with any financial decision, it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the potential risks and rewards."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been dropping recently, following a second rejection from the $4,000 resistance level, and it has yet to recover.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been making lower highs and lows since failing to break the $4,000 level to the upside a while ago. The market has also broken below the 200-day moving average, around the $3,100 mark.\n\nThe price is currently retesting the 200-day moving average but is seemingly getting rejected to the downside. As things currently stand, the cryptocurrency seems likely to drop toward the $2,700 support level in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart demonstrates a zoomed-in view of the recent price action. As evident, the downtrend has recently been aggravated to the downside, with the market briefly breaking below the $3,000 support level.\n\nYet, following an oversold signal by the RSI, the price has recovered above the mentioned support zone. However, the price seemingly lacks the momentum to continue higher and might be on the verge of a deeper decline toward the $2,700 area.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Exchange Reserve\n\nDuring the Ethereum downtrend in the last few weeks, many analysts have been looking for signs of capitulation that point to a potential bottom. Some signals are becoming evident.\n\nThis chart displays the Ethereum Exchange Reserve metric, which measures the amount of ETH held in exchange wallets. An increase shows potential selling pressure, while a decline indicates a decrease in supply.\n\nFollowing the recent brief decline below the $3,000 level, the exchange reserve metric has experienced an increase above its 30-day moving average. This might indicate the beginning of the capitulation phase, as many investors\u2019 stop losses were below the $3,000 level."

        "content": "Ethereum price gained 14% within the 7-day timeframe, as reclaimed the $3,200 territory on July 11, on-chain data trends suggest ETH retail traders could pile on more demand in the days ahead.\n\nEthereum Price Bounces 5% on Positive CPI Report\n\nEthereum price bounced 5% within the daily timeframe on June 11 as the crypto markets reacted positively to the latest US economy inflation report. On Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics published the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report which showed that inflation slowed for the first time in 4 years, adding more luster to calls for interest rate cut.\n\nThe dovish US CPI report of June 2024 sparked a way of buying pressure across the crypto markets, but Ethereum\u2019s ETF impending launch further fuelled the ETH price surge on Thursday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nLooking at the chart above, Ethereum price surged by more than 4% on Thursday, to reach a weekly timeframe top of $3,213 on Thursday, July 11, marking a 14.37% recovery from the 100-day low record during the market crash last Friday.\n\nWhile the positive CPI report, and louder calls for rate cuts have boosted investor confidence across all risk assets markets, ETH price is also receiving bullish tailwinds from the Ethereum ETF anticipated launch slated for July 15 according to Bloomberg analysts.\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s gains, the ETH price retraced toward the $3,100 level at the time of writing on Friday, July 12. However, according to on-chain data, more retail traders are looking to pile on additional demand for Ethereum as the ETF launch date draws closer.\n\nThe exchange order book data from IntoTheBlock provides comprehensive information on the total number of active buy and sell limit orders for a specific asset. This data is aggregated from 16 well-established cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nA higher volume of buy orders often precedes a price bounce, as it means that market demand has exceeded the current short-term supply of the asset and vice versa.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe chart above depicts that Ethereum buyers have listed active bids to purchase 300,000 ETH at the average price of $3,099. Meanwhile traders have only placed 232,000 ETH up for sale close to the current prices.\n\nEssentially, this means there is currently an excess market demand for over 68,000 ETH. Valued at the current prices, the bears must now place another $321 million worth of sell-pressure to halt Ethereum\u2019s current price rebound phase.\n\nBut with the spot Ethereum ETFs due to launch in less than a week, existing ETH investors could opt to sit-and-watch approach and consolidate on their holdings. Other strategic short-term traders may also be waiting to sell into the expected market euphoria around the launch date.\n\nAs this cooling sell-side pressure persists on the dovish CPI report and the anticipated ETF launch, ETH price could be on the verge of a parabolic breakout towards $3,500.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: ETH Bulls Can Target $3,500 Rebound\n\nEthereum (ETH) has shown signs of recovery, currently trading at $3,092.12 as of July 12. The price has rebounded by 14.37% over the past six days, suggesting a potential continuation of the bullish trend. The Parabolic SAR indicator at $3,256.23 signals a possible upward momentum, with ETH aiming to break key resistance levels.\n\nThe immediate resistance is at the Parabolic SAR level of $3,256.23. A break above this could open the door for a retest of the $3,500 level, a significant psychological and technical barrier. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39.20, indicating that ETH is still in the oversold territory but showing signs of recovery. If the RSI continues to rise, it could further confirm the bullish outlook.\n\nSupport levels are crucial to monitor in the event of a pullback. The first support level to watch is around $3,000, which has proven to be a strong psychological support. Below this, the next significant support is at $2,800. A drop below $3,000 could weaken the bullish momentum and lead to a retest of the lower support levels.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s price action and technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook with a target of $3,500. Traders should watch the key resistance at $3,256.23 and the support at $3,000. A successful break above the resistance could see ETH retesting $3,500 while maintaining support at $3,000, which is crucial for sustaining the bullish momentum."

        "title": "What is ENS? Ethereum Name Service Explained (Updated 2022) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Back in the days, when the Internet wasn\u2019t so mainstream, one of the main problems that users faced was that domain names hadn\u2019t been matched up to Internet protocol (IP) addresses.\n\nThis made them very unfriendly towards the average Joe, who had to type in the IP address of the website they wanted to visit, as in to type in the numbers literally.\n\nUnlike traditional IPs, cryptocurrency addresses represent even longer strings of numbers and letters. If a user wants to send another user funds over Ethereum\u2019s network, they would have to input the address and make sure that each number and letter is written correctly.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nIt\u2019s also important to know that blockchain-based technology is very punishing in this regard. If you fail to input the address correctly and mistype a letter, the funds you send will be irreversibly lost. There\u2019s no central authority to contact to reverse or refund the transaction\u2014that money is lost.\n\nAnd just like Domain Name Services (DNS) came to life when using the Internet, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) came to be.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) uses the same concept as the Domain Name Service (DNS) but adjusts it for the needs of Ethereum users. At its core, the Ethereum Name Service is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system operating on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt aims to map human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers. In this case, the human-readable name can be something like \u201ccactus.eth,\u201d whereas the machine-readable identifier can be the Ethereum address (or other cryptocurrency addresses, for that matter.)\n\nIn the image below, we have given an example of what it looks like. The address belongs to the Ethereum Foundation. The ENS domain name that we created is just an example for the purpose of this guide:\n\nThe standard Ethereum Address is converted into human-readable text (foundation.eth). This means that users can send funds or interact with \u201cfoundation.eth\u201d instead of the standard address. Obviously, this makes it much easier for regular users and also considerably tightens the possibility of a mistake.\n\nAccording to the official ENS documentation, the system \u201chas similar goals to DNS, the Internet\u2019s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain.\u201d\n\nSimilar to DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains. The owner of a domain also has full control over the subdomains.\n\nHow Does ENS Work?\n\nThere are two core components to the Ethereum Name Service. Namely, these are the registry and the resolvers. The architecture of the system looks like this:\n\nRegistry\n\nThe registry is composed of a smart contract designed to maintain a list of all the domains and subdomains while also storing three essential pieces of information about each. These pieces are:\n\nThe owner of the domain\n\nThe resolver of the domain\n\nThe caching time-to-live for all the records that are under the domain\n\nThe purpose of the ENS registry is very straightforward \u2013 it\u2019s to map from a name to the resolver who\u2019s responsible for it. Meanwhile, owners of domains in the ENS registry are allowed to:\n\nChange the ownership of the subdomains\n\nTransfer ownership of their domain to another address\n\nSet the resolver and the time-to-live (TTL) for the domain\n\nResolvers\n\nResolvers, on the other hand, are responsible for translating names into addresses. Every contract that implements the required standards can be a resolver in the Ethereum Name Service. However, resolving a name in ENS is a process that is composed of two steps.\n\nThe first one is to ask the registry what resolver is responsible for the said name. The second one is to ask that particular resolver for the answer to the query. In terms of architecture, it looks like this:\n\nThe Difference Between DNS and ENS\n\nThe Domain Name Service (DNS) was created in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, a US computer scientist. It followed the research of another American scientist, Elizabeth Feinler.\n\nPut in simple terms, the purpose of DNS is to match internet protocol (IP) addresses with human-friendly domain names. This allows users to type in the website\u2019s name instead of having to input the literal numeric IP address.\n\nIn a similar yet different way, Ethereum Name Service attempts to make it easier for people (and applications) to read and share cryptocurrency addresses.\n\nHow to Register an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Domain?\n\nRegistering an Ethereum Name Service domain is pretty straightforward. All you need is a hot wallet such as MetaMask.\n\nGo to app.ens.domains (the official website for registering an ENS domain), and type in the domain name that you want to register. This will check its availability.\n\nOnce you have selected your name, all you need to do is follow the instructions given below:\n\nEthereum Name Service Governance\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service is governed by several different arms, each with its own significance.\n\nENS Token + Distribution\n\nThe ENS token is a standard token using the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain. Its main purpose is to be used for the governance of the system.\n\nToken holders can submit proposals and cast their votes. The main place where community members can discuss ideas and have governance-related discussions is the forum discuss.ens.domains.\n\nThe ENS token was airdropped to early adopters who had previously registered an ENS domain name. The claiming process started on November 8th, 2021, and users had until May 4th, 2022, to claim their allotted tokens.\n\n25% of the total supply was distributed through the airdrop, while the rest is designated as shown in the following piechart:\n\nENS DAO\n\nIn the spirit of decentralization, the Ethereum Name Service is operated by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO is governed by holders of the ENS token, who can submit proposals and vote on them to determine the protocol\u2019s future development.\n\nENS Foundation\n\nThe ENS DAO itself is represented by an existing Cayman Islands Foundation called the ENS Foundation.\n\nIt has a few purposes, including:\n\nTo comply with tax requirements because without a legal entity, DAO participants may be responsible for a certain proportion of the DAO\u2019s income, even if they don\u2019t have access to these funds.\n\nTo enter into contracts with other companies.\n\nTo provide limited liability for participants in the DAO for the actions of the DAO.\n\nConclusion\n\nENS is a critical advent in the cryptocurrency field and a step towards solving some of the pressing issues that riddle the industry \u2013 namely, user experience.\n\nHaving to deal with long strings of random numbers and letters is oftentimes the reason for mistakes, and in the field of crypto, mistakes are quite commonly very expensive. Normalizing addresses and presenting them in a human-readable and friendly way is a step towards improving the overall user experience, the way DNS improved the UX for Internet users.\n\nAt the same time, though, DNS records of domains and names are typically stored on centralized servers, making them prone to hacks. ENS, on the other hand, are secured by Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, making them multifold and more secure.\n\nThat said, the Ethereum Name Service is undoubtedly an important invention and innovation that\u2019s quickly become widespread and used by thousands of people."

Ethereum leverages blockchain technology in its open-source platform, ensuring secure decentralized applications. Solana, also open-source, exploits the blockchain\u2019s permissionless nature to innovate in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nSolana\u2019s price recently dipped, disrupting a short-term upward trend. Typically, such corrections persisted for over a month before recovery. Meanwhile, Ethereum price exhibits a bearish pattern, albeit with modest rebounds.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese platforms are known for their distinctive strengths; Ethereum prioritizes robust security, whereas Solana offers high throughput and minimal transaction costs. Despite the current volatility, this combination of features makes them pivotal players in the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nAnticipated Growth with New ETFs\n\nEther and SOL are poised for significant growth with the anticipated arrival of new investment products. Ethereum is at the forefront of excitement with its upcoming spot ETFs.\n\nThe financial community buzzes as the possibility of introducing Ethereum ETFs as early as this week remains pending approval from the U.S.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Investment experts, like Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s Matthew Hougan, are preparing to capitalize on this development. Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to surge, potentially exceeding its previous peak of $4,867.60 in November 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana is not far behind, with a major ETF launch planned for March 2025. As the market begins to stabilize from recent fluctuations, Solana has shown impressive recovery.\n\nThe Cboe Exchange recently confirmed that asset managers VanEck and 21Shares would list their Solana-based products, pending regulatory green lights. The exchange has formally requested approval from the SEC to list these innovative ETFs.\n\nEthereum and Solana Drive Innovation in Blockchain Technology\n\nEthereum and Solana are pivotal in the blockchain landscape, fostering dynamic ecosystems for decentralized applications. Ethereum, a pioneer in smart contracts, maintains a vast array of dApps encompassing DeFi and NFTs, making it a leader in the field.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana excels in scenarios demanding high transaction speeds and minimal delays, such as gaming and high-frequency trading, thanks to its superior throughput capabilities.\n\nThese platforms rank among the top ten in market capitalization, enjoy robust developer support, and enjoy surging trading volumes. Their ongoing rivalry promises further advancements, making them attractive investment prospects in the blockchain domain.\n\nETH and SOL: Surge In DeFi TVL Dynamics\n\nEthereum holds a significant advantage as the leading platform in TVL, representing the total capital held within its smart contracts. High TVL indicates strong user activity and commitment to the platform, suggesting many users are locking up their assets in Ethereum-based DeFi projects. According to data from Defillama, ETH\u2019s total value locked is currently at $54.273 billion.\n\nSolana has a smaller TVL than Ethereum. It\u2019s known for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, which appeal to a different segment of DeFi users and developers. Solana\u2019s focus on scalability and efficiency has helped it quickly become a competitive DeFi ecosystem, attracting innovations and developers, which could boost its TVL over time. Currently, the total value locked is $4.47 billion.\n\nScalability and Efficiency\n\nHistorically, Ethereum has faced challenges with scalability and high gas fees, especially during peak usage. However, ongoing upgrades, notably the shift to Ethereum 2.0, aim to address these issues by moving from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which is expected to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs significantly.\n\nSolana is designed for high throughput and can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchains. This technical advantage makes it an attractive platform for high-frequency trading environments and applications requiring quick transaction settlements.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is Solana Faster Than Ethereum? Yes, Solana is faster than Ethereum. Solana can handle over 65,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum manages about 15 to 45. This speed comes from Solana\u2019s special design for handling many transactions. 2. Is Solana Cheaper Than Ethereum? Yes, using Solana costs less than Ethereum. Solana\u2019s transaction fees are very low, only a fraction of a penny. Ethereum\u2019s fees vary and can be high when the network is busy. 3. Is Solana More Secure Than Ethereum?

Discover SCENE\n\nMeme coins Bonk, Pepe, and Brett are among the top five worst losers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the past day, according to Coingecko data.\n\nSolana\u2019s dog coin Bonk (BONK) has taken the greatest hit, falling 12.1% to $0.000023 on the day. This comes amid a Bonk DAO vote to burn 100% of the BONK earned by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). At the time of writing, the approval is set to pass with 99.3% of the vote.\n\nMeanwhile Ethereum\u2019s Pepe (PEPE) is down 9.6% and Base chain\u2019s Brett (BRETT) has fallen 8.1%. These are outsized losses compared to the broader meme coin market, as defined by CoinGecko, which has slipped by 3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOther big meme losers include Dogwifhat (WIF) which has fallen 5.1%, Mog Coin (MOG) down 12.7%, and Popcat (POPCAT) which has stumbled 10.6%. Even meme coin veteran Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 3.1%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the meme coin market has been hit so hard that only one of the top 50 meme coins by market cap is in the green over the past 24 hours. Ethereum\u2019s Kendu Inu (KENDU) is up 13.3% after a Coinbase video advertising its new wallet web app included the token\u2019s ticker.\n\n\u201cNotice anything chads,\u201d the meme coin\u2019s Twitter account posted, \u201cCoinbase it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, KENDU has a market cap just shy of $100 million after its 21% rise over the past week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the meme coin market taking a hit, zooming out it doesn\u2019t look too bad.\n\nThe meme coin category has gained 3.1% over the past 7 days, with many of today\u2019s losers still being valued higher than they were a week ago.\n\nThis includes MOG which is up 21.3%, Bonk up 12.9%, Doge still up 7.8%, Popcat 4.4%, and Pepe 5.2%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "A popular crypto trader thinks one Ethereum (ETH) rival is primed to perform well over the coming months.\n\nThe pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 217,800 followers on the social media platform X that he\u2019s \u201cpretty neutral\u201d on Solana (SOL) over the short term but more optimistic on the asset as 2024 winds down.\n\n\u201cI still believe $120-170 is a decent region to accumulate SOL overall, and I think this still does pretty well in the second part of the year.

        "content": "Ethereum price decreased by 2.7% in the last 24 hours to trade around $3,067 during American hours hours on Friday. On the other hand, the Solana price dropped by 5.4% in the last 24 hours to trade at $135.39. ETH price gained 4.52% against Solana on Thursday, going into the wee hours of Friday morning before retracing back a little bit.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes 7% More Gains Amid Fearful Markets\n\nThe Ethereum price action is trending below the 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), while the relative strength index (RSI) is at 39 and rising. This indicates that bullish momentum is building on the Ethereum asset. The RSI also aligns with the chaikin money flow (CMF), which is at -0.05 and headed upwards. These two oscillating indicators signal that ETH price may be inbound for more upside.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the asset has bullish tendencies as the price action trailed back into the falling channel. A resistance barrier exists around the $3,300 level that, if broken, may catapult the price of ETH to $3,950.\n\nEthereum price has formed a double bottom against Solana, with 5.16% gains remaining until the market structure is completed.\n\nSOL Competes with Ethereum Price Amidst ETF Rumors\n\nOn the other hand, Solana price is trending inside an ascending triangle in the 4-hour time frame and is currently at the bottom trendline. The asset is also trending below the 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs, which is not bullish. The 200-day SMA currently offers a resistance of around $143, which coincides with the horizontal resistance line of the ascending triangle.\n\nIf the price of SOL breaks above the ascending triangle, it may surge 18% to $172. On the flip side, if bears prevail, the asset may find lower support around $121. The SOL RSI is trending at 41.61 and headed down, which shows increasing bearish momentum.\n\nNevertheless, the asset is at a crucial point against ETH price, where a bounce back could result in 15.74% gains.\n\nNate Geraci, president of ETF Store, shared Roxanna Islam\u2019s prediction that more Solana ETF applications may be filed if the ETH ETF is confirmed. Cboe\u2019s 19b-4 filings for VanEck & 21Shares already hint at the industry\u2019s readiness.\n\n\u201cI believe more issuers will submit spot Solana ETF filings after the spot ether ETFs are finalized.\u201d \u2013@roxannaswan Agree. My $$$ is on Bitwise first. pic.twitter.com/FoR84Fy9If \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 12, 2024\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum price action suggests a potential increase, targeting $3,950 if it can break through the $3,300 resistance level. Meanwhile Solana price prediction shows positive momentum in the short term against Ethereum, bucking the trend in a market where many crypto investors remain cautious. It trades within an ascending triangle pattern but shows increasing bearish momentum with its downward RSI. The price of Solana could either surge to $172 if it breaks above the pattern or find support around $121 if bearish trends continue.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the current price action for Ethereum? Ethereum's price has decreased slightly but shows potential for bullish momentum. If it can break through the $3,300 resistance, it could reach a target of $3,950. 2. What are the critical support and resistance levels for Solana? Solana is currently navigating critical support and resistance levels within an ascending triangle pattern. It could potentially surge to $172 if it breaks above the pattern or drop to $121 if bearish trends continue. 3. What are the potential impacts of ETF rumors on Solana and Ethereum? ETF rumors have a significant influence on the market. More Solana ETF applications may be filed if an ETH ETF is confirmed, potentially impacting both cryptocurrencies' market dynamics and price movements.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

There\u2019s a massive whale activity currently happening around Ethereum, with Tron founder Justin Sun trying to absorb all the selling pressure before the upcoming approval of spot Ethereum ETF, scheduled within the next two weeks.\n\nJustin Buys Ethereum in Huge Quantity\n\nAs per on-chain data provider Spot on Chain, Tron founder Justin Sun spent a total of $5 million USDT in order to acquire 1,614 ETH at a price of $3,097 per token.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSun has been on an Ethereum accumulation spree since the beginning of the year. Spot on Chain reports that since February 8, Justin Sun has reportedly accumulated a total of 362,751 ETH across three different wallets, for an estimated total investment of $1.1 billion, and an average price of $3,047 per ETH.\n\nAlong with these purchases, Spot on Chain also noted that Sun recently deposited 45 million USDT to Binance, suggesting the possibility of future Ethereum acquisitions.\n\n12 hours ago, Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) allegedly spent 5M $USDT to buy 1,614 $ETH at ~$3,097.

However, on-chain data shows that they have reportedly stopped selling ETH, while simultaneously staking a total of 40,000 ETH.\n\nMoreover, Elwood Technologies has also deposited 26,811 ETH worth over $84 million to crypto exchange Binance in the last three days. However, some of the Elwood-related addresses also withdrew 24,463 ETH from Binance during the same time.\n\nAs of now, the ETH price is holding firmly above $3,000 despite this massive whale activity.

        "content": "The launch of Ethereum ETFs remained uncertain despite Gensler\u2019s summer prediction.\n\nSEC\u2019s cautious crypto stance contrasted with the Bitcoin ETF approval under Gensler.\n\nAmid mounting anticipation, the upcoming launch of a spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund [ETF] has garnered significant attention.\n\n\n\nRemarking on the same, Katherine Dowling, Bitwise\u2019s chief compliance officer, emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the exact launch date.\n\nBitwise CCO on ETH ETF\n\nDespite SEC Chair Gary Gensler predicting a summer debut for the ETH ETF, Dowling in a recent conversation with Bloomberg, said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in the S-1 amendments that there are fewer and fewer issues that are being vetted back and forth between issuers and the SEC.\u201d\n\nShe further added,\n\n\u201cSo that points all signs in the direction that we are close. We\u2019re close to the finish line on the launch.\u201d\n\nTime for a crypto-friendly SEC admin?\n\nThis is quite surprising because Bitwise was one of the first issuers to take proactive steps by submitting an amended S-1 form to the SEC ahead of schedule, on 8th July.\n\nThis move had back then sparked excitement within the crypto community about the imminent approval of the ETH ETF.\n\nHence, the delay and uncertainty in approval highlight the SEC\u2019s cautious stance on crypto during the Biden administration.\n\nExpanding on the topic, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, put it well when he said,\n\n\u201cLooks like Solana ETFs are going to have a final deadline of mid-March 2025. But between now and then the most imp date is in November. If Biden wins, these likely DOA. If Trump wins, anything poss.\u201d\n\nReiterating the same, Dowling added,\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a really long haul to get some of these products out in the market, given the history we\u2019ve had with getting these products to market and the fact of not having futures trading in some of these potential products.\u201d\n\nNot all bad things!\n\nHowever, she also highlighted the SEC\u2019s potential for positivity during the ETF approval process when she said,\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s an act of dialogue and I think our communication with the SEC about the prospects for these products has actually been quite welcoming.\n\nThis is important because, despite the SEC\u2019s historical lack of interest in crypto, the current leadership under Gensler approved a decade-long-awaited Bitcoin [BTC] ETF.\n\nNeedless to say, the performance of the BTC ETF has been phenomenal since its debut on the 11th of January. As of the latest update on the 9th of July, the BTC ETF recorded inflows totaling $216.4 million as per Farside Investors."

        "content": "The consolidation trend in the cryptocurrency market continues as the leading digital asset Bitcoin struggles to sustain above $58000. Amid the uncertainty, the Ethereum altcoins in the ecosystem show a slight uptick due to market speculation of spot ETH ETFs getting approved around mid-July.\n\nA recent report by on-chain data tracker Lookonchain reveals significant Ethereum price ecosystem token accumulations by whales and institutions. Notably, aavebank.eth withdrew 21,027 AAVE ($1.98M), 205,493 UNI ($1.62M), 446 ETH ($1.37M), 102,313 LINK ($1.28M), and 20,797 ENS ($534K) from Binance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, whale \u201cOx345f\u201d withdrew 508,001 PENDLE ($1.89M) and 1.08M LDO ($1.77M). These large-scale transactions suggest a bullish outlook on Ethereum altcoins, indicating strong confidence from major market players.\n\nHere are the top four Ethereum ERC-20 tokens from the list above, each well-positioned for a significant market reversal.\n\nEthereum Altcoins -Chainlink (LINK)\n\nChainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in bridging real-world data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAmid the current market uncertainty, the native cryptocurrency LINK is hovering sideways above $12.2 support. This horizontal level has been intact for the past eight months now coinciding with 200W EMA to create a strong accumulation zone.\n\nToday, the Chainlink price jumped 0.44% to trade at $12.4, while the market cap surged to $7.53 Billion as seen on CoinGecko. A potential rebound could uplift the asset by 28% before challenging the key resistance of a downloping trendline.\n\nAn upside breakout from this resistance will offer a better confirmation of sustainable recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Forecast: Dwindling Open Interest Hints Sluggish Climb To $4,000\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap (UNI) stands out in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nUNI, the native governance token of Uniswap, has been trading sideways for the past five months amid the triangle formation. The two converging trendlines of the chart setup are majorly influencing this altcoin\u2019s price movement.\n\nCurrently, the Uniswap price trades at $7.75 seeking support at the pattern\u2019s lower trendline. Consequently, the Uniswap market cap holds at $4.65 Billion, while the 24-hour trading volume is at $123.1 Million.\n\nA potential rebound could push the asset 20% before piercing the upper boundary of the triangle. This breakout will signal the end-of-correction pattern and attract momentum trades into the market.\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO (LDO) is a prominent project in the Ethereum ecosystem, known for its innovative liquid staking solutions. Amid the recent market correction, the LDO price fell from a $2.5 high to a $1.4 low registering a 44% loss.\n\nThe $1.4 support marked as the August 2023 bottom, provides the LDO buyers with renewed demand pressure. With an intraday gain of 3%, the Lido Dao coin trades at $1.629, while the market maintains around $1.45 Billion.\n\nIf the support holds, this altcoin may rally 22% before challenging the first resistance carrying the correction trend. The daily chart shows two downsloping trendlines that the buyers need to breach before reclaiming better control over this asset.\n\nEthereum Altcoins To Buy: AAVE\n\nAAVE is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOutperforming the market consolidation, the AAVE price has been rising for five consecutive days. From the multi-month of $75.5, the altcoin surged 23% to hit $93.27 and the market cap jumped $1.39 Billion.\n\nThe AAVE price currently testing the downsloping trendline of the descending triangle pattern indicates a pivot momentum for the coin holders. If buyers flip the overhead trendline into suitable support, the ongoing recovery could chase the potential target of $134, followed by $153.7.\n\nHowever, a bearish reversal could signal the continuation of the consolidation trend within triangle formation.\n\nAlso Read: 32.7 Million Ethereum Staked, Nears ATH: What Is Fueling This?\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin and Ethereum shows no clear initiation from buyers or sellers to drive the crypto market. However, as the BTC price faces additional supply pressure from the German Government liquidating their Bitcoins, the potential approval of ETH ETFs bolsters Ether. Thus, the market whale/institutional entities show a higher interest in the Ethereum altcoins increasing their possibility of reversal.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a \"spot ETH ETF\"? A spot ETH ETF refers to an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to its price movements without owning the cryptocurrency themselves. 2. What does \"whale accumulation\" mean? Whale accumulation refers to large-scale buying activities by individuals or entities (whales) who hold significant amounts of cryptocurrency. 3. How does \"support\" function in technical analysis? In technical analysis, support refers to a price level below which a cryptocurrency has historically not fallen, suggesting a concentration of demand or buying interest at that level.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum HODLers lock 6400 ETH in Beacon Chain \u2013 Why it\u2019s important - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Sentiment appeared bullish ahead of the ETH ETF launch, with 40% of the total Ethereum supply now locked.\n\nBulls have kept bears at bay, suggesting that ETH might inch toward $3,500.\n\nOn the 11th of July, an unknown market participant transferred 6,400 Ethereum [ETH] to the Beacon depositor wallet. The Beacon Chain is the system responsible for validating new blocks on the Ethereum network.\n\nTherefore, sending coins to this wallet implies that holders would rather lock the supply than engage in trading them.\n\nLocking a lot of coins could reduce selling pressure, and in ETH\u2019s case, it could prevent it from declining below $3,000.\n\nETH supply continues to fall\n\nHowever, that was not the only thing. According to Glassnode, the ETH 2.0 New Deposits have been increasing.\n\nWhen this metric increases, it means that holders of the altcoins are socking away at least 32 ETH in expectation of rewards.\n\nCoincidentally, this is happening at a time when the spot Ethereum ETF launch is approaching. Going by this development, the drop in circulation suggest that the Ethereum community seem bullish on the event.\n\nShould more ETH get locked, the price of the cryptocurrency might increase. In total, the total Ethereum supply locked was 40%. Out of this, 28% has been staked and 12% \u2014 bridged via smart contracts.\n\nBut for the price to increase, the number of coins on exchanges has to reduce. To check if this was the situation, AMBCrypto assessed Ethereum\u2019s exchange inflow and outflow.\n\nExchange inflow tracks the number of crypto sent into exchange via external sources. Exchange outflow, on the other hand, is the number of ETH withdrawn.\n\nIf the exchange inflow outpaces the outflow, then the price risks correction. However, a rise in the outflow gives credence to a potential price increase.\n\nAccording to Santiment, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow was 26,500 while the outflow was 37,500. Considering the difference, there is a high chance ETH\u2019s price might jump days or weeks after official trading of the ETFs begin.\n\nA rally will begin sooner or later\n\nFollowing the development, Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, commented on the potential price action.\n\nAccording to Cowen, ETH might begin to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) by the fourth quarter of the year. He said,\n\n\u201cIf it follows last cycle, it means ALT /BTC pairs begin their final drop in August, ETH/BTC begins its final drop in late September, and then BTC dominance tops sometime in Q4.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, data from IntoTheBlock showed that Ethereum might not wait till then before it starts doing well. This was because of the state of the Bulls and Bears indicator.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nBulls refers to those who bought about 1% of the total trading volume. Bears are those who sold the same ratio of the volume.\n\nAt press time, bulls dominated ETH bears, indicating that buying pressure was more. If this remains the case going forward, ETH\u2019s price might revisit $3,300 and might approach $3,500."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision for the future of Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin speaks at EthCC in Brussels, 2024.\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, offered a comprehensive perspective on the current state and future of the ETH blockchain at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Brussels. EthCC is a major event where developers and enthusiasts gather to discuss Ethereum\u2019s advancements and challenges. In his keynote, Buterin addressed a packed room, highlighting both the strengths and vulnerabilities of Ethereum and proposing ways to fortify the network against potential threats.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder began by outlining the strengths of Ethereum, focusing on its ability to support complex smart contracts that have fostered a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). These applications range from decentralised finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), showcasing Ethereum\u2019s versatility. He also praised the Ethereum community for its international and intellectual diversity, for its contributions to the network\u2019s development and governance. It is the community that ensures the integrity and continuous improvement of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nButerin did not shy away from discussing Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses. He pointed out that the network struggles with handling a high volume of transactions, which leads to increased fees and delays. Security is also a concern, as Ethereum can be vulnerable to different types of attacks, including those targeting smart contracts. Additionally, using Ethereum can be complicated for new users. Newcomers may find managing wallets and interacting with decentralised applications difficult. There are also challenges in becoming a network validator. The validation process requires a significant amount of Ether (32 ETH) and technical knowledge to run a node. These issues can limit the network\u2019s growth and its ability to attract more users.\n\nTo address these threats, Buterin proposed several solutions. He suggested increasing the quorum threshold from 75% to 80%. This means that a larger majority of validators would need to agree to confirm transactions. This change would make it harder for malicious actors to control the network. Buterin also advocated for automated responses to 51% attacks. During such attacks a bad actor controls more than half of the network\u2019s mining power. This automation would allow honest validators to quickly move to a new fork of the chain. The goal behind this improvement is to reduce reliance on manual coordination. Simplifying the protocol and improving usability were also key points, aimed at making Ethereum easier and safer for everyone to use.\n\nButerin\u2019s commitment to Ethereum\u2019s continuous improvement was evident throughout his speech. He has been a frequent speaker at EthCC, discussing various topics over the years. In previous conferences, he tackled issues such as abstraction and the network\u2019s evolution. His ongoing engagement with the community underscores his dedication to refining Ethereum and addressing its challenges head-on.\n\nButerin\u2019s keynote at EthCC highlighted the dual nature of Ethereum\u2019s journey\u2014its strengths and its areas for improvement. By focusing on decentralisation, community engagement, and protocol simplification, Ethereum can overcome its current challenges and pave the way for a more robust future. As the blockchain continues to evolve, Buterin\u2019s insights and leadership will remain crucial in shaping its trajectory."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, dipped below $57,000 early Friday.

It's facing difficulties breaking past the $60,000 resistance due to several factors: investors anticipating Fed interest rate cuts, the German government transferring BTC to exchanges, and the liquidation of leveraged long positions. The next resistance level is at $57,750, while support is at $56,000. Investors are also eagerly awaiting the US SEC's final decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, expected later in July.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cGermany has rapidly offloaded its confiscated bitcoin holdings, transferring over 35,000 BTC, valued at $3 billion, to exchanges in the past three weeks. This move might ease concerns among crypto investors about potential supply overhang from large sellers like the U.S. government and the Mt. Gox estate, which have also recently moved substantial amounts of BTC to exchanges.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently trading at $56,923, down 0.89%. The price has declined from the $59,500 resistance zone and is now below the $57,500 mark and the 100 hourly SMA. A key declining channel with resistance at $58,400 is forming. If BTC fails to stay above the $56,500 support, it could continue to move down further. Bears could gain strength below the $56,000 support level.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cIn June, Bitcoin opened at $67,741 but closed lower at $61,529, down 15.2%. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index hit an 18-month low, indicating waning investor confidence. Concerns arose from the German sale of more than 27,000 BTC and instalments from Mt. Gox. Despite a brief increase in daily active addresses, overall Bitcoin network activity has decreased. Bitcoin dominance peaked at 52.92% on June 15, the most since April 2021. Immunefi reported a loss of $572.7 million due to hackers in Q2 2024, with significant breaches on Bitcoin DMM and BtcTurk. However, there have been positive signs of adoption, including the expansion of Strike in the UK, the legalization of Bitcoin in Bolivia, and increased activity in Bitcoin ETFs and mining companies.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin crossed the $59,000 mark immediately after June CPI data showed that inflation was negative in June. The news uplifted the market sentiments and resulted in a mini rally across major digital assets. The probability of the US fed going for a reduction in interest rates is at 70% versus less than 50% one month ago. The strong ETF inflows suggest that investors are actively buying the dip in the BTC prices which may be a good sign for the long-term market.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the overall market remained positive ahead of the U.S. CPI announcement. Despite the CPI data being less than expected, which is typically bullish for the market, the market declined afterwards, indicating underlying weakness. Currently, BTC appears weak, while altcoins are showing strength due to falling BTC dominance. ETH is also following BTC's path and could fall further if BTC declines. In the higher time frame, BTC's price action looks strongly bearish; if it loses $57,000, it could drop significantly, with key support levels at $53,600 and $50,700.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Ethereum has shown some degree of resilience in the face of heavy volatility in the broader crypto landscape, keeping ground above the $3,000 barrier in a week when Bitcoin stumbled under the weight of German economic policies.\n\nRelated Reading\n\n6,400 Ethereum Mystery Move Sparks ETH Rally Talk Pre-ETF Nod 2 months ago\n\nEther hodlers are keenly observing as the terrain of digital currencies undergoes notable changes; many of them are focusing on a possible $5,000 milestone.\n\nA Test Of The Market\n\nThere were tremors felt in the cryptocurrency market when the German government decided to sell about 5,000 BTC, or 90% of its Bitcoin holdings. As Bitcoin struggled to maintain values over $57,000, Ethereum showed remarkable resilience, remaining consistently above $3,000.\n\nBoth experts in the field and investors have noticed this difference in performance, and now people are anticipating how resistant Ethereum is to market forces in the coming days or weeks.\n\nIf Ethereum stays secure during this uncertain time, it could mean that it is no longer affected by changes in the Bitcoin market. This would have huge effects on the entire cryptocurrency business.\n\nETF Anticipation Drives Positive Mood\n\nIn the wake of the German Bitcoin selloffs, the broader crypto community is humming with expectation over the possible approval of an Ethereum ETF. If this event comes to fruition, Ethereum might reach a major turning point in terms of heavy institutional investments.\n\nThe possibility of an ETH ETF has given the market some hope as many people are guessing on significant price increase. Still, the effect of such an approval is unknown, hence investors should approach these changes warily.\n\nPrice Forecast and Technical Analysis\n\nAlthough many analysts see Ethereum\u2019s price soaring, the technical indicators show a more complex picture of ETH\u2019s existing situation even if optimistic forecasts abound.\n\n#Ethereum on the daily timeframe is looking bullish \ud83d\ude80 If $ETH holds the green box support at $3000-$2800, we could see $5000 soon. Ready for a big rally?#CryptoPatel #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/ArIWLO4WiO \u2014 Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 12, 2024\n\nA well-known cryptocurrency expert, CryptoPatel sees Ethereum as having a bright future, predicting that its price will continue to grow and may soon reach $5,000. His findings revealed significant levels of support and resistance, both of which would have an impact on the movement of ETH in the future.\n\nAccording to his observations, the green box represents a significant support zone that extends between $2,800 and $3,000. Maintaining this support level is essential to the optimistic projection for the price of the top altcoin. It is possible that Ethereum could be on track to hit $5,000 if it continues to move solidly within this green band.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMeanwhile, according to figures provided by crypto prediction platform CoinCodex, Ether will have risen by 3.68% by August 13, 2024.\n\nThe fear/greed index, on the other hand, shows some negative vibes. Last month, Ethereum had 50% green days. Because of these signs, experts say that you shouldn\u2019t buy anything right now.\n\nThese conflicting signals make it hard to predict how the altcoin will behave in the next coming weeks or months. The market is cautious, but there are hints that things will improve in the future.\n\nFeatured image from Flow, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for a price uptick as we begin a new week. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,195 and is up by 1.83% in the past 24 hours. Although Ethereum\u2019s gains are part of a wider market rally after a rebound, the altcoin is in the best position to surge the most in the coming weeks.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nFundamentals point to an extended price surge in the face of a looming launch of Spot ETFs. Additionally, technical indications are pointing to a bullish outlook for Ethereum as it approaches a crucial resistance level around $3,250.\n\nEthereum Basking In Bullish Sentiment\n\nEthereum is now looking to break above $3,200 after trading for the majority of the week below $3,100. Although Ethereum broke above $3,000 again last week, the king of altcoins largely consolidated between $3,000 and $3,100 in what looked like a slowdown of bullish sentiment.\n\nHowever, on-chain analytics and fundamentals point to Ether still basking in bullish sentiment among investors. Majority of investors are waiting for a signal before jumping on the asset.\n\nFor starters, there\u2019s a growing sense that Ethereum Spot ETFs could be on the horizon. VanEck and other potential issuers amended their filings earlier in the week in hopes of receiving the SEC\u2019s final permission. It could be a game changer for the crypto market in 2024 if Spot Ethereum ETFs start trading.\n\nAccording to Thomas Perfumo, Head of Strategy at Kraken, the Spot ETFs could open up an additional $1 billion inflow into Ethereum monthly. This new inflow of demand and money could see Ethereum push past its current all-time high of $4,900 into new price territories above $5,000.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, things are taking a better turn for the approval of these Spot ETFs, and the potential for approval by the SEC has jumped massively. As noted by Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, everything is already in place for the approval of the ETFs, and it is unclear why the SEC is taking so long. This has led to an increase in a bullish case for Ethereum for the rest of the month.\n\nYeah, rn it\u2019s all quiet on the Western Front re eth ETFs. Nada from SEC this week. Unclear why they taking such sweet ass time. Every issuer is ready. Docs are ready. It\u2019s like a rain delay in baseball. Gotta just wait. Maybe things will move fast next week. We\u2019ll see\u2026 https://t.co/o1ZSdIf1nE \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 12, 2024\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Whales Accumulate 71,000 BTC Amidst Price Dip \u2013 Details 2 months ago\n\nIndicators Looking Bullish\n\nOn the technical side of things, technical indicators also support a bullish outlook. According to the daily candlestick chart, Ethereum is on its way to closing its third consecutive bullish daily candle for the first time since June 16. The crypto is also attempting a break above the 100 SMA. A break above the 100 SMA in correlation with a bullish daily close could solidify the bullish momentum as we head into a new week.\n\nFeatured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Different predictions on the future price trajectory of Ethereum (ETH) have been triggered by the upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nOf these forecasts, one that stands out the most is that ETH might replicate the remarkable gains that Bitcoin (BTC) made between 2023 and 2024. Bitcoin increased from $26,000 to an all-time high of $73,750 over that time.\n\nEthereum ETF Could Ignite Another Bull Run, Analyst Predicts\n\nAn anonymous analyst on X Follis stated that the expected Ethereum ETF might cause ETH\u2019s price to move like BTC has in the past, with a possible 200% rise. Ethereum is now priced at $3,130, but the analyst predicts that price will grow to $9,324 by the end of the year.\n\nDemand would need to rise significantly in order for such a price hike to occur. The first signs of this increased interest were when ETH whales moved a sizable amount of money, as reported by Spot On Chain.\n\nEveryone focussed on Germany and Mt Gox\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the Ethereum ETF is about to launch and the $ETH chart looks identical to $BTC before it pumped +200% last year\n\n\n\nStudy ETF rallies pic.twitter.com/VWENNnO8dN \u2014 \u30d5 \u30a9 \u30ea \u30b9 (SG \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec) (@follis_) July 9, 2024\n\nA whale was observed to have taken out $50.30 million worth of ETH early on July 10, which was the first significant build-up since the Ethereum ETF started to garner more attention.\n\nThe recent events, in which a whale sold $12 million worth of Ethereum, stand in stark contrast to this claim. This change in behavior among Ethereum whales\u2014from spreading their holdings to making bulk purchases\u2014is corroborated by other Glassnode data.\n\nThis is demonstrated by the rise in addresses with $1 million or more in Ethereum valued at the time of reporting, from 14,217 on July 7 to 14,823 at that time. This suggests that there is increased demand for Ethereum and hope for the approval of the spot ETF.\n\nIn contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has experienced a more severe price correction. The price of ETH dropped by 24.65% between May 28 and July 9, while the price of Bitcoin dropped by a smaller amount, 19.43%.\n\nIn spite of this, according to market valuation, Bitcoin is still the most valuable cryptocurrency and is still outperforming Ethereum according to bullish signals.\n\nCautious Optimism\n\nHowever, historically, ETH\u2019s more severe price drops have presented chances for large rebounds. A double bottom formation is currently visible on the daily ETH/USD chart, indicating a possible bullish reversal.\n\nTwo low points that are located close to the same price level and suggest a stabilization and possible upward trajectory help to identify this formation.\n\nThe last time such a pattern appeared on the Ethereum chart was in January 2024. After that, the price of ETH increased by 81.94%, reaching $4,067 by April.\n\nIf past events are repeated in a comparable manner, Ethereum\u2019s price may reach $5,625 by the end of September. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s near-term outlook is still positive, provided that bulls can hold into their $2,934 support level.\n\nIs ETH About to EXPLODE? There could be Potential for a Bitcoin-Like Rally\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, with some forecasting a rise similar to Bitcoin due to the impending introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs. The likelihood of more demand\u2014especially in light of recent whale activity\u2014fuels the possibility of a price spike.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nEthereum\u2019s price adjustment is more noticeable than Bitcoin\u2019s, but there appears to be a growing interest for the cryptocurrency based on the change from whale selling to accumulation and the rise in high-net-worth Ethereum holdings.\n\nShould the expected flood of institutional capital via ETFs come to pass, ETH may see a price increase like to that of Bitcoin during its 2023\u20132024 surge."

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEthereum managed to stay above the key support at $2,800.\n\nETH/USD is now trading well below a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,265 on the daily chart.\n\nThe price could recover, but the bears might take a stand near $3,265 and $3,400.\n\nEthereum\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Ethereum (ETH) found strong bids near $2,800 and recently recovered. ETH is outperforming Bitcoin and might attempt to surpass key hurdles.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Major Uptrend Support\n\nEarlier this month, Ethereum saw a major decline below the $3,400 and $3,265 support levels. The price declined over 15% and even traded below $3,000, like Bitcoin dived below $60,000. Finally, the bulls took a stand near the main uptrend support at $2,800.\n\nA low was formed at $2,815 and it seems like the bulls again managed to defend the key support around the $2,800 zone. Ether is now recovering losses above the $3,000 resistance zone. It cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,975 swing high to the $2,815 low.\n\nEthereum price daily chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum is now consolidating and trading well below the 50-day simple moving average (blue). If there are more upsides, the price could face resistance near the $3,200 level.\n\nThe first major resistance sits near the $3,280 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,265 on the daily chart. The next resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,975 swing high to the $2,815 low at $3,400.\n\nA clear move above the trend line resistance and then $3,400 might call for a move to $3,500 and the 50-day simple moving average (blue). If Ethereum bulls push the price above the $3,500 resistance, there could be a fresh rally.\n\nIn the stated case, the price could rise toward the $3,700 level. Any more gains might initiate a move toward the $4,000 zone in the near term.\n\nMore Downsides In ETH?\n\nConversely, Ethereum might struggle to rise above the $3,265 and $3,400 resistance levels. In the stated case, it could resume its slide. The first major support sits near the $2,950 level. The main uptrend support is now forming near the $2,800 region.\n\nIf there is a daily close below the $2,800 support zone, there is a risk of a larger pullback. In the stated case, the price might test the $2,550 level. The next major support is near the $2,420 level. Any more losses might send Ether toward the $2,150 support.\n\nOverall, Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,800 and recovered above $3,000. However, ETH bulls need to clear the $3,265 and $3,400 hurdles to start a fresh uptrend."
