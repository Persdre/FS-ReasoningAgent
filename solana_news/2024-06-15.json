        "title": "Cryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.\n\nA defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nKey Takeaways A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.\n\nSome experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.\n\nThe advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.\n\nThe disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.\n\nInvestopedia / Tara Anand\n\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.\n\nCentral to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network.\n\nEvery new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.\n\nExperts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.\n\nTypes of Cryptocurrency\n\nMany cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies.\n\nBecause there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it's important to understand the types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in\u2014a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use.\n\nMost of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category:\n\nUtility : XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.\n\n: XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains. Transactional : Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.\n\n: Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.

Security tokens: Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire.\n\nIf you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate.\n\nHow to Buy Cryptocurrency\n\nIf you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency exchange. These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins.\n\nIf you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your brokerage. For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold Bitcoin futures ETF shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares.\n\n\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Legal?\n\nFiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\"\n\nBut cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure.\n\nIn the U.S.\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets\u2014either as capital gains or ordinary income\u2014depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.\n\nIn the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.\n\nEnthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry.\n\nAs of June 2024, El Salvador is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions. In the rest of the world, cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction.\n\nIn Asia\n\nJapan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.\n\nChina has banned cryptocurrency exchanges, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nIndia was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn Europe\n\nCryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as \"financial instruments.\" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users.\n\nIn addition to the market risks associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks:\n\nUser risk : Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.\n\n: Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent.

An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment. Market Manipulation: Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.\n\nDespite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion. Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.\n\nAdvantages Removes single points of failure\n\nEasier to transfer funds between parties\n\nRemoves third parties\n\nCan be used to generate returns\n\nRemittances are streamlined Disadvantages Transactions are pseudonymous\n\nPseudonymity allows for criminal uses\n\nHave become highly centralized\n\nExpensive to participate in a network and earn\n\nOff-chain security issues\n\nPrices are very volatile\n\n\n\nAdvantages Explained\n\nCryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure\u2014such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S.\n\nCryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake.\n\nBecause they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading.\n\nThe remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement.\n\nDisadvantages Explained\n\nThough they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.\n\nIn theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds.\n\nOne of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars.\n\nOnly 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools.\n\nThough cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments require accurate price monitoring. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble.\n\nIs Crypto Actually a Good Investment? Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.\n\nIs Crypto Real Money? One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money.\n\nHow Does Crypto Make You Money? There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Millionaire Maker? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum still has upside potential. But does it have enough to make you a millionaire?\n\nThere's no denying that Ethereum (ETH -4.16%) has been one of the best crypto investments of the past decade. At its current price of $3,500, Ethereum is up more than 10,000-fold from its initial price of just $0.31. As a result, an investment of just $100 in 2015 would have likely been enough to make you a crypto millionaire today.\n\nBut we're moving into Ethereum's second decade now, and it's no longer a slam-dunk certainty that you can become a crypto millionaire by investing at today's prices. If you are thinking about investing in it for that purpose, here are three important questions to ask yourself.\n\n1. Does Ethereum still have 1,000x upside?\n\nLet's assume for a moment that you have $1,000 to invest in Ethereum right now. For that initial investment to grow to $1 million, it would need to increase in value 1,000-fold. A decade ago, that was certainly possible. But what about today?\n\nRemember: In 2015, Ethereum had the all-important first-mover advantage. It was literally the first smart-contract blockchain platform, and that opened up all kinds of new opportunities that even Bitcoin (BTC -2.10%) couldn't match.\n\nSo Ethereum went on to create, define, and control entire sectors of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to blockchain gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it was not just the first to market. It was also best to market.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum no longer has the first-mover advantage. There are plenty of new challengers, and plenty of blockchains that can offer exactly what it can offer, if not more. So it only makes sense that the explosive growth that characterized the early years of Ethereum might no longer be possible. That's bad news if you're expecting 1,000x upside.\n\n2. How long can Ethereum remain the market leader?\n\nThere are now three direct Ethereum challengers -- Solana (SOL -4.76%), Avalanche (AVAX -6.54%), and Cardano (ADA -4.85%) -- that rank among the top 15 cryptocurrencies in market cap.\n\nThe appearance of these new challengers means that Ethereum's dominant market share in the various niches is slowly being eroded. So even if it is able to create entirely new blockchain niches (as it has for the past decade), the share of the market it will capture will likely continue to shrink over time.\n\nOf even more concern, some of these blockchain rivals are being viewed by investors as potential \"Ethereum killers.\" This poses a clear existential threat.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing blockchains, users and developers have a choice. And if the new Ethereum rivals continue to claim much higher speeds, enhanced throughput capacity, and lower fees, which blockchains do you think users are going to choose?\n\n3. What will be the effect of the new ETFs?\n\nLastly, there's the question of just how much of a lift the new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are going to provide. Just about everyone agrees that there was much more demand and hype for the new spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more than $30 billion in customer funds. However, JPMorgan Chase thinks that the new spot Ethereum ETFs will pull in only $3 billion.\n\nAs a result, the spot Ethereum ETFs are likely to be much less impactful than many people think. If you're expecting the price of the crypto to soar as soon as these new ETFs start trading, you might be disappointed.\n\nSetting realistic expectations\n\nThis might be tough to acknowledge, but Ethereum might only have 10x upside over the foreseeable future. And even that could be too optimistic. Given its current market cap of just over $400 billion, a 10-fold increase in value would imply a new market cap of $4 trillion. That's significantly more than Nvidia, which now has a lofty $3 trillion market value.\n\nA $4 trillion valuation might have been possible back when Ethereum had a clear economic moat to keep away potential challengers. But the barbarians are now at the gate, and some of them are crossing the drawbridge.\n\nFor that reason, I'm unconvinced that Ethereum is still a millionaire maker. Unfortunately, if you are really serious about becoming a millionaire, you might need to find \"the next Ethereum\" -- an undiscovered crypto with 1,000x upside that you can buy for mere pennies. And that, as we all know, is a lot harder to do than it sounds."

        "title": "Ethereum's Tailwind: How the SEC ETF approval boosted Memecoin mania - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Why the Ethereum ETF Effect?\n\nA Look at Key Ethereum Memecoins\n\nLong-Term Impact: A Speculative Future\n\n\n\nInstitutional Interest: A Long Road?\n\n\n\nMemecoins: Flavour of the season\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF, particularly BlackRock 's IBIT, has been the fastest-growing ETF to date, reaching $20 billion in just 137 days. In comparison, the next closest, JEPI, took nearly 1,000 days to achieve the same milestone. Now that the money men have tasted blood, and Ethereum spot ETFs to be listed, there are some interesting developments in the crypto market.While the primary impact is directly on Ethereum, there's been a fascinating secondary effect \u2013 a surge in the valuations of memecoins built on the Ethereum blockchain. Let's understand how this development is impacting the memecoin landscape and what it means for the future.Memecoins, often known for their viral appeal and sometimes questionable utility, have seen significant price boosts following the Ethereum ETF announcement. Notable memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced double-digit percentage gains, while lesser-known tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Dogelon Mars (ELON) skyrocketed by even higher margins.Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. The approval of an Ethereum ETF signifies growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This is also a major development in the industry after the Bitcoin ETF approval which witnessed large volumes of institutional money inflows. This can attract new investors, particularly those with a risk appetite who might explore memecoins as a volatile yet potentially high-reward entry point into the Ethereum ecosystem.The ETF reinforces confidence in Ethereum as a blockchain among users which partially translates to interest and enthusiasm in memecoins built on Ethereum. Compared to memecoins on alternative blockchains like Solana, Ethereum's established developer community, network security, and scalability efforts (like Ethereum 2.0) provide a perceived edge.: One of the OG memecoins, thanks to Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement, DOGE has seen renewed interest. While its utility remains debatable, its brand recognition and loyal community stand to benefit from the Ethereum ETF tailwind.: Known as the \"Dogecoin Killer,\" SHIB has also enjoyed a price increase. Its efforts to build a decentralised ecosystem with its SHIB token, Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain and LEASH governance token might attract investors seeking a more feature-rich memecoin experience within the Ethereum network.: Inspired by Elon Musk's dog of the same name, FLOKI positions itself as a memecoin supporting various charitable causes. The Ethereum ETF effect, coupled with FLOKI's community based initiatives, could attract impact-driven investors seeking memecoin exposure.: This space-themed memecoin, referencing Elon Musk's Mars ambitions, has seen significant gains. While its long-term viability remains to be seen, current market sentiment favours this token as a part of the overall market gains.The long-term impact of the Ethereum ETF on memecoins remains a grey area. While the current surge suggests renewed interest, memecoins are inherently volatile and prone to market corrections. Their long-term success hinges on developing real utility beyond mere hype, something that could be achieved by clear community guidelines and consensus, and of course a concrete regulatory framework.The Ethereum ETF approval gives Ethereum-based memecoins a temporary advantage over those on Solana. While Solana offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees, Ethereum's established reputation and developer base currently hold more sway in market sentiment. However, as market dynamics evolve and Solana continues to develop, this advantage could shift.Apart from reputation risk and uncertainty, institutional interest in memecoins isn't completely unfathomable. Despite their volatility, some memecoins boast massive market capitalizations and active communities. Institutions might see a potential for controlled exposure to capture some of this growth. A small allocation of memecoins could serve as a diversification tool in their broader portfolio. Some memecoins are exploring ways to develop utility, such as integrating with decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols or play-to-earn gaming platforms. This could attract institutions seeking exposure to these emerging trends. If memecoins gain wider mainstream acceptance like in the gaming community or other metaverse projects, and demonstrate long-term stability, institutional attitudes could shift.In May alone, 455,000 tokens were launched on Solana. During the same month, 177,000 tokens were introduced on Base, while Optimism and Arbitrum each saw the launch of 20,000 new tokens. Most of them were memecoins. Virtually everyone understands that investing in meme coins is gambling. In a casino, one is gambling against the house, everyone knows the house always wins. Many people view the stock market in a similar light, which is why GameStop and 'Roaring Kitty' gained traction\u2014because it felt like someone was sticking it to the house. However, people recognize that the house always wins. Meme coins, on the other hand, offer a different dynamic. They provide a sense of peer-to-peer competition rather than betting against the house. It's more about competing with fellow enthusiasts, which is a more exciting and less disheartening game. The PVP (player versus player) nature of it gives people a sense of having a chance. These activities are not controlled by Wall Street suits, which adds to their appeal. It's a way of rebelling against a system perceived as rigged against the average investor.The SEC 's approval of the Ethereum ETF has had an unexpected but fascinating consequence \u2013 a resurgence in Ethereum-based memecoins. While the long-term viability of these tokens is uncertain, the current market sentiment favours established blockchains like Ethereum. This, along with the potential influx of new investors, has created a short-term boost for these memecoins. However, for the enthusiasm to continue, these tokens will need to evolve beyond mere internet hype and demonstrate tangible utility."

They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, thus providing a more accessible and regulated investment vehicle.\n\nThis approval sparked significant interest and investment inflows, highlighting the growing acceptance and institutional interest in digital assets.\n\nThe success of the Bitcoin ETF has paved the way for further crypto-related financial products, and the market has been keenly awaiting similar developments for other such products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe anticipation for Ethereum ETFs has been particularly high, especially following the positive signals from regulatory authorities. The funds received initial approval in late May, but will not start trading until funds\u2019 S-1 registration forms are approved.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday indicated that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs might be completed by the end of the summer.\n\n\u201cIndividual issuers are still working through the registration process that's working smoothly, and I envision sometime over the course of the summer,\u201d Gensler said during a Senate hearing Thursday.\n\nTradFi butts in\n\nDespite the added mainstream attention coming with ETFs, Quigley expressed dissatisfaction with the increasing involvement of traditional finance in the crypto space.\n\n\"I was happy with crypto without Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be smaller? Of course. But I didn't feel the need to keep growing the size of crypto now.\u201d\n\nHe warned that Wall Street's aggressive marketing of crypto products could lead to significant risks, especially if institutional investors pull out during market downturns.\n\nDespite his reservations about Wall Street's involvement, Quigley acknowledged that a significant capital influx is essential for substantial market growth.\n\n\"If you want a massive amount of capital, then yes, you have to do things like ETFs,\" he conceded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile ETF hype was partially credited with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high price above $73,700 in March, alongside anticipation for April\u2019s quadrennial halving event, BTC has yet to seriously challenge that mark again in the months since\u2014and is down this week at a current price of just under $67,000.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s price typically climbs six months or more after the halving, which constrains the expanding supply, as the impacts of that event start to be felt. Quigley believes that historical patterns will continue along that path as well.\n\n\"It can't go higher because it's not the right time,\" he said, predicting a significant price increase ahead.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This major shift marks a turning point in the adoption of public blockchains. It also opens the door to a deeper integration of this technology into the workings of financial markets.\n\nPublic blockchains, particularly Ethereum, represent the future (Source: Twitter)\n\nBlackRock and public blockchains: a new direction\n\nUntil now, BlackRock tended to favor private blockchains. However, experience has shown that public blockchains, like Ethereum, offer significant advantages in terms of transparency, accessibility, and governance.\n\nTransparency on Ethereum\n\nTransactions on Ethereum are visible to everyone, allowing investors to track capital flows in real-time and ensure the proper execution of operations. This increased transparency is essential for:\n\nstrengthening trust in blockchain-based financial products,\n\nattracting a broader audience of investors.\n\nAccessibility\n\nPublic blockchains (like Ethereum) are open to everyone. This allows anyone to participate in the network and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) built on them. This open accessibility fosters innovation and the creation of new financial products.\n\nGovernance\n\nEthereum and all other public blockchains are managed in a decentralized manner.\n\nExplanation: users have a say in the development and evolution of the platform. This participatory governance promotes accountability.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s first tokenization project on Ethereum\n\nTo solidify its commitment to public blockchains, BlackRock launched its first tokenization project on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis project involves converting a traditional investment fund, \u201cInstitutional Digital Liquidity,\u201d into digital tokens based on Ethereum. These digital tokens, denominated in USD Coin (USDC), provide investors with transparent and secure access to portfolio diversification.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to adopt Ethereum is a strong signal of the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

This brings the project\u2019s total funding to date to $22 million. The company plans to use these funds to support the initial stage of its open testnet, dubbed Helium, which will enable developers to deploy smart contracts to the Fhenix network for the first time.\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a novel form of cryptography that allows data to be computed blindly without ever needing to be decrypted. Fhenix is the first blockchain to natively integrate FHE in order to deliver an EVM-compatible smart contract platform that allows developers to encrypt all or part of their Solidity-based applications using familiar tools without any prior knowledge of FHE encryption.\n\n1 View gallery Blockchain. ( Photo: Shutterstock )\n\n\"My life's work has been research into secure computation with the goal of bringing confidentiality onchain. After exploring every available technical solution to this problem I came to the conclusion FHE is the best possible solution. The launch of the Fhenix testnet is an important step towards bringing encrypted computation onchain,\" said Guy Zyskind, co-founder of Fhenix.\n\nFhenix recently announced a technical partnership with EigenLayer around the development of FHE Coprocessors, which enable host chains\u2013whether that be Ethereum itself, L2s, or L3s\u2013to offload specific computational tasks to a designated processor, enabling developers on any EVM-compatible chain to integrate encrypted computation into their application logic."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, a PEPE trader has capitulated, selling all of his 114.7 billion PEPE tokens for 366.5 ETH, worth approximately $1.27 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the trader initially purchased the 114.7 billion PEPE tokens on May 14 and May 15 for $0.000011 per token, totaling $1.27 million.\n\nThis entry point seemed promising as the PEPE was gaining traction and attracting considerable interest within the crypto market. PEPE would later surge to all-time highs of $0.00001718 about 14 days later.\n\nThis $PEPE trader capitulated and sold all 114.7B $PEPE for 366.5 $ETH($1.27M) at a breakeven price.\n\n\n\nHe bought 114.7B $PEPE($1.27M) at $0.000011 on May 14 and May 15.\n\n\n\nThe price of $PEPE broke through $0.000017 on May 27, at which time his profit was $670K(+50%), but he did not\u2026 pic.twitter.com/aPxuftE1yI \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 15, 2024\n\nOn May 27, the price of PEPE surged, breaking through the $0.000017 mark. At this peak, the trader's holdings were valued at $1.94 million, presenting a potential profit of $670,000, or 50% gains. Despite the substantial gain, the trader chose not to sell, possibly holding onto the tokens in anticipation of further price increases, which proved costly.\n\nHowever, the market took an unfavorable turn as PEPE's price began to decline. The downward trend continued, and the value of PEPE fell below the trader's breakeven point of $0.000011.\n\nFacing the sustained drop in PEPE's price, the trader ultimately decided to sell all 114.7 billion tokens. The sale was made at a breakeven price, yielding 366.5 ETH, nearly equivalent to his initial investment of $1.27 million.\n\nAlthough the trader did not incur a financial loss, the missed opportunity for a substantial profit underscores the significance of timing the market perfectly. More often than not, market timing has been found to significantly impact trading outcomes.\n\nAt the time of writing, PEPE had dropped 0.79% in the previous 24 hours to $0.00001204. The frog-themed cryptocurrency has slowly decreased since reaching an all-time high of $0.0000171 on May 27. PEPE struck a low of $0.00001057 in yesterday's trading session as profit-taking continued and the market saw a slump before rebounding rapidly."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent reports by crypto journalist Colin Wu reveal a significant transaction involving Ethereum (ETH), worth $64.4 million. The funds were moved from an account previously associated with the Ethereum Foundation, identified as \"0x8e23,\" to a newly created address, \"0x8798.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original transaction in which the Ethereum Foundation sent 44,167 ETH, then worth $40,930, to \"0x8e23,\" took place nine years ago on Nov. 20, 2015. As of now, this amount of Ethereum is equivalent to $154.58 million.\n\nThis is not the first time that one of the key entities associated with the major altcoin token may have sold its ETH. However, it is one of the largest in recent times, with previous recent cases not exceeding 100 ETH, or $350,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, justified these sales with the need to cover the operating costs of the organization, or charity. Whether the possible sale of ETH worth tens of millions of dollars is justified by such a need remains a question.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price outlook\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the main altcoin continues to torment traders in the range of $3,400 to $3,900, and it still will not update its all-time high at $4,868.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nUncertainty is added by the low-liquidity summer market and confusion with the dates related to the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.

Notably, the wallet\u2019s substantial buy-up, totaling around $20 million, has sparked optimism about potential price movements and the broader implications for the market amid current volatility.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the recent accumulation pattern and see the potential reasons that might keep the momentum consistent.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum & Uniswap Price Soars Anticipation Amid $20M Accumulation\n\nA wallet related to Amber Group made waves in the cryptocurrency world by amassing $20 million worth of Ethereum and Uniswap. According to the on-chain transaction tracking platform Lookonchain, the wallet withdrew 987,053 UNI, valued at $10.6 million, and 2,638 ETH, worth $9.2 million, from Binance within just three hours today.\n\nMeanwhile, this large-scale accumulation has fueled a slight recovery in both Ethereum and Uniswap prices. Notably, the news has generated significant buzz among investors, eager to see if this momentum will be sustained in the face of a fluctuating market.\n\nMarket analysts suggest that this substantial purchase by a major player like Amber Group could indicate strong confidence in these assets\u2019 future prospects. However, some caution that while such accumulation can trigger short-term price increases, the challenge lies in maintaining this upward trajectory.\n\nNotably, the broader market dynamics and ongoing volatility play a crucial role in determining whether these gains will hold.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Ethereum Exchange Reserve Plunges, Price To Recover?\n\nWill The Rally Sustain?\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price recovery has been buoyed by expectations surrounding the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF approval. The SEC has already accepted the 19b-4 filings for Ether ETF as of May 23. Besides, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has recently hinted that the approval for Ethereum Spot ETF could come by the end of summer, adding to market optimism.\n\nIn addition, a senior Bloomberg ETF analyst anticipates that the Spot Ethereum ETF might get approved around July 2. This potential timeline projection has further boosted Ethereum\u2019s market confidence, making it a focal point for investors betting on its sustained growth.\n\nSuch regulatory advances are crucial, as they enhance Ethereum\u2019s appeal to institutional investors, driving potential price support and long-term growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Uniswap has shown significant growth in its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. According to a recent X post from Uniswap Labs, the protocol\u2019s all-time L2 volume has reached $300 billion.\n\nNotably, the timeline to reach each $100 billion milestone has accelerated dramatically:\n\n22 months for $100 billion.\n\n10 months for $200 billion.\n\n3 months to achieve $300 billion.\n\nThis rapid growth underscores increasing user adoption and heightened transaction volumes on Layer 2 (L2) platforms, reflecting a robust uptrend. Besides, this impressive growth trajectory has strengthened investor confidence in Uniswap\u2019s continued expansion and the potential rise in demand for UNI tokens.\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum price soared 0.50% and exchanged hands at $3,533.98, with its trading volume soaring 13% to $16.13 billion. On the other hand, Uniswap price noted a surge of 1.91% to $10.96, while its volume soared more than 34% to $360.5 million.\n\nNotably, as of writing, Ethereum Futures Open Interest rose 2.59% to $15.80 billion, while Ethereum Options Open Interest surged 1.63% to $6.38 billion.

The value of FLOKI declined by 28.52% over the past week, to appear on the list of Ethereum crypto losers today, with a price of $0.0002061.\n\nThe technical analysis of the meme coin mainly a bearish sentiment, as both EMA and SMA indicators signal a downward trend.\n\nThe negative value of the MACD Level supports this belief by showing selling pressure. Additionally, the RSI reading indicates an oversold condition, potentially presenting a chance for investors to buy.\n\nFibonacci support level is at $0.0001608803 while the resistance level is at $0.0003310183. FLOKI is nearing its support level, indicating that it could potentially stabilize in the near future.\n\n3.

This demonstrates a decline of 21.77% in its price over the past week, resulting into a market cap of $838.78 million .\n\nThe technical analysis shows mostly bearish sentiment, as both EMA and SMA indicators are signaling a downward trend.\n\nThe negative MACD Level reinforces this view by showing selling pressure. Moreover, the RSI value indicates that a potential buying opportunity could be nearing as the token nears oversold territory.\n\nFibonacci support can be seen at $0.3116 while resistance is located at $0.7879.

Keeping up-to-date and being adaptable are essential to successfully navigate the unpredictable crypto market."

        "content": "There has been a lot of changes in the price of Ethereum in the recent past. ETH price fell to $3,368 on June 14 before rising to $3,512 and remaining above $3,500 at the time of writing. At the moment, ETH is trading at over $3,548, which has risen by 0.34% in the last day even as it fell by 2.96% in the past week. These price movements have been felt in both the long and short positions in the market.\n\nOther on-chain metrics include changes in ETH\u2019s realized profit, which is the total value of all coins that have been moved and sold at a price lower than the current market value. The realized profit for ETH was $55.18 million on June 12 and increased to $104.58 million by June 14.\n\nThis increase may therefore be an indication of the holders taking profits which if the pressure is sustained may lead to a price drop. Nevertheless, if the profit taken hits the market at $3,400 \u2013 $3,600 levels, it might trade between this range in the coming days."

        "content": "NOT followed TON\u2019s price direction as demand pushed the volume to $1.37 billion\n\nToken seemed overbought, pointing to a possible fall to $0.016 on the charts\n\nNotcoin [NOT] defied the broader market \u201cred period\u201d as the price climbed by 7.22% in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, this happened at a time when Bitcoin [BTC] slid to $65,103 before slightly recovering above $66,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] also registered a decline to $3,381 around the same time. The performance underscores Notcoin\u2019s next-to-nothing correlation with the top two cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt press time, NOT changed hands at $0.020. On 14 June, however, the token had initially tapped $0.022 on the price charts.\n\nNOT sentiment bullish, goes with TON\n\nHowever, Notcoin is not alone in its rise as fellow Telegram-linked project Toncoin [TON] joined in too. A few weeks ago, AMBCrypto had reported how NOT did not follow the same trend as TON.\n\nOn the back of the latest price hike, it would seem now that the two have aligned.\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, we also found that sentiment around Notcoin has been incredibly bullish. Using the Weighted Sentiment metric, for instance, AMBCrypto observed that the reading was 0.178 on 13 June. However, at press time, the same metric had hit 0.617.\n\nThe notable hike within a short period implies that online comments about NOT were much more positive than those that were bearish about the token.\n\nApart from the price hike and bullish sentiment, Notcoin\u2019s volume surpassed the $1 billion mark. The increase in volume constituted a 131% hike in the last 24 hours.\n\nTrading volume is crucial for a cryptocurrency\u2019s price and direction. It indicates if market participants are interested in a token.\n\nHeavy movement of the volume, alongside a price increase, suggests an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, if the spike comes with a price fall, it implies a hike in selling pressure.\n\nNotcoin\u2019s price may go down later\n\nFor NOT, it was the former. However, it is unlikely that NOT\u2019s volume would hit $4 billion like it did when the price hit an all-time high of $0.029 on 2 June.\n\nEvidence of this was reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is an oscillator that measures speed and changes in price movements.\n\nA value of over 70 indicates that an asset is overbought. When it is less than 30, it means that it is oversold. In Notcoin\u2019s case, the RSI on the daily chart had a reading of 74.27.\n\nSimply put, the token was overbought. Thus, the price might begin a slow reversal down the chart. If this happens, the price of NOT might fall to $0.016 within a few days.\n\nHowever, this prediction would be invalidated if the broader market condition changes. Assuming prices across the board begin to move north, NOT might follow suit.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s NOT\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nShould this be the case, the value of the token might jump to $0.022 once more. Besides that, market participants should be on the lookout for developments or announcements around the project as this could also impact the price."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 7% in the last seven days.\n\nMost metrics and market indicators hinted at a trend reversal.\n\nThe end of May for Ethereum [ETH] was bullish as the token\u2019s daily chart showed a massive green candlestick. But last week wasn\u2019t in investors\u2019 interest as the token dropped substantially.\n\nHowever, the declining price trend might change soon, which might allow ETH to retest its March highs.\n\nEthereum enters a bullish pattern\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 7% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,516.89 with a market capitalization of over $422 billion.\n\nInvestors\u2019 shouldn\u2019t get disheartened as a bullish pattern emerged on the token\u2019s daily chart. AMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s price has been consolidating inside a bullish flag pattern.\n\nThe token entered the pattern after reaching its May high. At press time, the token\u2019s price was testing the support near the lower limit of the bullish flag pattern.\n\nA successful test could initiate a bull rally. If that happens, then it would be surprising to see Ethereum retest its March highs of $4k in the coming weeks.\n\nWill ETH test the pattern?\n\nIt will be crucial for ETH to register a few green candlesticks in the coming days in order for ETH to test the bullish flag pattern. To see whether that\u2019s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed CryptoQuant\u2019s data.\n\nAs per our analysis, ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was dropping, meaning that buying pressure on the token was high. Additionally, the total number of coins transferred has increased by 13.93% over the last 24 hours, which can be inferred as a bullish signal.\n\nThings in the derivatives market also looked optimistic as ETH\u2019s funding rate rose. This meant that long-position traders are dominant and are willing to pay short-position traders.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data pointed out that ETH\u2019s NVT ratio dropped last week. Whenever the metric drops, it means that an asset is undervalued, which usually results in price upticks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price touched the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands, hinting at a rebound. Moreover, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark.\n\nNonetheless, the MACD displayed a bearish advantage in the market, which could cause trouble for ETH\u2019s recovery.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap to look for possible support and resistance levels. We found that if ETH turns bullish in the coming days, investors might witness ETH touch $3,675 in the coming days.\n\nHowever, if ETH fails to test the bullish flag pattern, then the token might drop to $3,500 in the short term."

        "content": "Both longs and shorts experienced a turbulent time after ETH\u2019s price went up and down\n\nRealized Profits increased, indicating that the value may fall below $3,400\n\nThe high volatility in the market caused liquidations in the market to hit $215 million. Out of this, Ethereum [ETH] contracts accounted for $50.61 million, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nLiquidations occur when a trader does not have a sufficient margin balance to keep a position open. The forceful closure is necessary to avoid further losses.\n\nStormy season for the market\n\nFor ETH, the high liquidations could be linked to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. A look at the price action revealed that it dropped to $3,368 at some point on 14 June. Later on, the value rose to $3,512, before settling above $3,500 at press time.\n\nAs a result of these price swings, both longs and shorts were not spared. Longs refer to traders betting on the price of an asset to hike. Shorts, on the other hand, are traders with stakes on a price decline.\n\nHowever, traders seemed to expect the depreciation in price. This, because of the Put/Call ratio before Friday\u2019s options of expiry. According to Deribit, the derivatives exchange, Ethereum\u2019s Put/Call Ratio was 0.37.\n\nSince the ratio was below 0.50, it meant that expectations have been bearish. However, it did not seem the participants anticipated the high level of volatility.\n\nIn terms of the price, AMBCrypto looked at the Realized Profit too. As the name implies, this denotes the total of all moved coins whose last price was lower than its press time value.\n\nETH plans to swing between $3,400 and $3,600\n\nOn 12 June, ETH\u2019s Realized Profit was $55.18 million. By 14 June, the value had risen to $104. 58 million. An increase in this metric implies that holders are booking profits, and this could lead to a price fall on the charts.\n\nHowever, if the metric stabilizes itself, selling pressure reduces across the market. For Ethereum, Realized Profit seems to have settled around the aforementioned value. Therefore, it might be likely for the altcoins to trade between $3, 400 and $3,600 over the next few days.\n\nAMBCrypto also analyzed Exchange inflows and outflows to assess ETH\u2019s next movement. Exchange inflows track the number of coins sent into exchanges.\n\nIf this increases, it means that holders are planning to sell. When this happens, the price of a cryptocurrency usually decreases. Exchange outflows, on the other hand, measures the number of coins sent out of exchanges.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Exchange inflows were $34,400 while the altcoin\u2019s outflows were 24,100. The difference in the flows implied that there were more ETH up for sale, than those retired to cold wallets.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIf this continues, the price of the cryptocurrency might drop below $3,400 like it did on 14 June. On the other hand, a fall in selling pressure could halt this decline and ETH might keep consolidating on the charts."

Although Ethereum\u2019s weekly NFT sales volume also rose by 17%, it amounted to \u201cjust\u201d $40 million.\n\nThis, notwithstanding the fact that 99,297 NFT transactions were completed on Ethereum last week.

In the last 30 days, BAYC\u2019s sales volume totalled $12 million, having plummeted by 34%.\n\nAs far as the CryptoPunks NFT collection is concerned, its floor price was 27.42 ETH at press time, representing its year-to-date lowest.\n\nAfter peaking at 63 ETH on 24 January, the average price of an NFT in the collection has since fallen by a massive 57%."
