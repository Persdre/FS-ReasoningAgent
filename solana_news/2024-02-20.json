        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ethereum. Analysts see four drivers behind an even bigger surge - DLNews",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Ether\u2019s trip to $3,000 may have been short-lived, but on-chain data and the state of the wider ecosystem suggests that there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the digital asset.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) hit a near two-year high ahead of $3,000 on Tuesday \u2013 the first time it has traded at this level since April 2022.\n\nThe second largest digital asset by market cap rallied over 12% in the last week and briefly changed hands at $3,031, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, ether had failed to gain momentum towards a move higher, suggesting that this resistance level won\u2019t be so easy to breach.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this recent rally could also have some traders on their toes, given the last time ether rallied to this level in the weeks leading up to April 3, 2022. At the time, ether rallied from $2,520 over three weeks to a high of $3,580, but its price plummeted 46% over the next 40 days that followed.\n\nIn its most recent review of the crypto market, onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that while Bitcoin dominance still remains significant, there are early signs of more investor capital rotating into other ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe note that following the approval of the bitcoin ETF, ether has started to outperform bitcoin, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023,\u201d said the Glassnode analysts.\n\nIt is also likely that major inflows into ether will only materialize over the coming weeks, as they tend to lag relative to bitcoin inflows on account of investors looking for confirmation that digital asset markets are growing.\n\n\u201cIn the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into bitcoin occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ether,\u201d said Glassnode analysts.\n\nOptions market data suggests that a retest of some crucial price levels might come sooner rather than later. Coinalyze data points to more bullish bets on the price of ether, showing that 59% of traders were in long positions over a 24-hour time frame."

        "content": "On Feb. 20, Solana TVL surpassed $2 billion for the first time in 2 years, and funds flowing in from Ethereum through the Wormhole bridge suggest more SOL price gains ahead.\n\nSOL\u2018s price has lost steam after soaring to a new 2024 peak of $118.40 on Feb. 15. However, an on-chain data trail of funds inflows trickling down to Solana from the Ethereum (ETH) network this week could spark a SOL price rebound toward $150.\n\nSolana price dips 12%, falling below market average\n\nIn the first half of February 2024, Solana was at the forefront of the crypto market rally, with SOL price soaring 26.8% and adding nearly $11 billion to its market capitalization. But that market trend flipped on Feb. 15 as investors began to take profits once the SOL price reached the 2024 peak of $118.\n\nSolana (SOL) price performance vs. Total3 Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC and ETH) | Source: TradingView\n\nAt press time on Feb. 21, Solana is trading at $103, down 12% from its Feb. 15 peaks.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast, the total altcoin market has grown by 5% during that period. Solana\u2019s negative price performance seems driven by insiders and existing holders\u2019 booking profits rather than macro factors.\n\nSolana receives $25 million in inflows from Ethereum\n\nHowever, while some SOL traders are taking chips off the table, the Solana network has continued to make some giant strides this week, which could trigger an early price rebound.\n\nIn the past week, Solana has received significant inflows from Ethereum as investors increasingly look to leverage Solana\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective defi services.\n\nBetween Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, investors transferred funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum to Solana, per on-chain data from Wormhole bridge Explorer.\n\nFund Outflows Ethereum (ETH) to Solana (SOL), Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 21 | Source: Wormhole Bridge\n\nThis indicates that Solana continues gaining traction among developers and defi users due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. Hence, this rising flow of funds bridged into Solana-hosted decentralized applications (dApps) is a bullish indicator of its growing adoption and utility.\n\nSolana defi TVL hits $2 billion milestone\n\nInvestors transferring funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum into the Solana ecosystem, despite the 12% decline in Solana\u2019s price over the last seven days, shows an evident divergence between short-term price movements and long-term investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL) Total Value Locked (TVL) hits $2 billion, Feb. 21, 2024 | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nThe latest wave of fund inflows has now propelled Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Solana network above the $2 billion milestone for the first time since June 2022.\n\nThis further underlines that the ongoing SOL price pullback is not driven by any discernible deterioration of Solana\u2019s fundamental network growth metrics.\n\nIf the trends persist, the rising demand for Solana defi service could eventually evolve into market demand for native SOL tokens and ultimately trigger a bullish price reversal towards the $150 territory in the coming weeks."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Filecoin, and Hedera Are on Fire Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculation about cryptocurrency ETFs continues, but a lot is going on under the crypto hood.\n\nThe crypto market's hot streak is continuing, and since the market closed on Friday, there have been some big movers. And in some of these cases, the moves have been driven by real developments, not just hype.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.88%) has risen as much as 8.1% since the stock market closed on Friday, Filecoin (FIL -0.78%) jumped by 40.7%, and Hedera (HBAR -2.34%) was up 38.7%. As of noon ET Tuesday, the tokens were up 5.4%, 30%, and 22.1% since Friday.\n\nBig crypto moves all around\n\nEthereum is rising in part because traders are still speculating that regulators will approve more crypto ETFs beyond the Bitcoin (BTC -0.45%) ETFs launched in the last few months. The next coin that is likely to get approval for one is Ethereum because of its size and recognition in the market.\n\nIf an ETF were approved, the purchasing activity around the coin could push Ethereum higher, in a similar fashion to the way Bitcoin has responded. Just last week, $2.4 billion flowed into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFilecoin's rise was prompted by more fundamental news: It announced it will store Solana's (SOL -0.46%) block history, allowing Solana to move to more decentralized storage. This should be a win for both cryptocurrencies; Solana can now focus more attention on expanding the high-throughput network while Filecoin gets a significant partner.\n\nLesser-known token Hedera is benefiting from the growth in its SaucerSwap decentralized exchange, which now has over $127 million in total locked value, a gauge of how much investors are putting into the exchanges on the ecosystem.\n\nBuilding the foundation of crypto's future\n\nIndividually, these moves may seem small. But together, they tell a story about where crypto is headed in the near future.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been approved, which suggests that eventually, ETFs for Ethereum and other tokens could arrive too, bringing more money into the ecosystem and driving values higher. If an Ethereum ETF gets approved, there may soon be dozens of crypto ETFs.\n\nThe Filecoin and Hedera news is more useful for the industry long term. As more tokens and exchanges are launched, it's necessary for market makers to put value into the ecosystem, and that's part of what we're seeing with the SaucerSwap exchange. Filecoin helping Solana store its blockchain history moves that token toward the decentralized vision that so many advocates would like to see.\n\nIf Solana and Filecoin can work together to create an extremely fast, high-throughput blockchain with accessible storage, it would be a win for all blockchain users. This is where I think we will see more utility and financial products built in the near future.\n\nCrypto is maturing before our eyes\n\nTwo years ago, crypto was still in the speculative trading days, and speculation in that market still exists, but major tokens like this are now focused on building real utility on blockchains. If that utility is combined with more investors putting money into the crypto ecosystem, it could create a reinforcing loop of value creation."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's recent price trajectory has been met with a stark rejection, as it encountered a near-impenetrable resistance level that has halted its upward momentum. This resistance confluence is particularly formidable as it aligns with the 100, 50 and 200 EMAs, key technical indicators closely monitored by traders for significant price movements.\n\nThe current price level has proven to be a substantial barrier for XRP, as the EMAs have converged to form a tight band of resistance. This band has effectively capped the price, acting as a ceiling that XRP has struggled to breach. The close proximity of these EMAs indicates a critical decision point for the asset; a break above could signal a strong bullish turn, while continued rejection may cement the current level as a robust ceiling.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the noticeable lack of trading volume. Volume acts as fuel for price movements, with higher volumes often associated with strong price action. The tepid volume accompanying XRP's approach to this resistance suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, which can often precede a price retreat.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the resistance zone around $0.58 to $0.60 is the area of interest. XRP's recent approach to this level was met with swift denial, indicating that overcoming this barrier will require a significant influx of buyer interest and volume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $0.50 level is one to watch. It has served as a historical psychological and technical support level, providing a foundation for price rebounds in the past. Should XRP retreat, the response of buyers at this level could determine the asset's short-term fate.\n\nEthereum almost there\n\nEthereum is on the cusp of breaching the pivotal $3,000 mark, showcasing formidable strength in an otherwise tepid market. Its resilience and upward momentum may well act as a catalyst for broader market optimism.\n\nThe ascent toward $3,000 has been marked by consistent higher lows and higher highs, a bullish pattern that suggests strong buying interest at every dip. Technical indicators have turned favorable, with Ethereum recently pushing past the 50-day and 100-day EMAs \u2014 a sign that the momentum could sustain.\n\nSupport levels for ETH have been notably robust. The primary support at the $2,750 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, has been defended well by the bulls. This level is critical as it has been tested multiple times, proving to be a springboard for subsequent rallies. On the upside, the psychological and technical barrier of $3,000 stands as the next significant challenge. A decisive close above this level could open the gates for further exploration into uncharted price territories, with potential intermediate resistance at $3,200.\n\nETH's exceptional performance can be partly attributed to the ongoing development within its ecosystem. The introduction of ERC-404, a new token standard that combines the versatility of NFTs with the fungibility of standard tokens, is an innovation that could further solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBitcoin faces opposition\n\nExamination of the BTC chart reveals that the asset is experiencing a consolidation phase, which is often a precursor to a trend continuation rather than a sign of stagnation.\n\nCurrently trading above the $50,000 mark, Bitcoin has maintained a steady position near this psychological threshold. The consolidation phase is characterized by a narrowing price range, with Bitcoin oscillating between support and resistance levels that converge over time. This tightening of price movement is often associated with the accumulation of assets by traders and investors, setting the stage for a potential breakout.\n\nThe key support level for Bitcoin lies around the $48,000 area, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has been tested and held firm on several occasions, indicating strong buying interest. On the flip side, the immediate resistance is located near the $53,000 mark. A convincing break above this level could signal a bullish continuation, potentially targeting previous highs or setting new records."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter an airdrop farming campaign that prompted hopeful recipients to flood Crypto Twitter with tweets, the Portal gaming token finally has a launch date\u2014and it comes with the announcement of a Binance Launchpool campaign that will offer up another way for crypto users to earn a potentially sizable stash of PORTAL.\n\nPORTAL will launch on February 29, according to the Binance Launchpool campaign page, and the crypto exchange will list the token at 10am UTC (or 5am EST). The Launchpool campaign will debut tomorrow, February 22, and offer token staking rewards ahead of the listing.\n\nBinance customers who stake either Binance Coin (BNB) or the FDUSD stablecoin into PORTAL liquidity pools can earn a share of the total rewards pool, which numbers 50 million tokens\u2014that\u2019s 5% of the total PORTAL supply of 1 billion Ethereum-based tokens.\n\nAccording to Binance, the token will debut with a circulating supply of 167,134,615 PORTAL, or about 16.7% of the total supply. However, Binance\u2019s Launchpool campaign is not available to users in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and more. A full list can be found here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPortal has yet to announce details about the actual airdrop distribution following a farming campaign that spanned November and December last year. A Portal representative told Decrypt\u2019s GG that details will be announced before the Binance token listing.\n\nIn pre-market trading on Whales Market, the PORTAL token is commanding bids of $1.02, which puts the total estimated value of the Binance rewards pool at just a hair over $50 million.\n\nWhat is Portal? Billed as a cross-chain crypto gaming platform and token, it\u2019s designed to bridge the gap across various ecosystems, providing one place to play, discover, and transact across popular blockchain games.\n\n\u26a1 Portal x @binance \u26a1 The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for is nearly here. On Feb 29, 10am UTC, $Portal will officially launch on @binance. This is just the beginning. We\u2019ve got so much to show you about Portal and the products we\u2019ve been building. Get ready! https://t.co/zge4Prs1n1 \u2014 Portal (@Portalcoin) February 21, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Portal\u2019s founding team members and advisors are associated with SuperDuper, the startup behind Ethereum NFT collection Creepz, including Chief Business Officer Dan Keene, who serves the same role at SuperDuper. Advisors Jamie King (ex-Rockstar Games) and Matt Dixon (ex-Electronic Arts) are among those who also advise SuperDuper.\n\nPortal is represented by prominent Hollywood agency WME. Beyond the airdrop farming campaign, the project also held a presale in December that attracted nearly $10 million worth of interest across Ethereum and Solana in just 15 minutes alone.\n\nThe Portal campaign comes right after Binance concluded a Launchpool push for PIXEL, the Ethereum token of the Ronin network game Pixels. PIXEL was listed Monday and generated more than a billion dollars worth of trading volume in less than a day, making it one of the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies in the world that day, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Ethereum price scrapes $3,000 psychological threshold after 20 months, inspiring conjecture on altseason - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price has tested the $3,000 psychological level, a threshold last hit in 2022.\n\nETH could drop 10%, giving sidelined investors another entry before next leg up.\n\nThe bearish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS token records a higher high above the $3,004 peak.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has managed to test a crucial milestone for the first time in months, which is a remarkable show of strength considering Bitcoin (BTC) price has hinted at a fall. This means that Ether has managed to sidestep the BTC cue, causing markets to speculate on whether another alt season is underway.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nEthereum tests $3,000 after almost two years\n\nEthereum (ETH) price scrapped the $3,000 psychological level on Tuesday, a level last tested on April 26, 2022, almost two years ago. It comes a day after the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token outperformed BTC with double-digit weekly gains and a spike in Open Interest.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Ethereum price has slumped 0.78%, causing up to $15.47 million in short positions to be liquidated against $20 million of long positions. The disparity shows that most traders anticipated the surge in Ethereum price and took long positions, only that their take profits were higher such that their margin accounts could no longer support the open positions.\n\nETH liquidations\n\nAs it stands, Ethereum price is suffering the aftermath of an overbought asset, seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Traders looking to take new long positions should probably wait as the ETH market is at high risk of a pullback to the south.\n\nSuch a directional bias could provide sidelined or late investors a buying opportunity around the $2,689 support level before the next leg up. This would denote a 10% fall below current levels.\n\nIn a dire case, Ethereum price could slip below the aforementioned level to test the $2,500 level. Or ETH could find support at the $2,388 critical support.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bulls show strength, Ethereum price could reclaim the $3,000 milestone, potentially going as high as to reclaim the $3,004 range high. A decisive candlestick close above this local top on the daily timeframe would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIs an alt season coming?\n\nMeanwhile, speculation has it that the bold move by Ethereum price against BTC\u2019s price consolidation could be the beginning of an alt season.\n\nAlt season is a colloquial term that is used to describe a phase where investing in altcoins provides better returns compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Consequently, the dominance that Bitcoin holds in the market declines, and that of altcoins increases. The alt season indicator from BlockchainCenter is also leaning in favor of a potential altcoin season taking place as opposed to a Bitcoin season.\n\nAlt season index\n\nQuick summary of an alt season in play\n\nFresh capital enters the cryptocurrency ecosystem, effectively flowing into stablecoins, Bitcoin or Ethereum on preference that they are relatively safe: check! Markets rally as a consequence of this capital influx: check! The profit from these ecosystems, along with the new capital, moves into altcoins: in progress This rotation of capital triggers an alt season: possible result!\n\nThe chart above provides a visual representation."

        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has made a bullish prediction for Ethereum, suggesting that it could soar to $4,500.\n\nVan de Poppe believes Ethereum is soaking up Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum as investment capital shifts to ETH. According to the analyst, this is a \u201cmassive period to be rotating from Bitcoin towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\n#Ethereum is on its way towards $3,800-4,500. pic.twitter.com/TfoBGloBsH \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 19, 2024\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast comes amidst Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in price, which saw a 9% increase in seven days and 17.5% in one month. Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies have experienced notable gains as well, with MATIC and OP surging by 5% and 6%, respectively.\n\nOn Monday, ETH tapped $3K, its highest in nearly two years, signaling a bullish trend. The recent price surge could be attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC, following the footsteps of Bitcoin.\n\nSome experts, such as Tom Crown (CEO of Crown Analysis), believe the upswing could continue in the following days, predicting ETH\u2019s surge to $3,300 before the end of February.\n\nAnother person who outlined an optimistic scenario is Raoul Pal (co-founder and CEO of Real Vision). Earlier this month, he forecasted that ETH could rise to as high as $20,000 during the next bull cycle, while BTC could hit the astonishing $250,000.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user Altcoin Gordon was also quite bullish, setting a price tag of $11,250 to be reached by the end of the ongoing year.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s current market strength could be further bolstered by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, or a short-term peak of BTC, according to the analyst.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Could Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nThe Dencun upgrade aims to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations in transaction speed and cost. By implementing sharding \u2014a concept involving breaking network data into smaller \u201cshards\u201d\u2014 the upgrade aims to increase the overall computation throughput on the Ethereum network, making it more competitive with faster networks like Solana.\n\nVitalik Buterin underscored the Dencun upgrade as a significant development for Ethereum and its accompanying Layer-2s.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Dencun is a big step towards making Ethereum more \u201crollup-friendly\u201d while enhancing scalability and reducing costs on transactions.\n\nBesides the Dencun upgrade, the integration of Verkle trees on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to streamline Ethereum nodes\u2019 storage needs while maintaining their block validation capabilities, enhancing efficiency and decentralization within the network\n\nMeanwhile, another factor that could increase Ethereum\u2019s price is the approval of a spot in the ETH ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent post titled \"ETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive,\" on the X platform, Fred Krueger, known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, delivered a harsh critique of Ethereum (ETH), highlighting concerning trends and indicating a bleak outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over ETH's declining user activity\n\nKrueger began by pointing out that despite Ethereum's soaring price, indicative of a robust ecosystem, the actual usage of the Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a notable decline. He highlighted that while ETH has surged to $3,000, the number of Daily Active Users (DAUs) on the Ethereum network has dwindled from 120,000 in 2021 to a mere 66,000 in the past year.\n\nThe decline in active users is further exemplified by the dwindling numbers on Uniswap V3, Ethereum's leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. With just 16,000 DAUs, a stark contrast to the 60,000-plus seen in 2020, Krueger noted that Ethereum's utility as a transactional platform seems to be eroding.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right?\n\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\nEth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\nThis statistic is particularly alarming considering Ethereum's role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its aspirations to become the backbone of various decentralized applications (dApps), especially in the face of the upcoming Dencun Upgrade.\n\nEthereum: Meme coin in disguise?\n\nKrueger likened Ethereum's current state to that of a \"meme coin,\" drawing parallels to assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB). He emphasized that despite its soaring valuation, Ethereum's utility seems to have dwindled, particularly in comparison to other blockchain networks such as Solana, Avalanche and Near, which offer cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism regarding the possibility of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval, citing concerns about regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), unlikely to greenlight an Ethereum ETF due to potential issues surrounding its premined nature, Krueger cautioned against banking on such an approval as a catalyst for Ethereum's growth."

Case in point: MAVIA, the recently launched token of mobile strategy game Heroes of Mavia, has plunged sharply over the last two days, even after setting a new all-time high price.\n\nMAVIA is down over 5% on the day to a price of about $8.00, according to data from CoinGecko, and the latest drop has accelerated a total 24% dip since the Ethereum token popped to a new peak price of $10.59 on Sunday.\n\nHeroes of Mavia is an iOS and Android base-building strategy game similar to the smash hit Clash of Clans, albeit with planned crypto elements that have yet to be integrated. Skrice Studios\u2019 game will implement the MAVIA token for certain benefits, along with NFT land plots sold long before the game\u2019s January debut.\n\nMAVIA\u2019s latest spike came amid a broader surge for gaming tokens, with those tied to the Xai (XAI) and Beam (BEAM) gaming networks also setting all-time high prices, along with NFT trading card game Parallel (PRIME)\u2014GG\u2019s pick for the 2023 game of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upswing came just after Skrice revealed a detailed roadmap for the game, which includes implementing some of those aforementioned crypto elements in the game, adding other gameplay features, and rolling out an additional period of MAVIA staking rewards for NFT land owners. Heroes of Mavia will soon announce an as-yet-unrevealed Ethereum scaling network for implementing such crypto components.\n\nThe recent dip on MAVIA may reflect investors and airdrop recipients cashing in on the massive surge in token price. Even at the current subdued price, MAVIA has jumped 338% in value since debuting at $1.83 just two weeks ago. The token has seen just shy of $99 million in trading volume over the past day\u20148th most among gaming tokens, per CoinGecko.\n\nHeroes of Mavia targeted a sizable audience with its airdrop, offering a token claim to 100,000 early players alongside NFT land owners who had participated in previous staking campaigns.

        "content": "LISBON, Portugal, Feb. 21, 2024 /CNW/ -- Fuel Labs , creator of the first optimistic rollup Fuel V1, today announced its evolution into the \"Rollup OS\", a complete operating system specifically designed to help Ethereum rollups realize their full potential. Specifically designed to tackle critical limitations in the existing rollups architectures, the strategic shift strengthens Fuel Labs' position as a visionary in the Ethereum ecosystem while paving the way for its mainnet launch in Q3 2024.\n\nUnlike existing virtual machines (VMs) designed for layer-1 (L1) blockchains or general-purpose computation systems, Fuel offers the first purpose-built VM that will unlock new capabilities for Ethereum rollups.\n\nFuel's unique architecture addresses core challenges in blockchain scalability beyond the conventional paradigm of modularity and even data availability \u2014 enabling higher throughput via parallelization, state minimization, seamless interoperability and VM customizability.\n\n\"As rollups mature, it's clear that an operating environment optimized for their unique requirements is a non-negotiable next step. Fuel is that evolution: the 'Rollup OS' solves critical bottlenecks, future-proofing both rollup technology and the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Nick Dodson, CEO and Co-Founder of Fuel Labs.\n\nAddressing Ethereum's Scaling Bottleneck\n\nEthereum's reign as the dominant smart contract platform is undeniable, yet its future-readiness and developer appeal hinges on EVM's ability to solve future requirements of Ethereum rollups. As rollups and modular infrastructure rise, existing technologies made for general computation, or monolithic L1 systems, fail to address the evolving demands of this rollup-centric reality. This forces developers to navigate compromises in design, limiting innovation, adoption, and ultimately, Ethereum's long-term vision for a globally decentralized network.\n\nThe Fuel Advantage: A New Operating System for the Rollup Era\n\nFuel brings unprecedented power to Ethereum rollups by combining state-of-the-art innovations and learning from its rich history in rollup development:\n\nParallelization to Fuel Scalability Beyond Modularity: Parallel transaction execution in the FuelVM enables Fuel-powered rollups to offer a highly performant user experience, while preserving Ethereum 's decentralization and security. As blockchain networks are increasingly designed to be modular \u2013 separating execution, consensus, transaction finality and data availability into separate layers \u2013 optimized performance rests on parallelization to offer next-generation scalability benefits.\n\nParallel transaction execution in the enables Fuel-powered rollups to offer a highly performant user experience, while preserving 's decentralization and security. As blockchain networks are increasingly designed to be modular \u2013 separating execution, consensus, transaction finality and data availability into separate layers \u2013 optimized performance rests on parallelization to offer next-generation scalability benefits.

        "title": "Spectacular rise of Ethereum: Are we on the verge of the altseason? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 20 Feb 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRecently, Ether (ETH), the native crypto of Ethereum, has seen notable momentum. The asset is currently flirting with the $3,000 mark. This has sparked hope among crypto enthusiasts about the continuation of this trend with a positive effect on altcoins. A question that clearly divides analysts and experts.\n\nThe Hope of an Altcoin Season Driven by Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH)\n\nThe recent surge in the price of Ether (ETH), which has flirted with the $3,000 mark, has sparked hope for an impending \u201caltseason\u201d within the crypto community. However, analysts remain divided on the issue. On February 19, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto reached an intraday high of $2,980. That\u2019s its highest level in 22 months. Many enthusiasts believe this could herald the start of an ETH bull market and, consequently, an altcoin rally.\n\nHenrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, highlighted several fundamental factors underpinning this sentiment. Among these are the upcoming updates to Ethereum and the mainnet launches for scaling solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin over the past year suggests a potential catch-up. Especially given its deflationary nature following the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\nYuga Cohler, Senior Director of Engineering at Coinbase, echoed similar sentiments. He notably highlights the correlation between an ETH bull market and positive outcomes for altcoins. Meanwhile, voices like that of Mikybull Crypto forecast a bullish March for the native asset of Ethereum blockchain, with $3,000 as a plausible target. He anticipates a significant increase in altcoin activity.\n\nHopefuls call for \u2018#altseason\u2019 led by #Ethererum rally, analysts not so sure https://t.co/LUxw2uzJVz \u2014 MrMr4Nk \ud83d\udc99 De.Fi Army (@MrCr4nk) February 20, 2024 While enthusiasts anticipate an altcoin season driven by Ether, some analysts remain skeptical\n\nDissenting Voices Regarding This Outlook\n\nHowever, Markus Thielen, Head of 10x Research, holds an opposing view. According to him, there is a lack of substantial evidence for the eventuality of an impending altcoin season. He points out that sustainable reductions in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance below 45% are required to foster a viable altcoin rally.\n\nThe crypto expert also notes that unlike previous increases observed during the ICO and DeFi summer bull markets, the current rise lacks a clear explanation. Save for the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, the recent altcoin rallies have quickly dissipated, suggesting a higher risk-adjusted potential in favor of investments in BTC.\n\nMarkus Thielen\u2019s analysis also questions the sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s momentum. He believes it could be more motivated by the anticipation of the ETF approvals in May than by an increase in on-chain activity within decentralized applications (dApps). For the analyst, the current bull market will persist until 2025, a period during which altcoins may experience sporadic recoveries.\n\nSupporting Markus Thielen\u2019s cautious outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment cautions against overbought signals on the market. As indicated by the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, it suggests above-average risk associated with buying or opening new positions during the current surge. This is while most crypto projects have generated medium and long-term profits since October 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Sharp Rejection Near $3,000 As Profit-Taking Sentiment Rises! What\u2019s Next For ETH Price? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "After [ccpw id=60415] soared past the $50K milestone, traders eagerly anticipated [ccpw id=60480] to mirror this success by crossing the $3K threshold. This expectation came to a conclusion as Ethereum shattered its two-year peak by breaking the $3,000 milestone, setting off a wave of short liquidations. This breakthrough has triggered bullish outlooks, prompting a rise in Ethereum accumulation by investors who are now gearing up for potential further price surges. Nevertheless, with the increase in profit-taking behavior around that mark and the exit of both long-term and short-term holders near the peak, this led to a steep decline in the ETH price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Becomes Positive\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has climbed to $53,000, but Ethereum has outpaced BTC\u2019s gains, reaching $3,000 for the first time in almost two years. These price increases have put highly leveraged traders on alert, leading to total liquidations of around $300 million.\n\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s price is now undergoing a significant drop as many investors sold their stakes near the $3,000 peak. Notably, Ethereum saw total liquidations nearing $8.6 million, with a substantial $8.5 million of those being buyer liquidations. The week started off on a slower note, but Bitcoin made an aggressive move to $53,000, hitting this level for the first time since late 2021.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Netflow metric for ETH has moved into the positive territory, indicating that the volume of inflows now exceeds that of outflows. This shift points to a rise in exchange reserves, increasing the likelihood of sales and thus exerting downward pressure near resistance levels. The Netflow metric currently registers at +20,470 ETH.\n\nMoreover, the volume of large transactions has doubled recently, jumping from a low of 1.08 million ETH to 2.26 million ETH. This increase signals a rise in activity by major investors or \u201cwhales.\u201d In the event of such a market rejection, these whales could lose confidence, potentially triggering a wave of selling pressure that may drive the ETH price down to its immediate support levels.\n\nHowever, the bullish sentiment continues as ETH\u2019s network is poised for a pivotal enhancement called \u201cDencun,\u201d scheduled for March. This update is set to deploy \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d to the blockchain, which is expected to boost its performance and lower transaction fees.\n\nA Bloomberg analyst has projected a potential rise in ether\u2019s value to $4,000, drawing parallels with bitcoin\u2019s rally preceding the approval of spot ETFs. On the other hand, TD Cowen and JPMorgan express skepticism; TD Cowen questions the immediate approval of spot ether ETFs by the SEC, while JPMorgan assigns a probability of less than 50% for such approval by May.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther rebounded off the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that buyers are attempting to solidify this level as a foundation of support. Consequently, this boosted the buyers\u2019 confidence, enabling them to surpass the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels and break past the $3,000 mark. Currently, the price of ETH stands at $2,948, marking an increase of over 1.1% from the previous day\u2019s value.\n\nAlthough the price managed to breach the immediate barrier of $3,000, it couldn\u2019t maintain its surge as sellers initiated a pullback. Nonetheless, buyers are keen on maintaining the upward momentum with hopes of driving the price towards the critical resistance level at $3,100. Achieving this could set the stage for a move towards $3,500.\n\nThe recent price rejection has plunged the Relative Strength Index (RSI) toward 58, hinting at the possibility of a minor correction or a consolidation phase looming. For a short-term peak to be indicated, sellers would have to send the price below the 20-day EMA."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the rising DeFi market, newcomers are finding themselves in the spotlight. KangaMoon (KANG) is one of those newcomers. Some analysts have even hinted that this meme coin, which will soon enter its presale, could surge by 35x in 2024. But how does this rookie compare to already-established cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG): A Potential Star in the Memecoin Sector\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is a community-driven meme coin that everyone has been talking about. It is making a splash with its unique approach of combining memes and cryptocurrency. By focusing on building a solid community and introducing play-to-earn elements, KangaMoon is looking to be one of the top meme coin out there.\n\nKangaMoon could accomplish this as it will introduce a P2E game in which KANG is the main currency used for everything. With KANG, players can purchase in-game items, upgrade their characters, and more.\n\nKangaMoon will also incorporate a marketplace where you can sell or trade any in-game collectibles you have gained. Therefore, any player can make money from their time in the game.\n\nCurrently, the DeFi project is preparing to enter its presale. During this time, you can buy the KANG token for a discounted price of only $0.0075.\n\nHowever, since it will enter the $176B gaming market, experts are bullish about this meme coin. They forecast a potential 350% price pump once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in 2024.\n\nAnalyst Elja With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nRecently, crypto analyst Elja made a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction. According to his new tweet, Ethereum may hit $15,000 by 2025. He states that this explosive move will come as whales accumulate this altcoin.\n\nOver the last week, the Ethereum price has been bouncing between $2,402 and $2,272. In that same time period, its market cap moved between $288B and $272B. However, 20 technical indicators are in the green for this altcoin. Due to all these reasons, market analysts predict that Ethereum will hit $2,400 before the end of February 2024.\n\nRekt Capital\u2019s New Bitcoin Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been making headlines. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that a new Candle 4 has formed for Bitcoin at the $39,357 level. He predicts that this Candle will be broken after the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has jumped from $40,790 to $42,261 over the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also increased from $799B to $825B. Furthermore, this DeFi coin now trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Because of this, experts in the field foresee a Bitcoin price of within Q2 of 2024.\n\nWill KangaMoon Outpace Ethereum and Bitcoin?\n\nSince it is so early in its development, KangaMoon has gained a competitive edge over Ethereum and Bitcoin. To clarify, KangaMoon now has a market cap of $5M. Because of this, KANG would need less money to raise its price. This puts it in a good position to become the next top memecoin in 2024.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\n*This article was paid for.

This fascination was the seed for Polygon, a groundbreaking solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.\n\nPolygon: Revolutionising Blockchain\n\nIn 2017, Kanani, alongside Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, founded Polygon (initially known as Matic). Their mission was clear: to address the high fees and slow transactions plaguing Ethereum. By creating a scalability platform that supported faster, cost-effective applications while remaining on the Ethereum network, Polygon became a pivotal player in the blockchain ecosystem. The platform's native token, Matic, saw its valuation surge, propelling Kanani and his co-founders into the ranks of billionaires.\n\nA Financial Odyssey: From 6000INR to Billions\n\nKanani's net worth, primarily built through Polygon, underscores the vast potential within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. His transition from earning a modest salary to becoming a crypto-billionaire exemplifies the lucrative opportunities available in the space. Strategic investments, including a significant stake in Polysynth, have further solidified his position as a leading figure in the crypto revolution.\n\nBeyond Blockchain: The Personal Side of a Tech Innovator\n\nDespite his monumental professional achievements, Kanani maintains a low profile regarding his personal life. Known as a family man, his story reflects not only his technical prowess but also his values and commitment to his loved ones.\n\nThe Future and Legacy\n\nIn late 2023. After six years of relentless dedication and achieving remarkable milestones, Kanani decided to step back from the day-to-day operations, seeking to explore new adventures while still supporting Polygon from the sidelines. His decision was met with emotional responses from his co-founders, reflecting the deep bond and shared vision that drove Polygon's success. His focus on strategic investments and innovation promises a bright future for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nA Tale of Innovation, Resilience, and Transformation\n\nJaynti Kanani's ascent from a young man in Gujarat to India's first crypto-billionaire is more than a success story; it's a narrative of innovation, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of dreams. As Polygon scales new heights, Kanani's journey remains a source of inspiration, encouraging future generations to dream big and innovate without bounds."

        "title": "Q1 2024 Crypto Price Predictions: Near Protocol, Meme Moguls, Ethereum - What\u2019s in Store for These Tokens? - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 will be a wild ride for many altcoins, such as Near Protocol (NEAR) and Ethereum (ETH). Today, we look at some price predictions for these hot tokens. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - a Stage 5 presale star, has been making waves in the meme coin space. Many analysts even have it pegged as the next 100x meme coin in 2024. Let\u2019s see why.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR): Price Soars Around 22%\n\nRecently, Near Protocol (NEAR) has been showing bullish signs. For instance, the Near Protocol price increased from $2.90 to $3.53 in the past 30 days. Its market cap also grew from $2.91B to $3.67B in that time. Not only that, Near Protocol experienced 17/30 green trading days.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, this number will increase as Near Protocol trades above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Furthermore, this altcoin has 24 technical indicators in the green. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Near Protocol price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.95 within Q1 of 2024 for NEAR.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): To Rule the Meme Coin Market\n\nThe Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale is garnering a significant amount of attention and investment. This project has already raised nearly $2.5M in its presale performance, aiming to make waves in the booming meme coin sector. With real utility and an experienced team behind it, there is no reason why MGLS cannot become a blue-chip token.\n\nWhat sets Meme Moguls apart is its commitment to blending meme coin dynamics with tangible utility. Unlike most meme coins, MGLS serves a dual purpose as a governance token and the in-game currency for the upcoming Meme Moguls play-to-earn (P2E) game.\n\nIn the P2E game, players will participate in virtual stock trading experiences, gaining insights into wealth-building and investments. They may even try to \u201cBeat the Market\u201d - a game mode where you can compete against indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nThe Meme Moguls ecosystem is built on the MGLS token. Currently priced at $0.0036 during Stage 5 of its presale, early adopters are already up by 90%. And since it\u2019s set to be listed on Uniswap in Q1 2024, experts are predicting a 100x pump. At this moment, there\u2019s also a 30% deposit bonus, which adds to the overall appeal of this game-changing meme coin.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe Announces a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has also been making headlines. For instance, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe remains bullish for this altcoin. In other words, Poppe made a new tweet stating that a price increase would come after the Dencun upgrade or from a short-term peak of BTC. He claims that Ethereum will also reclaim 0.06.\n\nIn terms of the Ethereum price movement, it has jumped from $2,488 to $2,901 in the past week alone. Its market cap also grew from $299B to $348B during that time. Additionally, Ethereum is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. As a result, experts predict that this altcoin will hit $3,629 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Meme Moguls Outpace Near Protocol and Ethereum?\n\nMeme Moguls hold a solid chance of outpacing giants like Near Protocol and Ethereum. With a modest market cap of $10.8M, Meme Moguls can reach heights faster by requiring fewer new funds. Thus, MGLS is one of the best meme coins to invest in if you wish to see fast returns.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) is a \u201cshitcoin\u201d without purpose that has no distinct advantage over competitors, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\n\u201cWho gives a fuck? Zero?\u201d said Hayes when asked \u201cWhat about Cardano?\u201d in an interview with Coin Bureau published on Sunday.\n\nCardano Is A Shitcoin, Says Hayes\n\nContinuing to describe the cryptocurrency \u2013 a top ten digital asset by market cap \u2013 Hayes did not mince words: \u201cThe first wannabe Ethereum, and probably the first one to go to be irrelevant,\u201d he said.\n\nTypically, the popular crypto essayist and trader is well known as one of the loudest long-term Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) bulls, and often expresses interest in small-cap cryptos for short-term trading.\n\nDuring the same interview, Hayes even expressed interest in the memecoin \u201cdogwifhat\u201d calling it the \u201cbest dog money of this bull cycle.\n\n\u201cI love Rare Pepe\u2019s\u2026 I think we\u2019re going to see a resurgence of NFT trading volumes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe writer\u2019s unique callout of Cardano ruffled some feathers online \u2013 especially with the network\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson. On Tuesday, Hoskinson asked Hayes why he was \u201cthrowing shade\u201d at Cardano.\n\n\u201cCause your coin is a piece of shit man,\u201d Hayes replied. \u201cJust buy some ETH and chill.\u201d\n\nWhat Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nMuch like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform for developing decentralized applications. It also popularized as one of the first well-developed proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, which use crypto rather than energy to secure its network.\n\nHowever, many popular blockchains today now use the same mechanism, with Ethereum undergoing a massive upgrade in 2022 to adopt proof of stake. In terms of both market size and DeFi TVL, Cardano is still outsized by competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Hayes published a list of the world\u2019s most popular Dapps, and asked which of them had originated or grown most popular on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n\u201cFrom my very limited knowledge, it looks like none of them do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why ADA is dog shit.\u201d\n\nOn Bitcoin, however, Hayes remains a bull, expecting strong money printing from the Federal Reserve to drive the asset\u2019s price up soon.\n\n\u201cWhen printing money happens and you debase the value of time and human labor, we rejoice and say great, fuck you, we\u2019re gonna take Bitcoin to a million,\u201d he told Coin Bureau.\n\nLate last year, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would reach between $750,000 and $1 million by the end of 2026."

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has crossed the $3,000 threshold for the first time since April 2022 yesterday. However, amidst the celebratory fireworks in the crypto community, Fred Krueger, a renowned Bitcoin ETF expert, has voiced a starkly contrasting opinion. Krueger, a Wall Street veteran and prop trader, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his skepticism about the current valuation of ETH, stating, \u201cETH is completely detached from reality.\u201d\n\nWhy Ethereum Is \u201cCompletely Detached From Reality\u201d\n\nKrueger\u2019s comments come at a time when the crypto market is witnessing a resurgence in investor interest, with Ethereum at the forefront due to its recent price rally. Despite this, Krueger points out a concerning trend in the usage of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\n\u201cETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K active daily users in 2021, to just 66K over the last year. The top app, Uniswap V3 is only getting 16K DAUs. I remember, back in 2020 this number was 60K or more,\u201d he noted, emphasizing a decline in the platform\u2019s direct utility and engagement.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Receives Nod Of Approval From Berstein: ETH Price Will Reach $10,000 7 months ago\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF expert further criticized the valuation of Ethereum, drawing parallels to meme coins like Shiba Inu due to its inflated market cap, which stands at $361 billion despite the fall in active users. \u201cIt really has become a type of meme coin, similar to Shiba Inu,\u201d Krueger remarked, pointing to the stark contrast between Ethereum\u2019s high market cap and its diminishing direct use.\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum is not only overvalued but also faces stiff competition from other blockchains that outperform it in terms of transaction costs and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly cheap ($1.50 per transaction), or fast. If you are just interested in reward points for games, or casino-style DeFi apps \u2014 Solana, Avalanche, Near etc.. all crush it.\u201d\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism about the future regulatory landscape for Ethereum, particularly concerning the potential for an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cFinally, I don\u2019t think Gensler is going to allow an ETH ETF\u2026 I just don\u2019t think Gary wants to make his second ETF a massive pre-mine. Sets a very bad precedent,\u201d he stated, reflecting on the challenges Ethereum faces in gaining mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe Crypto Community Reacts\n\nIn response to Krueger\u2019s critical take, the crypto community on X provided mixed reactions. One user challenged Krueger\u2019s analysis by pointing to Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap and the misleading nature of using mainnet daily active users (DAU) as a metric for the platform\u2019s health. Krueger, however, remained unconvinced, stating, \u201cEven L2s like Arbitrum have been in decline for the last 12 months. This is not the case that all is well in ETH-land.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnother user attempted to highlight the cyclical nature of DeFi and the broader crypto market, suggesting that the current downturn is a temporary phase of risk aversion. Yet, Krueger dismissed these arguments, reiterating his lack of interest in speculative DeFi activities and emphasizing his belief in Bitcoin as the true revolutionary cryptocurrency. \u201cI am not interested in degen ape games. Have fun,\u201d he stated.\n\nKrueger\u2019s critique extends beyond Ethereum to the broader landscape of cryptocurrencies, questioning the long-term viability and value proposition of altcoins, including Layer 1 solutions other than Bitcoin. He argues that these platforms are unlikely to become significant value generators in the long term, likening their control mechanisms to fiat currencies but with central figures like Vitalik Buterin in place of traditional central bankers.\n\nKrueger\u2019s overall stance on Ethereum and the broader crypto market is clear. \u201cMy position on ETH. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is the revolution\u2026 Every other cryptocurrency is fighting for some other much smaller use case,\u201d he explained, underscoring his belief in Bitcoin\u2019s unique value proposition as a decentralized, finite currency system.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price surpassed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (at $2,922), trading at $2,935. A weekly close above this threshold could confirm another leg up for the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The Merge NFT is a unique dynamic NFT collection that was created by a digital artist called Murat Pak and featured on the leading NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in December 2021.\n\nThe collection that commemorates Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism netted over $91.8 million during its brief 48-hour sale. This makes The Merge not only the most expensive NFT collection ever sold, but also the most expensive art piece sold by a living artist on a public sale.\n\nThe artwork that accompanied The Merge NFT drop on Nifty Gateway. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is The Merge NFT and how does it work?\n\nThe Merge is a unique and dynamic Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection that made headlines and broke sales records in December 2021. After the sale was concluded, Nifty Gateway minted all 312,686 purchased tokens, also referred to as units of \u201cmass\u201d.\n\nWe're kicking off minting of mass tonight, anyone who purchased mass should see their NFT within the next few hours. We will also be putting a hold on moving mass out of your accounts momentarily to make the secondary market fair for everyone \u26ab\ufe0f @muratpak pic.twitter.com/bkdXu4uFFU \u2014 Nifty Gateway ? (@niftygateway) December 7, 2021\n\nThe artworks of The Merge NFTs are very basic as each token is represented by a simple white or yellow circle on a black background. The visuals are generated fully on-chain based on the formulas included in the smart contracts and not hosted off-chain as is the case with many other NFT collections.\n\nWhat sets The Merge apart from all other NFT collections is the concept behind the collection, which utilizes a unique mechanism that causes the collection to change and develop over time. The collection\u2019s smart contract prevents one address from holding multiple NFTs from the Merge collections \u2013 as soon as two NFTs from the collection are held in the same wallet, the masses of the two tokens merge. The result is one newly minted NFT with the combined mass of both pre-existing NFTs, which is depicted by a bigger circle on a black background.\n\nThe Merge NFTs in circulation diminishes as they are transferred between wallets (more precisely, bought by someone who already holds an NFT from the collection in the wallet), and their average mass increases. The total mass, however, remains constant.\n\nAn illustrative artwork depicting the merging of two mass tokens on the left and an equation explaining how the merging principle works on the right. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Merge?\n\nAs already mentioned, The Merge NFT collection commemorates the Ethereum Merge, which was a historical event in Ethereum\u2019s history that concluded the network's transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe transition process started with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the Serenity upgrade, on December 1, 2021, when the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain (the chain that currently acts as the central coordination layer for the entire Ethereum 2.0 network) was activated. While ETH 2.0 staking deposits were enabled shortly after, the PoS and the PoW networks ran simultaneously up until September 15, 2022, when the transition concluded with The Merge event. Since then, the Ethereum network is secured solely by staking.\n\nThe move to proof-of-stake enabled Ethereum to address its scalability issues, which often caused extraordinary spikes in gas prices while the network still relied on PoW. In addition, the network had become more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable as the energy consumption was reduced by more than 99% when the PoW chain was made obsolete.\n\nHow much money The Merge NFT sold for in December 2021?\n\nThe Merge NFTs were sold in an open edition style (the opposite of a limited edition sale) from December 2 to December 4, 2021. The starting price for the public sale of The Merge tokens was set at $575 per unit, with the price increasing by $25 every 6 hours, so the ones who bought the tokens in the last few hours of the sale had to cash out $750 per token. The number of tokens each participant could acquire was unlimited.\n\nThe Merge NFT sale saw participation from 29,983 unique address owners who bought a total of 312,686 tokens. The Merge NFT sale ended up netting an exceptional sum of $91.8 million. This crowns The Merge NFT as the most expensive artwork ever publicly sold by a living artist.\n\nNevertheless, this record is a bit controversial as it is only valid if we consider the whole collection as a single piece of art. While many claim that The Merge is actually a collection of artworks, it could one day, if all the NFTs are merged in one wallet, become one NFT and thereby one single unique art piece.\n\nHow much is The Merge NFT worth now?\n\nSince its initial sale, the price of The Merge NFTs has fallen significantly. At the time of writing, one unit of mass has a floor price of $125, which is about 0.0428 ETH. Using this floor price puts the total market capitalization of the NFTs in circulation at slightly below 803 ETH (worth around $2.3 million).\n\nStill, quite a few tokens get sold above the floor price, which means that the total value of the whole collection would likely be higher in the end. In addition, the price of an NFT from The Merge collection also depends on its mass. There are currently 8,210 unique addresses that are holding The Merge NFT, meaning that there are only that many distinctive NFTs in circulation and many of them have a mass larger than 1.\n\nTop 4 The Merge NFTs with the largest mass that are currently being sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT marketplace and their respectful ask prices. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nThe Merge: Regenesis NFTs by ConsenSys\n\nPak's Merge collection is not the only NFT collection that pays tribute to the Ethereum merge. Ethereum development studio ConsenSys has released a collection called The Merge: Regenesis, which was also designed to celebrate Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe collection was available for minting over a period of 72 hours and features three types of artworks, each commemorating one aspect of Ethereum's move to PoS: scalability, security and sustainability.\n\nDue to the sheer amount of NFTs minted, this collection has a very low floor price of only about 0.0007 ETH ($2.05 at the time of writing).\n\nThe bottom line: The Merge is the most expensive NFT collection ever sold\n\nAlthough The Merge NFT collection is not as valuable as it used to be when it was initially dropped on the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the sale of this unique dynamic NFT collection still represents a record-breaking event in the history of digital art and art in general. The Merge NFT collection sold for $91.8 million, surpassed Jeff Koons\u2019 sculpture titled \u201cRabbit,\u201d which sold for $91.1 million by a hair's breadth and became arguably the most expensive artwork sold publicly by a living artist.\n\nIn addition, The Merge NFT reigns on top of the list of the most expensive NFT collections. Even so, The Merge tokens have not made it to the list of the most expensive single NFTs ever sold just yet. Interesting and unique NFTs from collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, have a tendency to soar much higher as far as the price of a single non-fungible token is concerned.\n\nWe will conclude this article with a hard snap back to reality as those of us without ETH holdings worth millions of dollars in our digital wallets would likely find an article on how to find and participate in free NFT drops much more useful."
