        "title": "Crypto Is Getting Political\u2014Ethereum Giant Consensys Wants to Stay Out of It - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs crypto emerges as an increasingly partisan issue in the 2024 presidential election\u2014what with Donald Trump making overtures to the industry, and President Joe Biden threatening to kill legislation intended to protect it\u2014American crypto companies have begun feverishly spending to aid the campaigns of pro-crypto candidates across the country.\n\nIndustry mainstays like Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ripple Labs have already dedicated tens of millions of dollars to influencing key Senate and House races this year. Meanwhile, crypto leaders have begun openly embracing Trump in a manner unthinkable four years ago.\n\nBut amid the crypto industry\u2019s rise as a force in American election fundraising, one of the country\u2019s most valuable crypto firms has opted to stay out of partisan politics altogether.\n\nConsensys, the $7 billion Ethereum software giant, has notably refrained from backing crypto-friendly candidates in the 2024 election. To the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Joe Lubin, this is a deliberate choice intended to ensure the crypto industry\u2019s long-term success (disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPolitically, we've liked to remain neutral,\u201d Lubin told Decrypt. \u201cIt doesn't make sense for us to choose one broken party over another.\u201d\n\nRelying on one political party or faction to support crypto is not as sustainable a long-term strategy as solidifying the industry\u2019s legality via the judiciary, the Ethereum co-creator believes.\n\n\u201cThe way through all of this, the way that we land\u2026 is to rely on the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Consensys filed a preemptive lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that the regulator has no legal authority to classify ETH as a security\u2014a position it has secretly held for over a year, the suit revealed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit with the SEC is a good platform for us to help people understand the benefits of the technology,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cI don't think we need to be politically partisan or make political donations in order to be a very clear and loud voice on this topic.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, though, that the entrepreneur has eschewed politics altogether\u2014far from it. Lubin says that Consensys regularly has closed-door conversations with politicians and regulators about the importance of crypto to America\u2019s future.\n\nWhat\u2019s key, though, is that those conversations are aimed at creating broad\u2014forgive the pun\u2014consensus around crypto.\n\n\u201cWe may not be visible,\u201d Lubin said of Consensys\u2019 political machinations, \"but we are certainly doing things.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Trades Above $3,000 Price Mark, What\u2019s Next? - The Tech Report",
        "content": "Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has posted strides today with a few erratic price swings. With the bulls staging a comeback, ETH has exceeded the $3,000 price mark.\n\nHowever, while ETH shows moderate gains in the 24-hour timeframe, it has yet to recover its losses in the past weeks. Ethereum price reflects a 1% decline in the last seven days and 1.5% in the past month.\n\nBut the bulls are fast at work, vying to push Ether to higher highs. With ETH already above $3,000, what\u2019s the next target?\n\nPrice Analysis:Ethereum (ETH) Faces Key Resistance Level at $3,059\n\nEthereum (ETH) trades at $3,032, inching closer to a significant resistance level of $3,059. This $3,059 level has previously acted as a support, so a decisive break above it is crucial for further ascent.\n\nA successful breach of the $3,059 resistance would solidify Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum and push it above the bearish channel, restraining its upward trajectory.\n\nFurther, Ether holds a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 51, indicating a slight bullish momentum in the market.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is above the signal line, further reinforcing the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum. However, Ethereum (ETH) is still below the 50-day SMA indicator. However, from all indications, it could break above this level soon.\n\nThe alignment of these technical indicators suggests that Ethereum could be poised for an upward movement, provided it can decisively conquer the $3,059 resistance level.\n\nMassive ETH Movements by Whales Hints at Potential Price Surge\n\nSeveral crypto whales have moved significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) from the popular exchange Coinbase to unknown wallets. The transactions involved the transfer of 7,563 ETH, worth approximately $22 million each time.\n\nThe first whale, identified as 0x091d, moved 7,563 ETH worth $22,215,383 from Coinbase to an unknown wallet. Another whale, 0xd26e, also transferred 7,563 ETH, valued at $22,210,308, to an unidentified wallet.\n\nAdditionally, whale 0xfe73 shifted 7,563 ETH worth $22 million from Coinbase to an anonymous wallet. In the final transaction, whale 0xf627 moved 7,563 ETH, valued at $22.19 million, to an unknown destination.\n\nThese substantial whale movements often signal their intention to hold their Ethereum holdings for an extended period. By transferring their ETH to unknown wallets, they are likely preparing to accumulate more coins or hold their existing positions, anticipating a potential price increase.\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s bullish technical indicators and recent price action, these whale movements could indicate impending upward pressure on the coin\u2019s price.\n\nThe whales may be positioning themselves to capitalize on a potential breakout or rally in the Ethereum market. However, market participants should exercise caution and consider all relevant factors before making investment decisions.\n\nAI-Powered Meme Coin, WienerAI, Soars Past $2 Million in Presale\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and meme coins are two of the hottest trends in the cryptocurrency market. WienerAI, a newly launched project, combines these powerful narratives into one exciting offering.\n\nCurrently, WienerAI is holding a presale event, during which investors can purchase the project\u2019s native token, $WAI. The presale has already raised over $2 million, demonstrating strong interest from the crypto community.\n\nInvestors can buy $WAI tokens at $0.000708 during the presale. However, this price will gradually increase as the presale progresses. The earlier investors participate, the lower the price they can secure.\n\nWienerAI: The Meme Coin with Serious Utility for Crypto Traders\n\nWienerAI isn\u2019t just a meme coin; it offers much more practical utility than regular coins. Behind its fun nature lies a powerful trading bot designed to enhance the experience of decentralized finance (DeFi) users.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s trading bot provides free, instant token swaps across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, Bakeryswap, and Pancakeswap.\n\nThis feature helps eliminate the frustration of lengthy waiting times typically associated with buying cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the bot resists miner extractable value (MEV), ensuring users are not front-run by malicious bots.\n\nBy offering seamless and secure token swaps, WienerAI aims to bolster the overall DeFi user experience, making it more efficient and accessible for traders. This innovative utility has generated excitement within the crypto trading community, as many see the potential benefits WienerAI can bring to their trading activities.\n\nMeme Coin Goes Big on Community: WienerAI Allocates 60% of Tokens to Presale, Staking, and Rewards.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s token allocation plays a central role in the project\u2019s operation. A significant portion (30%) is allocated to the ongoing presale. Another 20% is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing long-term holding and participation.\n\nAnother 20% is designated for community rewards, while 10% of the tokens are allocated for exchange liquidity. Finally, 20% is dedicated to marketing efforts, fueling the project\u2019s growth and raising awareness.\n\nIn true meme coin spirit, this distribution puts the majority of tokens into the hands of the community. At the same time, it ensures resources are available for sustained growth and development.\n\nCurrently, staking rewards for WienerAI offer incredible returns of over 487%. This opportunity is available on a first-come, first-served basis. The annual percentage yield (APY) will gradually decrease as more tokens are staked.\n\nAlready, the community has staked over 2 billion $WAI, showcasing their eagerness to accumulate more tokens. Those seeking to maximize their upside potential should act swiftly before the presale ends.\n\nTo stay updated on the latest news and developments regarding WienerAI, follow the project on X (formerly Twitter) or join its Telegram channel. Alternatively, visit the official website to purchase tokens and begin staking immediately.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "In what U.S. prosecutors are calling the first case of its kind, a pair of brothers have been charged with stealing $25 million worth of cryptocurrency in just 12 seconds. They're now charged with wire fraud and money laundering for the April 2023 heist.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were reportedly educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in mathematics and computer science. Using the skills they learned at MIT, prosecutors say the duo found a way to exploit the Ethereum transaction validation process.\n\nThe brothers allegedly used that exploit to gain fraudulent access to pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, a public ledger that records and validates cryptocurrency payments.\n\nThe pair was arrested on May 14 on the indictment handed down from the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York. The indictment against the brothers was unsealed (PDF) on Wednesday, May 15, 2024.\n\nInvestigators say the brothers altered enough transactions in 12 seconds to redirect $25 million in cryptocurrency to themselves instead of the intended recipients.\n\nIn a press release, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco stated that the brothers used \"a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds.\" She also explained that agents from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) played a crucial role in solving the riddle of where the cryptocurrency went.\n\nA representative for Ethereum confronted the Peraire-Bueno brothers, but they refused to return the funds.

If convicted, they each face more than 20 years in prison."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin experiences a 1.5% rise, signaling strong momentum for the leading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough, with analysts predicting it could soon reach the $5,000 mark. Amid these developments, a new and captivating player, Furrever Token, is emerging as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Combining the charm of cat-themed content with blockchain technology, Furrever Token offers a unique investment opportunity with the promise of astronomical returns. As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture headlines, don't overlook the irresistible appeal and innovative potential of Furrever Token\u2014the next big thing in cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Surges 2%: Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs Skyrocket\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at around $65,738.46, experiencing a nearly 2% increase since yesterday. Over the past week, more than 600 firms have disclosed substantial investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their 13F filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAccording to the filing data, professional investment firms have reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Major players include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, UBS, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada, and hedge funds like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors.\n\nMillennium Management leads the pack with $1.9 billion invested across various Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Schonfeld Strategic Advisors follows with a $479 million investment, primarily in BlackRock\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s funds. Boothbay Fund Management and Pine Ridge Advisers have also declared significant holdings in spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMorgan Stanley stands out with a $269.9 million investment in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), making it one of the largest holders. Other notable investors include Aristeia Capital, Graham Capital Management, CRCM, and Fortress Investment Group, each with substantial investments in IBIT.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January, saw massive demand in the first three months. Despite a recent slowdown in inflows, the sustained interest from hundreds of financial institutions underscores the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s potential. As Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to rise, these substantial investments highlight the increasing mainstream acceptance and adoption of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's Potential Surge Amid SEC Decision Anticipation\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently trades at around $2,950.80, down 0.5% from yesterday but poised for a potential short-term bullish surge after a five-day stagnation. This momentum is fueled by discussions on declining revenue on the ETH Mainnet and the looming SEC decision on spot ETH ETFs.\n\nOpinions are divided on the SEC's verdict for VanEck's spot ETF application due May 23. Nate Geraci of ETF Store believes rejection is unlikely, citing past ETH futures ETF approvals and staking option removals. However, some speculate denial due to ongoing Ethereum security classification investigations.\n\nSEC scrutiny began in April 2023, yet ETH futures ETFs were approved in September, highlighting regulatory complexity. Ethereum now aims to surpass $3,000, facing resistance at $3,103 and $3,161. Short-term bullish sentiment is evident, with ETH long liquidations decreasing, open interest rising to 1.97%, and anticipation of increased price volatility pre-SEC decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: Analysts Predict the Next Big Thing in Crypto\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is capturing the attention of the crypto world, with analysts predicting it could be the next big thing.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin has published a new article outlining upcoming Ethereum improvements, particularly focusing on PeerDAS, the Verkle tree transition and decentralized methods for storing history as proposed in EIP-4444.\n\nGrats @dankrad @peter_szilagyi you got me to interrupt my work on EIPs and make a twitter response that turned into an unscheduled poast \ud83d\ude00https://t.co/mmVaiEV68K \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 17, 2024\n\nEthereum's founder emphasized the importance of decentralization, a key element of ETH's unique development strategy. He also addressed issues like Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and the balance between minimizing and quarantining it.\n\nThe article was inspired by a series of tweets from long-time Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi, who expressed concerns about MEV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMEV became an issue, so instead of trying to find solutions against it, we've glorified it and are now catering the protocol and infra around it to proprietary MEV builders instead of local block producers. It's futile to fight against MEV os might as well lean hard on it, right? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) May 16, 2024\n\nButerin noted that many of these concerns are already being addressed by ongoing protocol features and that additional issues can be resolved through realistic adjustments to the current road map.\n\nMEV\n\nButerin discussed Ethereum's approach to managing Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which emerged around 2020 when miners started using complex strategies to gain extra revenue from DeFi activities. This development compromised the fairness of block proposing, favoring larger actors.\n\nTwo strategies address MEV: minimization and quarantining. MEV minimization involves creating alternatives like Cowswap and using encrypted mempools to reduce exploitable information.\n\nMEV quarantining accepts MEV but limits its impact by separating block proposing from content selection. Validators focus on proposing blocks, while specialized builders choose block contents via an auction protocol.\n\nButerin supports a mix of both strategies, acknowledging that MEV will not disappear entirely and emphasizing the need to reduce the potential harm from builders to maintain decentralization.\n\nDecentralization\n\nButerin also emphasized the importance of making Ethereum nodes accessible, a central issue in blockchain decentralization. He highlighted EIP-4444 and Verkle trees as key technologies to reduce node hardware requirements, potentially to under 100 gigabytes or even near-zero by offloading history storage.\n\nButerin acknowledged concerns about centralization if responsibility for state maintenance and proofs is offloaded, suggesting an alternative: storing old history in a peer-to-peer network where each node holds a small portion of the data. This would ensure robustness with thousands of copies and potentially use erasure coding for added reliability.\n\nHe stressed that while Ethereum Layer 1 should support Layer 2 projects, it must maintain scalability and the unique properties that make Ethereum distinct, ensuring continued decentralization and security."

Check.\n\n\n\n0 local miner tips will nuke local stakers.\n\nGigagas hardware reqs will nuke local nodes.\n\n\n\nVoila, the banking system recreated. All privately held and operated. \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) May 16, 2024\n\nThe increased concerns sparked a series of posts from several Ethereum core contributors, including Josh Stark, Tim Beiko, Dankrad Feist and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin gave a detailed response to these criticisms in a blog post, stating that the concerns raised by community members are valid and \"are already being addressed by protocol features that are already in-progress.\"\n\nHe also stated that several other concerns from the community can be \"addressed by very realistic tweaks to the current roadmap.\" Buterin addressed three major areas that he believes form the majority of the concerns raised:\n\nMEV and builder dependence\n\nLiquid staking\n\nHardware requirement of nodes\n\nHe discussed how Verkle trees, EIP-4444, robust solo staking, and a peer-pressuring development process for MEV reduction can solve these issues.\n\n\"There is a near-unlimited number of blockchain projects aiming for the niche of \u2018we can be super-fast, we'll think about decentralization later.\u2019 I don't think Ethereum should be one of those projects,\" said Buterin.\n\n\"We should have deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique, and continue to work to maintain and improve on those properties as Ethereum scales,\" he added.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could attempt to break $3,251 resistance\n\nEthereum posted a 5% gain on Friday after it broke the $3,103 resistance. The rise follows a general appreciation of assets in the crypto market. However, Ethereum notably outperformed Bitcoin in the past 24 hours after several community members highlighted the ETH/BTC ratio was nearing a bottom.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows slight bullish signs, SEC faces several hurdles in attempts to deny spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nAs a result, ETH short liquidations are outpacing longs for the first time. With a total liquidation of $24.5 million in the past 24 hours, short liquidations sit at $17.54 million compared to $6.76 million long liquidations, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nThe recent ETH rise has also caused a spike in ETH open interest, which increased by 6.6% in the past 24 hours. This signifies renewed investor interest in ETH, meaning it may see less sideways movement in the coming days.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIf renewed confidence prevails, ETH could attempt to break the $3,161 resistance and, if successful, move past the $3,251 mark. However, it's important to watch out for volatility in the days leading up to the SEC's decision on spot ETH ETFs on May 23."

        "content": "Maocat\n\nMAOCAT is a project that seeks to contribute to changing the memecoin crypto niche.\n\nHong Kong, May 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The MAOCAT project has officially stated its strategy to become the next big thing in Ethereum-based memecoins. With unique features like fixed staking, launchpad, and NFT marketplace, MAOCAT aims to offer a diverse ecosystem for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nAfter years of dog domination in the memecoin world, cats finally get to shine with MAOCAT's promising growth potential. The ongoing presale is just the beginning of this ambitious project, with more developments and features to come.\n\nHow This Team Plans to Launch the Next Big Ethereum-based Memecoin\n\nThe project's team believes MAOCAT could be the next big Ethereum-based memecoin to explode in popularity and value. Some hints of its potential already exist, such as the outstanding success of its current presale.\n\nAt the time of this writing, MAOCAT had already sold over 60% of its pre-sale allocation. Considering how fast the team reached this threshold, the growth indicates a high demand for this project.\n\nThe team's roadmap is divided into different phases. Specifically, Stage 1 includes:\n\nThe launch of MAOCAT.\n\nStaking opportunities for $MAO.\n\nThe creation of various social media accounts to connect with the community.\n\nIn Stage 2, users can claim their $MAO tokens and see them listed on exchanges. Additionally, the team aims to expand its presence on bigger and better exchanges while working on game development. The team is also excited to reach the milestone of having 10,000 holders of $MAO.\n\nFinally, Stage 3 will see the launch of the highly anticipated MAOCAT game and 10,000 NFTs. These unique NFTs will go live on the popular OpenSea platform and an NFT marketplace created by MAOCAT.\n\nThe Growing Ecosystem of MAOCAT: From SWAP to Launchpad to NFTs\n\nThere are four elements that make up the exciting and rapidly expanding ecosystem of MAOCAT. These elements include the MAO CAT NFT collection, an NFT Marketplace on ETH, MAO SWAP (DeFi 2.0), and MAO GAME.\n\nThe upcoming NFT marketplace will be a platform where users can buy and sell their unique MAO CAT NFTs. With NFTs' growing popularity, MAOCAT aims to provide its users with a seamless and secure marketplace experience.\n\nThe NFT collection will find its home in this marketplace. This feature will offer NFT holders a range of rarity tiers and unique benefits. Whether owning a rare or legendary MAO CAT NFT, users have multiple ways to be part of this exclusive community.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ecosystem also includes MAO SWAP, a DeFi 2.0 platform allowing efficient and flexible trading through its innovative liquidity mechanism. With MAO SWAP, users can farm and stake their tokens to earn a fixed APR and other rewards.\n\nLastly, the upcoming MAO GAME will offer an interactive gaming experience with collectible NFTs as in-game assets. This particular mix of features goes beyond the typical memecoin project and focuses on token utility. The $MAO token lets users access all ecosystem elements and join various events, creating a great experience for MAOCAT supporters.\n\nAbout MAOCAT\n\nAt its core, MAOCAT is a project that seeks to contribute to changing the memecoin crypto niche. This sector is often entirely about dogs, which can surprise many, considering how popular cats are on the internet.\n\nBeyond the cat-based project, there's a rather large ecosystem in place for the MAOCAT community. This ecosystem will offer its users a range of benefits and opportunities, such as staking, trading, NFTs, and gaming.\n\nMAOCAT is gaining popularity and has already sold over 60% of its pre-sale allocation. In more practical terms, early investors bought over $300,000 worth of tokens in this phase.\n\nThe team behind MAOCAT has a clear roadmap for bringing this project to its full potential. The project's website is a great source for learning about MAOCAT's features and progress. As always, the social pages below let anyone connect with the community and stay updated on all things MAOCAT.\n\nX (Twitter) | Telegram | Instagram | YouTube\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a press release and does not contain any financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap entered a fresh rally in mid-week and rebounded from $2860 monthly support. This renewed buying interest bolstered by the Bitcoin price jump to $67000 on Friday has surged the ETH price to an 8.7% gain. However, an analysis of the daily chart shows the rising Ether price is heading to a crucial resistance indicating an upcoming pivot momentum for this asset.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Charts Might Turn Bullish Now: ETH Targets $4k?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Poised for Rebound as Falling Channel Pattern Nears Break\n\nIn the daily time frame chart, the Ethereum price shows the formation of a falling channel pattern. The two parallel trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support have plunged the ETH value from $4084 to $2864 support indicating a nearly 30% loss.\n\nWhile the BTC price rally bolsters a new recovery sentiment in altcoin, the ETH price could remain trapped in a correction until the chart setup is intact.\n\nHaving said that, the Ether coin is heading higher to challenge the upper boundary of the Channel pattern. After a 3% upswing, the coin buyers escape the range of this pattern, signaling the end-of-correction trend.\n\nAccording to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in the middle of its bull cycle. Ju highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that historically lasts around two years.\n\nIf this pattern continues, the current bull cycle might extend until April 2025. The accompanying chart from CryptoQuant illustrates the growth rate difference between Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and realized cap, showing similar cycles approximately every two years.\n\nThis potential uptrend significantly influences the altcoin market bolstering top assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP to lead to higher rallies.\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the channel pattern will accelerate the buying momentum and assist buyers in rechallenging the $4080 high.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA prevents the ETH price from breaching the channel pattern.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The ADX slope falling below 18% hints the prevailing bearish momentum is weakening.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets. Armed with a strong grasp of technical analysis, he keeps a vigilant eye on the daily price movements of top assets and indices. Drawn by his fascination with financial instruments, Sahil enthusiastically embraced the emerging realm of cryptocurrency, where he continues to explore opportunities driven by his passion for trading\n\nDisclaimer: The presented content may include the personal opinion of the author and is subject to market condition.

        "title": "Market watch: Bitcoin, Ethereum traders on the spot with $2.13B options expiry - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin maintained a balanced Put/Call Ratio ahead of the deadline\n\nETH traders face potential losses as its price was close to the maximum pain point\n\nAccording to data from Deribit, the market-leading derivatives exchange, Bitcoin [BTC] options with a notional value of $1.18 billion will expire on 17 May.\n\nAlso, Ethereum [ETH] contracts, valued at $950 million, would expire on the same day. At press time, the Put/Call Ratio for Bitcoin was 0.61 while the maximum pain point was $62,500.\n\nWhere do both BTC and ETH stand?\n\nIn trading options, a put means that a trader has placed a position to place a contract up for sale. In this case, the expectation is that the price of the asset decreases so the position can make gains.\n\nOn the other hand, a call implies a purchase, indicating that the bet is for a price hike. If the reading of the Put/Call Ratio is 0.70 and above, it means that traders are buying more puts than calls.\n\nConversely, a reading of 0.50 and below implies a bullish sentiment in the market. For Bitcoin, the ratio revealed that the number of put and call positions was close, indicating a balance between bearish and bullish positions.\n\nFor ETH, the Put/Call Ratio was 0.21 \u2013 A sign that most of the bets were bullish. ETH had a maximum pain point of $3,000. If the cryptocurrency trades at this level or below by the end of the day, a lot of traders might face huge financial losses.\n\nIt would be the same for Bitcoin if the price hits $62,500 or drops below it. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was $66,443, indicating that it might be difficult for the crypto to cause a lot of pain.\n\nHowever, at the same time, ETH was valued at $3,018. The closeness of this to the maximum pain point leaves ETH traders at a big risk of losing.\n\nETH\u2019s weakness has not deterred future bets\n\nIn addition, Greeks.live, an options trading repository, commented on the matter. The handle agreed with AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis for Bitcoin via X. For Ethereum, it noted,\n\n\u201cBtc is more balanced between long and short, while the ETH price is weak leading to continued weakening of the market confidence, and selling calls have become the absolute main deal.\u201d\n\nHowever, data from Deribit revealed that traders expect ETH to recover from its struggles going forward. Based on AMBCrypto\u2019s observations, there has been an increase in bets targeting $3,600 between the last week of May and June.\n\nOne of the reasons for this prediction could be the looming SEC decision on the numerous Ethereum ETF applications. A nod on this front could drive ETH\u2019s price higher, and traders might gain from the same.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nOn the other hand, delay or rejection could force the price of the altcoin further lower. Should this be the case, traders might have to deal with huge financial losses."
