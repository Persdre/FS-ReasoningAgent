        "title": "Ethereum is too hard to use - Blockworks",
        "content": "Anyone else think Ethereum is difficult to use these days?\n\nYeah, there\u2019s a bunch of cool stuff on Ethereum \u2014 meme tokens, NFTs, DeFi, degens \u2014 it\u2019s all there. But over the years as the blockchain evolved, it has become more expensive and more complicated \u2014 as in, an already complex technology for users has become even moreso.\n\nNot only do users need to understand crypto basics like wallets, irreversible transactions and addresses, they also now have to contend with getting to know different chains. You can\u2019t just send Ethereum chain ETH to Optimism chain ETH, or Optimism chain ETH to Polygon chain ETH, unless of course you use a bridge which means that this system might be getting a little complex for many users.\n\nEthereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anyone in particular to blame for this; it\u2019s an ecosystem problem as a whole. When Ethereum launched almost 10 years ago, nobody was using it. At that time, any usage at all was welcomed.\n\nNow, it\u2019s 2024 and there is usage. But there\u2019s also expensive layer-1 fees. Average transaction fees on the layer-1 Ethereum blockchain are at $0.94. If a user wants to interact with a smart contract, like a DEX, fees are averaging $4.70.\n\nSome might say, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s time to examine fees themselves.\u201d Problem is, fees are what secure the network. If validators were not being incentivized by staking and reaping fees, what would be the point?\n\nOkay, yeah, but there\u2019s the layer-2 options, right? There are. And Arbitrum and Optimism have both transaction and smart contract fees at less than $0.02. We\u2019re securing the bottom layer, enabling lower fees on the second.\n\nBut as a Coinbase report from late last year noted, there are so many of these layer-2s that fragmentation now exists between all of these different chains. And mainstream users, aka those who could enable mass adoption, want financial apps that don\u2019t make things complicated.\n\nThe sandbox\n\nThe point is clearly that Ethereum is just one big-ass financial experiment. I actually wrote about this way back in 2016, about Ethereum being a fintech sandbox.\n\nAnd it has been one. When I wrote that piece, ICOs were only slowly gaining traction, DEXs were in their infancy and there wasn\u2019t even an NFT token standard yet \u2014 just Plain Jane ERC-20s.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it\u2019s forever silly.\n\nTimes have certainly changed. Ethereum\u2019s \u201cworld computer\u201d concept, the idea that people could build programmable monetary systems on a verifiable blockchain, has been a success. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is a standard for smart contract development \u2014 even outside the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the 2022 move to the proof-of-stake model, which to Ethereum\u2019s credit, was pulled off with remarkable execution.\n\nYet I\u2019ve heard of people working on Ethereum layer-3 projects now. That\u2019s an abstraction of two layers \u2014 can anyone come up with something comparable for so many layers in technology? Maybe the OSI model? It has seven layers. But it\u2019s used for data in networking, all running at the same speed. And there\u2019s no fees. It\u2019s just categorizing data.\n\nOkay, well, blockchains are just data. So then we arrive back at the fee conundrum. But blockchains are decentralized, so there has to be some incentive to support the network, right?\n\nA fee quagmire\n\nFees secure the Ethereum network, rent the computing power to do things and also limit spam. With that in mind, I suppose there have to be fees in the system \u2014 I\u2019m not proposing some grand, new fee-less Ethereum design, that\u2019s for the Vitalik Buterins of the world.\n\nThere are rollups, and that\u2019s promising because they can batch process transactions off of Ethereum while lowering fees with the same level of security. Or maybe some smart startup can somehow increase interoperability \u2014 instead of reducing it by having users dig through layers like a Stouffer\u2019s Italiano.\n\nI just am not convinced of the feasibility and long-term viability of so many bridges, some of which have been compromised. It feels like too many vulnerabilities in the margins. Perhaps a standardization of bridges is needed, and many wallets do warn users about interacting with bad smart contracts, so some safeguarding is happening.\n\nBut I\u2019m still trying to coincide my recent experiences with Ethereum as something\u2026\n\nVery.\n\nLasagna-like.\n\nTasty for the taste buds as a food, yes.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it a bit complex for people to use as a blockchain? People want apps that offer free flow of money, not restrictive layers. Hopefully, Ethereum can evolve past this lasagna stage.\n\nDaniel Cawrey has been involved full-time in the crypto space since 2013, including as an editor at CoinDesk.

        "title": "What Is the EIP-7022 Proposal on Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "EIP-7702 is a new proposal that will introduce a new transaction type to enhance the security and functionality of EOAs.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a team of developers are spearheading a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). EIP-7702 will significantly improve smart contract functionality on Ethereum by temporarily merging it into externally owned accounts (EOA), thus simplifying and improving user experience.\n\nRead on to learn about the EIP-7702 proposal on Ethereum, how it works, its potential impact, and its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nWhat Is EIP-7702?\n\nThe EIP-7702 proposal was introduced as an alternative to EIP-3074, which was approved for inclusion in the Pectra upgrade scheduled for Q4 2024.\n\nEIP-3074 was designed to refine account management within the Ethereum protocol by allowing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to assign control to smart contracts, paving the way for more advanced transaction strategies. EOAs are a type of Ethereum account controlled by users rather than code\n\nThe proposal would achieve this by introducing two new opcodes, AUTH and AUTHCALL, enabling EOAs to transition smoothly into smart contracts without deploying new ones. This would improve transaction efficiency and flexibility in interactive scenarios and complex operations.\n\nHowever, EIP-3074 faced some limitations, including technical issues and security challenges. These issues became evident in practical applications, especially when dealing with high-value or large-scale transactions. Vitalik Buterin, alongside Ansgar Dietrichs, Matt Garnett, and Sam Wilson, developed EIP-7702 in response to these issues and as an alternative to EIP-3074.\n\nEIP-7702 is a new proposal that will introduce a new transaction type to enhance the security and functionality of EOAs. The proposal will enable EOAs to behave momentarily like smart contracts.\n\nSimply put, EIP-7702 will inherit and expand some of the functionalities of EIP-3074, such as batch processing, lowering privileges, and transaction sponsorship.\n\nHow Does EIP-7702 Work?\n\nThe proposed EIP-7702 will provide a new method for EOAs to interact within the Ethereum blockchain. Externally owned accounts will be temporarily able to operate as smart contract wallets during transactions before returning to their initial state after the transaction.\n\nThis technique improves the functionality and security of Externally Owned Accounts without launching new opcodes, making assimilation more efficient than EIP-3074. Moreover, removing opcodes from the process helps decrease complexity, compatibility difficulties, development resources, and potential security flaws linked to them.\n\nEIP-7702 has been developed to be forward-thinking, given its compatibility with ERC-4337. ERC-4337 is an account abstraction standard on the Ethereum network that aims to improve security and user experience by launching smart contract functionality in wallets. This integration can help externally owned accounts attain features such as multi-factor authentication, the potential for people to transact using any token, and social recovery.\n\nEIP-7702 can significantly reduce transaction fees by batching transactions, making the Ethereum network more efficient. The proposal promotes financial inclusion by introducing transaction sponsorship, where one user can offset the transaction fees for another user. It also makes the platform more accessible, lowering the barrier to entry.\n\nEIP-7702 also includes downscaling privileges. Accounts can limit their privileges for certain crypto transactions, boosting the platform\u2019s security against fraudulent and phishing activities.\n\nThe Potential Impact of EIP-7702 on the Ethereum Network\n\nThe new Ethereum proposal, EIP-7702, if included in the Pectra upgrade scheduled for Q4 2024, is expected to impact the Ethereum network positively. Although currently in the discussion stage, EIP-7702 offers a robust solution to enhancing Ethereum by introducing account abstraction.\n\nAccount abstraction makes it more flexible for users to program their security better while enjoying an enhanced user experience. Lowering the barrier to entry for Ethereum enhances accessibility, potentially boosting its adoption in the Web3 ecosystem. In addition, smart contracts can provide better safety features, such as recovering funds in case private keys are lost.\n\nTransaction sponsorship also means that users can easily get started with the Ethereum network as they don\u2019t have to worry about buying ether for gas fees.\n\nThe proposal introduces greater flexibility in the design of smart contract wallets for developers. They can customize their verification logic, incorporating features such as emergency recovery techniques, multi-factor authentication, and spending limits. This opens up new opportunities for developers to explore smart contract wallets.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of EIP-7702\n\nWhile still in discussions, EIP-7702 has some benefits and drawbacks linked to it. Below are some benefits of the proposal:\n\nBatched Transactions: The Ethereum network can become much more efficient through the batched transaction feature, which can also reduce transaction costs.\n\nERC-4337 Compatibilit y: The EIP-7702 is a forward-thinking proposal compatible with the ERC-4337 standard on Ethereum, which can enhance the user experience and security of the Ethereum blockchain while advancing blockchain technology.\n\nTransaction Sponsorship : If successfully implemented, EIP-7702 will enable users to cover the transaction fees of other users, making the platform more accessible for everyone.\n\nWidespread Ethereum Adoption : By lowering the barrier to entry for users, more people will be able to access and use the Ethereum platform, leading to its widespread adoption.\n\nWhile there is optimism surrounding EIP-7702, it\u2019s not without its drawbacks. Below are some challenges with the EIP-7702 proposal:\n\nAdjusting Gas Costs : It\u2019s still unclear how EIP-7702 will scale the gas fee costs associated with its transactions.\n\nRevocation of Transactions : Implementing EIP-7702 would mean that users relinquish the control of their externally owned accounts to smart contract codes, which, albeit need to be trusted, can be prone to malice. Therefore, the Ethereum team must ensure users can revoke and revert transactions signed using malicious code.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe introduction of EIP-7702 is expected to benefit Ethereum. Still, its implementation will depend on its developers finding solutions to the raised issues and getting consensus from the Ethereum community.\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs, one of the researchers at the Ethereum Foundation, suggested implementing EIP-7702 to the Pectra upgrade first and tracking it for several weeks before deciding whether to replace EIP-3074 with EIP-7702.\n\nIf incorporated, it remains to be seen how EIP-7702 will revolutionize the Ethereum blockchain."

But the top two coins by market cap aren't the only ones seeing big gains. The entire crypto market is up, with Solana and Avalanche the top gainers.\n\nSolana, the fifth biggest coin by market cap, is up over 8% in the past day and is now trading hands for $184.17, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe coin isn't as close to breaking records like Bitcoin is, though\u2014it still has to rise in value by another 29% to hit its 2021 all-time high of $259.\n\nElsewhere, Avalanche is also riding high: of the top 20 coins and tokens, it's doing the best, having shot up by nearly 9% in 24 hours. It is now priced at $38.24.\n\nThe coin, which runs on a network used by developers to build decentralized apps, is the 12th biggest digital asset by market cap and last year made headlines when J.P. Morgan announced that it had used its blockchain to tokenize investment portfolios.\n\nFurther down the list of top cryptocurrencies by market cap, price surges have also hit Uniswap (UNI), Pepe, and Lido DAO (LDO) with 24-hour gains of over 18%, 20%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is currently up 14% in the past day, coming in priced at $3,511. The asset shot up on news that Wall Street's biggest regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, could be close to approving a spot ETH ETF.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch an investment vehicle would give people exposure to the second biggest digital currency by market cap via shares that trade on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January but has been coy on the issue of approving an ETH equivalent.\n\nA long-list of big Wall Street firms have filed paperwork to release a spot ETH ETF, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck.

        "content": "Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the odds of the SEC approving the Ethereum ETFs have greatly improved.\n\nThe SEC's sudden change of attitude is leaving everyone scrambling, Balchunas said.\n\nHe upped his odds of approval to 75%, from 25%.\n\nThe odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission will greenlight Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund applications have just increased.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, long bearish on the products\u2019 odds, posted on X that chances of approval have shot up to 75% from 25%.\n\nBalchunas said he was \u201chearing chatter this afternoon that the SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone is scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they\u2019d be denied).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from multiple sources,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart said. \u201cShould see a bunch of filings over coming days if we\u2019re correct.\u201d\n\nEthereum soared 8% off Balchunas\u2019 tweet, recently trading at $3,400.\n\n\u201cIf the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who\u2019s close to this process,\u201d Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant fund, posted. \u201cIt means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy after the SAB 121 vote, perhaps more important than the ETF itself.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, the Senate voted on a resolution to repeal a controversial accounting guidance from the SEC, called SAB 121, which critics say has deterred investment banks from offering crypto custody at scale.\n\nPresident Joe Biden indicated that he would veto the provision if approved. Prominent Democrats, however, have sided with their Republican colleagues against the rule, raising speculation that the White House may back down.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nDeadline\n\nIf the SEC wants to approve the Ethereum ETF products, it will have to be fast about it. The deadline for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application is on Thursday \u2014 and the SEC is unlikely to approve some of the filings ahead of others in order to avoid playing the role of a kingmaker.\n\nNate Geraci, president of ETF Store, said that even with the tight deadline, it would be possible for the SEC to approve one set of important filings, called 19b-4s, before the deadline, and then \u201cslow play\u201d the second set of filings, called S-1s.\n\nThe SEC must approve both set of filings before the ETFs could come to market.\n\nBalchunas had previously told DL News that in light of the reported lack of engagement from the SEC with prospective issuers, Ethereum ETFs were unlikely to get approved before the end of 2025.\n\nIf the ETFs are rejected, issuers will likely wait until after the US presidential election to file again, because a victory for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump would probably mean a change of leadership at the SEC \u2014 perhaps in favour of someone less antagonistic toward crypto than current chair Gary Gensler.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Investors poured $932 million into digital asset products this week, but Ethereum (ETH) crypto funds bucked the trend, experiencing outflows exceeding $23 million, according to CoinShares, an asset management firm. Analysts attribute these outflows to growing concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nInvestors favored Bitcoin, with $942 million flowing in, and minimal short positions, indicating positive sentiment. Altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano saw inflows of $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million. However, the weekly trading volume was only $10.5 billion, significantly lower than March\u2019s $40 billion.\n\nImage Source: CoinShares (ETF Flows by Providers, Asset & Country)\n\nIn terms of regions, the US led the way this week with inflows of $1 billion. Grayscale, after experiencing significant outflows totaling $16.6 billion since its ETF launch in January, saw its first inflows of $18 million in a notable shift. Following the US, Switzerland and Germany also saw minor inflows, amounting to $27 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\n\nBlockchain equities have had a tough year, with outflows recorded in 14 of the 20 weeks so far, resulting in a cumulative outflow of $512 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s potential disapproval of an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) reflects its cautious approach towards crypto regulation. Concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the underlying infrastructure of Ethereum may influence their decision.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of clear regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrencies creates uncertainty, making it challenging for the SEC to greenlight such products. Until comprehensive regulatory frameworks are established, the approval of an ETH ETF remains uncertain, impacting investor sentiment and market dynamics."

        "title": "IBC to Ethereum: Building the interconnected Internet of Blockchains - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009 and the explosion of innovation that followed, the web3 industry has faced many challenges. Beyond dealing with regulators, improving UX, and weeding out bad actors, blockchain engineers continue to tackle two major hurdles: scalability and interoperability.\n\nWhile many Layer 2s are working to scale Layer 1s like Bitcoin and Ethereum by improving throughput and reducing transaction fees, protocols like Union enable both\u2014interoperability at scale.\n\nThe need for blockchain interoperability\n\nWhatever your opinion on the WEF, its 2020 whitepaper on blockchain interoperability hit the nail when it stated, \u201cOrganisations do not want to find themselves on a blockchain platform that may limit their options for external collaboration in the future.\u201d\n\nTo elaborate further on that point, imagine having a Gmail account, sending a message to a Yahoo account, and being unable to exchange communications. The internet was able to develop as quickly as it did because it factored in interoperability from the early days, and blockchains must do the same.\n\nA notable player in the interoperability space is Cosmos, whose flagship Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol has enabled a host of sovereign chains to connect, transact, exchange, swap tokens, and perform other actions without compromising sovereignty. Map of Zones shows 91 zones now connected via IBC transacting more than $2.1 billion over the last 30 days in more than 8.7 million transactions.\n\nIBC isn\u2019t limited to Cosmos chains, either. The trustless interoperability protocol has broadened its scope to include EVM-compatible chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. However, most bridging solutions so far have been offered by centralized providers, meaning users must trust the bridging protocol.\n\nUnion provides a permissionless bridging protocol that connects modular blockchains and rollups trustlessly, without depending on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC, using advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography.\n\nAlready connecting several ecosystems, Union recently announced a partnership with L2 developer Polygon Labs that will tap into Polygon\u2019s AggLayer \u201cto facilitate message passing and asset transfers between the Polygon ecosystem and IBC-enabled chains,\u201d bridging two of the largest blockchain ecosystems: Polygon and Cosmos.\n\nPermissionlessly bridging Polygon, Cosmos, and beyond\n\nUnion founder and prior CTO at Composable Finance Karel Kubat told CryptoSlate, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a Cosmos to Polygon bridge but anything that\u2019s IBC-enabled, which includes Scroll, and soon Arbitrum, Berrachain, Movement Labs, M2\u2026 They can build and connect into the Agglayer using Union,\u201d permissionlessly tapping into the liquidity of one of the largest blockchain Layer 1s, Ethereum.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s very interesting because we have big L1 ecosystems that really only have permissioned centralized bridges or something in between. You need to go to the bridge provider to get support for a small ecosystem. What Union does, is if you\u2019re building a new Cosmos chain or a new rollup that\u2019s IBC enabled, you don\u2019t need to go to a centralized provider to get support. You just open the connection to Ethereum and you\u2019re done\u2026 So we\u2019re going quite quickly from a world with only 200 to 300 ecosystems to a world with thousands and thousands.\u201d\n\nThis type of seamless interoperability isn\u2019t possible with centralized solutions because the \u201cwait queue\u201d is too long. Every chain wanting to connect needs to request the bridging protocol\u2019s permission.\n\nWith Union, chains can permissionlessly open a channel with Ethereum, enabling a seamlessly interconnected future\u2026 of potentially millions of chains. Karel gives the example of dYdX, one of the largest decentralized exchanges that began as a smart contract on Ethereum and moved ecosystems to become a sovereign Cosmos app chain.\n\n\u201cWe all went into crypto for sovereignty,\u201d he says. \u201cAny successful smart contract is contemplating going to their own L2 or app chain.\u201d This means the total addressable market for Union is potentially vast. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone that wants to build a blockchain. It\u2019s any existing app on Ethereum and Solana that could benefit from making this move.\u201d\n\nUnion\u2019s IBC to Polygon bridge should be completed by the end of this year and you can keep up with the latest developments by following Union on X.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Soars 20%, Lifting Arbitrum and Optimism - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRumors of a potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs have fueled a full day of gains for the Ethereum ecosystem, with the price of ETH skyrocketing 20% intraday to just shy of $3,700\u2014trading at $3,687 at time of writing\u2014and sister tokens Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) both notching gains of 18% on Monday.\n\nThe optimistic mood had already spread to other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), which are peaking above $40 and $188 respectively, as of this writing, representing more than 25% gains over the last seven days for both.\n\nThe sudden rally to start the week was sparked moments after two Bloomberg ETF analysts\u2014Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart\u2014revealed their joint prediction that the Securities and Exchange Commission \u201ccould be doing a 180 on this increasingly political issue\u201d and approve Ethereum spot ETFs when its first major deadline comes later this week.\n\nThey increased their estimated odds of approval to 75%\u2014a huge upgrade from their prior estimate of 25%, which was already more pessimistic than other analysts who placed the chances at 50-50 earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: @JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied). See\u2026 https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024\n\nCrypto oddsmakers are certainly shifting their views, with the collective probability of an Ethereum spot ETF approval by the end of the month leaping from 10% yesterday to 61% on Polymarket, as of this writing. Optimism had been declining steadily since the betting option appeared in January at 76%, when Bitcoin spot ETFs were unleashed.\n\nAs with the long and meandering Bitcoin spot ETF approval process, the SEC has systematically delayed making a decision on the Ethereum equivalents. Hopes for approval had dimmed, with fears peaking that this week's deadline would prompt the federal regulator to outright declare Ethereum a security, decisively separating it from the commodity status enjoyed by Bitcoin.\n\nLate last week, however, a debate on Capitol Hill prompted many Democrats to join Republicans in defiance of Pres. Joe Biden's pro-SEC stance, a significant battle in a broadly partisan war over U.S. crypto policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI don\u2019t think people appreciate how huge that vote was. Warren had a strangle hold over financial policy under the Dems. This is showing the WH and Senate Dems are starting to realize that\u2019s toxic to their election odds. They also realize there are *a lot* of moderates,\u2026 https://t.co/w8gsmw6BIn \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) May 20, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said it saw Ethereum spot ETFs as an eventuality\u2014if not immediately approved on May 23.\n\nAll of this came as top coin Bitcoin was in the middle of its own rally, the price of BTC clearing $70,000 earlier in the day amid massive short-position liquidiations\u2014heights not seen since April 12, and approaching the $73,737 all-time high set in March.\n\nThe good mood was contagious, and by late Monday, the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap were all green for the day\u2014and for the prior 7 days.\n\nAmong meme coins, Bonk and Pepe are both up more than 20% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "With the spot Ethereum ETF decision pending this week, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, offers insights into the potential outcomes for the week ahead. Approval from the SEC for spot Ethereum ETFs to trade on Wall Street hinges on the clearance of both the 19b-4s (exchange rule changes) and S-1s (registration statements).\n\nSpot Ethereum ETH Approval\n\nAs we know, the spot Ethereum ETF will directly hold Ether as its underlying asset, and will trade on the stock exchanges just similar to stocks. However, for them to trade on exchanges, they must receive the SEC nod for both \u2013 19b-4s as well the S-1 filings.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSEC decision deadline this week on spot eth ETFs\u2026 SEC must approve both the 19b-4s (exchange rule changes) & S-1s (registration statements) for ETFs to launch. Technically possible for SEC to approve 19b-4s & then slow play S-1s (esp given reported lack of engagement here). \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 19, 2024\n\nRule 19b-4 refers to the filing that a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq, submits to the SEC when proposing to change rules or introduce new products. For Ethereum ETFs, the exchanges need SEC approval on these filings to list the ETFs. Essentially, this process involves the exchange requesting permission to add these new Ethereum products to their trading platforms.\n\nThe S-1 is the initial registration form required for new securities offered to the public. It provides the SEC and potential investors with detailed information about the company\u2019s business operations, financial condition, and management. For ETFs, this document details the structure of the fund, its management, and how it intends to replicate the performance of Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC must approve both the 19b-4 filings and the S-1 registration forms in order to legally sell the ETFs to the public. The SEC typically has a statutory timeframe of 45 days, extendable up to 240 days, to make an initial decision on the 19b-4 filings. Approval of the 19b-4s permits the ETFs to be listed on exchanges. However, without approval of the S-1s, the ETFs cannot be legally sold to investors.\n\nChances of A Delay\n\nEven if the U.S. SEC approves the 19b-4s, it can go slow with the approval of the S-1s. This also means that the regulator can take even longer in order to review and approve these documents. Also, the lack of engagement between the issuers and the SEC highlights that the regulator could undertake a more cautious approach due to the complexities and risks involved with crypto products.\n\nThe decision on Ethereum ETFs is crucial, as approval could boost mainstream adoption of Ethereum and offer a more regulated and secure investment environment for those interested in cryptocurrency. Conversely, a delay or denial might indicate ongoing regulatory concerns about the stability and security of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nAs the decision looms around, the Ethereum price has given a partial bounceback to $3,100 over the last weekend.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin expressed his opinions on three key issues regarding the decentralization of Ethereum: MEV, liquid staking, and node hardware requirements.\n\nButerin explained that many of the concerns related to the centralization of Ethereum can be addressed through smart protocol designs and updates, some of which are already being implemented.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nDecentralization of Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s response\n\nAs anticipated, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, responded to the criticisms directed at the blockchain in a detailed blog post, analyzing three fundamental issues for the centralization of Ethereum.\n\nMEV (Miner Extractable Value), liquid staking and hardware costs for managing a single node are the three key points.\n\nButerin has observed that concerns about the design of Ethereum in these three key areas are \u201cwidely shared\u201d and added:\n\n\u201cThese are concerns I have personally had on many occasions.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Buterin, these problems might not be as difficult to overcome as some argue.\n\nIn his post, published on May 17th, Buterin first addresses the issue of MEV, which is the financial gain that sophisticated node operators can obtain by reordering transactions within a block.\n\nButerin distinguishes two approaches to MEV: \u201cminimization\u201d (reducing MEV through the design of intelligent protocols, like CowSwap) and \u201cquarantine\u201d (attempting to reduce or eliminate MEV altogether through in-protocol techniques).\n\nAlthough the MEV quarantine may seem like an appealing option, Buterin notes that this perspective carries some risks of centralization:\n\n\u201cIf builders have the power to completely exclude transactions from a block, attacks can easily arise-\u201d\n\nHowever, Buterin has supported builders working on MEV quarantine through concepts like transaction inclusion lists, which \u201ctake away the builder\u2019s ability to completely exclude transactions from a block.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the ideas in this direction \u2013 really pushing the quarantine box to be as small as possible \u2013 are really interesting, and I am in favor of going in that direction.\u201d\n\nButerin: reducing barriers for solo stakers, a crucial step\n\nVitalik Buterin has addressed the issue of the low number of solo stakers on Ethereum.\n\nIn particular explaining that many prefer to use centralized staking providers like Coinbase or decentralized solutions like Lido and RocketPool.\n\nThis choice is due to the complexity, hardware requirements, and the minimum of 32 ETH needed to run an Ethereum node independently.\n\nWhile acknowledging the progress made in reducing the costs and complexity of managing a single node, Buterin emphasized that \u201cthere is still more that we could do.\u201d\n\nSuggesting the possibility of reducing the time required to withdraw ETH in staking or lowering the minimum requirement of 32 ETH to become a solo staker, as stated:\n\n\u201cIncorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralization and \u2018recreation of the traditional financial system with additional steps\u2019; correct answers could create a shining example of a successful ecosystem with a wide and diversified set of individual stakers and highly decentralized staking pools.\u201d\n\nHigh hardware requirements for nodes: the civil debate\n\nRegarding the high hardware requirements for nodes, Buterin admitted that the issue is more complex.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that with the implementation of Verkle Trees and the upcoming EIP-4444, \u201cthe hardware requirements of a node could plausibly eventually decrease to less than one hundred gigabytes, and perhaps almost to zero if we completely eliminate the responsibility of storing the history (perhaps only for non-staking nodes).\u201d\n\nButerin concluded his post urging the Ethereum ecosystem to confront difficult questions rather than avoid them:\n\n\u201c\u2026 We should have a deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique and continue to work to maintain and improve those properties as Ethereum grows.\u201d\n\nIn a post on X, Buterin added that he is happy to see a civil debate among community members:"

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why the Ethereum (ETH) Price is Rising Heavily - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has made a shocking recovery as the token gained a 30% surge in the last few days, pushing the value to the highest of the month. At the time of writing, Ethereum price is valued at $3,758.22 with a market capitalization of $451,726,002,955. Moments before surging, ETH price was shallow around the $31K mark, but within 34 minutes, the price jumped to $34K, with a big surge in its number of transactions. Because of that, the trading volume jumped 253% yesterday, pumping the value to $ 33.2billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo, why the Ethereum price is rising so much? Let us look into that.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind The Ethereum Price Rally?\n\nAfter creating history for being the most preferred cryptocurrency network, ETH hit its peak in 2021 when it surged to its ATH of $4,891.70. But with the declining market conditions, Ethereum was laying low for years before witnessing a surge in March 2024. And now after weeks of break, Ethereum price has started to rise again with a major pump in the last 48 hours solely because of two factors related to the market recovery and new updates on Ethereum ETF.\n\nBullish Market Conditions\n\nAfter weeks of neutral sentiments restricting the market conditions, finally, bulls appeared in the market with a 68/100 score on the fear and greed index. This along with the rise in overall market cap to $2.6 Trillion and the trading volume of $120.57 Billion confirms the bullish market conditions today. As a result, all the cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum have recovered after gaining decent gains in the last 48 hours.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin price targeting the ATH target of $73,750.07 after rising to $69,822.46 also pushing the altcoins up.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Approval\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision over Ethereum ETF will be out on Thursday but one thing has changed, making it the main reason behind creating a surge. After the SEC portrayed disagreement with Ethereum, the investors lost hope of hearing positive news on the result day. Also, the analysts presented a very low probability of approval of Ethereum Spot ETF due to the issues of Ethereum status between Commodity and Security. However, finally, the analysts have presented a 75% approval rate in the ETH ETF case, much higher than the prior 25%.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart openly announced the approval ods rising to 75% based on the SEC advising the exchanges to update their 19B-4 filings on an instant basis for Spot ETH ETFs. This single move changes the trajectory of people\u2019s opinions about the SEC approval, including these Bloomberg analysts.\n\nUpdate: @JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they\u2019d be denied). See\u2026 https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024\n\nHow High Ethereum Price Can Go?\n\nEthereum is still under the bullish sentiments and might continue to surge more. Agreeing with the same, crypto analyst Oliver Isaac said that the Ethereum price charts are forming the biggest daily Ethereum candle of the five years which is almost equal to the entire market cap of Solana (SOL). He further predicted the Ethereum price to hit $10K next.\n\nLargest daily Ethereum candle in 5 years$ETH is up almost the entire mcap of $SOL today If they approve the Ethereum ETF, they are approving the entire industry. ETH to $10,000 next target pic.twitter.com/3KLgjUu7Xe \u2014 Oliver Isaacs (@oliverzok) May 21, 2024\n\nRegardless, the ongoing hype around the Ethereum ETF is supposed to be behind the Ethereum bull run, pushing the value to a $4K mark easily. The Fibonacci level indicates an upsurge in the Ethereum price, where if the trend continues the value can surge up to $4749 by the end of the month. Moreover, the Ethereum Spot ETF approval can push this value even harder to $6K.\n\nPooja Khardia With a deep-seated passion for reading and five years of experience in content writing, Pooja is now focused on crafting trending content about cryptocurrency market.

        "title": "ETH Soars Past $3K But Will the Sellers Come Back? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has faced challenges breaking below the critical $3K support region, with a recent bullish rebound driven by heightened demand near this level.\n\nHowever, a substantial resistance region looms ahead, potentially halting the current momentum.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAn analysis of the daily chart shows that Ethereum sellers have been attempting to push the price below the crucial $3K support region, which aligns with the 0.5 ($3133) and 0.618 ($2906) Fibonacci levels.\n\nDespite these efforts, ETH recently experienced a bullish rebound due to significant demand around this key threshold, reaching the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge and the crucial 100-day moving average at $3.2K.\n\nA sudden breach of this critical resistance zone could trigger a surge, with the next target being the $3.4K resistance region. However, the $3.2K resistance region has the potential to halt the upward momentum, as it includes a notable amount of supply. If a bearish rejection occurs, a plummet toward the wedge\u2019s lower boundary becomes imminent.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer look at the 4-hour chart reveals a multi-week range-bound phase, with Ethereum consolidating between the significant support at $2.9K and the critical resistance at $3.2K. Recently, the price saw a notable surge near the $2.9K threshold, retracing towards the wedge\u2019s upper boundary, which corresponds to the $3.2K resistance region.\n\nThis indicates a slight increase in market demand.\n\nIf buyers successfully breach the wedge\u2019s upper trendline at the $3.2K resistance level and the bullish momentum strengthens, a strong bullish trend could emerge in the mid-term. However, if buyers fail to push the price above this threshold, a reversal may occur, leading to the continuation of the current sideways range phase towards the $2.9K support.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s recent sideways consolidation and uncertain price action, investors are closely watching futures market behavior to gauge potential sentiment shifts. The accompanying chart displays the Ethereum Open Interest metric, which measures the number of open perpetual futures contracts across various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHigher values suggest potential market volatility and trend sustainability, while lower values indicate a cooling off in the perpetual markets.\n\nThe chart shows a significant surge in Open Interest following a short period of sideways consolidation, highlighting increased futures market activity and more aggressive long or short positions. Depending on the direction of these positions, this suggests a potential notable price move in the short term. If the funding rates metric also rises, the market could be set for renewed bullish trends in the mid-term. However, heightened volatility may accompany this activity, so traders should exercise caution."

        "title": "Bitcoin Climbs 10%, Ethereum 5%, and Furrever Token Promises 15X Returns: How Will the Market React? - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "New York City, NY, May 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nInvestors are happy with this week as most cryptos surged during this period. Bitcoin climbed by an impressive 10%, and Ethereum followed suit with a 5% increase, signaling a strong bullish sentiment across the market. Amid these gains, Furrever Token has captured significant attention with its promise of up to 15X returns post-launch. As these developments unfold, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation on how the market will react to these exciting prospects.\n\nBitcoin Surged 10% in 7 Days: Optimism Amidst Market Momentum\n\nLast week proved remarkably optimistic for cryptocurrencies after a prolonged period of uncertainty. Despite higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data, US inflation for April was reported lower, offering relief to risk markets previously jittery over fears of additional Fed interest rate hikes. Now, attention turns to upcoming data releases, particularly on employment and other economic indicators, until the June 12 meeting.\n\nLabor market figures are weakening, while the latest wage growth data has been supportive for risk markets. Overall, with inflation figures gradually softening over the past few months, the likelihood of further Fed tightening and prolonged peak interest rates diminishes.\n\nOn the front of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this week's data has been supportive for Bitcoin. We're now seeing inflows rather than outflows in the GBTC space, pushing ETF total value above $12.4 billion. If we witness renewed inflows in IBIT and FBTC spaces totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, it could signal a more impressive resurgence akin to the rapid ascent witnessed until mid-March.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 5% Surge Caught Attention: Thrilling Market Outlook and Potential Catalysts\n\nEthereum (ETH) is presently valued at approximately $3,098.41, showing a slight decrease of 1.2% from yesterday while experiencing a notable increase of over 5% from the previous week. Despite Ethereum's recent performance, it has trailed behind Bitcoin throughout 2024, indicated by the ETH/BTC ratio hitting a three-year low of 0.044. However, following Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake (the Merge), its correlation with Bitcoin has witnessed a decline of 45%, diminishing the probability of the much-awaited \"flippening.\"\n\nNevertheless, despite encountering hurdles, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests Ethereum is primed for an upward trajectory, particularly amidst adverse market conditions. Coinbase shares this positive outlook, emphasizing Ethereum's minimal supply-side pressures and the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Regulatory clarity, especially regarding the SEC's decision on the ETF, holds significant importance. While initial rejection is plausible, Coinbase contends that legal action could potentially reverse it.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would signify a milestone, likely attracting increased institutional interest and investment in Ethereum, potentially elevating its price. The current ETH/BTC ratio, at a three-year low, indicates potential for growth should Ethereum narrow the gap with Bitcoin. Overall, market sentiment displays cautious optimism, with analysts anticipating Ethereum's resilience, particularly amidst potential regulatory advancements.\n\nFurrever Token Sparks Excitement in the Crypto Industry\n\nIn the midst of the recent market upswings observed in prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, a fresh contender has entered the scene, drawing attention from the crypto community due to its distinctive allure and auspicious prospects. Furrever Token, characterized by its endearing feline-themed identity and intuitive interface, has swiftly garnered enthusiasm and intrigue among both investors and enthusiasts.\n\nFurrever Token stands out in the crowded crypto space by offering a whimsical and heart-warming experience that goes beyond traditional use cases. Its mission to integrate cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals into its ecosystem has resonated with a broad audience, making crypto engaging and fun. This light-hearted approach, combined with strong fundamentals, has helped Furrever Token carve out a niche in the market.\n\nThe tokenomics of Furrever Token are strategically designed to ensure growth and stability. With a total supply of 9 billion tokens, 65% allocated for presale, 25% for DEX allocation, and 10% for team allocation (locked for a year), the project demonstrates a commitment to security and longevity. The recent presale success, raising over $1.1 million and nearing the final stages, highlights the growing investor confidence.\n\nAdding to the excitement is Furrever Token's promise of up to 15X returns, a compelling proposition for those looking to capitalize on new opportunities. The ongoing $20,000 Highest Total Buys Competition further incentivizes participation, fostering a vibrant and engaged community. This competition ends on 27/05/24 at 12:00 UTC, giving investors a limited time to join the race for significant rewards.\n\nWith its current price at $0.000648 and exclusive availability on its official website, furrevertoken.com, Furrever Token is poised to make a significant impact. As the crypto industry buzzes with anticipation, all eyes are on how this charming newcomer will perform in the dynamic market landscape.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nJoin $20,000 Furrever Token Giveaway\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "ETH was up by more than 6% over the last seven days.\n\nA few of the metrics suggested that the bullish momentum might not last.\n\nEthereum [ETH] caught investors off guard as its price gained bullish momentum on the 17th of May.\n\nWhile the token\u2019s price moved up, it broke above a bullish pattern that could allow the king of altcoins to touch $4k in the coming days or weeks.\n\nEthereum eyes $4k again\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH investors enjoyed profits last week, as the token\u2019s price had surged by more than 6%.\n\nThings heated up in the last few hours as ETH\u2019s value increased by over 2.6% over the last day. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion.\n\nThe bullish price action had a positive impact on the token\u2019s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week.\n\nIts Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market.\n\nThanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k.\n\nWorld Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern.\n\nThe pattern appeared on ETH\u2019s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it.\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again.\n\nWhat to expect in the short term?\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days\u2019 average, signifying less selling pressure.\n\nAnother positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital\u2019s data. We found that ETH\u2019s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone.\n\nA successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k. However, if ETH\u2019s price turns bearish, then its value might plummet to $2.85k."

        "content": "Coinbase analysts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, citing strong demand drivers and unique scaling advantages despite current underperformance.\n\nThey believe Ethereum maintains key strengths such as its Solidity community, EVM platform use, and crucial role in DeFi, supporting a strong case for the approval of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nDespite challenges, the potential for regulatory and market acceptance of ETH ETFs remains high, with a 30-40% chance of approval noted amidst growing political attention to crypto.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, Coinbase analysts hold a positive view toward the second largest crypto. They anticipate ETH could surprise investors with a better-than-expected performance later in the cycle.\n\nDavid Han, research analyst for Coinbase Institutional, wrote that they \u201cbelieve that Ethereum has some of the strongest persistent demand drivers in crypto, and retains unique advantages to its scaling roadmap\u201d.\n\nRelated: Analyst Who Sold All His Bitcoin Says He Hasn\u2019t Lost Faith In BTC, Makes Bold Bet On Altcoins\n\nHan added that ETH can draw from its historical trading patterns, which indicate its dual benefit as both a \u201cstore-of-value\u201d and a \u201ctechnology-token\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Solana being a potential threat to Ethereum and the potential for a Spot ETH ETF rejection in May, Coinbase still believes in the long-term outlook of the network.\n\nWe continue to believe that Ethereum\u2019s long-term positioning remains strong and that it has important advantages that meaningfully distinguish it from other smart contract networks. David Han, Coinbase David Han, Coinbase\n\nHan adds that the strengths of Ethereum include the well-established Solidity developer community, widespread adoption of its EVM platform, the role of ETH as crucial DeFi collateral, and the robust decentralisation and security of its mainnet.\n\nAdditionally, upcoming advancements in tokenisation are expected to benefit ETH more than other Layer 1 blockchains in the near term.\n\n30-40% Chance of Approval, Says Analyst\n\nHan further believes that the approval of spot ETH ETFs is likely due to their potential to offer regulatory clarity and access to new capital, similar to previously approved BTC ETFs.\n\nThese ETFs would allow ETH to access the same capital pools as BTC, significantly benefiting its market position. The rationale behind the BTC ETF approvals, based on the correlation between CME futures and spot rates, is applicable to ETH as well, supporting a strong case for approval, the analyst wrote.\n\nWe believe the odds of approval are close to 30-40%. As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it\u2019s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial. David Han, Coinbase David Han, Coinbase\n\nDespite uncertainties, such as the SEC\u2019s current non-committal stance and the unique challenges posed by Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake mechanism, Han remains optimistic. Market indicators and political dynamics could sway the SEC towards approval, with potential reversals of initial rejections through litigation also likely, he concluded.\n\nMatt Hougan: Bitcoin ETFs Opened Doors for Crypto\n\nBitwise Asset Management\u2019s Matt Hougan agrees with that analysis, saying the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for crypto ETFs. Hougan told CNBC that the United States\u2019 outdated securities laws don\u2019t fit with the digital asset world \u2013 but in the end what everyone wants is a \u201csafe, secure platform where investors are protected, and innovation is protected\u201d.\n\nHougan added:\n\nWe\u2019ve entered the ETF era for crypto. We\u2019ve seen the Bitcoin ETFs come to market. We\u2019ve seen the great things they\u2019ve done for investors: lowering costs, improving regulation, improving sort of safety, security and peace of mind. I think we will get there on Ethereum as well.

        "content": "Could Ethereum's rival generate major multibagger gains?\n\nSolana (SOL -1.70%) has minted a lot of millionaires since its launch in 2020. The cryptocurrency started trading at $0.95 and hit its all-time high of $260.06 on Nov. 6, 2021 -- which would have turned a $10,000 investment into $2.74 million.\n\nSolana was widely seen as an alternative to Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) for the development of decentralized apps. Solana's blockchain was faster, more scalable, and had lower transaction costs than Ethereum. It accomplished that by using its unique proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism to accelerate the proof-of-stake (PoS) mining method used by Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a series of network congestion and security failures caused Solana to lose its luster, and rising rates subsequently crushed the cryptocurrency market. To make matters worse, failed crypto exchange FTX hastily liquidated its Solana tokens in several huge auctions to raise more cash to pay off its creditors. As a result, Solana's price dipped below $10 by the end of 2022.\n\nYet Solana bounced back, reaching $163; your original $10,000 investment would still be worth $1.72 million. It was tough for investors to stick with Solana through those wild swings, but it's now the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $71 billion. Could it keep growing and turn a fresh $10,000 investment to $1 million again?\n\nWhat's next for Solana?\n\nSolana's powerful recovery suggests it will remain a formidable rival for Ethereum as a platform for the development of decentralized apps and tokens. Its network has already been used to produce a wide range of meme coins, including notable ones like BONK (BONK 5.68%) and WIF (WIF 2.21%), as well as decentralized exchanges like Jupiter and Orca. The expansion of that ecosystem could make it a fertile environment for more crypto projects.\n\nNew decentralized wallets and financial apps could also help Solana (and Ethereum) disrupt traditional financial institutions. The introduction of Solana Pay, which was integrated into Shopify last year, marked a major step in that direction. Visa also started to run its stablecoin settlement program on Solana, while Circle recently added native Solana support for its EURC stablecoin.\n\nSolana Labs' subsidiary, Solana Mobile, even launched its own Saga smartphone last December. The Android device is still a niche gadget, but it targets Web3 enthusiasts with its integrated digital asset management and Solana blockchain tools.\n\nSolana's rapid expansion is impressive, but Ethereum is scrambling to match Solana's speed and scalability with its own network upgrades. In a recent essay, Ethereum's co-founder and chief architect, Vitalik Buterin, proposed the introduction of \"multidimensional gas fees\" which sound similar to Solana's variable project-by-project user fees across its \"local fee markets.\" If Ethereum closes that gap, it could throttle the long-term growth of Solana's blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow much higher can Solana soar?\n\nSolana seems to have overcome its initial growing pains. It resolved the congestion issues caused by the market's feverish interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021, survived FTX's large liquidations, and still processes transactions faster than Ethereum. Developers are still launching new apps on Solana and promoting their new tokens with airdrops.\n\nHowever, it's tough to tell how much larger Solana's blockchain can grow as long as it's overshadowed by Ethereum's larger network. For now, CoinPedia estimates that Solana's price could hit $500 by the end of the year and $1,672 by 2030.\n\nYou should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they imply that Solana will remain one of the world's top cryptocurrencies as it attracts more developers and becomes more widely adopted for mainstream payments. But even if Solana's price hits $1,672 by 2030, it would only turn a new $10,000 investment into about $100,000.\n\nTherefore, Solana might still have a lot of upside potential -- but it probably won't make you a millionaire by the end of the decade. It could also easily be cut in half before it generates bigger gains, so investors should brace for a lot of volatility."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket indicators hinted that Ethereum\u2019s bull rally might resume soon.\n\nEthereum [ETH] successfully broke above a bullish falling wedge pattern a few days ago. Since then, the king of altcoins has been on track and has earned investors profit.\n\nIf the trend lasts, then ETH has a long way to go.\n\nEthereum bulls are slowing down\n\nWorld Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting how ETH managed to break out of a falling wedge pattern.\n\nThe token\u2019s price has consolidated inside the pattern since March and finally broke out a few days ago. Since then, ETH seemed to be on the right track, as its price increased by almost 5%.\n\nHowever, this gain could just be the beginning, as the breakout has the potential to push ETH\u2019s price by 45%. However, the last few hours showcased less volatility, which somewhat paused ETH\u2019s gaining spree.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,131.77 with a market capitalization of over $376 billion.\n\nTo see whether this sluggish 24-hour price action could lead to a price correction, AMBCrypto checked Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days\u2019 average.\n\nThis meant that selling pressure on ETH was low. Additionally, both its Transfer Volume and Active Addresses remained high, which was an optimistic sign.\n\nTroubles still persist for Ethereum\n\nThough the aforementioned metrics looked promising, a few of the others raised concerns. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s NVT ratio had increased sharply over the last few days.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the NVT ratio is computed by dividing the market cap by the transferred on-chain volume, measured in USD.\n\nA rise in the metric meant that ETH was overvalued, which indicated a possible price correction soon.\n\nApart from this, another key indicator looked bearish. Ethereum\u2019s fear and greed index had a value of 83% at press time, meaning that the market was in an \u201cextreme fear\u201d phase.\n\nWhenever the metric hits such levels, it suggests that an asset\u2019s price has high chances of dropping.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto planned to check ETH\u2019s daily chart to better understand whether a price correction was around the corner.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Additionally, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick from the neutral mark. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar trend.\n\nThese indicated that the chances of a major price correction were slim."

        "content": "As Ethereum and Polkadot face market struggles, BlockDAG is currently a standout in cryptocurrency, thanks to its cutting-edge dashboard features and articulated roadmap. This approach has successfully captivated investors, culminating in a substantial $28.3 million in presale.\n\nThe platform\u2019s innovative dashboard, which includes features like current rankings and a leaderboard, provides critical insights and encourages competitive interaction among users. In contrast, Ethereum faces uncertain price predictions, and Polkadot continues to develop its smart contract capabilities. These elements position BlockDAG as a premier Layer 1 cryptocurrency with significant return potential.\n\nEthereum Faces Price Instability Amid Market Trends\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $2,904, marking a slight decline over the past day. Ethereum remains trapped within a bearish pattern despite some bullish attempts, potentially indicating further drops. From a recent high of $4,000 in March, Ethereum has fallen by 31%, with the price stabilizing around $2,870\u2014a critical support level now contested by bulls and bears.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum remains uncertain as both the 50-day exponential moving average and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appear to lean toward a bearish sentiment. A break below $2,870 could depress prices to $2,800 or even $2,200, making it crucial for investors to watch these levels closely.\n\nPolkadot Advances with New Smart Contracts\n\nPolkadot is enhancing its blockchain framework by integrating smart contracts through the ink! language, which facilitates the creation of robust, DOT-compatible applications. This move is set to tackle one of Polkadot\u2019s significant limitations and drive its platform forward. With the Pop Network\u2019s solution already operational on the Paseo testnet, Polkadot is preparing for its next development phase, including features to improve network efficiency and scalability.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Dashboard and Roadmap Accelerate Market Impact\n\nBlockDAG's updated dashboard provides many features that enhance user interaction and offer valuable insights. Users can view their current ranking and the necessary purchases to advance, fostering a competitive spirit through a leaderboard that showcases top investors. Additional tools like transaction previews, referral tracking, and detailed personal profiles simplify investment tracking and enhance user engagement.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG's ambitious roadmap is meticulously laid out in four distinct phases: initial development, expansion through strategic partnerships, the launch sequence, and finally, the closing of the presale leading to the mainnet launch. A key highlight of this roadmap is the X1 Miner app, designed to be user-friendly with functionalities such as a wallet, send/receive options, and a performance leaderboard. The app is geared towards easing the mining process and enhancing community involvement with dedicated sections for user interaction and streamlined onboarding.\n\nThese enhancements to the dashboard and roadmap have greatly appealed to investors, propelling the presale quickly through its phases. In Batch 13, priced at $0.008, the presale has successfully raised $28.3 million, demonstrating strong investor trust and the potential for significant returns.\n\nBlockDAG Sets a High Standard in the Crypto Market\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles with price volatility and Polkadot develops its smart contract infrastructure, BlockDAG is making significant strides with its innovative dashboard and comprehensive roadmap. These developments not only boost user engagement but also enhance BlockDAG's investment appeal, positioning it above established players like Ethereum and Polkadot. With a robust $28.3 million presale and over 9.2 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG offers a promising investment opportunity in the blockchain space, poised for substantial future growth.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Now!\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant surge as prices skyrocket, fueled by the anticipation of a potential game-changing regulatory approval. Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has seen a remarkable gain of more than 6%, driven by reports that the SEC is poised to legalize spot ETH ETFs. This development has investors and enthusiasts buzzing with excitement and speculation.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur. ETFs provide investors with a diversified portfolio of assets, which can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market-determined prices.\n\nWhat is a Spot ETH ETF?\n\nA spot ETH ETF would be a fund that directly holds Ethereum as its underlying asset, rather than derivatives or futures contracts. This means that the ETF would track the actual price of Ethereum, providing investors with direct exposure to the cryptocurrency's performance. Such a product would offer a more straightforward and potentially safer way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to manage the complexities of owning and storing the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nBreaking News: SEC to Approve ETH ETF?\n\nThe buzz around a potential SEC approval stems from recent actions by the regulatory body, which has requested exchanges to update their 19B-4 filings on an accelerated basis for a spot Ethereum ETF. Form 19B-4 is a filing that exchanges must submit to propose new rules or rule changes, including the listing of new financial products like ETFs. The accelerated review process indicates that the SEC is prioritizing the consideration of these proposals, suggesting that approval could be imminent."

        "content": "2024 started with an incredible upswing for crypto tokens, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), creating enthusiasm among digital asset users.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s anticipated Bull Run is not going as expected. As of August 31, 2024, BTC price is currently trading at $58,872.26, representing a 1.16% decrease in the last 24 hours, down 2.89% in the last 7 days, and an 11.59% decrease in the last 30 days. It is currently trading below the $63,500 support level, which it had held in the past few days.\n\nThe current decline can be attributed to macroeconomic pressure and reduced activity of the Bitcoin network. The US home price increase outpacing inflation and wages is adding pressure to the economy ahead of the election season.\n\nDeclining Bitcoin network usage due to a decreased investor interest is also another cause of the current BTC price plunge. In the last two months, the number of BTC active addresses has reduced to their lowest levels, signaling decreased retail activity. Although institutional investors and whales could be on the buying spree, data shows that there is a decreasing adoption by the broader audience.\n\nWhy Rajagopal Feels Optimistic\n\nCrypto enthusiasts are questioning how much further Bitcoin value might drop if it fails to find its $61,000 support levels. Cryptocurrency experts believe that if BTC maintains the $45,000 level and above, it could surge to $60,000 by the end of the year.\n\nRajagopal Menon, the vice president of India-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, believes that, amid current consolidation, Bitcoin is eyeing a breakout. Bitcoin eyes to rise past the $60,000 mark, before it enters the \u201cparabolic phase\u201d of another bull cycle, potentially pushing towards the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. According to Rajagopal, if Bitcoin successfully breaks out from this level in the next few weeks, the flagship cryptocurrency could propel its way to $90k-100k. The $90,000 threshold is a significant milestone, as it is logical for BTC to pause around 90k, potentially surging above the level but hovering below 100k.\n\nDespite Bitcoin losing its steam to soar to greater heights, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered bot, recently stated some factors that could propel the token to experience another bullish trend by the end of the year.\n\nRegulatory developments and market sentient\n\nIn March, Bitcoin experienced a massive price rise due to its tremendous demand. The recent Bitcoin halving and approval of BTC ETFs led to increased optimism that the 2024 bull run would be remarkable and could eventually trigger the crypto to surge to the $100,000 target.\n\nWhile Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $74,000 in March, it experienced a price decline in May and early June and consequently dropped under $50,000 in early August.\n\nAccording to Perplexity AI, Bitcoin could overcome the current slowdown on the condition that overall investor confidence and market sentiment improve.\n\nOn the other hand, Perplexity AI admitted that global regulators have continued to bring in tighter oversight of crypto assets across the world. The AI bot is optimistic that things could change after the upcoming US elections, especially if a pro-crypto candidate enters the White House.\n\nAdoption and the Global Economy\n\nPerplexity AI also believes that continued growth in Bitcoin adoption for transaction purposes and its integration into financial services and products could create a robust foundation for a bullish trend.\n\nLastly, the AI chart acknowledged that macroeconomic conditions, like interest rates and inflation, have historically affected the entire cryptocurrency market. The AI bot believes that a favorable economic condition could trigger an increased interest in alternative investments, like Bitcoin, to experience another bull run."
