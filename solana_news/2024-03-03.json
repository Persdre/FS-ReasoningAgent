        "content": "Discover how Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade could enhance security and reduce transaction fees.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network is set to receive a major update named \u201cDencun,\u201d a blend of two smaller upgrades, Cancun and Deneb. The upgrade is expected to significantly reduce layer 2 (L2) transaction fees and enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and security.\n\nThe Ethereum upgrade date is scheduled for March 13, with a Feb. 27 entry on the Ethereum Foundation Blog announcing that it has been successfully activated on all test networks, including Goerli, Sepolia, and Hole\u0161ky.\n\nquick notes from the eth dev call this morning, acdc #128:\n\ndencun \ud83d\udc21\n\n\u2013 all client teams, except lodestar, have released final software versions for the dencun upgrade\n\n\u2013 these versions plus the dencun-ready candidate client for lodestar are currently being tested on one last\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) February 22, 2024\n\nSo, what is the Ethereum Dencun upgrade? Read on to find out why it is causing so much excitement among the Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey and its next big step\n\nIn December 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, which brought in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and allowed for ETH to be staked\u2014this was essential for moving Ethereum away from the older proof-of-work (PoW) consensus method.\n\nBy September 2022, Ethereum had made a big move called \u201cThe Merge,\u201d linking its main network with the Beacon Chain and switching completely to proof-of-stake. In April 2023, the Shanghai upgrade allowed users to withdraw staked ETH, making it easier for validators (people who help verify transactions) to manage their stakes.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2023, Ethereum launched a new testing network called Hole\u0161ky, which supports 1.4 million validators and is a foundational step for the ETH Dencun upgrade.\n\nMany have asked what is the main goal of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. Looking back, the earlier Ethereum network upgrades were more about laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and secure Ethereum rather than directly tackling the issue of scalability.\n\nThe Merge was about moving to a greener and more efficient system of verifying transactions, and the Shanghai upgrade improved how people can stake their ETH. The ETH Dencun update, a fusion of two pivotal enhancements, is seen by many as the culmination of the journey started by previous upgrades to turn Ethereum into a faster, more secure, and more scalable network.\n\nThe first part of the upgrade, Cancun, focuses on the \u201cexecution layer\u201d\u2014how transactions are processed and managed. The second part, Deneb, tackles improvements in the \u201cconsensus layer,\u201d which is all about how network participants agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nEnhancements for a better Ethereum\n\nThe Dencun upgrade brings several technical improvements to solidify Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. For instance, it introduces techniques for more streamlined data management and smarter contract security, along with tweaks that promise to make Ethereum run smoothly and cost-effectively for its users.\n\nIt also aims to improve the experience for those who stake ETH, making it easier and more beneficial for users to participate in the network\u2019s security.\n\nProto-danksharding\n\nAmong Dencun\u2019s spotlight features is proto-danksharding, which was introduced through a specific Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) known as EIP-4844. In simpler terms, this feature is about making Ethereum more scalable by efficiently managing large chunks of data.\n\nIt employs a method that temporarily holds transaction data, making the process smoother and cheaper.\n\nTraditionally, all transaction data is kept on the blockchain permanently. However, this new approach introduces a way to include large chunks of data (blobs) in transactions without storing them forever.\n\nIts proponents claim it will make processing transactions faster and cheaper, especially for rollups. Rollups bunch several transactions into one, reducing the workload and cost (gas) of recording them on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile rollups are already a step forward in managing transactions more efficiently, they still leave room for improvement. Until now, the data collected by rollups had to be stored permanently on the blockchain, taking up space and potentially slowing things down.\n\nProto-danksharding proposes a way for this data to be temporarily stored and removed after a specific time. It is done by creating a summary (or commitment) of the data, which ensures that even after the detailed data is deleted, the integrity of the transactions is not compromised.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this approach means that only temporary storage of data is necessary, significantly reducing the clutter and maintaining the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network. This temporary storage could last a few months before the data is deleted to prevent an overload of unnecessary information.\n\nImproved security and performance\n\nThe most recent update to Ethereum introduces several EIPs aimed at making the network more secure and efficient.\n\nA standout feature is EIP-4788, which enhances how information travels within Ethereum, particularly improving the connection between its execution and consensus layers. In the past, these layers worked together as separate entities, ensuring that for every block of data in one layer, there was a corresponding block in the other.\n\nHowever, getting these layers to talk to each other could be quite complicated, sometimes even needing extra help from external services.\n\nWith the new upgrade, this process gets simpler by incorporating a summary from the consensus layer directly into the execution layer\u2019s current block of data. This summary acts like a bridge, allowing direct access to the consensus layer\u2019s information without needing a middleman, making the system more trustworthy.\n\nFurthermore, this update supports Ethereum\u2019s apps by keeping a log of these summaries in a smart contract, making it easier to check on the consensus layer\u2019s status.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade driving price upward\n\nImproved staking\n\nDencun is also on a mission to improve the staking experience on Ethereum.\n\nProposals like EIP-7044 and EIP-7045 aim to streamline the process of exiting and making attestations, making it more user-friendly. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown:\n\nEIP-7044 is expected to simplify earning rewards from Ethereum for those who prefer not to be full validators. Since Ethereum transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, individuals can earn rewards by staking 32 ETH. However, those who are not interested in managing the technical aspects of being a validator can opt for delegated staking. With delegated staking, they stake their ETH through a third party while retaining control over their assets. Previously, stopping staking with a specific validator required a pre-signed exit message, which relied on trust. EIP-7044 aims to make these exit messages permanent, providing more security and peace of mind.\n\nMeanwhile, EIP-7045 seeks to improve the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. For a block to be considered official, it needs validations or attestations from validators. Currently, validators have a limited time window to submit these attestations. However, EIP-7045 proposes to extend this period significantly. This change would allow more validators to earn rewards and, importantly, speed up the confirmation of blocks on the blockchain.\n\nEnhanced cost efficiency\n\nThe forthcoming update will also introduce significant cost-efficiency improvements, particularly those highlighted by innovations such as EIP-5656 and EIP-1153.\n\nThese changes focus on streamlining smart contract functionality and enhancing temporary storage techniques. Specifically, EIP-5656 introduces an operation code, or opcode, called MCOPY, aimed at boosting the efficiency of memory copying within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThis opcode simplifies the process by replacing the previously cumbersome method involving MSTORE and MLOAD opcodes, offering a more streamlined and effective approach.\n\nFurther addressing efficiency, EIP-6780 targets the controversial SELFDESTRUCT opcode. While widely used in numerous smart contracts, its problematic nature has caught the community\u2019s attention.\n\nThrough EIP-6780, the goal isn\u2019t to remove SELFDESTRUCT entirely\u2014which would impact existing contracts\u2014but to render it obsolete for future applications, effectively sidelining it without direct elimination.\n\nThese improvements are all about making Ethereum staking more flexible, secure, and efficient for everyone involved.\n\nSimplifying Ethereum\u2019s growth\n\nAnother proposal in the next Ethereum upgrade is EIP-7514, and it\u2019s all about managing how many new validators can join Ethereum at once. Too many validators joining too fast could cause problems, like making some tasks harder or leading to too much control being in the hands of a few big players.\n\nNext up, we continued a conversation from last week's ACDC call, about whether to add a constant cap to the validator activation queue. The proposal had since then been formalized as EIP-7514: https://t.co/sd4D4GlMRY \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 14, 2023\n\nEIP-7514 plans to limit how many new validators can start in each epoch (a set period in the Ethereum network) to 8. This change aims to make the growth of validators more steady instead of jumping up fast. It\u2019s like inviting only a certain number of people to a party to make sure it doesn\u2019t get too crowded.\n\nAnother important part of this proposal is that it treats joining and leaving differently. More specifically, the limit only applies to new validators joining, not those wanting to leave.\n\nWhile it might seem like a small tweak, it\u2019s an important step to keep Ethereum running smoothly and ensure it\u2019s ready for future changes and growth. By doing this, Ethereum hopes to maintain its security and decentralization, ensuring no single group has too much power and keeping the network accessible and fair for all users.\n\nA cautious yet optimistic outlook\n\nWhile the Dencun upgrade offers promising prospects for enhancing Ethereum, developers are proceeding with caution. Introducing new consensus mechanisms and architectural changes could bring unforeseen complexities and operational hurdles.\n\nAdditionally, network upgrades inherently involve uncertainty, as unexpected technical issues may temporarily affect user experience and network stability. Concerns include potential challenges related to storage capacity and data management with the introduction of larger data blocks.\n\nTo fully embrace this transformative upgrade, stakeholders must exercise prudence and conduct thorough due diligence.\n\nNevertheless, the anticipation surrounding the next Ethereum upgrade underscores a strong belief in its benefits, reaffirming the network\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement."

        "title": "How to Buy Ethereum and Best Exchange Ratings - CoinCentral",
        "content": "Ethereum (Ether) launched in mid-2015 but quickly surpassed the market cap of all other cryptocurrencies\u2014except for Bitcoin. At the start of 2017, the price of 1 ETH was less than $10. Since this time, the price at one point reached more than 40 times its 2017 starting price.\n\nThis incredible growth in price, combined with a wider understanding of Ethereum\u2019s potential, has many new investors looking to buy Ethereum.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ethereum is to use an online cryptocurrency exchange. As cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity over the last few years, there\u2019s been no shortage of new businesses looking to facilitate exchanging them.\n\nWith so many choices to choose from, our goal is to help you find the exchange that\u2019s right for you. This guide will detail the differences between exchanges while linking to complete reviews and user guides of each exchange mentioned. While all of these cryptocurrency exchanges do the same thing (facilitate buying and selling cryptocurrencies), they operate differently. To make things easier to understand, we\u2019ve outlined 3 groups of exchanges:\n\nGroup A: Fiat to Crypto Onramps\n\nThis first group of exchanges allows users to trade fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) and cryptocurrencies on an open market. These sites function similarly to traditional forex and stock exchanges, allowing users to make limit, market, stop, and even margin trades.\n\nTypically, these sites have limited deposit and withdrawal methods for fiat currencies, most commonly offering bank wires and bank transfers.\n\nWhile these sites can be complicated for new users, they typically have the lowest fees of any group.\n\nExchanges in Group A include Gemini, Kraken, GDAX, & CEX.IO (CEX.IO also offers Group B offerings).\n\nGroup B: Ease of Use\n\nThe second group of exchanges operate more like \u201conline cryptocurrency retail stores\u201d. Rather than have their users make trades on a market, they directly facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency with their users. This creates a more beginner-friendly process than group A exchanges.\n\nThese exchanges also typically allow users to make purchases with debit and credit cards, in addition to bank wires/transfers.\n\nWhile these sites are typically thought of as the easiest ways for beginners to buy and sell Ethereum, they charge higher fees than Group A exchanges.\n\nExchanges in Group B include Coinbase, CEX.IO, and Coinmama.\n\nGroup C: Best for Trading\n\nThe last group of exchanges work similarly to Group A exchanges but only offer cryptocurrency trading. This means on these exchanges, you can only trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies. This group does not offer the ability to buy or sell cryptocurrencies with fiat currency.\n\n3 Beginner Friendly Methods for Buying Ethereum\n\nNumerous startups looking to help customers buy and sell cryptocurrencies have sprouted in response to the increased demand for cryptocurrencies. With so many options to choose from, here are 3 of the most widely recommended and trusted beginner-friendly places to buy Ether.\n\n1) Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is our top recommendation for beginners looking to purchase Ether. Coinbase offers functions that serve as training wheels for newcomers.\n\nWith its initial launch in 2012, Coinbase aimed to create an easier way to buy and sell Bitcoin. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase directly facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrency to its users. Their site comes with a variety of advantages over other exchanges:\n\nYour guaranteed price and fees are clearly stated at the time of your order. This means no dealing with complicated market interfaces.\n\nat the time of your order. This means no dealing with complicated market interfaces. You can lock in prices for your first order faster on Coinbase than on most exchanges. Coinbase locks in your price when you initiate an order, rather than waiting for deposits to clear. You will receive the amount of cryptocurrency you purchased, at the set order price, after your deposit has cleared.\n\non Coinbase than on most exchanges. Coinbase locks in your price when you initiate an order, rather than waiting for deposits to clear. You will receive the amount of cryptocurrency you purchased, at the set order price, after your deposit has cleared. You can use credit and debit cards for instant Coinbase purchases, although your limits will be substantially lower than if using a bank transfer.\n\nSensing an increase in demand for Ether, Coinbase added Ethereum support in 2016. Their Ethereum services now come with the same benefits as their original Bitcoin service.\n\nWhile we recommend storing cryptocurrency in a wallet that you have full control over, Coinbase does offer one of the most secure online wallets. You can use your Coinbase wallet to store, send, and receive Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to being easy to use, Coinbase is also one of the most trusted names in cryptocurrency. The company is based out of San Francisco, California and has received numerous investments from big-name venture capitalists, and is notably valued at $1.6 billion. As a U.S.-based digital asset exchange, the company is also compliant with all required laws and regulations. Coinbase has helped over 11 million users in 32 countries exchange more than $20 billion in digital currency.\n\nYou can sign up for Coinbase or learn more in our complete Coinbase Review and User Guide.\n\n2) Gemini\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss founded Gemini in 2015. The company is based out of New York, thus regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Despite being around for less time than some competitors, they\u2019ve quickly built a great reputation.\n\nUnlike Coinbase, Gemini operates as a more \u2018traditional\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange. This means that users can use the website to trade with other users on their market. The site functions like a traditional stock or Forex platform.\n\nGemini users can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USD. Deposits and withdrawals are unfortunately only available via bank transfer and bank wire. However, the site does allow you to begin trading while your deposits are still processing. This gives users the ability to lock in purchase prices faster than almost all other traditional exchanges. Gemini also still comes with the very low fees associated with \u201cGroup A exchanges\u201d.\n\nWhile we do think Gemini is slightly less beginner friendly than Coinbase, their team has done a phenomenal job designing an interface that\u2019s easy to use.\n\nYou can learn more by reading our Gemini review or you can sign up for Gemini here.\n\nCEX.IO\n\nBased out of London, CEX.IO represents another long-trusted method of buying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company was initially started in 2013 as both a Bitcoin exchange and cloud mining service provider. In 2016, the company added Ethereum to its platform and ended its cloud mining service. They\u2019ve also recently added Dash and Zcash to their platform.\n\nCEX.IO offers both a full exchange, as well as easy buy/sell methods. The site accepts deposits and withdrawals with credit cards and bank transfers. They also give verified members higher credit card limits than Coinbase.\n\nThe downside to CEX.IO, compared to Coinbase, is its potential higher fees. Still, CEX.IO is a good option for users wanting to make large purchases with credit cards, or users in locations not supported by Coinbase.\n\nYou can learn more in our CEX.IO review or sign up there now.\n\nMore Exchanges\n\nFor the vast majority of you reading this, one of the above three exchanges is most likely your best option for buying Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase \u2013 Most widely trusted and easiest-to-use exchange.\n\n\u2013 Most widely trusted and easiest-to-use exchange. Gemini \u2013 Very low fees, while still being relatively beginner-friendly.\n\n\u2013 Very low fees, while still being relatively beginner-friendly. CEX.IO \u2013 Very high credit card purchasing limits compared to alternatives.\n\nWith that said, we realize everyone has different needs, so here are more of our recommended options.\n\nCoinmama\n\nCoinmama is another option for those of you looking to buy large amounts of ether with credit cards. The Slovakian exchange allows users to purchase both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nUnlike Coinbase and CEX.IO, Coinmama does not offer a wallet service, meaning you will have to provide an Ethereum address from a separate wallet where your Ether can be sent. For this reason, we view it as a less beginner-friendly option than these competitors.\n\nLike CEX.IO, which also offers high credit card purchase limits, Coinmama has rather high fees. You can compare credit card fees between exchanges in the credit card section below.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken is another exchange option for those looking to trade fiat currencies for Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies. Like Gemini and Coinbase, they allow users to make fiat deposits through bank transfers and wires. The site also offers far more altcoins to trade than these two competitors. Still, we suggest choosing between Kraken and Poloniex as these are the best options.\n\nWhile Kraken does not offer as many cryptocurrencies to trade as Bittrex, they do offer to trade for the following cryptocurrencies:\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Zcash, Dash, Ethereum Classic, Gnosis, Iconomi, Melon, EOS, Augur, Tether, Dogecoin, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash\n\nEstablished in 2011, the company has built a solid reputation in the cryptocurrency community over the years. They do however seem to have more complaints about slow customer support than most of their competitors. Another common complaint is their poor user interface.\n\nBuy Ethereum with a Credit Card\n\nMany cryptocurrency newcomers hope to use a credit card to make their first purchase. Unfortunately, very few exchanges accept credit cards. For the ones that do, credit cards open the door for fraudulent purchases, chargebacks, and high fees.\n\nThere are, however, a few good cryptocurrency exchanges accepting credit cards. You can compare them in the table below and learn more about each site by clicking their respective review.\n\n*CEX.IO fee estimates are for \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d FOK orders. Fees are lower when trading on their exchange.\n\nEthereum Buyer\u2019s Guide FAQ\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough time to answer every individual question readers have when it comes time to make their first Ether purchase. However, we have answered many of the most common questions asked by Ethereum newcomers below.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Ethereum and Ether?\n\nEther is the currency of the Ethereum network. While technically, the currency is not called Ethereum, the term is often used interchangeably to describe both the network and the currency. For this reason and to not confuse any readers, we too use the term \u201cEthereum\u201d interchangeably.\n\nFor a better understanding, you may want to read our Beginners\u2019 Guide to Ethereum.\n\nDo I have to Buy an Entire Ether?\n\nNo! Ether is divisible to 18 decimal places. While no exchange will allow you to purchase .000000000000000001 Ether (worth a fraction of a US cent), most will allow you to deposit as little as $10.\n\nHow Does CoinCentral Rate Exchanges?\n\nWhen rating and reviewing exchanges, our goal is to answer the most common questions cryptocurrency traders have about exchanges. This leads us to primarily focus on the following factors:\n\nBeginner Friendliness\n\nCustomer Support\n\nCommunity Sentiment\n\nFees\n\nDeposit and Withdrawal Methods\n\nAvailable Cryptocurrencies\n\nIt\u2019s important that our readers understand the final rating number is a combination of all 6 of these factors. For example, while Coinbase may be higher rated than Kraken, that does not mean it\u2019s the better exchange for YOU. The point is, to get the most out of our reviews, you should actually read them so that you can make an informed decision.\n\nWhile our reviewers do their best to research and speak to facts, it would be impossible to say that exposure and familiarity bias does not play at least some part in our selection.\n\nHow Should I Store My Ether?\n\nIt\u2019s typically not recommended that you store large amounts of any cryptocurrency on an exchange long-term. There are two main reasons for this.\n\nWhenever a cryptocurrency wallet or exchange account is hosted online, it creates an opportunity for hackers to breach the account. You should always make sure to use secure password and enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). Note that SMS text 2FA is typically not recommended. Instead, apps like Google Authenticator and Authy are thought to be far more secure. Most online exchanges are controlled by central authorities (businesses). These businesses control your cryptocurrency wallets, as you do not have access to your wallet\u2019s keys. For this reason, it\u2019s recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet that you have full control over.\n\nYou can learn more in our Ethereum Wallet Guide.\n\nShould I Buy / Is it Too Late to Invest in Ethereum?\n\nAs with any investment, you should do your own research and not invest an amount you couldn\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nWhere Can I Buy Other Cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhile all of the above exchanges can be used to buy various other cryptocurrencies, we\u2019ve created specific guides for the following coins:"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nThe recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked a resurgence in the crypto market, attracting a wave of new investors and igniting a surge in trading activity. This positive momentum has created a ripple effect of optimism that transcends Bitcoin alone. Now, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gears up to decide on a potential spot in Ethereum ETF in May, anticipation is running high for another major milestone in the crypto space.If Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market is undeniable, Ethereum's unique functionalities and growing ecosystem make it a force to be reckoned with. The Ethereum blockchain and its native currency, Ether (ETH), serve as the backbone for a vast array of decentralized applications and innovative projects. From smart contracts to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum's ecosystem continues to drive unprecedented levels of use cases and activities.ETH has already demonstrated strong performance with a 33% gain year-to-date. This rally is fueled by a combination of factors, including Ethereum's shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model, which has made its token supply deflationary. Additionally, the amount of ether locked up in staking pools, DeFi smart contracts and layer-2s is also an important factor. The proportion of ETH held on exchanges has reached an all-time low of 11%, suggesting increased demand and scarcity.The growth of Ethereum's ecosystem, particularly in the DeFi sector and layer 2 scaling solutions, further reinforces the bullish outlook for ether. New layer 2 networks have brought scalability and lower fees to the Ethereum network, driving higher transaction volumes and activity. With further upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's ecosystem is poised for continued expansion and value accrual. To add this, the number of Zk rollups being built on top of Ethereum further bolster its position in the Web3 space.The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs presents a significant opportunity for investors to capitalize on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem while mitigating the complexities associated with direct asset ownership. These investment vehicles offer a regulated and simplified avenue for investors, providing indirect exposure to Ethereum's price movements.Several established financial institutions, including Franklin Templeton, Blackrock, and Fidelity, who already have SEC-approved Bitcoin ETFs, are actively pursuing the launch of an Ethereum ETF in the U.S. These firms see the potential for Ethereum ETFs to do more than simply track the price of Ether; they believe it can facilitate the development of transparent and accessible tokenized financial markets built on the Ethereum network, offering benefits beyond simply attracting investors.The classification of Ethereum as either a commodity or security remains an ongoing discussion. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler's statement regarding the potential categorization of most crypto assets as securities adds complexity to the ETH ETF approval process, it also signifies the ongoing engagement of regulatory bodies in defining a framework for the evolving crypto landscape.India boasts millions of enthusiastic investors who are increasingly convinced about the future of virtual digital assets (VDAs). For Indian investors, although such ETFs are currently unavailable for investment, these developments have nonetheless infused the community with positivity.While the availability of ETFs for crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum remains a future prospect, the recent developments have nevertheless inspired confidence and optimism among Indian investors. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, Indian investors eagerly await opportunities to participate in the growth and innovation of this dynamic sector."

        "title": "What Should the Crypto Market Expect From Ethereum Dencun Upgrade? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks, breaking through the $3,000 mark and showcasing bullish momentum that has captured the attention of investors worldwide. A significant contributing factor to this surge is the eagerly anticipated Ethereum Dencun upgrade, slated for deployment on the mainnet come March 13, 2024. This upgrade, representing a pivotal milestone in Ethereum roadmap, promises to usher in a new era of scalability, efficiency, and security. Let\u2019s delve into what the crypto market can expect from this transformative development.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe anticipated Cancun-Deneb upgrade, or Ethereum Dencun Upgrade, is set for release in March 2024 and aims to improve scalability, efficiency, and security of the Ethereum network through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The term \u201cDencun\u201d signifies progress in the execution layer (EL) and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nadvertisement\n\nFollowing the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals in April 2023, the Dencun upgrade represents a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolutionary journey. It is set to implement nine EIPs, marking the initiation of what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin terms \u201cThe Surge\u201d era. Buterin emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s dedication to alleviating scalability bottlenecks, with a target of surpassing \u201c10,000 transactions per second and beyond\u201d during this phase.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade lays the groundwork for Ethereum to achieve mass scalability through the adoption of layer-two rollups. Notably, proto-danksharding, one of the key EIPs slated for implementation, is expected to drive widespread adoption of rollups by reducing gas fees on Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\nEssentially, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade marks a crucial point in Ethereum\u2019s efforts to improve scalability and efficiency, paving the way for increased usage and improved capabilities in the network.\n\nWhat To Expect from Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect from the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade.\n\n1. Scalability and Efficiency Improvements:\n\nThe Dencun upgrade prioritizes scalability through initiatives such as proto-danksharding. This approach to sharding is aimed at optimizing gas fees and transaction throughput. This progress significantly improves Ethereum\u2019s ability to overcome its scalability issues, enabling it to comfortably manage more transactions and enhance user experience.\n\n2. Layer-2 Rollups Focus:\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade marks a significant change in attention to Layer-2 rollups, as opposed to past upgrades that mainly focused on Layer-1 improvements. Layer-2 rollups are a strategic move towards improving scalability and transaction speed while maintaining Ethereum blockchain security\n\nLayer-2 rollups play a vital role in preparing for Ethereum\u2019s \u201cThe Surge\u201d era, focusing on achieving mass scalability. By processing transactions off-chain, they help alleviate congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and ensure data security and integrity.\n\nLayer-2 rollups have important characteristics such as off-chain processing, which allows transactions to be executed without taking up space on the Ethereum blockchain, and transaction aggregation, which combines several transactions into one compressed form after execution. Subsequently, the compressed transaction data is posted to the Ethereum main chain, ensuring data availability and verifiability for all network participants.\n\nIn a nutshell, the focus on Layer-2 rollups in the Dencun update represents a strategic move towards scalable and efficient transaction processing on Ethereum, while also upholding strong security measures.\n\n3. Impact on DeFi and NFTs:\n\nThe integration of Layer-2 rollups through the Dencun upgrade is expected to have a notable effect on the spheres of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFTs) in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe implementation of Layer-2 rollups boosts Ethereum\u2019s scalability, creating a more effective setting for DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces to function within. By easing congestion and cutting gas fees, rollups quicken transaction processing, thus improving user experience and accessibility of DeFi and NFT platforms.\n\nConsequently, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms could experience advantages from improved efficiency and cost savings, leading to increased involvement and creativity in these areas. In addition, the increased use of layer-2 solutions is predicted to accelerate the arrival of DeFi 2.0, which will have improved scalability, interoperability, and usability.\n\nWith the Dencun upgrade set to launch on March 13, 2024, we expect an increase in the usage of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions for DeFi and NFTs. This adoption is anticipated to continue driving the expansion and progress of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, creating fresh opportunities and applications in different industries.\n\n4. Price Implications:\n\nThe anticipation surrounding the Dencun upgrade has already influenced Ethereum (ETH) Price, with investors eagerly awaiting its implementation. As scalability improves and layer-2 solutions gain traction, ETH prices may experience a bullish trend, potentially reaching new all-time highs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, holding the capacity to redefine the crypto scene. Ethereum is focusing on scalability, efficiency, and security to set the stage for upcoming innovation and adoption. The crypto community is eagerly anticipating the activation of the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet, with all attention focused on Ethereum as it prepares to unlock the potential of decentralized finance and more."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAll good things come at a cost\u2014and in this case, skyrocketing prices across the crypto market have also triggered an equally steep rise in Ethereum gas fees.\n\nOn Ethereum, massive levels of network traffic pushed gas fees beyond 174 gwei by midday Monday according to Etherscan, incurring significant costs for traders attempting to complete various types of transactions within the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nTo give an indication of the severity of the gas fee uptick: The average charge to complete a typical NFT transaction on Ethereum eclipsed $372.29 at certain points on Monday. This means users, even if they were swapping profile pictures (PFPs) among friends for free, would have to pay hundreds of dollars just to see those transactions completed.\n\nSwapping tokens on Ethereum cost almost as much at several points on Monday, upwards of $220 per transaction. Such prohibitively expensive fees potentially eliminate the value of certain crypto transactions, as the costs could eliminate any potential profits from flipping tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBorrowing on Ethereum cost above $186 per transaction at certain points on Monday; attempting to escape such steep prices by bridging funds from Ethereum to another blockchain cost over $70 on average.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the largest gas guzzler in the Ethereum ecosystem has been Uniswap, a protocol for trading fungible ERC-20 tokens. Over $4.2 million worth of ETH has been burned completing transactions on the platform in the last day.\n\nThe uptick in exorbitant on-chain surcharges comes as cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2014as well as on-chain assets like NFTs\u2014are experiencing massive surges in value.\n\nOn Monday morning, ETH hit $3,500 for the first time since the start of 2022. Minutes later, an Ethereum-based CryptoPunks NFT sold for a whopping $16.03 million worth of ETH, the second-highest price ever fetched by a piece in the popular PFP collection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe gas fee surge also comes just days before Ethereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which is set to substantially reduce transaction costs on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks via a novel data storage method called proto-danksharding.\n\nSeveral layer-2 developers recently told Decrypt that they anticipate Dencun will so significantly reduce gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem, that the concept of such charges may soon become obsolete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to enter a world where most users are just not going to experience gas at all,\u201d Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman previously told Decrypt, \u201cand it becomes abstracted away.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is starting the week having inched its way past $3,500, marking a 3% gain since this time yesterday, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is $3,506.38, which means that ETH has gained 15% in the past week. This is the highest Ethereum has been since January 2022, when it was coming down from the late 2021 bull run. And 91% of ETH held in wallets is now in the money. That means all but 9% of ETH has appreciated in value since it was purchased, according to blockchain analytics firm IntotheBlock.\n\nEthereum developers are now only 9 days away from pushing the Dencun upgrade to mainnet on March 13. It's long been said that the upgrade, which will introduce proto-danksharding to the network, will make transactions much faster and cheaper. Last week a handful of devs told Decrypt the change will be striking, adding that this is the kind of upgrade they've been \"dreaming of.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt tends to be the case that when investors are bullish on Ethereum, DeFi projects see a lot more action. That's very much been the case this time around. The total value of assets in DeFi protocols has reached $94 billion as of Monday morning\u2014the highest it's been since TerraUSD crashed in 2022, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nIn super simple terms. the TerraUSD crash and the contagion that followed scared a lot of money out of DeFi protocols. The total value locked in DeFi projects had been $132 billion just before the Terra collapse, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nA quick refresher: The Terra ecosystem was able to grow so large so fast because it promised upwards of 20% returns on deposits. When it suddenly crashed in May 2022, it took lots of other projects and firms with it and made traders wary of protocols that promised sky-high returns.\n\nThat wariness sent the TVL as low as $36 billion in October 2023. But as of this writing, assets in the DeFi ecosystem have nearly tripled in value. Ethereum has seen 64% growth over the past month\u2014which outpaces the 54% growth it's seen in price. And Solana isn't far behind it, having seen 57% growth in the past 30 days after its native SOL token has gained 34% over the same period."

        "content": "Solana's trading volume exceeded Ethereum's, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours.\n\nDespite a decline in new token creations, established memecoins on Solana are seeing significant price rallies.\n\nThe rivalry between Solana and Ethereum intensifies as memecoins become a key factor in onchain trading preferences.\n\nA memecoin frenzy has once again pushed Solana trading volumes higher than those on Ethereum.\n\nSolana generated $2 billion in volume while Ethereum generated $1.8 billion in the last 24 hours. The blockchain with the next highest volume generated was BNB Chain with $789 million.\n\nDexscreener, an analytics platform monitoring trading on decentralised exchanges, reports that within the top 20 trading pairs, Solana\u2019s memecoin volume reached $178 million, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $138 million over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe top memecoins by volume in the last 24 hours on Solana are WIF, POPCAT, BONK, TRUMP and WEN. All of these memecoins, besides TRUMP, were launched over a month ago.\n\nPrice history for memecoin BONK\n\nMemecoins are cryptocurrencies that draw their inspiration from internet memes, pop culture phenomena, and trends that have gone viral.\n\nThis ongoing competition underscores a significant shift in onchain trading, highlighting Solana and Ethereum\u2019s rivalry in becoming the dominant platform for memecoin trading.\n\nThis tug of war not only reflects the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets but also points to the growing influence of memecoins in shaping trading volumes and platform preferences.\n\nThe first time Solana surpassed Ethereum in trading volume was on December 14, and since then it has passed Ethereum\u2019s volume on 11 different days.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe usual suspects\n\nWhile trading volumes during Solana\u2019s boom in December were dominated by an influx of newly launched coins, mostly memecoins, this is no longer the case.\n\nNewly created tokens on Solana in December peaked at 7,900, while today, only 2,500 new tokens were created on Solana. This shows that trading volumes on Solana are concentrated in already existing coins.\n\nOne memecoin that has made a dramatic comeback is dogwifhat, WIF, a memecoin created referencing a popular internet meme of a dog in a pink knitted hat.\n\nWIF reached an all-time high on February 14 of $0.46 before falling 39% to $0.28 on February 23. Since then, WIF rallied 571% to reach $1.88 earlier today.\n\nAnother Solana darling memecoin, BONK, experienced similar price gains. BONK is up 51% on the day, reaching an all-time high of $0.000045, giving it a fully diluted valuation of over $3.6 billion.\n\nSimilar gains were seen with Ethereum memecoins last week, with some of those memecoins, like PEPE and DOGE, continuing their gains into this week.\n\nGot a tip about DeFi?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has historically been a bellwether for upcoming corrections in the market landscape of Ethereum. Recently, the foundation made an unexpected move by liquidating approximately $13 million worth of Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, on a daily time frame, is displaying a strong uptrend characterized by consistent higher highs and higher lows. The Moving Average lines are positioned in a manner that suggests sustained bullish momentum. The 50-day MA (in blue) is above the 100-day MA (in orange), which in turn is above the 200-day MA (in black), a configuration that traditionally signals a bullish trend.\n\nFurthermore, the price of Ethereum has been trading comfortably above these MAs, reinforcing the strength of the uptrend. A closer analysis reveals that Ethereum's price recently hit a peak, followed by a slight retracement. While such pullbacks are normal within an uptrend, they often present moments of tension as the market anticipates the next move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is hovering near overbought territory, indicating that the market may be due for a correction. This is where the recent operation by the Ethereum Foundation becomes particularly salient.\n\nIf we follow the history, the foundation's large transfers have been associated with preceding market downturns. While the direct correlation between the foundation's actions and market response cannot be verified with absolute certainty, seasoned investors are likely to tread with caution.\n\nThe market's reaction to the Ethereum Foundation's sell-off will be telling. Should the price sustain above the key MAs, it might indicate that the bull run still has legs. However, if the price begins to close below these MAs, particularly the 50-day MA, it could signal the onset of a larger correction."

At the time, Wormhole published a tokenomics and unlock schedule for W, which entailed a token generation event that would immediately release 1.1 billion tokens, with another 600 million tokens released to the community over the next several months.\n\nThe math adds up to an immediate airdrop worth $2.73 billion at current prices, potentially one of the largest airdrops in crypto history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the largest crypto airdrop so far was for Uniswap\u2019s UNI token on September 16, 2020\u2014a $6.43 billion event.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently drew attention to the predicted cost of \"blobs\" on the Ethereum network, highlighting potential economic ramifications. Blobs, introduced by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, are data bundles roughly 125 kilobytes in size that can be attached to transactions.\n\nButerin compared current data transmission costs on Ethereum with projections from Polymarket, a prediction market platform. According to current gas prices, transmitting 125 kB of data (calldata) costs approximately 0.06 ETH.\n\nIn contrast, Polymarket forecasts the price of blobs to be around 0.001 ETH. This significant disparity suggests that EIP-4844, if implemented, could drastically reduce data storage costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolymarket is predicting that blobs (~125 kB) will cost ~0.001 ETH.\n\n\n\nToday, 125 kB calldata costs ~30 gwei per gas * 16 gas per byte * 125000 gas ~= 0.06 ETH\n\n\n\nAnd if you think polymarket's guess that blobs will be 60x cheaper is over-optimistic, you can use the market to hedge! pic.twitter.com/vUwJInNhCP \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 3, 2024\n\nWhat is EIP-4844?\n\nEIP-4844 proposes a three-part solution to tackle blockchain's scalability issues. Firstly, it introduces Type-3 transactions, which enable users to attach blobs directly to their transactions. This offloads non-critical information from the main ETH chain, freeing up space and potentially reducing transaction fees.\n\nSecondly, the proposal introduces blob storage, allowing a limited number of blobs to be temporarily stored on beacon nodes (validators) for a specific time frame. Finally, a blob base fee mechanism is implemented to incentivize validators to include these blobs in blocks. This ensures the continued availability of the data while preventing excessive storage that could strain the network.\n\nHow to hedge by Vitalik Buterin\n\nBeyond cost reductions, Buterin suggests that Polymarket's predictions could serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders within the Ethereum ecosystem. By understanding the market's anticipated cost of blobs, participants can potentially hedge against price fluctuations, contributing to a more stable and predictable environment.\n\nIt is important to note that EIP-4844 is still under development and its implementation timeline is uncertain. However, the potential cost savings and increased scalability offered by blobs highlight the ongoing efforts toward a more efficient and cost-effective Ethereum network."

        "title": "How Safe Is the Layer-2 Blast Solution on Ethereum? - Bitrates",
        "content": "The latest controversy in the crypto universe revolves around Ethereum, the token whose blockchain is revolutionizing technology.\n\nAlthough nothing really notable happened with the cryptocurrency recently, besides the ETF failure due to the SEC\u2019s continuous delay, now Ethereum is on a spree due to the layer-2 system that seems to have caught people\u2019s attention more than it should\u2019ve. Many users have already entered their funds within the project, even though Blast will be delivered only next year around March.\n\nDue to this boom, the price of Ethereum on Binance suffered significant rising stats, but this doesn\u2019t seem to go on for much longer. That\u2019s because some users are skeptical about the reliability of this project due to what appears to be a Ponzi scheme. Not only that, but some investors believe the layer-2 solution isn\u2019t safe at all. Since the project is barely new, it\u2019s hard to say if that\u2019s the truth, which is why we\u2019ll get into analyzing Blast more.\n\nWhat is Blast, and why was it necessary?\n\nBlast is part of the layer-2 solutions on Ethereum responsible for keeping the blockchain safe while ensuring users\u2019 profits are well managed. The project aims to provide a better environment for native staking on Ethereum while focusing on yields that incentivize users. Besides regular staking rewards, investors might also receive DAI stablecoins, therefore diversifying their portfolios.\n\nLayer-2 network solutions are plenty on Ethereum, from zk-rollups to optimistic ones. Their purpose on the mainnet is to maintain security, lower transaction fees, and expand use cases for the network. All these actions work together to improve scalability and make the ecosystem work a seamless place for all users. Indeed, despite all efforts, Ethereum can sometimes be slow, which is why additional updates are being created. However, Blast seems to be more than that.\n\nUsers looking for Blast points and yields\n\nThe main reasons investors blew up Blast include the possibility of getting points and receiving more funds. This is also why some people are skeptical of this project because it seems to be based on a pyramid scheme. Basically, if you enter the system and invite more friends who also fund Blast, you\u2019ll receive a considerable percentage of points, which will go up if your friends ask more people. Hence, it may be possible that some will get wealthier and withdraw more money when Blast is present on the market due to their connections.\n\nMoreover, the Blast points are accompanied by a mechanism that generates yields, which are being staked on a liquid staking protocol, Lido. The company announced that users who deposit their ETH on the pool will receive 5% stablecoin yields.\n\nWhat should users be wary of before depositing their funds to Blast?\n\nAn impressive number of investors turned to Blast as soon as it was announced, which boosted the project considerably, but maybe not all were prepared to take risks. That\u2019s because immediately after the astonishing cost boom, experts and crypto enthusiasts perceived Blast as a dangerous investment considering some aspects of Blast.\n\nFirst, the developer\u2019s contract ownership has five signers, for which most of the three can execute a transaction. Still, it\u2019s a matter of safety if these signer keys are to be trusted, which raises questions on transparency.\n\nAt the same time, the project\u2019s proxy smart contract can always be modified since it has an upgrade function that can be used maliciously. For instance, the developer could take advantage of all the funds gathered without certainty over their trust levels.\n\nFinally, other users found an interesting function within the smart contract that could be used as a\n\npotential exploit. The mainnetBridge option might provide a path for the creator to receive a considerable amount of ETH and DAI with minimum effort, but this is only an observation made by curious users.\n\nPossible liquidity crisis over Ethereum?\n\nFew crypto experts consider that farmers and investors might trigger a liquidity crisis for Ethereum somewhere around February, one month before the applications\u2019 deployment. Hence, it won\u2019t be possible for investors to withdraw their funds for at least three months after February. That might be because liquidity providers will be waiting for an airdrop, which has been debunked as providing a disappointing yield ratio.\n\nTherefore, the lack of liquidity isn\u2019t a good sign for supposed investors. Liquidity ensures price stability and less asset volatility, so we\u2019re unsure whether Blast will be profitable. What\u2019s worrying is that many investors put their funds to work and expect great results, which isn\u2019t specific for now.\n\nHow will Blast affect Ethereum?\n\nThe layer-2 solution on Ethereum might also have some effects on the blockchain and the cryptocurrency. For instance, it could have been the cause of an increased price, which can be perceived as beneficial. However, since users found weird aspects of the smart contract code, the solution faces security scrutiny due to the unverified chain management whose developers are anonymously working.\n\nBeing dependent so much on the Lido liquid staking protocol isn\u2019t great for a small project because users wonder if their funds are safely managed and secured. Although Lido is a considerable helping booster for solutions like Blast, every funding investment idea should be considered with people\u2019s findings.\n\nInvestors already went through the FTX scandal, so they could learn a thing or two from previous experiences. The conclusion is that it\u2019s always best to be cautious of new projects because they haven\u2019t taken the test of time, so it\u2019s hard to assess whether they\u2019re safe. Indeed, crypto investing is about taking risks, but sometimes, they\u2019re not worth it despite their high-income potential.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nBlast is a new layer-2 solution provided for Ethereum and will ensure native staking and high yields for investors who invite more participants. This made people believe Blast is only a pyramid scheme, mainly because the developer and its team haven\u2019t provided much transparency on the project since its announcement on the market. However, many individuals deposited their funds into it and are now waiting for a significant withdrawal in March 2024."

        "title": "Ethereum Classic (ETC): The Original Ethereum? - Markets.com",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a prominent cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in recent years. To understand the significance of Ethereum Classic, it is crucial to go deep into the history of Ethereum and the infamous DAO attack that led to the creation of two separate cryptocurrencies: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe History of Ethereum and the DAO Attack\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum was introduced to the world as a blockchain-based platform that allowed the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It quickly gained popularity and became a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. However, in 2016, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was launched on the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe DAO was a revolutionary concept that aimed to create a decentralized venture capital fund. It raised a staggering amount of funds through a token sale, but unfortunately, it was exploited, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether (ETH). This incident shook the Ethereum community to its core and forced the developers to make a difficult decision.\n\nThe Split: Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic\n\nIn response to the DAO attack, the Ethereum community proposed a controversial solution - a hard fork. This involved creating a new version of the Ethereum blockchain that would reverse the transactions associated with the DAO attack and return the stolen Ether to the rightful owners. This new version became known as Ethereum (ETH).\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Ethereum community agreed with the decision to perform a hard fork. A group of dedicated individuals believed that the principles of immutability and censorship resistance, which were the foundation of the blockchain, had been compromised.\n\nAs a result, they decided to continue using the original Ethereum blockchain, which became known as Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nUnderstanding the Principles of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) stands for the preservation of the original principles of Ethereum. It upholds the belief that blockchain transactions should be immutable and free from interference, even in the face of catastrophic events like the DAO attack.\n\nEthereum Classic supporters argue that tampering with the blockchain undermines its core values and erodes trust in the technology.\n\nBy maintaining the original Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum Classic aims to provide a reliable and unchanging platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, security, and self-governance, making it an attractive choice for those who value the fundamental principles of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Key Differences between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum Classic and Ethereum share a common origin, several key differences set them apart. The most significant difference lies in their approach to governance.\n\nEthereum Classic adopts a hands-off approach, allowing the community to make decisions collectively, while Ethereum has implemented a more centralized governance model.\n\nAnother notable difference is the approach to scalability. Ethereum Classic has chosen to prioritize security and decentralization over scalability, whereas Ethereum has implemented various solutions, such as the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, to address scalability concerns.\n\nThe Development and Community behind Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic's development and community have grown steadily over the years. The Ethereum Classic Development Team (ETCDEV) plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving the Ethereum Classic blockchain. They focus on enhancing security, developing new features, and fostering the growth of a vibrant ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Classic community is composed of passionate individuals who believe in the principles of immutability and decentralization. They actively contribute to the development of Ethereum Classic by participating in discussions, proposing improvements, and building decentralized applications on the platform.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic has a range of potential use cases and applications. Its robust smart contract capabilities make it suitable for a variety of decentralized applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and identity verification systems. The immutability of the Ethereum Classic blockchain also makes it an ideal platform for storing permanent records, such as land ownership records or academic credentials.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Classic's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily port existing Ethereum dApps to the Ethereum Classic platform, expanding its range of potential applications even further.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum Classic: Pros and Cons\n\nInvesting in Ethereum Classic comes with its own set of pros and cons. On the positive side, Ethereum Classic has a dedicated community and development team, which bodes well for its long-term growth. Additionally, its focus on immutability and decentralization may attract individuals who value these principles.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with investing in Ethereum Classic. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and Ethereum Classic is no exception. Furthermore, Ethereum Classic faces competition from other blockchain platforms, which may impact its adoption and value.\n\nFuture Prospects and Challenges for Ethereum Classic\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum Classic faces both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the increasing adoption of blockchain technology and the growth of decentralized finance present exciting prospects for Ethereum Classic. As more applications are built on the platform, its value and utility may continue to rise.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Classic must overcome challenges such as scalability and interoperability to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and potential security vulnerabilities are factors that need to be addressed to ensure the long-term success of Ethereum Classic.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) holds a significant place in the blockchain ecosystem. Its commitment to preserving the principles of immutability and decentralization resonates with individuals who value the core tenets of blockchain technology. By providing a reliable and unchanging platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, Ethereum Classic contributes to the growth and evolution of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to mature, Ethereum Classic will face both opportunities and challenges. However, its dedicated community, passionate development team, and adherence to its core principles provide a solid foundation for its continued success. Whether it becomes a mainstream platform or remains a niche choice, Ethereum Classic's significance in the blockchain ecosystem cannot be ignored.\n\nDive into our CFD trading products and services to find the right one for you!\n\nStart Trading Now Start to trade now Join the 100.000s that have made markets.com their home for trading.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cardano market has recently showcased a trend that could be cause for concern among its investors. A noticeable decrease in trading volume suggests that the momentum behind ADA's recent price rally may be waning, potentially signaling an upcoming period of volatility and price correction.\n\nThe declining volume trend is a critical red flag in technical analysis, often indicating a lack of conviction in the asset's ability to sustain its current price levels. As trading activity diminishes, the support that has propelled ADA\u2019s price higher becomes increasingly fragile. This situation can lead to a scenario where even a minor sell-off could trigger a disproportionate price drop, as fewer buyers might be present to absorb the sell orders.\n\nA closer look at the ADA price chart reveals that while the currency has been experiencing an upward trajectory, the diminishing volume could signify that this rally might not have a strong foundation. The recent surge in ADA's price could be at risk if the market does not regain its trading volume to reinforce the uptrend.\n\nCardano's price is testing a critical resistance level. If the trading volume continues to fall, there is a possibility that ADA will lose support and enter a severe correction. The support levels that were previously reliable may not hold if they are tested again with a low volume, leading to potential massive losses for those holding the asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum to face issues?\n\nEthereum has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, but as the old adage goes, what goes up must come down \u2014 or at least take a breather. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen a sharp rally in its price, but with such steep ascents come concerns about sustainability and the potential for a reversal.\n\nThe current state of Ethereum's rally is one of caution. The momentum indicators, while still in bullish territories, are beginning to show signs that the rally may be overextended. The RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is nearing levels that typically indicate overbought conditions, which could precede a price correction.\n\nFor Ethereum, support levels are now established at $2,993, $2,653 and $2,515, which would be crucial to watch if a downturn begins. A healthy correction would potentially see Ethereum's price retesting these levels, confirming their strength and providing a possible accumulation point for investors.\n\nSolana holds tight\n\nAs Solana encounters a minor price correction at the $128 threshold, there are indicators suggesting that this could be the precursor to a more extended reversal. This notion is based on a detailed examination of its recent price action, which reveals that SOL's impressive climb could be tapering off.\n\nThe support and resistance levels for SOL have become increasingly relevant in recent trading sessions. After hitting resistance around $128, SOL experienced a pullback, which has left investors and analysts speculating about the possibility of a trend reversal. The support levels at $112 and $103, previously serving as solid grounds during SOL's ascent, are now being scrutinized as potential retest points in the event of a further price decline.\n\nAnalyzing the current trend through technical indicators shows a reduction in trading volume accompanying the price dip. This decreased volume could signal a weakening buying pressure, which, when coupled with the resistance met at $128, heightens the probability of a trend reversal. If the volume continues to decline and the price fails to break past the resistance level with conviction, SOL could indeed be on the cusp of a reversal.\n\nLooking forward, if the market sentiment shifts and the price of SOL breaks below the $112 support, this could confirm the bearish scenario, potentially leading to a prolonged retracement. Such a correction would not be out of the ordinary, as it would allow the market to consolidate after the recent rally and could potentially provide healthier long-term growth for SOL."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are making headlines with their surges in value. Bitcoin\u2019s recent break above $65,000 and Ethereum\u2019s price surpassing the $3,500 mark signify remarkable milestones in the cryptocurrency market. We explore the factors influencing Bitcoin\u2019s recent rise and the expected effects of Ethereum\u2019s next Dencon update as enthusiasts and investors keep a careful eye on these developments.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Surge and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin has surged to unprecedented heights, breaking the $65,000 mark and signaling a period of remarkable growth. This surge, observed in February, recorded the longest monthly green candle in Bitcoin\u2019s history, showcasing the strength of its upward momentum. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has soared to a staggering $1.244 trillion, consolidating its position as the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market with a dominance of 52.36%.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the last 24 hours alone, trading volume spiked by 65.6% to reach $34.75 billion, indicating heightened activity and investor interest. The BTC-spot ETF market witnessed substantial net inflows, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) contributing a significant $2,050.5 million. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) experienced a surge in net outflows, amounting to $1,455.7 million.\n\nThis outflow was attributed to Genesis Global Holdco LLC\u2019s liquidation of GBTC shares, signaling shifting investor sentiments and market dynamics. Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally saw it breaking through multiple support levels, particularly at $40,000, to surpass the $65,000 milestone. However, it faces strong resistance at $64,000 and $69,000, while maintaining support levels at $52,000 and $56,000. Technical indicators suggest a challenging path ahead, requiring sustained momentum to overcome key resistance levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Hail Reddit IPO, But Says \u201cThis Make Me Sad\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Milestone and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rally has been equally impressive, with gains exceeding 12% and surpassing the $3,500 milestone. Trading volumes surged by 43% in the last 24 hours, reaching over $16 billion, highlighting robust demand and investor confidence in the platform. Anticipation is high within the Ethereum community for the imminent launch of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThis upgrade promises significant benefits, including the reduction of transaction costs and simplification of layer-2 transactions, potentially enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability and usability. Post-launch, the Dencun upgrade is expected to lead to a substantial reduction in gas fees on layer-2 networks, following settlement contract updates. This development could have far-reaching implications for Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, potentially fostering greater adoption and utilization of the platform.\n\nAlso Read: Pepe Coin Price Rallies 70% As Binance Extends Support For PEPE\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: ETH, DOGE, SHIB - crypto.news",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was highly prosperous last week, witnessing a remarkable 16% surge in the global crypto market cap to $2.32 trillion. During this positive trend, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are among the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into Monday.\n\nETH, DOGE, and SHIB prices \u2013 March 3 | Source: Santiment\n\nETH breaches $3,400\n\nETH is up 9.6% this week.\n\nAs Bitcoin (BTC) garnered significant attention from market participants this week, Ethereum capitalized on the rally, achieving substantial surges beyond crucial psychological thresholds that had historically posed formidable challenges during its previous rallies.\n\nAt the onset of the week, Ethereum started on a positive note, securing an impressive three-day winning streak spanning from Feb. 26 to Feb. 28. During this period, the cryptocurrency overcame the psychological resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,300.\n\nRemarkably, Feb. 28 stood out as Ethereum\u2019s most bullish day, with the asset surging 4.40% amid Bitcoin\u2019s rally beyond $63,000. However, ETH experienced a pullback on Feb. 29 after reaching a peak of $3,521. The last time ETH saw the $3,500 level was in April 2022, before the Terra-induced price slump.\n\nAfter retesting $3,500 on Feb. 29 due to increased exchange outflows, Ethereum faced intense bearish pressure, resulting in a 1.33% decline \u2014 this marked Ethereum\u2019s first intraday loss for the week. Nonetheless, a recovery campaign on March 1 saw ETH breach and retain $3,400.\n\nDespite facing selling pressure attributed to rising exchange inflows and a potentially overbought RSI, Ethereum has managed to stay above $3,400, currently trading for $3,411 at the reporting time.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin options surge to $500m as whales apply cautious strategies\n\nDOGE records a 55% surge\n\nWhile Ethereum recorded a bullish week, its gains pale compared to Dogecoin. Notably, DOGE emerged as one of the most significant beneficiaries of the market uptrend despite commencing the week at a modest price of $0.08611.\n\nBefore the recent rally, Dogecoin had been in a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $0.094 and $0.076 since the beginning of the year, with $0.09438 acting as a formidable resistance level. On Feb. 27, DOGE successfully surpassed this threshold, rallying to a peak of $0.10058.\n\nFollowing the correction at the $0.10 resistance, Dogecoin maintained its position above the $0.094 level, concluding Feb. 27 at $0.00766 with an impressive 9.45% intraday gain. The meme coin built on this momentum, achieving a substantial 18.69% gain on Feb. 28, as it surpassed the $0.11 and $0.12 levels.\n\nDOGE sustained its uptrend until it hit a 16-month high of $0.15074 on March 2. This price represented a 75% increase from Dogecoin\u2019s weekly opening price of $0.08611. The token expectedly faced stern resistance at $0.15, but held up well above $0.14, closing the day at $0.14206.\n\nIn a notable retracement from the March 2 highs, Dogecoin has experienced a 6.07% drop today as the market corrects from the week-long uptrend. Despite these bearish developments, DOGE maintains a considerable 55% gain for the week, currently trading at $0.13335.\n\nSHIB makes it to the top gainers\u2019 list\n\nThe crypto market witnessed a resurgence of meme coins amid the uptrend, with Shiba Inu surfacing as one of the biggest gainers. SHIB began the week at the $0.000009 level, a threshold it had continued to trade at amid the previous market bearish consolidation phase.\n\nShiba Inu held above $0.000009 at the time, looking to leverage the threshold as a springboard for more substantial gains when a market uptrend comes up. This plan went well, as the asset took advantage of the Bitcoin rally to secure one of the most substantial weekly gains in the market.\n\nSHIB recorded multiple substantial intraday gains, with the lowest coming in at 4.18% on Feb. 26.\n\nThe month of March bode well for the token, as it recorded its largest intraday gains on March 1 and March 2 soaring 34.33% and 33.93%, respectively. SHIB eventually flipped MATIC, DOT and TRX to become the 12th largest asset by market cap.\n\nAmid these price surges, SHIB breached the $0.00001 and $0.00002 zones, soaring to a 22-month high of $0.00002390 on March 2 before witnessing a retracement. Despite the retracement, Shiba Inu has retained a spot among the top 5 gainers this week, changing hands at $0.00002176 amid a 125% weekly gain."

        "content": "Prominent whales have switched from Bitcoin to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum ETFs and the Dencun upgrade may have had a part to play.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bitcoin [BTC] has been the primary focus for both retail and whale investors, capturing significant attention with its soaring prices.\n\nHowever, recent data suggested a shift in sentiment, as Ethereum [ETH] emerged on the radar of whale investors.\n\nWhales switch their stance\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, a substantial move occurred as a whale transitioned from a bullish stance on BTC to adopting a bullish position on ETH.\n\nThis strategic shift involved exchanging 1,500 ETH for 88.68 WBTC, totaling $4.58 million on the 26th of February, with the intent of shorting the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nFollowing this initial maneuver, the whale executed another exchange, converting the acquired 88.68 WBTC back to 1,597 ETH, valued at $5.57 million.\n\nThis adjustment resulted in a net gain of 97 ETH, amounting to $338,000.\n\nThis transition to Ethereum aligned with the growing anticipation around Ethereum ETF approvals and heightened excitement surrounding the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThese factors could potentially attract more interest and investment into Ethereum, positioning it as a favorable asset in the eyes of both retail and institutional investors.\n\nHowever, despite this positive sentiment, Ethereum faced challenges, notably the persistently high gas fees, on its network.\n\nThese fees have been a point of concern, potentially impacting investor sentiment negatively, especially for smaller traders looking to engage in transactions.\n\nThe high fees could force users to look for lower-cost alternatives such as Solana [SOL], which may impact Ethereum in the long run.\n\nLooking at ETH\n\nDespite this, gas usage on the Ethereum network remained relatively consistent over the last few days.\n\nExamining the price movement, Ethereum was trading at $3,469.49 at the time of writing, exhibiting a growth of 1.56% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhile positive price movement was encouraging, other concerning issues emerged.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s Network Growth saw a decline, indicating reduced interest from new addresses.\n\nThis may pose a challenge to Ethereum\u2019s sustained growth, raising questions about the broader market sentiment around the altcoin."

        "content": "Taiko, a layer-2 scalability solution for the Ethereum blockchain, has just closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Lightspeed Faction, Wintermute Ventures, GSR, and other Venture Capital firms.\n\nThe money will be used to develop the emerging network, which will go live on mainnet in the coming months. Additionally, part of the funds raised could be dedicated to an incentive program through an airdrop, distributing the new native crypto of Taiko to all the first users of the chain.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nTaiko: Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 announces $15 million Series A funding round\n\nTaiko is a layer-2 cryptographic network, designed to improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis is a ZKEVM rollup that uses zero-knowledge computational proofs to batch transactions off-chain and later send the compressed data to Ethereum.\n\nThe project features a \u201cbased contestable rollup\u201d architecture in which there are mechanisms for contesting operations.\n\nWhile Taiko developers continue their work from 2022, the network is currently in testnet, to be precise within the sixth testing phase called Katia.\n\nWith the launch of the mainnet scheduled in the coming months, this type of layer-2 has already recorded excellent numbers with 1.1 million addresses created and 13 million transactions executed\n\nNow Taiko can rely on new resources ready to be invested in the development of the chain, after a Series A funding round of 15 million dollars has been closed.\n\nInvestors such as Lightspeed Faction, Hashed, Generative Ventures, and Token Bay Capital have invested in the secondary network of Ethereum, leading the round, along with other Venture Capital firms like Wintermute Ventures, Flow Traders, Amber Group, OKX Ventures, and GSR.\n\n9 months ago Taiko had revealed two more funding rounds, totaling 22 million dollars, which have been used in recent months to continue the development of the new network.\n\nWe're excited to announce that Taiko Labs, the core development team behind the Taiko protocol, has raised $37M in total capital across three rounds!\n\n\n\n1/ pic.twitter.com/1F6gD6l3Bh \u2014 Taiko \ud83e\udd41 (@taikoxyz) March 2, 2024\n\nIt is currently unclear whether the latest Series A funding announcement was concluded through an equity, token, or mixed structure for investors. What we do know is that in the future, with the same investors who are \u201cbetting\u201d on Taiko\u2019s growth, an investment fund in the crypto sector will be created.\n\nIn honor of the excellent result achieved, Terence Lam, the co-founder of the project, stated in his own words while layer 2 eagerly awaits to make its entrance into mainnet:\n\n\u201cWe definitely need to update our Katla testnet to enable support for EIP-4844 and perform an additional round of stress testing and security audit for the mainnet. The current outlook for completing all of this is before the end of the second quarter.\u201d\n\nThe Taiko team is composed of 40 people working on different tasks, with one front dedicated to engineering and the other on community growth and support of the cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nTaiko could launch a token through an airdrop after entering the mainnet\n\nWhile Ethereum Taiko\u2019s layer 2 completes the final network adjustments before entering mainnet, airdrop hunters are getting ready to seize another earning opportunity.\n\nThe need to launch a native token within its own ecosystem suggests that Taiko will take the opportunity to attract network traffic and new capital through an incentive system, riding the trend of airdrops on second-tier chains.\n\nWith Starknet officially launching its STRK resource just two weeks ago and distributing the token to its community, and with other major players on the horizon like ZkSync, Scroll, and Linea ready to follow the same path, market attention is becoming increasingly focused in this context.\n\nThe airdrop itself does not represent exclusively a way to decentralize one\u2019s cryptocurrency to a layer-2, but rather is seen as a marketing tool capable of attracting data and capital flows.\n\nFurthermore, this process allows to reward the same VCs who have financed the project (and who allow a token launch with attached liquidity) by offering their token as an exit, which is still subject to a vesting period to prevent it from being dumped on the market at listing.\n\nCurrently, to participate in the airdrop of this Ethereum scaling solution, you can only move in testnet, carrying out social campaigns on Galxe, becoming active members on Discord and offering support on Github commits.\n\nTaiko just announced their $15M funding round.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Total raise till now: $37M\n\n\n\nAccording to their latest announcement, six testnets were conducted involving 1.1M unique wallets.\n\n\n\nAs of now the 6th testnet \"Katla\" is live.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udde7 You can try out their Galxe campaign if you want to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ASFr5zeu1G \u2014 Airdrop Official \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@its_airdrop) March 2, 2024\n\nHowever, the most important phase to farm the Taiko airdrop is yet to come: the launch of the mainnet in this sense represents a more concrete opportunity to qualify for the coin distribution.\n\nMany of these layer-2 solutions that aim to launch a token with this kind of initiative, in fact, try to stimulate as much network traffic as possible on the main network, where the project collects fees.\n\nSo, as in the cases of similar projects, even for Taiko the eligibility for the airdrop will likely be guaranteed by actions such as bridging funds on the chain, executing transactions over different months, interacting with a wide range of protocols, and generating a good volume of exchanges."

Yet, based on both technical and sentiment analysis, a correction in the short term is looking probable.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been blowing past several resistance levels since rebounding from the $2,200 level at the beginning of February. The market is currently testing the $3,500 resistance level and is yet to break to the upside definitively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index demonstrates a clear overbought signal pointing to a potential consolidation or pullback in the coming days. In this case, the $3,000 level can provide sufficient support to prevent a deeper drop.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price has recently demonstrated signs of weakness, failing to break above the $3,500 level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index also demonstrates a bearish divergence between the two recent highs. As a result, another rejection from the $3,500 level might occur, leading to a correction toward the $3,000 zone.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been rallying rapidly over the last few weeks, approaching the $4,000 mark. This has led many speculators to jump on the crypto wagon once more and chase substantial profits.\n\nThis chart represents the open interest, which is a useful metric for futures market sentiment evaluation. It measures the number of open perpetual futures contracts across all crypto exchanges.\n\nThe open interest has also been experiencing a steep rise during the recent bullish run. While we have already concluded that there is a logical reason for this trend, high open interest values tend to result in increased volatility."

While Bitcoin rose 2.2% in the last 24 hours and traded at $63,275 around 11:21 am IST, other major cryptos such as Cardano, Ethereum, Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Polkadot surged up to 11%. However, a few of the top crypto tokens such as Avalanche, Chainlink, Polygon, Solana, and XRP were the laggards.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 1.5% to around $2.38 trillion in the last 24 hours.\"Bitcoin traded above the $63,000 mark over the weekend. The upswing in price is attributed to growing mainstream adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the approaching Bitcoin Halving event. BTC is eyeing towards $67,150 resistance level, if the momentum continues, a close above it this week could signal the potential for a new all-time high,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Meanwhile, Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to break the $3,600 level, which could potentially push the second-largest cryptocurrency beyond $4,000.\"The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $110.12B, which makes a 28.38% increase. The total volume in DeFi is currently $9.6 billion, 8.71% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $129.27 billion, which is 88.33% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $1.244 trillion.

BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 65.6% to $34.75 billion.\"In the past 24 hours, around $59.27 million worth of Bitcoin positions, with $38.52 million in shorts, were liquidated. This surge is linked to the growing mainstream adoption, notably propelled by the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, cultivating a stronger holding mentality among investors,\" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President at WazirX.Bitcoin's recent surge to over $62,000 has captivated crypto enthusiasts and surprised sceptics alike, marking a period of exponential growth. The rally witnessed in February even set a record, representing the longest monthly green candle in Bitcoin's history. Despite this remarkable rise, several key factors and upcoming events suggest that this may just be the beginning of a significant bull run with further potential gains.Bitcoin after taking multiple support at $40,000 resumed the up move and rallied up to $52,985. The asset was facing stiff resistance at $52,000 and started consolidating between $52,000 and $50,000. Post this move, BTC finally gave a breakout above the range and surged up to $6,248. The asset has a strong resistance at $64,000 and $69,000 and to further rally it needs to break, close and sustain above these levels. $52,000 and $56,000 will act as a strong support for the asset."

IntoTheBlock reports that 97% of all Bitcoin addresses are currently profitable, marking a milestone unseen in over two years. The upswing in price is credited to the growing mainstream adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event. Bulls are currently active in the market and are eyeing $67,150\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cWith the overall crypto market rising, global crypto M.Cap continues to pick up; crossing the $2.5 trillion level for the first time since December 2021. Simultaneously, with weekly gains of over 23%, BTC (+2.7% in the last 24 hours) is currently trading at over $63.5K; ETH (+1.4%) is trading at over $3.4K. Data shows that BTC withdrawals from exchanges are happening at a rapid pace, indicating rising investor activity. This could be a signal of a bullish future, given that BTC\u2019s prices are maintained and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index continues to stay in the \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 region with a score of 82/100.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin soared above $64,000 on Monday, nearing its all-time high from November 2021. Over the past 24 hours, $59.27 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated, with $38.52 million in shorts. The surge is linked to growing mainstream adoption, notably through Spot Bitcoin ETFs, fostering a stronger holding mentality. Long-term Bitcoin holders have reaped the most significant profits in this new wave of enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's price at $62,000 sees a slight dip of 0.10% amid regulatory shifts and market movements. The UK's expanded seizure powers under the Economic Crime Act may bolster investor confidence, while Marathon Digital's Anduro platform aims to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities, potentially impacting its value. Nigeria's clarification on Binance fines underscores regulatory uncertainties. Despite challenges, Bitcoin remains bullish above $60,750, supported by technical indicators. Green Bitcoin introduces Gamified Green Staking, promoting eco-consciousness and offering rewards, shaping a sustainable financial landscape.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"Bitcoin surged above $64,000 again, being only 10% away from its ATH ($69,000). Bitcoin's market capitalization currently stands at $1.25 trillion with market dominance at 52.23%, after seeing an increase of 0.54% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to break the $3,600 level, which could potentially push the second-largest cryptocurrency beyond $4,000.\"\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Crypto whales have seen significant returns following the recent upswing in value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Both of these cryptocurrencies experienced an exponential level of growth on the weekly and monthly charts, and at this rate could surge even further up. Yet, the same whales accumulated the Pullix (PLX) cryptocurrency during its blockchain ICO.\n\nThe crypto has already grown 250%, and could soon spike 100x following its BitMart listing. We will go over all three to determine which one can surge the most in value, and see why PLX is the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Performance Bullish \u2013 Surges Above $62,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained a lot of attention as of recently based on its optimal price performance. Just during the previous week, the Bitcoin crypto experienced a notable price upswing, in anticipation for the Bitcoin halving.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin today has high growth potential, especially as it surged 20.3% in the past week, and 44% in the past month. Its value spiked up from $50,607.53 to a maximum value of $63,938.71 during the past seven days, and according to the Bitcoin price prediction, the highest level it can reach in 2024 is at $100,903.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Nears $4,000 Price Point After Jump Above $3,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) also showcased dominant on-chart performance. The Ethereum value has seen a notable upswing in the past week, where it moved above the $3,400 level. Moreover, the current Ethereum price has not finished climbing, as it has reached a 50% increase in the past 30- days, and a YTD upswing of 113%. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $5,534 by the end of 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX) Accumulated by Crypto Whales After BitMart Listing Announcement\n\nPullix (PLX) is an upcoming project that can dominate the Web3 space as it will introduce a hybrid platform in which anyone can get access to the best elements of CEXs and DEXs in a streamlined experience. Anyone can access it without the need to undergo KYC procedures. Users can get leverage, up to 1000:1, and the platform will even introduce a token burn feature, where the supply will decrease over time and increase the PLX token scarcity. Moreover, anyone can also stake their crypto into automated market makers (AMMs) to get additional value.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recently sold out its presale in rapid time, raising nearly $10 million. Over 20,000 participants registered for the presale, and following its BitMart listing, it can spike as high as 100x, which has attracted massive whale attention. These aspects make PLX the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile whales did initially accumulate Bitcoin and Ethereum, and those two major cryptocurrencies still have growth potential, it\u2019s clear that the most significant gains can be made with Pullix. With its BitMart listing, it will become available to a much broader range of traders and investors, and at this rate, could reach new heights, and it\u2019s one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix, see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Community\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
