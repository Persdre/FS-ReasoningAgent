This is where Base by Coinbase comes in. Base is a new Ethereum-based crypto platform that increases transaction speed and security and supports a variety of applications.\n\nHere\u2019s what Base is, how it works, its benefits and potential drawbacks and its use cases.\n\nWhat is Base by Coinbase?\n\nBase by Coinbase is a crypto platform that uses the Ethereum network to increase transaction speed, security and accessibility while reducing costs. Unlike other cryptocurrency platforms, Base is specifically designed using blockchain to support decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBase uses what\u2019s known as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain. The Layer 2 blockchain is designed to perform transaction-heavy work with speed, keeping costs lower for the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1). Base uses OP Stack, an open-source development platform, to create greater compatibility and ease of transition for developers familiar with Ethereum.\n\nBecause of this approach, Base can offer low transaction fees, faster transaction times and full compatibility with Ethereum processes. Base is linked with Coinbase, making it accessible for broader adoption in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow does Base work and what is it used for?\n\nBuilt as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network, Base is designed to increase performance, interoperability and scalability while decreasing transaction costs and settlement time.\n\nBase processes transactions off-chain through a mechanism known as \u201crollups,\u201d bundling multiple transactions together and submitting them as a single batch to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 for validation. This approach reduces costs and load on the main Ethereum network.\n\nThe primary use cases for Base include the following:\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) platforms\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces\n\nGaming and virtual worlds\n\nSocial media platforms\n\nSupply chain and logistics applications\n\nBase\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and frameworks, along with lower fees and faster transaction times, make it a useful platform for developers and individuals.\n\nThe benefits of Base by Coinbase\n\nBase by Coinbase offers some key advantages for individuals and businesses:\n\nFaster transactions: Base processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.\n\nBase processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.

So it may need further scalability to manage significant user growth in the future. User experience: The transition from traditional Ethereum transactions to Base might not be seamless for all users, leading to potential difficulties.\n\nCan you buy Base from Coinbase?\n\nCoinbase says it does not currently plan to issue a new network token for Base. Instead, Base will use Ethereum as its native gas token. So at least for now there is no Base crypto coin to buy.\n\nCoinbase warns that users should be aware that scammers may try to send fake Base tokens and suggests that you don\u2019t interact with anyone peddling fake Base coins.\n\nBottom line\n\nBase by Coinbase is a Layer 2 solution for the Ethereum network, offering faster transaction times, lower fees and increased compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite some key advantages, users should pay attention to potential drawbacks such as security and complexity."

        "content": "Solana-based meme coins have significantly outperformed their Ethereum-based counterparts in 2024, yielding an average return of 8,469% as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 962%, per the \u201cCMC 2024 H1\u201d report.\n\nSolana-based meme coins Vs. Ethereum-based meme coins, Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs per the report, the explosive rallies of WIF and BONK on Solana have drawn significant attention and capital from other blockchains, creating a cycle of increased meme coin performance and investment. While meme coins exist across various blockchains, Solana and Ethereum lead in activity and trading volume.\n\nEthereum meme coins are more well-known because they were primarily introduced in 2023 or earlier. In contrast, most Solana meme currencies came onto the scene in late 2023 or early 2024, capitalizing on the surge in attention at the time.\n\nPolitical meme tokens have become a prominent subgenre inside the $57.7 billion meme currency market with a market valuation of $784 million. The MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin has increased in value by more than 5,100% this year due in large part to Trump\u2019s open endorsement of cryptocurrencies and his acceptance of cryptocurrency contributions for his campaign.\n\nThe exceptional performance of Solana-based meme coins underscores a growing shift in speculative investments within the crypto space. This trend is not only reshaping the dynamics between different blockchain ecosystems but also highlights the increasing integration of political narratives within the meme coin market.\n\nAs crypto becomes a significant topic for the upcoming November US elections, political meme coins are expected to continue attracting speculative interest, further driving their market activity and value."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAsset manager Bitwise submitted an updated registration statement for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF with regulators on Wednesday, disclosing its plans to waive fees. While largely procedural, this latest revision is seen by market observers as a sign that the launch of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\n\u201cExpect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter (aka X). \u201cWe're thinking these things could potentially [be listed] later next week, or the week of the 15th at this point.\u201d\n\nAfter shares in the Bitwise Ethereum ETF are listed on an exchange, Bitwise will waive a yet-to-be-defined management fee on the first $500 million its fund garners during that period, the amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated.\n\nBitwise\u2019s move follows similar ones from Franklin Templeton and VanEck. Both ETF hopefuls have included fee waivers in filings for the first $10 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnticipation of the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs has grown steadily since the regulator\u2019s last-minute approval in May. While the SEC approved several so-called form 19b-4s, it has yet to green light individual S-1 filings from asset managers, which are needed for trading to begin.\n\nBitwise submitted its amended S-1 days before it was actually due, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Twitter, he floated the idea that Bitwise \u201cwanted to get it off their plate,\u201d and that the SEC\u2019s latest round of comments appeared to be minimal.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear the last round of comments were \u2018literally nothing\u2019\u2014took zero time to update,\u201d he said.\n\nBalchunas concurred that the class of products seems on track to begin trading this month. At the same time, he wondered why the regulator appears to be dragging its feet, considering the SEC seems mostly satisfied with the filings that firms have put forward so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCould be one 'problem' issuer slowing down [the] process or just summertime.\u201d\n\nNot long after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23, the cryptocurrency rallied to around $4,000. Yet as the approval process has played out, Ethereum\u2019s price has shed most of those gains, drifting down $3,270, as of this writing.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said last month that the process for launching spot Ethereum ETFs is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Summit, he added that progress is dependent on asset managers providing full disclosures.\n\nThough Bitwise\u2019s amended filing has few changes, it does include new disclosure language. For example, a clause was inserted stating the \u201cchair of the SEC has stated that the SEC has authority under existing laws to regulate the digital asset sector\u201d within a section on oversight.\n\nBitwise also added a few sentences disclosing that certain digital asset trading platforms, to the extent that they are regulated, may not be in compliance with applicable rules.\n\nFinally, a section also outlines the \u201cInitial Creation of Ether.\u201d Looking at Ethereum\u2019s initial supply of 72 million, it shows how most was sold to the public through a crowd sale in 2014, alongside distributions to the Ethereum Foundation and the network's developers.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Ethereum: Its History and Future Outlook - Camarillo Acorn",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world computer, has been instrumental in the blockchain and the cryptocurrency community since its entrance. Being one of the largest platforms for the implementation of smart contracts and dApps, Ethereum has become a platform for many new ideas in the digital economy niche. Appreciating its history from when it was born up to the present and its possibilities is useful in comprehending its importance and possibilities. Also, certain points in Ethereum\u2019s timeline can be marked as important, for example, the Ethereum price all time high and the lowest price Ethereum has hit in 2024.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nEthereum was introduced in late 2013 by a young programmer, Vitalik Buterin. Buterin planned on building a platform surpassing what Bitcoin can offer, a decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and dApps. This vision aimed at using blockchain technology not only to de-centralize money but also a number of applications and operations.\n\nThe development of Ethereum was backed by an ICO in 2014, the project creators accepted over 18 million dollars in Bitcoins. This funding effort was a testimony to the fact that the people believed in Buterin\u2019s vision. The Ethereum network officially went live on July 30, 2015, with the first block known as the \u201cFrontier.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Evolution and Milestones\n\n1. Early Growth and Adoption: The early years of Ethereum though were quite dynamic and experienced high adoption rates. Due to the ability of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, developers began to actively engage in developing dApps. Many initiatives, starting from decentralized finance (DeFi) and ending with gaming, appeared during this period and were based on Ethereum.\n\n2. The DAO and Its Aftermath: A major milestone in the history of Ethereum is The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016. The DAO was a very ambitious project envisioned as a decentralized venture capital fund. However, a flaw in its code was taken advantage of, and 50 million dollars in Ether were stolen. This caused a rather bitter fork, where the community was split in two: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, whose token is ETC. The reason for forking was the community\u2019s decision to get the funds back and to make the platform trustworthy.\n\n3. Reaching All-Time Highs: The price of Ethereum has been volatile over the years, which depicts the growth of the currency and people\u2019s interest in it and the crypto space as a whole. The highest Ethereum has ever been recorded was in November 2021 when one ETH was trading at above $4800. This milestone signified the escalating beliefs in the Ethereum project and cryptocurrencies with the DeFi, NFTs, and the Ethereum 2.0 launch.\n\n4. The Technology Behind Ethereum: Ethereum platform is based on implementing smart contracts and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are digital contracts that are self-executing with the terms of the contract written in code. These contracts operate on the EVM, meaning that the implementation of these contracts is done to the letter as is coded, and there are no chances of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party meddling.\n\n5. Ethereum 2. 0: An essential shift that characterizes Ethereum technology is the shift to Ethereum 2. 0, also called Eth2 or Serenity. Ethereum 2. As for the platform\u2019s major concerns such as scalability, security, and energy consumption, 0 attempts to tackle some of them. The upgrade involves moving from the proof of work (PoW) to the proof of stake (PoS).\n\n6. Proof-of-Stake (PoS): In PoS, the validators are selected to produce new blocks and check transactions depending on the number of tokens they own and are willing to pledge. This is anticipated to cut energy usage by a large margin, thus improving Ethereum\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, PoS is aimed at increasing the network capacity so that more transactions can be processed per second, eliminating the issue of high traffic and high gas fees.\n\nBenefits and Challenges\n\nBenefits\n\nDecentralization and Security: Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature ensures that there is no single point of failure for applications.\n\nInnovation Platform: Ethereum introduced the smart contract feature, which created a market of decentralized applications combined with various industries, from finance to gaming and even supply chains.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum\u2019s open-source architecture ensures the integration and cooperation between various platforms and applications in the ecosystem.\n\nChallenges\n\nScalability Issues: Nonetheless, Ethereum has a major problem of scalability whereby the network usually gets congested and this attracts high charges. Ethereum 2. 0 also aims at solving these problems but the change is gradual and continuous.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not free from the criticism of the regulating authorities. Changes in the law on its uptake and application can influence it.\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: Smart contracts are very effective but sometimes contain errors and flaws that can lead to attacks such as the one witnessed in the DAO hack.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nSeveral prospects indicate that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, and several important advancements are likely to strengthen its status as a dominant blockchain.\n\nEthereum 2. 0 Implementation: The complete execution of Ethereum 2. These include scalability, security, and energy efficiency, and it is expected that the 5G network 0 will offer many improvements. This upgrade may encourage developers and enterprises to deploy their applications on the Ethereum network since it is a more reliable and fast network.\n\nDeFi and NFT Growth: The DeFi and NFT markets which are closely associated with Ethereum are expected to expand in the future. DeFi applications provide financial services with no intermediaries, and NFTs are non-interchangeable digital assets that include art, virtual land, etc. For Ethereum these innovations will be vital for its to remain relevant in the future which is why the support for these innovations will be important.\n\nEnterprise Adoption: Enterprises are increasingly using blockchain solutions to enhance business aspects such as transparency, security, and efficiency. Ethereum\u2019s well-deepened ecosystem and further growth make it a valuable candidate for enterprise use, which can result in further expansion and becoming a more widespread part of business processes.\n\nCommunity and Development: The Ethereum community has been, and continues to be, very engaged and enthusiastic about the platform. This way, it is possible to constantly improve and develop the approach that corresponds to the current tendencies and issues. Given that the Ethereum\u2019s development is based on a principle of collaboration, it will most probably remain a leader in the field of block-chain technologies.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nEthereum has evolved from a unique concept to one of the most significant parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency sphere. It has introduced the elegance of smart contracts and Decentralized applications to the world, which has completely changed the way assets are interacted with and managed.\n\nDespite the issues concerning the network, including the matters of scaling and the legal environment, the further evolution of Ethereum 2. Thus, it has a 0 ranking and strong community backing, which shows it has a bright future ahead of it. Thus, as Ethereum is constantly developing, it is ready to stay one of the leaders in the digital economy and contribute to the development of further implementations of decentralized technologies."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs expected to begin trading in July after Bitwise files amended S-1 ahead of due date.\n\nEthereum ETFs could flip analysts' expectations if investors buy into ETH's Nvidia-like high-growth tech play narrative.\n\nEthereum derivatives data reveals investors are becoming more risk averse following Mt. Gox headwind on horizon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 3% on Wednesday following Bitwise filing an updated S-1 draft and a wider market downturn with potential Mt. Gox BTC supply flooding the market. Despite the general market lull, investors may gain consolation from Bitwise prediction that Ethereum ETFs could outperform analysts' expectations if positioned as a high-growth tech play similar to Nvidia.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Could Ethereum be the next Nvidia?\n\nAsset manager Bitwise filed its amended S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today ahead of its July 8 due date. The new filing added a fee waiver for up to $500 million in assets under management, similar to Van Eck's waiver last week.\n\nConsidering the comments on these drafts were light, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said spot ETH ETFs should have begun trading and expects them to launch before the end of July.\n\nThe SEC approved spot ETH ETF issuers' 19b-4 filings in May but also needs to greenlight their S-1 registration statements before the products can begin trading.\n\nAccording to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum ETFs could be more successful than earlier predicted if investors buy into the narrative that Ethereum is a high-growth tech play similar to Meta and Nvidia. Hougan had earlier predicted that spot ETH ETFs could attract up to $15 billion in net flows before the end of 2025.\n\n\"It's pretty easy for me to imagine investors selling a small amount of their tech exposure and adding ETH. I'd argue it's easier than imagining investors carving out an entirely separate portfolio sleeve for a new monetary asset,\" Hougan noted.\n\nHowever, people need to buy into the idea that \"Ethereum is a technology investment\" for this to happen. Hougan noted that a clear understanding of how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin and the growth of applications on its network would help strengthen the \u201chigh-growth tech play\u201d narrative.\n\n\"What might that look like? Imagine stablecoins going from $160 billion to $1.6 trillion in assets as more people embrace the speed and transparency of blockchain-enabled payments. Or consider decentralized finance applications opening up new avenues for lending and borrowing with the onset of regulatory clarity. Or imagine more firms following BlackRock's lead and building tokenized funds on the Ethereum platform,\" said Hougan.\n\nMeanwhile, Lookonchain revealed in a recent analysis that Ethereum ranks number one among blockchain networks in terms of yearly revenue. Ethereum's revenue is at $2.728 billion per year, with Bitcoin coming behind at $1.302 billion. Increased revenue often indicates high user activity in a blockchain network, which helps estimate bullish sentiment.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum traders are skeptical with Mt. Gox headwind in sight\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,307, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. ETH breached the $3,367 support level, pouring cold water on hopes of a potential rebound. ETH liquidations reached $44.33 million, equalling that of BTC in the past 24 hours despite having a lower market cap. Long liquidations accounted for 87% of ETH's total liquidations, with shorts at 13%.\n\nEthereum options open interest has declined by 57% since its spike following the SEC's approval of 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. As of May 24, ETH options OI was at $13.44 billion. However, following the expiry of May and June options, most investors have failed to open new positions as indicated in the chart below.\n\nETH options OI\n\nETH options OI is now at $5.69 billion, its lowest level since September. The decreasing options OI accompanied by ETH's price decline suggests option traders are more risk-averse. Two possible reasons for the uncertainty among traders include:\n\nSEC's delay in greenlighting prospective spot ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts.\n\nPrevailing wider market bearish sentiment from Mt. Gox BTC supply.\n\nThe ETH Long/Short ratio also provides insights into traders' sentiment in the past week. The ratio's 7-day average is at 0.946, indicating the futures market is tilted toward the downside.\n\nAs a result, ETH may sustain a horizontal movement in the coming weeks until the SEC approves issuers' S-1 drafts for spot ETH ETFs to begin trading.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nA breach of the $3,203 support could strengthen bearish sentiment and send ETH back to the $2,850 to $3,029 range."

        "content": "Ethereum has surpassed Bitcoin in fee income over the past year by an epic 100%, according to the newest report from Lookonchain. Thus, its network has recorded $2.73 billion in fee income, the most in the industry. Bitcoin, in second place, generated $1.3 billion. Closing the top three is Tron Network, with almost $460 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther networks also contributed to the overall fee income landscape. Solana generated $241.3 million, Binance's chain accumulated $176.6 million and Avalanche recorded $68.83 million. Additionally, the zkSync Era earned nearly $60 million, Optimism $40.4 million and Polygon $23.9 million.\n\nHere are the top 10 chains by 1-year fee revenue.#Ethereum earns a fee of $2.728B per year, #Bitcoin earns a fee of $1.302B per year, and #TronNetwork earns a fee of $459.39M per year. pic.twitter.com/ixAiP9g8JA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 3, 2024\n\nAs the data highlights, Ethereum has a significant lead, doubling Bitcoin's revenue. This result is attributed to a broader range of applications and services on the network of the main altocin, with higher usage and transaction fees as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure win?\n\nEthereum's ecosystem supports decentralized finance platforms, NFTs and various applications, all of which contribute to increased transaction volume and fee income. This is what has positioned ETH as a more versatile and widely used network compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn return, Bitcoin's revenue, while still over a billion dollars, is primarily driven by its role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Its transaction fees are affected by network congestion and the price of BTC itself, which can fluctuate significantly.\n\nHowever, it still lacks the extensive range of applications found in the Ethereum ecosystem, resulting in lower overall fee income."

        "content": "Lido has reported a rise in staked Ethereum on its platform despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifying its staking programs as securities in its lawsuit against Consensys.\n\nStaked Ethereum increase\n\nA July 2 report showed that Lido users staked an additional 95,616 ETH between June 24 and July 1. This increased the total value of assets staked on the platform by 1.26%, reaching $33.48 billion.\n\nDuring this period, Lido led in net Ethereum deposit inflows, surpassing centralized exchanges like Binance and Gate.io and the rapidly growing liquid restaking project Ether.fi.\n\nThe platform also revealed significant activity in its wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) on Layer 2 networks like Scroll, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. The total number of assets on these blockchains increased by 7.19% to 141,586, bringing the 7-day trading volume to $1.23 billion.\n\nHowever, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staked ETH decreased slightly, dropping 0.04% to 2.96%.\n\nNode decentralization\n\nLido is enhancing decentralization efforts by launching a Community Staking Module (CSM) to promote more decentralized Ethereum node operations.\n\nAccording to official documentation, CSM will integrate a diverse range of Node Operators, including Solo stakers, into the network. The module will also allow permissionless entry for node operators. It added:\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal for this module is to allow for permissionless entry to the Lido on Ethereum Node Operator set and enfranchise solo-staker participation in the protocol, increasing the total number of independent Node Operators in the overall Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nThis move would mark a clear departure from its previous approach, which required its DAO to approve a new node operator before its addition to the platform. However, its current initiative would allow solo staking to become more attractive and accessible for interest validators by introducing \u201creasonably low bond for Node Operators\u201d and requiring \u201cno secondary token collateral.\u201d\n\nThe module is in early adoption mode on the Holesky testnet and is expected to transition to a permissionless state on July 11, 2024.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is hanging on the edge at $3,365, as this price level is actually far more important than you might think. The asset has clearly gained serious ground for a reversal after breaking above the 100 EMA, but right now, ETH is in some trouble and may reach $3,000 quite soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has historically held up at this critical support level, which is located roughly where the $3,365 level is. If Ether were to fall below this mark, it would indicate that this support is no longer there and will probably descend to $3,000. This is the next significant psychological level. The 100 EMA frequently serves as a reliable gauge of the general trend, and a break below it may trigger a large sell-off.\n\nThe 200 EMA is the only significant support level between the 100 EMA and the 200 EMA in terms of technical support aside from the 200 EMA, which is located much further below. Ethereum may see a swift decline to the 200 EMA level, or roughly $3,000 in case of a breakdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has Ethereum broken above the 100 EMA, but it has also broken below the consolidation channel it has been trading in for the last few weeks. This channel has given traders some predictability by providing a range in which ETH has moved. A break below $3,365 would mean that the market is leaving this channel to the downside, suggesting that the trend may be turning from bullish to bearish and potentially causing more losses.\n\nThe 100 EMA serves as a key support level, and a break below it might cause ETH to move rapidly toward $3,000 because there would be no other support level. Furthermore, a breach below this level would indicate a break out of the current consolidation channel and could indicate a reversal of the bearish trend."

        "content": "Much attention has been focused on Ethereum Name Service (ENS) in recent days. Ethereum Name Service increased by 41% over the past week, signalling a solid uptrend with further upside potential. In a broader sense, ENS headed up nearly 14% over the past 30 days, testifying to this token\u2019s sheer resilience and growth potential.\n\nThis impressive surge can be attributed mainly to Bitcoin\u2019s price rebound. The upward momentum that Bitcoin\u2019s rise created for altcoins has given them room for losses to recover and set their eyes on new highs. With the lead set by this top cryptocurrency, Ethereum Name Service and other altcoins follow through in a continuum, further benefiting from renewed investor confidence.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Name Service stands at $31.90, with a trading volume of $1.17 billion within the last 24 hours and a market capitalization of $1.00 billion. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum Name Service has added 10.54% to its value, additional backing for what is already an extraordinary cryptocurrency market player.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) Sees Remarkable Growth, Eyes $120 Target 4\n\nAnalyst Sees Potential for $120 for Ethereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nCrypto analyst Matthew Hyland believes in an optimistic price trajectory for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). As per Hyland, if it breaks out from its current levels, Ethereum Name Service will reach as high as $120. Hyland\u2019s bullish prediction came from ENS\u2019s recent performance.\n\nThe analyst mentioned that he had recommended this to his Patreon subscribers when it was $17.50, exactly on the night of the ETH ETF approval a few weeks ago. Unaffectedly, with ENS currently trading at around $30 and showing every sign of attempting a breakout, this recommendation has paid off.\n\nHyland\u2019s insights and predictions give further weight to the growing confidence placed by the crypto community in ENS. His price target of $120 foreshadows a substantial upside potential from current levels, so it has emerged as one of the cryptocurrencies investors will watch over the next few months.\n\nAs ENS values surge, many opportunities emerge within the crypto market, gaining optimism from well-esteemed analysts like Hyland. The eyes of investors and enthusiasts are fastened on Ethereum Name Service, hoping for more significant gains as the market evolves.\n\nRelated Reading | Ethereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Surge in 2024? What Traders Should Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "As 2024 progresses and the cryptocurrency market keeps evolving, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, stands as a strong contender, garnering the attention of both investors and traders. With various developments in the pipeline, and a volatile market to deal with, there are speculations about ETH price will surge this year. This article delves into the key factors that could influence Ethereum price in 2024 and what traders should keep an eye on.\n\nRecent Market Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum price has experienced challenges in the market, having declined by 2.8% in the past day to trade today at $3,357.89. The past month was not friendly either, with the token recorded losses of about 12.17%. With a market cap of $403.6 billion, and a trading volume of $10.8 billion, ETH remains a strong contender among cryptocurrencies. Although the coin achieved its all-time high milestone of $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021, it has since dropped in price by 31.32%.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price in 2024\n\n1. Ethereum Upgrades and Developments\n\nIn 2024, the Ethereum network will experience several major enhancements. The ongoing \u201cSharding\u201d is designed to improve the network\u2019s scalability even more.\n\nSharding will enable Ethereum to handle numerous transactions at once, easing congestion and decreasing gas fees. Anticipated enhancements in technology are likely to draw in additional developers and users to the platform, potentially increasing the need for ETH\n\n2. Institutional Adoption\n\nInterest from institutions in Ethereum is increasing. Many big financial institutions are starting to incorporate Ethereum in their activities, whether through investing directly, using DeFi apps, or creating products based on Ethereum.\n\nIn 2024, the anticipated introduction of Ethereum ETFs could potentially unlock the doors for a surge of institutional funds. These advancements are expected to increase investor trust and encourage interest in ETH.\n\n3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion\n\nEthereum has been behind the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. The sector has seen an increasing number of assets on Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms and yield farming are innovations on DeFI continuing to gain traction.\n\nAs the ecosystem expands, the demand and utility for ETH are likely to increase, positively impacting its price.\n\n4. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Metaverse\n\nEthereum is also making big advancements in the metaverse and NFT areas. The popularity of virtual real estate, collectibles and digital arts is driving demand for ETH, especially since most NFTs are created on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMost NFTs are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. As the concept of metaverse develops, the role of Ethereum in fueling these virtual worlds could result in higher adoption, leading to increase in ETH price.\n\n5. Regulatory Environment\n\nThe regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies still has both positive and negative aspects. Although clear regulations can support growth, overly strict policies may hinder innovation and discourage investment.\n\nTraders need to monitor regulatory changes worldwide, as they could affect the price of Ethereum. Favorable ETF approvals or supportive blockchain policies could trigger price surges as positive regulatory updates.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Market Sentiment\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) technical analysis shows a complex situation with indicators like EMA, MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci levels. EMA signals \u2018Sell\u2019, hinting at a bearish trend, with potential support at $3,090.3.\n\nMACD at -47.4 suggests selling due to bearish momentum, while RSI at 41.2 is neutral but near oversold levels. Fibonacci levels indicate support at $3,266.8 and resistance at $3,767.7, offering insights on potential price movements.\n\nFalling below $3,266.8 could lead to further drops, while surpassing $3,767.7 might indicate bullish momentum.\n\nWhat Traders Should Know\n\n1. Stay Informed: Staying updated about Ethereum\u2019s technical upgrades and their schedules is essential. Effective execution of these improvements could signify a significant uptrend.\n\n2. Monitor Institutional Movements: Pay attention to updates from large financial institutions about their participation in Ether. Higher adoption by institutions can result in noticeable price gains.\n\n3. Follow DeFi and NFT Trends: The rise of DeFi and NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem shows the high demand and usefulness of ETH. Monitoring these industries can offer understanding of potential price fluctuations.\n\n4. Regulatory News: Keep informed about regulatory changes happening across the world. Favorable regulatory updates may result in optimistic market outlook, while unfavorable news can elicit the opposite reaction.\n\n5. Technical Analysis: Make use of technical indicators for insight into market trends and possible entry and exit points. This can assist in forming informed decisions when trading\n\nConclusion\n\nthereum faces a critical juncture in 2024, driven by tech advancements, institutional attention, and the evolving DeFi and NFT sectors. Despite current bearish trends, the long-term outlook is optimistic with the upcoming upgrades and potential ETF greenlights. Traders must stay alert to market shifts and regulations to seize Ethereum\u2019s anticipated growth in 2024 through informed decision-making and technical analysis."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking: A Guide to Earning Rewards and Securing Network - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum, a major cryptocurrency, has become more eco-friendly and secure by using a new system called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This new system lets you earn rewards for just holding onto your Ethereum (ETH) and helping to keep the network safe.\n\nThis guide explains what staking ETH is, how it works, and different ways to do it. Even if you\u2019re new to crypto, this guide will help you understand how staking ETH can be a great way to get involved in the exciting world of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Staking?\n\nEthereum staking is the process of locking ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and participating in verifying transactions. This method sees users locking in their ETH as a \u201cstake\u201d or \u201cdeposit\u201d as a guarantee against them verifying and validating Ethereum transactions.\n\nBy staking ETH, users qualify to become validators with granted privileges of broadcasting transactions on the blockchain, maintaining the distributed database, and securing the network. These validators are rewarded with transaction fees and a predefined yield on their staked amount.\n\nFollowing the Merge upgrade, which went live in September 2022, Ethereum was transited into using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from the Proof-of-Work (PoW). This upgrade marked a significant milestone for ETH which changed its fundamental infrastructure.\n\nBefore the adoption of PoS consensus, Ethereum validators tended to use heavy electricity for verifying transactions just like Bitcoin. Now its electricity consumption is drastically reduced and the network efficiency is improved from the ground level.\n\nBy implementing a staking mechanism, Ethereum has also unlocked numerous economic benefits for its ever-evolving ecosystem. For instance, data from Ultrasound.money shows that the rate of increment in ETH supply has steadily decreased post the Merge upgrade and it is also helping maintaining ETH scarcity by burning significant supply regularly.\n\nBenefits of Staking ETH\n\nEthereum provides numerous benefits to users and entities who wish to participate in staking and securing the blockchain network. Below are some key benefits of staking on Ethereum for users:\n\n1. Passive Rewards\n\nThe primary benefit of staking ETH is getting rewarded in exchange with newly minted ETH as block rewards plus transaction fees. As a validator, users who stake ETH get to verify transactions and add them into blocks. Each of these transactions have associated gas fees which are rewarded to that particular validator who verifies it and adds it to the blockchain network.\n\n2. Network Effects\n\nStaking is a crucial element for PoS blockchain networks like Ethereum as it makes it secure and decentralized. As stakers are responsible for verifying and validating transactions, it is necessary for them to function in a fair and transparent manner so that the security of the blockchain network is preserved.\n\n3. Sustainability\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is periodically locked in the system so that its economical value remains sustained until it is unstaked. This brings prolific sustainability and empowers value creation within the blockchain ecosystem. Locking of ETH also contributes to narrowing the selling pressure in live markets.\n\nHow to Stake ETH\n\nThere are different ways to stake ETH and harness its benefits. All these staking methods are separate from one another on the basis of technicality, reward bars, and ease of implementation.\n\nLet\u2019s understand it all in detail;\n\nSolo Staking\n\nThe method of Solo Staking involves setting up a node on Ethereum with a manual process. It is also known as native staking where stakers directly interact with the Ethereum network. The solo stakers will participate in securing the network all by themselves with their hardware devices to verify and validate transactions.\n\nAlthough it requires 32 ETH as a staking deposit for a node to become a validator and secure the network. Additionally, a sophisticated computer system is also essential for an Ethereum client to run, which is the software containing information on the whole blockchain. Such requirements make solo staking a hefty process and burden to people with no such experience in software engineering.\n\nHowever, this method represents the gold standard for staking on Ethereum with higher responsibilities than other methods and higher staking rewards. To run a node and become a solo staker, it\u2019s recommended to follow the official guide from Ethereum.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nAs the interest in ETH staking has grown rapidly, many \u201cStaking as a Service\u201d platforms have arrived in the past few years. These platforms allow you to stake ETH as a third-party service provider which then manages all your technical requirements including node set-up and hardware. It means that users can benefit from staking rewards without being worried about running their own validator node on Ethereum.\n\nThis method essentially enables non-technical users to participate in stalking while leaving technical aspects to someone else. All it requires is for users to generate keys and deposit 32 ETH for service providers. In exchange for their service, these staking service providers will charge minimal fees from staking rewards and send back the remaining rewards to users.\n\nStaking Pools\n\nStaking Pools allow individuals to stake a flexible amount of ETH instead of the standard 32 ETH in order to partake into staking. It enables earning staking rewards without the need for extensive technical knowledge or running their validator node. Instead of staking alone, users can send their ETH to a liquidity pool from where combined staking is initiated. Once a pool reaches to 32 ETH by collective deposits from different users, it automatically deploys a node and starts functioning as a validator.\n\nThis innovative staking method makes it possible for users to contribute any ETH amount and secure Ethereum network as a validator. Then the pool operator entity uses all the shared deposits to join the native staking on Ethereum. When staking pools receive rewards, it is distributed to participants in accordance with their initial stake.\n\nStaking on Exchanges\n\nOne of the easiest and most convenient methods of staking ETH is accessing it via centralized crypto exchanges. It involves depositing of ETH to a centralized exchange platform which offers staking facility. This is usually regarded as the safest and most handy staking process as exchanges provide guarantees to users for security as well as rewards.\n\nAlthough the exchanges require to send ETH to their wallets and giveaway asset custody which possesses risk for users. It essentially means that exchanges retain ownership of user\u2019s assets and the risk of loss is increased. Most of the popular exchanges offer staking services to users including Binance, ByBit, Coinbase, and others.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem, staking opens up exciting opportunities for users to participate in blockchain security and earn rewards. Ethereum stays at the forefront of staking with its robust position among blockchain networks. Staking ETH not only offers economic benefits but also contributes to the decentralization, security, and stability of the Ethereum network."

        "title": "Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD \u2013 Top Winners Revealed - TradingView",
        "content": "In the first quarter of the year, Solana-based meme coins have emerged as the frontrunners, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s meme coin ecosystem and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, according to a recent report by market data platform CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis shift in popularity signifies a change in dynamics within the cryptocurrency market, with meme coins gaining traction and challenging previously dominant narratives such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana Ecosystem Dominates Growth Chart\n\nThe CoinMarketCap report highlights that the Solana ecosystem has consistently topped the growth chart for the past eight months, with over 20 new tokens introduced in Q2 alone.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem followed closely behind with 14 new tokens, while Derivatives and Stablecoins witnessed relatively lesser growth with 5 and 4 new tokens, respectively. This surge in Solana-based token offerings indicates a growing interest in the network and its potential.\n\nSolana\u2019s meme coin ecosystem, in particular, has gained significant momentum in price performance and popularity since October 2023. Although Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain, Solana\u2019s growing prominence suggests a noteworthy trend in the crypto space.\n\nInterestingly, SOL memes have significantly outperformed ETH memes, delivering an average return of 8,469% compared to 962% for Ethereum, as seen in the chart below.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nAs \u201cspeculative capital\u201d from other chains rushed into Solana, attracted by the explosive rallies of tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), more meme coins experienced price surges, attracting additional attention and capital.\n\nThe top winners in the meme coin space include the cat characters MEW, POPCAT, and Book of Meme (MEME). These tokens have outperformed even the most popular ones like WIF, BONK, Ethereum\u2019s Pepe coin (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNotably, political memes also emerged as a popular subcategory, with the leading MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin gaining over 5100% year-to-date, largely due to vocal support for crypto from former President Donald Trump and the acceptance of crypto for campaign donations.\n\nEthereum Tops Fee Income Rankings\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s significant gains, Ethereum continues to dominate the Layer 1 (L1) smart contracts market, representing 62.11% of the major L1s. The report notes that Ethereum\u2019s recent milestone was propelled by the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Solana have also gained traction, adding $42 billion and $18 billion to their market share among L1 networks. Solana currently leads with over 1.6 million active daily addresses, followed by BNB with 1 million active addresses.\n\nIn Q2, Ethereum experienced record low gas fees, reaching levels not seen since 2020 due to the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions and the market excitement surrounding Solana-based meme coins.\n\nDespite representing 62% of the market cap among major L1s, Ethereum accounted for 70% of the daily revenue, generating approximately $2.7 million. Solana ranked second with around $900,000 in daily revenue.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, Ethereum topped the fee income rankings in the past year with $2.728 billion, followed by Bitcoin with $1.302 billion.\n\nOther notable networks include Tron ($459.39 million), Solana ($241.29 million), Binance Smart Chain ($176.56 million), Avalanche ($68.83 million), zkSync Era ($59.77 million), Optimism ($40.4 million), and Polygon ($23.91 million).\n\nDespite both platforms experiencing success in various financial metrics and growth charts, Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, has significantly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s ETH token.\n\nAs of the current trading price, SOL is valued at $143.25, showcasing a year-to-date growth of 650%. ETH has seen a more modest surge of 68% during the same time frame, currently trading at $3,310.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ethereum Developers Unveils EIP-7732 Designed for Speed - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum developers have proposed an exciting update, EIP-7732, which aims to overhaul the block validation process and accelerate the blockchain. This proposal introduces significant changes designed to bolster security and performance by bifurcating the process into consensus and execution stages.\n\nIn response to the ever-growing demand for efficiency, EIP-7732 aligns with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s advocacy for quicker transaction confirmation times. At the heart of this proposal lies the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS), a groundbreaking method that splits block creation into two distinct roles: the consensus proposer and the execution proposer.\n\nImage Source: Farcaster (Vitalik Buterin exploring methods to enhance the confirmation speed of Ethereum transactions)\n\nUnder this new system, the consensus proposer selects the execution proposer, who then commits to generating a valid block pack or a block hash. Ensuring this block\u2019s timely submission is a dedicated group of validators known as the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC).\n\nBy segregating the consensus and execution layers, EIP-7732 aims to alleviate the computational burden on validators, thereby enhancing network efficiency and speed. Presently, validators juggle both roles in rapid succession, a process filled with potential inefficiencies and delays.\n\nEPBS promises a solution by allowing validators to immediately handle consensus and defer execution validation, all without compromising performance or security.\n\nMoreover, this proposal introduces a trust-free exchange mechanism between builders and proposers. This guarantees payment and the inclusion of valid blocks, eliminating the need for intermediary middleware. As Buterin emphasized in a recent post, \u201cOne of the important properties of a good blockchain user experience is fast transaction confirmation times.\u201d\n\nThanks to the transaction fee overhaul of EIP-1559 and consistent block times post-merge, Ethereum\u2019s transaction confirmation now ranges between five and twenty seconds. While this matches the speed of credit card transactions, certain applications demand even faster processing, far outpacing the current 12-second Gasper consensus mechanism.\n\nWith EIP-7732 under discussion, the promise of swifter transaction speeds seems within reach. However, this advancement may come with the necessity of another hard fork, introducing backward-incompatible changes."

Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th. via @emily_graffeo @olgakharif pic.twitter.com/NG8xhtCP21 \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2024\n\nEthereum ETF Hopefuls\n\nRecent SEC feedback to issuers involved minor questions, which are being addressed, the report added.\n\nHead of asset management at Galaxy Digital, Steve Kurz, told Bloomberg that an Ether ETF could potentially be approved within the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2013 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nMajor asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark 21Shares, and Invesco have pending filings, but many issuers have yet to disclose their fund fees, which is a necessary step before trading begins.\n\nIt is also unclear if Ethereum ETFs will generate demand similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed $52 billion in assets since they launched in January.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that the Ethereum ETF flows could be around 10% to 15% of Bitcoin ETF flows and that ETH prices may fall as much as 30% following their launch.\n\nHowever, crypto research firm K33 Research expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in July.\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader,\u201d wrote K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde in a July 2 report.\n\nBitcoin is facing potential selling pressure from a forthcoming distribution of almost $9 billion worth of BTC related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nETH Price Declines\n\nEthereum prices are not showing any positive momentum today. The asset fell 3% to an intraday low of $3,342 during Asian trading on Wednesday.\n\nETH topped $3,500 in a ten-day high earlier this week but shadowed its big brother as crypto markets failed to break resistance and retreated once again.\n\nEthereum is currently 17% down from its 2024 peak of just over $4,000 and 31% down from its November 2021 all-time high."

Around 12 pm today, it was trading at $61,035.66. The slide in BTC had an impact on other altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Tether, Dogecoin , Avalanche, and Shiba Inu which were down by up to 2.5%.Altcoins that were trading in the green around this time included Solana, XRP , Toncoin, Cardano, and Tron which gained up to 2%.The crypto market's lackluster trade could be attributed to the remarks by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish statement which said that the Central Bank needs more evidence on inflation to decide on the timing of the rate cuts. Moreover, the May jobs data was reported higher-than-expected.Bitcoin's decline reflects both concerns and opportunities in the crypto market, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin said as he highlighted strong trading volume of $20 billion over the past day, indicating significant market activity. \"The news suggests that large holders of Bitcoin, known as whales, are piling up, indicating confidence in a potential year-end rally,\" he said.Vishwanath said that BTC is currently finding support within an ascending channel of around $61,700 though it faces resistance at the 50-day EMA at $62,210, suggesting a limited immediate upside. \"With the RSI at 48, indicating neutral sentiment, the market is depending on Bitcoin's ability to hold above $61,700 to avoid a deeper decline to the $60,700 and $60,000 support levels,\" he added.Source: CoinMarketCapOn the BTC price movement, CoinDCX Research Team in a note said that the current drop filled most of the weekend BTC CME gap, though another gap remains around $59,700-$59,800 which suggests that BTC could drop further to fill it.Currently, Solana is outperforming BTC and ETH due to ETF hype, the note said, adding that the market is slightly negative due to bearishness in BTC.\"Bitcoin has been consolidating around $61,000 for the past 24 hours, following some profit-taking by traders. It's having a hard time breaking past the $63,600 resistance level. If it doesn't manage to hold its current position, Bitcoin might drop back to the $60,800 support level, with bulls trying to keep it above that mark,\" Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex warned.He pins his hopes on approval to Ether ETFs which he said could improve the market sentiments.Also Read: Gold\u2019s 13% uptick beats Nifty's H1CY24 gains.

        "content": "As Ethereum\u2019s price continues to trend lower, investors are wondering whether the bull market is over. Yet, there is still a key support level that can provide the staging grounds for a recovery.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been trending lower inside a large descending channel pattern. In the last few days, the market has failed to reclaim the $3,500 level, and it dropped lower following a bearish rejection.\n\nCurrently, a decline toward the $3,000 support level, which coincides with both the lower boundary of the channel and the 200-day moving average, could be expected.\n\nWhile this confluence of support elements makes $3,000 a strong support zone, if it gets broken down, things can get much worse very quickly.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe shows a clear picture of the price\u2019s rejection from the $3,500 resistance level. The $3,350 short-term support zone is also getting broken to the downside, making $3,000 a probable upcoming target for ETH.\n\net, investors should keep an eye on the RSI, as it has entered the oversold region, which could point to a potential recovery soon.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nTaker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nAnalyzing the futures market metrics for Ethereum can be a great complement to price analysis. This chart demonstrates one of the most useful futures market metrics, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio.\n\nIt measures whether the buyers or sellers are more aggressive in executing their orders on aggregate.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, following the rejection from the $4,000 level, a huge volume of market sell orders has been executed in the futures market, bringing the Taker Buy Sell Ratio to its lowest value in the past few months. This indicates that futures market traders believe the price will be dropping even lower in the short term."

        "title": "Hops on the Blockchain: How Ethereum Is Revolutionizing the Beer Industry - Washington Beer Blog",
        "content": "Image from pexels.com.\n\nFor many years, beer has been something that helps people relax and enjoy social events. It is also a sign of celebration and an important part of different cultures. However, how beer goes from the farm to your glass can be quite mysterious.\n\nMany people who love their favorite beers do not know much about where these drinks come from, how the ingredients are sourced, or what kind of effect making them has on the environment. This lack of clear information is becoming more and more worrisome for buyers, especially because craft beer is getting very popular nowadays.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum. It is the second-biggest blockchain platform globally and it can\u2019t be said for sure what will the Ethereum price prediction tomorrow will be. But one thing we know is that its ability to change the beer industry cannot be ignored. This new technology has great potential for changing how we keep records of beer, comprehend its history and relate with those who make it \u2013 all in a way that could greatly benefit this thriving sector.\n\nTransparency From Grain to Glass\n\nImagine picking up your favorite IPA and raising a glass, knowing exactly where every hop in that brew was grown \u2013 right down to the specific farm, their green methods and even when they were harvested. With Ethereum blockchain technology, this is possible now. Brewers can use this technology to note each step in making beer, starting from getting raw materials like hops and barley all the way to putting the finished beer into bottles.\n\nThis information is then kept safe on a digital ledger that nobody can alter, and anyone can see. People who buy the beer use simple apps to check this data, making sure where their beer came from and how good it is. This openness builds trust between brewers and customers, allowing the customers to make smart buying choices that match their values.\n\nA Toast to Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability\n\nMany consumers now want to support businesses that are ethical and have sustainable practices. Blockchain can be very useful for making sure there is transparency in these aspects. Breweries dedicated to using organic ingredients can place this data on the blockchain, giving consumers verifiable evidence.\n\nAdditionally, this technology has the ability to track the carbon footprint of beer throughout the whole supply chain. This helps breweries find places where they can do better and do less harm to the environment. Picture a world where lovers of craft beer can pick their favorite drink, knowing it was made with little harm to the environment \u2013 making both their taste buds and the planet happy.\n\nStreamlining Distribution: Smart Contracts for a Smoother Brew\n\nIn the beer distribution world, there is a complicated web of breweries, distributors and retailers. These parties often face inefficiencies such as errors in orders or invoices due to miscommunication between them.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts can solve this issue by automating tasks like ordering from the brewery, creating an invoice for the distributor and making payment \u2013 all executed without any need for human intervention. This not only cuts down on administrative expenses but also gets rid of mistakes and hold-ups linked to conventional ways.\n\nConsider a situation in which a distributor automatically places an order for more of a well-liked IPA from a brewery whenever the inventory levels decrease, all because of a smart contract. This method greatly enhances efficiency for each participant involved \u2013 starting with the brewer up to the distributor and eventually ending at the consumer who receives their preferred beer more swiftly.\n\nCraft Beer Goes Global\n\nFor craft breweries, the main problem they encounter in exporting their beers is the complicated regulations and huge amount of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help with this by creating an easy-to-use system for international trade that guarantees safety and prevents any changes to documents or transactions.\n\nFor small breweries, this might be a game-changer. They can make use of it to enter new markets and distribute their special brews all over the world. Picture a dedicated craft brewer in Seattle smoothly exporting their IPA that won awards to a beer festival in Europe, with blockchain dealing with all required paperwork without any issues.\n\nBig Beer Embraces Blockchain\n\nThe craft beer market is perfect for blockchain, yet big players are also becoming interested. In 2018, it was said that Anheuser-Busch InBev \u2013 the biggest brewer globally \u2013 utilized Ethereum to monitor advertising details about its Budweiser brand. This shows how blockchain can be beneficial even for the largest businesses in this industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a company to last for the next 100 plus years and that can only be done by disrupting existing paradigms through innovation and putting consumers at the heart of everything we do,\u201d said Lucas Herscovici, AB InBev\u2019s Global Marketing Vice President of Consumer Connections, Insights and Innovation.\n\n\u201cWhen we started digging into the potential of blockchain, we began to realize that if Kiip was started today, it would be built on blockchain technology,\u201d said Brian Wong, founder and CEO of Kiip, a leading ad tech and data platform powering mobile advertising. \u201cBlockchain\u2019s magical impact comes in the form of its immutable and decentralized ledger technology. Data that is stored uniquely in thousands of servers can never be manipulated. We saw this technology\u2019s potential to impact several major areas of the advertising world, including supply-chain transparency, campaign data reconciliation and viewability verification. Single Ledger, quite frankly, is just the beginning for us.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Budweiser\u2019s move to purchase the domain name \u201cBeer.eth\u201d for 30 ETH (around $81,000 at the time) and an NFT art piece for 8 ETH (around $21,000) further highlights the growing interest in blockchain within the beer industry.\n\nBrewing a Brighter Future\n\nWhile blockchain technology gives exciting possibilities, there are issues to think about before it can be used everywhere. One main problem is scalability \u2013 for example, the Ethereum network sometimes gets crowded and this might make transaction processing slower.\n\nGovernments must solve complex regulatory challenges as they figure out how to fit blockchain technology into current legal systems. And also, it is very important that consumers learn about this technology. Many people still do not know much about blockchain, so brewers must find good methods to explain the advantages of this technology.\n\nA Toast to Innovation\n\nEven with these difficulties, the possible advantages of blockchain for the beer industry are clear. By making things transparent, encouraging honest sourcing and improving the distribution process, blockchain can give more power to both brewers and people who buy beer.\n\nAs technology becomes better and these problems are solved, we can see even more new uses coming up. The future of beer appears very promising, with the addition of blockchain making things clearer, smoother and more fun for all people taking part in it.\n\nImagine a future where breweries can make interactive experiences on the blockchain. This way, people can go on virtual tours of hop farms or join special beer releases with safe token ownership. The chances for fun and new ideas are really without limit.\n\nDedicated to working together, creating new ideas and learning continuously, blockchain technology can change the beer industry greatly. This will make everything more connected, eco-friendly and enjoyable for everyone involved \u2013 from the enthusiastic brewers making the beer to those who truly appreciate drinking it.\n\nSo, next time you open a chilled drink, take a short moment to think about the journey it made to be there. Maybe with blockchain technology, someday you\u2019ll even track that path yourself\u2014from \u201chops on the blockchain\u201d to delightful sips."

Even though the uptrend remains, since gains of May 20 weren\u2019t wiped clean, there are cracks developing. These fissures are widening after ETH closed below $3,300 today, confirming yesterday\u2019s losses. If the dump continues, the probability of the coin crashing to as low as $3,000 would be elevated, denting sentiment.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is bearish, breaking below a critical support level. As things stand, Ethereum is down 5% in the last day and week. Since the coin is in red, there have been changes in trend; the coin is sliding on rising participation. Over the last day, the average trading volume rose to over $18 billion. This points to traders flowing in, possibly unloading.\n\nTraders and investors are monitoring the following Ethereum trending news:\n\nGTA 6, the popular video game, reports show that it will support other crypto assets apart from BTC , ETH, and USDT. The expansion of the number of coins accepted is a huge boost as far as adoption is concerned.\n\nCircle and Paxos are now regulated in the European Union, compliant with MiCA laws . Meanwhile, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale, one of the largest banks in France, is launching its stablecoins on Ethereum. More TradFi companies are choosing the first smart contracts platform over modern solutions like Solana.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nETH/USD is under immense selling pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart.\n\nWith the drop of July 3 and early today, every high below $3,300 could offer entries for aggressive sellers targeting $3,000 in the short term.\n\nSince the drop was comprehensive, the probability of ETH sliding below $3,000 to as low as $2,800 remains elevated.\n\nNotice that the gains of May 20 are yet to be completely erased, giving hope to optimistic Ethereum buyers.\n\nIf ETH unexpectedly picks up momentum, winding up recent gains, and breaks $3,500, it would be a huge boost for bulls."

According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, Ethereum ETFs are expected to become available for trading as early as July 15th.\n\nGeraci stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Thus, July 15, Monday, would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th.

Sources familiar with the matter stated that the issuers have been already working on it. As we know, in May, the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings to list the Ether ETFs on exchanges. However, they can only go live for trading after the SEC approves the S-1 submissions.\n\nSteve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, expected the Ether ETF approval in the next couple of weeks. Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, July 2, Kurtz said:\n\n\u201cThis is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2014 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nNow the bigger question in everyone\u2019s mind is will the Ether ETF prove to be a strong catalyst to drive the crypto market higher?\n\nAlso Read: Why Are Ethereum Institutional Products Depleting Before ETF Launch?\n\nEthereum to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nOn Tuesday, K33 Research published a report stating that Ethereum would be outperforming Bitcoin post the ETF approval. As per K33, the launch of Ether ETfs would absorb nearly 0.75% to 1% of all ETH in circulation within the initial five months. This expectation is in line with that of Gemini which predicted $5 billion inflows within the first six months of launch. K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said:\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched, reaching 0.046 by May 24. However, unexpected news that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs boosted the ratio back up to 0.055.\n\nAlso Read: ETH/BTC Price Prediction: ETF Hype, FOMO and Ethereum Price Imminent Rally To $5,000\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "K33 Research says that Ethereum spot ETFs will accrue up to 1% of the Ether supply, or $4 billion, pushing ETH to outperform Bitcoin, which faces selling pressure as Mt. Gox creditors get refunded.\n\nThe firm says that ETH is trading at a steep discount against BTC but noted that Ether\u2019s futures interest was soaring, indicating that traders are accruing the altcoin on high leverage.\n\nK33 Research says Ethereum spot ETFs will change the game for the largest altcoin, making it a better investment than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Norwegian analytics company, formerly Arcane Research, says that most investors don\u2019t realize Ether\u2019s vast opportunity. This is reflected in its continued suppressed price, even as the green light for the launch of the ETH ETFs edges closer.\n\nThe company believes that once the ETFs launch, they will quickly rack up around 1% of all circulating Ethereum, equating to 1.2 million ETH, or $3.86 billion. It stated:\n\nWe maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 #Ethereum (ETH) set to outshine #Bitcoin (BTC) post-ETF launch! \ud83d\udcb9 K33 Research: 'We maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.' Get ready for a bullish ride! \ud83d\udcc8\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SB9fTggK9M \u2014 Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) July 3, 2024\n\nMarket experts have yet to come to a consensus on when the SEC will nod to the ETH ETFs. As Crypto News Flash reported, some, like ETF Store President Nate Geraci and Consensys\u2019 Jimmy Ragosa, believe the approval will be in mid-July. Others believe it\u2019s towards the end of the month, while a few others believe the SEC\u2019s move to return the applications with its comments will lengthen the application process beyond July.\n\nAll analysts concur that these products will forever change Ethereum regardless of the timeline. American exchange and custodian says they will rack up $5 billion in the first six months, while K33 Research has a slightly more conservative estimate at $3.86 billion.\n\nThe firm said:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nCan ETFs Push Ethereum Beyond $5,000?\n\nBitcoin ETFs launched in mid-January, and two months later, the top coin hit its all-time high just below $74,000, dragging the entire market with it. Ethereum soared to $4000 at the time.\n\nAnalysts believe that a similar effect will take place once ETH ETFs launch. However, according to K33, ETH might \u201cstumble immediately following the launch of the ETFs\u201d from the \u201csell the news\u201d phenomenon. However, they expect it to pick up pace immediately and, by the end of the year, hit new heights.\n\nK33 says it\u2019s surprised that more traders aren\u2019t accumulating ETH in anticipation of the coming surge. Year-to-date, the top altcoin has only gained 45%, around the same as BTC and lower than BNB and other lower-cap altcoins.\n\nHowever, those in the derivatives market are catching on. Data shows that ETH futures open interest has been surging \u201crelentlessly\u201d as more traders take on higher leverage to buy ETH in anticipation of the price rise.\n\nEthereum trades at $3,313 at press time, dipping 3.5% in the past day.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Short-term Analysis\n\nIn the short term, Ethereum price movement suggests a cautious outlook. The 1.71% decrease in the last 24 hours, coupled with a bearish MACD and a nearing oversold RSI, indicates that sellers currently dominate the market. However, the approach towards the first support level at US$3,347.7 could attract buyers, potentially stabilizing the price and providing a platform for recovery.\n\nMedium-term Analysis\n\nOver the medium term, the 1.05% decline over the past week reflects ongoing bearish sentiment. The support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining the next phase of price movement. If Ethereum holds above the first support level and manages to breach the first resistance level, it could signal a shift in momentum toward a more bullish outlook.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nThe overall market sentiment for Ethereum remains mixed. While the current technical indicators point to a bearish trend, the approaching support levels and near-oversold RSI suggest the potential for a rebound. Traders and investors should closely monitor these key levels and technical indicators to make informed decisions."

ETH started another decline below the $3,320 support zone like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $3,250 and $3,220 support levels.\n\nThe price declined 5% and even tested the $3,150 support. A low was formed at $3,156 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $3,200 resistance level. The price is now testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,426 swing high to the $3,156 low.\n\nEthereum is trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $3,250 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,300 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,426 swing high to the $3,156 low.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,325 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major hurdle is near the $3,365 level. A close above the $3,365 level might send Ether toward the $3,450 resistance. The next key resistance is near $3,500. An upside break above the $3,500 resistance might send the price higher. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,200. The first major support sits near the $3,150 zone.\n\nA clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward $3,080. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,150\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,320"

        "content": "As the global financial markets prepare to launch U.S.-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ethereum is positioned to potentially outperform Bitcoin, according to a new analysis by K33 Research.\n\nThis comes amid concerns that Bitcoin might face downward pressure due to upcoming repayments to creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETF Launch to Begin a New Era for Ethereum\n\nEthereum has lagged behind Bitcoin in performance over the last year, with the former surging 67% while the latter by 95%, but that might be about to change with the anticipated launch of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expected in the coming weeks.\n\nAnalysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman from K33 Research suggest that introducing these spot ETFs could be pivotal for Ethereum\u2019s valuation.\n\nDespite a likely initial dip post-launch, they forecast that inflows into these funds will propel Ethereum\u2019s price over time, drawing a parallel to the earlier impact of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETFs, which attracted billions of dollars in inflow after launch.\n\nThis optimism is rooted in the belief that ETFs will catalyze significant capital flows into Ethereum, mirroring the influx seen with Bitcoin.\n\nThe analysts project net inflows amounting to 0.75% to 1% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply within five months post-launch, potentially setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. The analysts noted:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nWhen Will ETH Spot ETF Launch In The US?\n\nDespite the analysts\u2019 bullish outlook, the market appears skeptical, as evidenced by Ethereum futures trading at a discount relative to Bitcoin futures, as highlighted in the K33 Research.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nExperts Eye Spot Ethereum ETF Launch By Mid-July, Predict Price Rally 2 months ago\n\nEthereum is trading at around $3,312, reflecting a 3.3% drop over the past day and conceding with the ubiquitous decline in the crypto market.\n\nIn the broader context, the crypto industry is enthusiastic about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

        "content": "The crypto industry is on the verge of a potentially significant development as key figures in the sector hint at the imminent approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States, possibly triggering a notable price rally for ETH.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared insights into the expected timeline for the launch of the first spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to Geraci, current forecasts by Bloomberg predict a mid-July launch. He detailed the procedural timeline via X, stating, \u201cWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th.\u201d\n\nIn parallel, Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, confirmed to Bloomberg on July 2 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF before the month\u2019s end.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETH Price Dips As Ethereum ETF Approval Faces Delay 2 months ago\n\nKurz emphasized the extensive groundwork laid in collaboration with the SEC, drawing parallels between the proposed Ethereum ETF and Galaxy\u2019s existing spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), created with Invesco. Kurz expressed confidence in their preparedness, remarking, \u201cWe know the plumbing, we know the process\u2026 The SEC is engaged.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, aligning with the mid-July expectations. He highlighted the SEC\u2019s recent instructions to Ethereum ETF issuers for amending their S-1 registration forms by July 8, suggesting possible further amendments. Notably, the SEC approved rule changes under 19-b4 in May, facilitating the listing and trading of such funds, though the issuance of funds remained pending final approvals.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Above Key Support\n\nThe anticipation of these approvals appears to be having a stabilizing effect on Ethereum prices. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, commenting on Ethereum\u2019s current price trajectory via X, noted optimism for a near-term breakout, stating, \u201cETH \u2013 Looking more optimistic for a Q3 breakout. Liking the chances of a run towards $4,000 this or next month.\u201d According to the chart shared by him, ETH price needs to hold the region of $3,300 to $3,350 in order to rally to $4,000.\n\nSupporting this sentiment, Cold Blooded Shiller highlighted the crucial need for Ethereum to demonstrate momentum at the current price levels, specifically around the $3,400 mark, as a key indicator for a potential high-time-frame impulse.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024\u2019s Worst Performer 2 months ago\n\n\u201cETH is still in a fine position but it really needs to start showing some momentum soon. LTF divergences around this $3400 low are probably where I take one stab at trying to capture any HTF impulse away from the consolidation,\u201d he remarked via X.\n\nAdding historical perspective, analyst Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) compared the current market phase to Ethereum\u2019s long consolidation in 2016-2017 before its massive rally, urging persistence and optimism: \u201cIn 2016-2017, ETH consolidated for 50+ weeks before rallying nearly 12000 percent. Today, people are giving up after less than 20 weeks, with ETH ETFs right around the corner. Stick to the plan boys. The best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,353.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"
