        "title": "Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020 - Unchained",
        "content": "The low price of transacting is a result of the flight of activity away from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its layer 2 networks, particularly following the Dencun upgrade that occurred in March.\n\nThe average cost of a transaction on Ethereum is at its lowest level since Jan. 2020 (one gwei represents one-billionth of one ether and is the unit of ETH used to measure gas prices). The decline reflects the movement of activity from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its expansive array of Layer 2 solutions.\n\nMoreover, the release of the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced fees for those layer 2 networks, has only intensified this trend of lower transaction costs. Gas prices on Ethereum have decreased about 92% from about 63 gwei on March 12, the day before the upgrade, to around 5 gwei at presstime, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan and analytics investment platform Ycharts shows.\n\nAccording to layer 2 watchdog platform L2Beat, the number of active and upcoming L2 projects collectively stands at 95. Over the past several months, users have significantly increased the amount of crypto assets they\u2019ve bridged over to various layer 2 scaling rollups. And of the L2s, the top ones by total value locked\u2014namely, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base \u2013 have seen a spike in active daily addresses, signs of increasing user activity.\n\nRead More: Vitalik\u2019s New EIP-7702 Draws Early Support; Could Be Included in Ethereum\u2019s Next Hard Fork Upgrade\n\n\u201cWe can certainly see a trend upwards on EVM compatible chains of daily active addresses, which means users are going to cheaper alternatives. Looking at bridge data also confirms this, as bridge activity across Layer 2s has increased from ~$170mn per week to ~$300mn per week,\u201d Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Artemis, said in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has seen over $3 billion in net outflows of ETH over the past three months, per Artemis, with the majority of the flows going to L2s such as Arbitrum, zkSync, Base, Starknet, and Optimism.\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum\u2019s transaction costs is \u201ca reflection of the constant evolution of blockchain. Initially Ethereum served as the universal layer for all apps, from decentralized exchanges, to games, to trading memecoins, wrote Justin, CEO of decentralized perpetual futures platform Vest Exchange, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cHowever, with the advent of Layer 2 solutions and app chains, builders and users (and MEV bots) are realizing that there are tailored ecosystems for specific use cases. In return, we also see Ethereum to be transitioning moreso as a foundational security layer and for supporting more \u2018passive\u2019 protocols such as lending and LSTs.\u201d\n\nEthereum Post-Dencun Upgrade\n\nDencun, the most recent Ethereum hard fork that brought several codebase changes, went live on mainnet on March 13.\n\nWhile the number of transactions has remained stable at just over one million per day, the amount of fees paid by end users of Ethereum has plummeted since Dencun, per Artemis.\n\nWith less overall transaction fees, the amount of ETH burned has gone down as well. According to Ethereum analytics platform Ultra Sound Money, the amount of ETH issued in the past thirty days is more than the amount of ETH burned, one outcome of the Dencun upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe new supply of ETH is now growing at the fastest daily rate since the Merge as fees burned plummeted as a consequence of the Dencun upgrade,\u201d analysts at blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant wrote in a report published on Wednesday.\n\nThe price of ETH reached a multi-year high of $4,000 on the day of Dencun, but has since dropped roughly 25% to around $3,015 at the time of publication, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Ethereum spot ETFs will likely be denied on May 23.\n\nProspective issuers probably won\u2019t sue the SEC \u2014 even though the strategy worked to get Bitcoin ETFs out.\n\nThe US election may hold the key to an approval.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission will probably deny applications for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds on May 23.\n\nThe lack of meaningful interaction with prospective issuers, coupled with Ethereum\u2019s ambiguous regulatory status, have made analysts pessimistic about the chances.\n\nNot to mention the SEC\u2019s recent investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThat means spot Ethereum ETFs probably won\u2019t see the light until the end of 2025, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News.\n\nFaced with a rejection, prospective ETF issuers \u2014 like BlackRock, Fidelity, or Ark Invest \u2014 have two options: either sue the SEC like Grayscale did for the Bitcoin spot ETFs, or file again at a later date.\n\nFactoring into the equation is the US election. Should former President Donald Trump win a second term in the White House, the SEC is likely to face a change of leadership. And a new chair could be friendlier towards crypto than Gary Gensler.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a new president, you file again,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cMaybe you get approved. Or you sue. Either way, that will take a whole other year to play out.\u201d\n\nSuing the SEC\n\nThe SEC spent years shooting down Bitcoin spot ETF applications before Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the regulator in protest in 2022.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn September, a judge found that the SEC had acted in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner by denying the applications. Four months later, the Bitcoin ETFs were launched.\n\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely that the strategy will be replicated for Ethereum ETFs. For one, Grayscale will probably not bring the fire to the SEC a second time, Balchunas told DL News.\n\nLawsuits are expensive \u2014 not just in terms of money, but in attention and bandwidth too. And after suffering massive outflows when its Bitcoin trust was converted into an ETF, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Grayscale did not aggressively pursue a conversion of its Ethereum trust.\n\nOther prospective issuers, meanwhile, won\u2019t dare pick up the baton and sue the regulator themselves, Balchunas said.\n\n\u201cNone of these other firms want to piss off the SEC,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cGrayscale was unique in that it wasn\u2019t a big ETF issuer. The rest of these firms have other things going on, and they\u2019re more scared.\u201d \u201cNobody else will step up,\u201d he added.\n\nElection time\n\nAnd why sue the SEC when the US presidential election, slated this November, may solve the problem?\n\nWith Trump leading in some polls, the odds that a new SEC chair will be appointed are higher than previously expected.\n\n\u201cTrump is not necessarily pro-crypto,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cRemember his previous SEC chief Jay Clayton didn\u2019t allow that ETF either. So he\u2019s not going to be like, \u2018let\u2019s just go crazy.\u2019 But he\u2019ll probably still be better for crypto and spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAssuming a new chair is appointed in April or May, and filings submitted immediately afterwards, that could bring the deadline for approval or rejection to somewhere around December 2025.\n\nAlternatively, issuers could try to file as soon as the election is over \u2014 or even before results are in \u2014 to speed up the timeline.\n\nAnd if Joe Biden wins?\n\n\u201cIn the past cycles, when they denied spot Bitcoin ETFs, there was usually a cooling off period for like a year where nobody did anything,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cAnd then out of the blue someone is like, \u2018Oh, the hell with it\u2019 and files again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy guess is that issuers will take the summer, lick their wounds, just be bummed, and then see what happens in the election,\u201d he added.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s \u2018ultrasound\u2019 money narrative is at risk after the Dencun upgrade, said CryptoQuant.\n\nEthereum's EIP-7702 would address concerns raised about the previous EIP-3074.\n\nEthereum's recent price action suggests it may be gathering momentum for a bullish run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action on Wednesday shows it could be gathering momentum for a rally as a recent report from CryptoQuant reveals its ultrasound money narrative is at risk. Also, the number one altcoin's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and co-authors have published Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702 as an alternative to EIP-3074.\n\nRead more: Ethereum resume sideways move as Grayscale files to withdraw Ethereum futures ETF application with the SEC\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ultrasound money, EIP-7702, Ethereum Foundation\n\nEthereum is set to see interesting updates on its blockchain following recent developments. Here are key market movers for the top altcoin:\n\nA recent report by CryptoQuant highlights that Ethereum is becoming inflationary following the Dencun upgrade in March. After the Merge that saw Ethereum transitioning from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, the network began burning gas fees at a significant rate that saw a significant reduction in the growth of ETH's circulating supply.\n\nHowever, since the Dencun upgrade, when the introduction of \"blobs\" reduced Ethereum's network activity to boost its scalability and reduce user fees, the amount of gas fees burned has reduced significantly.\n\n\"Before the Dencun upgrade, the higher network activity on Ethereum meant higher fees burned and hence less ether supply. However, after the Dencun upgrade, the total amount of fees burned has decoupled from the network activity,\" noted CryptoQuant. As a result, this puts ETH's 'ultrasound' money narrative at risk since its circulating supply would begin increasing over time.\n\n\"We conclude that, at the current rate of network activity, Ethereum will not be deflationary again, and the narrative of 'ultrasound' money has probably died or would need much higher network activity to come back to life,\" said CryptoQuant.\n\nFurthermore, following several concerns raised about EIP-3074, which was considered for inclusion in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and co-authors Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett proposed EIP-7702 as an alternative.\n\n3074 = upgrade for normal \"EOA\" wallets to give some smart wallet functionality\n\n4337 = standard for smart contract wallets\n\n\n\n3074 was slated for inclusion, v likely worried the long term implications of\n\n1) compatibility btwn 3074 and 4337 wallets\n\n2) 3074 breaking in a future\u2026 \u2014 hayden.eth (@haydenzadams) May 7, 2024\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that would allow externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act as smart contracts during a transaction. Like EIP-3074, the new proposal would enable better ways to abstract gas fees, batch transactions, and improve the user experience. However, it goes further by improving compatibility with the ERC-4337 standard for smart contract wallets \u2014 an issue with EIP-3074 \u2014 and being more future-proof.\n\nSome crypto community members have speculated that EIP-7702 would replace EIP-3074 in the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade. One X user commented, \"I think it would probably make more sense to include in Pectra than 3074.\"\n\nFireblocks' VP of Technology Arik Galansky also commented on the proposal saying, \"It's a long while since Ethereum introduced changes that are user-oriented rather than scaling-oriented and this one is right on point.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, EIP-3074 sent the AA world into shambles.\n\n\n\nInitially it looked like it's synergetic with ERC-4337, since they do different things. One enables EOA migration, another enables decentralized mempools.\n\n\n\nHowever, the nitty gritty details looked suboptimal: it's hard\u2026 \u2014 Ivo e/acc (@Ivshti) May 7, 2024\n\nAlso read: Ethereum traders show uncertainty, SEC delays decision on Invesco's ETH ETF application\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation appeared to be dumping ETH again on Wednesday following a transfer of 1,000 ETH worth $3 million to middle multisig address 0xbc9, according to data from Spot On Chain.\n\nThis transfer is the latest action in a larger trend where the Ethereum Foundation has sold 1,766 ETH for 4.81 million DAI stablecoin at ~$2,725 since the beginning of 2024. The ETH sales, done in small batches through the same middle multisig address 0xbc9, often coincide with brief Ethereum price declines, noted Spot On Chain.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could be gathering momentum for a bullish run\n\nThe market remained quiet on Wednesday as Ethereum continued trading around the $3,000 mark. Despite the calm market, ETH derivatives volume in May has risen higher \u2014 close to 60% \u2014 than that of Bitcoin, according to QCP.\n\nRead more: Ethereum could see a brief rally despite Michael Saylor's jab at ETH ETFs\n\nThe reason for the increase may be the market pricing in volatility over the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision on Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application on May 23, noted QCP. This also explains why the market is slightly tilted toward a downward movement as many expect the SEC to deny spot ETH ETF applications.\n\nWhile current price action indicates ETH may continue a horizontal movement in upcoming weeks, historical data suggests the largest altcoin could be gathering momentum for a bullish run. Considering ETH has remained in the $2,852 to $3,300 range for nearly a month, it could attempt a sustained breakout above the upper level of the range if it sees a slight bullish trigger.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOnchain data also shows most whales have been accumulating ETH around this range in anticipation of a price rally. A bearish event could see it break below the lower level of the range briefly, presenting a buying opportunity.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,013 on Wednesday, May 8, down 0.7% on the day."

        "title": "Shiba Inu Eyes $0.001 Amidst Supply Challenges, Ethereum Targets Uptrend with EIP-7702, Furrever Token Rallies Community with $20,000 Competition - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, May 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to offer diverse investment opportunities with unique growth potentials. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR) each present distinct scenarios, from SHIB's long-term aspirations to hit a significant price milestone, Ethereum's ongoing technological enhancements amid regulatory scrutiny, to Furrever Token's engaging community-driven initiatives. These developments highlight the varying strategies and market dynamics that investors and enthusiasts can navigate.\n\nShiba Inu's Road to $0.001: A Millionaire Maker for the Patient Investor\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), the cryptocurrency that captured the hearts of many young investors, continues to hold the community's attention despite its fluctuating market performance. Originating as a favorite among retail investors, SHIB has created significant wealth for its early backers, with some even reaching millionaire status. Although the token is currently far from its all-time high of $0.00008616 achieved in October 2021, the undying optimism among its supporters envisions a milestone price of $0.001 per SHIB.\n\nTo become a millionaire at this ambitious target price, an investor would need to hold approximately one billion SHIB tokens, currently valued at about $23,972. This significant number reflects not only the potential high reward but also the substantial risk associated with such an investment in the volatile crypto market.\n\nPredictions on when SHIB might reach the $0.001 mark vary, with forecasts suggesting a timeline between 2033 and 2040. Such a long horizon necessitates patience and enduring confidence in Shiba Inu\u2019s market strategy and broader adoption. The primary challenge facing SHIB is its massive circulating supply of 589 trillion coins, which poses a substantial barrier to significant price increases. Achieving a price of $0.001 with such a vast number of tokens would result in an unrealistically large market capitalization, not seen in current crypto valuations.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the SHIB development team is actively working on new mechanisms to reduce the token supply dramatically. Rumors suggest that these new initiatives could potentially burn trillions of tokens annually, accelerating SHIB\u2019s journey towards the $0.001 goal if successfully implemented. This strategy not only aims to enhance SHIB\u2019s value but also aligns with the community's long-term vision of reducing supply to create scarcity, thereby driving up the token's price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those betting on SHIB, the path to becoming a millionaire is intertwined with the token\u2019s ability to overcome its supply challenges and achieve unprecedented growth in the coming years. This journey requires both a belief in the token\u2019s potential and the fortitude to withstand the ups and downs of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Positioned for Uptrend Amid Regulatory Developments and Technical Enhancements\n\nEthereum, a leading cryptocurrency, is showing potential for growth amidst a flurry of technical and regulatory developments. On a recent trading day, Ethereum's price was slightly down by 0.7%, trading around $3,013. However, signals of an upcoming rally are emerging, driven by significant improvements in its blockchain technology and speculative market movements.\n\nThe new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, developed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin and his team, is at the forefront of these developments. This proposal aims to innovate how externally owned accounts (EOAs) operate by allowing them to temporarily take on smart contract functionalities. This change is set to enhance the user experience significantly by simplifying gas fee processes, enabling transaction batching, and ensuring greater compatibility with the ERC-4337 smart contract wallet standard. These updates emphasize a shift toward making user-focused enhancements rather than purely technical scaling solutions, reaffirming Ethereum's commitment to its community of users.\n\nMoreover, the market is on edge as it awaits the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision regarding the Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application, expected on May 23. This decision is anticipated to cause volatility, with the community and investors closely watching for any potential impact on Ethereum's market position. Although current sentiments tend towards caution, historical trends and recent significant buying activities by large investors, commonly referred to as 'whales', suggest that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a significant upward movement. Should the market receive even slight bullish signals, Ethereum might break through the upper levels of its current price range, presenting a valuable buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nFurrever Token Stimulates Market Activity with $20,000 Competition Following Impressive Presale\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is gaining notable traction within the cryptocurrency sector by not only achieving over $1.1 million during its presale but also by initiating a lucrative buying competition. The newly announced \"Highest Total Buys Competition\" is set to distribute $20,000 worth of FURR among the top ten participants who invest the highest amounts over the course of the event. This competition is designed to further energize the Furrever community and stimulate market transactions for the FURR token.\n\nKicking off today, the 18-day competition promises generous rewards for the most active buyers. The participant with the highest total purchase will be awarded $5,000 in FURR tokens, with the second and third highest buyers receiving $4,000 and $3,000, respectively. Those who place fourth through tenth will each receive $1,000 in FURR tokens. This strategic move not only encourages community participation but also aims to enhance the liquidity and trading activity of the Furrever Token.\n\nPriced attractively at $0.000648 per token, Furrever Token presents an enticing investment opportunity with potential returns of up to 15X. The vibrant community backing the token is evident in its active Telegram group, which houses over 4,000 members. Here, investors and enthusiasts collaborate and exchange ideas, staying informed about the latest developments and strategic directions of the Furrever Token. This level of engagement and the exciting new competition underline the dynamic and promising future of the Furrever Token in the competitive cryptocurrency market.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an acerbic X post, Ethereum (ETH) veteran, prominent investor, podcaster and crypto educator Ryan Sean Adams describes two alternative midterm forecasts for Ether (ETH) as a crypto coin.\n\nBearish: Inevitable puberty of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nIn a 2024-2025 potential rally, Ethereum (ETH) might be overlooked by investors as it is going through the \"awkward\" phase of \"puberty.\" It looks too slow and expensive compared to its own second-layer solutions of various types, Adams admits.\n\nWhile L2s are necessary for the scaling of such a blockchain and reflect the founder's vision of its progress, it has nothing to do with the interests of its most obvious investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeme coin champions and dApps users (including retroactive airdrop farmers) are too focused on alternative L2/L3 blockchains, while institutional \"big money\" is on its way to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe approval of Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. might change the status quo but, as U.Today previously reported, analysts are skeptical of the possibility of this step in the coming months.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) is getting through the challenges of its \"puberty\" while \"toddler chains\" are looking for shortcuts and, therefore, might look more attractive in the midterm.\n\nBullish: Rock solid monetary economics for \"chain of 1000 chains\"\n\nAt the same time, the arguments of Ethereum (ETH) optimists also look strong as of Q2, 2024. Ethereum (ETH) meets this cycle stronger than in 2020 with viable overhyped L2s and zkEVMs driving innovations and attracting value.\n\nWith its \"rock solid monetary economics\" cemented by ERC 4337 implementation, it remains the only profitable blockchain, and its competitors are not even close to this status.\n\nAlso, despite the growing audience of alternative blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) mainnet remains the root chain for 1,000 blockchains, Adams says.\n\nThese two theses are just \"two perspectives for ETH bulls,\" the author concludes.\n\nEther (ETH) is changing hands at $2,925, being 3% down in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Solana could surpass Ethereum in transaction fees - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In a turn that could rewrite the current dynamics of the world of cryptocurrencies, Solana seems poised to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees within the next week.\n\nThis event, if it were to occur, would not only strengthen Solana\u2019s positioning in the sector, but could also further solidify its label as an \u201cEthereum-killer\u201d, despite the technical challenges and network interruptions it has recently faced.\n\nCurrent context between Ethereum and Solana for transaction fees\n\nEthereum, long considered the undisputed leader in decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi), is known for its high transaction fees, especially during network usage peaks.\n\nThis has led many developers and users to seek cheaper and more efficient alternatives, a niche in which Solana has begun to stand out thanks to its promise of speed and significantly lower transaction costs.\n\nSolana has made its way in the field of blockchain with the promise of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a capacity of Ethereum which currently revolves around 30 transactions per second.\n\nThis performance is supported by a unique consensus model, known as Proof of History (PoH), which works in tandem with the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism to optimize efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nDespite these advanced technical features, Solana has faced numerous network interruptions, raising doubts about its long-term reliability and scalability.\n\nThese technical issues have temporarily hindered its growth and have shaken the confidence of some investors and users. However, recent improvements and updates to the network aim to solve these problems, restoring confidence in the platform.\n\nImpact of reduced transaction fees\n\nIf Solana were to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees, it could attract a significantly larger number of developers and projects.\n\nThis shift would not only increase the volume of transactions on the Solana network, but could also positively influence the value of its native token, SOL.\n\nFurthermore, a reduction in fees could further democratize access to DeFi applications, making them available to a wider audience that may currently be discouraged by high fees on Ethereum.\n\nSurpassing Ethereum will not be an easy task for Solana, given Ethereum\u2019s vast user base and its extremely active developer community.\n\nFurthermore, the upcoming update of Ethereum, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to solve many of its current issues related to scalability and transaction costs.\n\nHowever, temporary success in terms of lower transaction fees could give Solana the necessary advantage to solidify its position as a credible alternative to Ethereum in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Solana\u2019s potential superiority over Ethereum in terms of transaction fees represents a significant turning point. If Solana manages to maintain lower transaction costs, it could not only attract a new wave of developers and users, but also consolidate its position as a valid alternative to Ethereum.\n\nThis evolution highlights the continuous innovation in the field of blockchain and the need for existing platforms to adapt in order to remain competitive. However, the success of Solana will depend on its ability to overcome past technical challenges and build a stable and secure network.\n\nIn a market that rewards both innovation and technical robustness, Solana has the opportunity to redefine the cryptocurrency landscape and demonstrate its value as a potential \u201cEthereum-killer\u201d in the long term."

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nThe broader crypto market has been on a steady downward trend since May 6, with the price of most assets dropping significantly. Ethereum fell from a high of $3217 to $2936 on May 8, 2024, marking an 8% price decline.\n\nEthereum is hovering around $2,984, down by 1% in the last 24 hours, its trading volume is $10.9 billion.\n\nThe prevailing downtrend has cast doubts and uncertainty about Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the coming days. Will the bulls return to trigger a rebound? Read on to find out.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Bearish Momentum Strengthens, Investors Urged to Exercise Caution\n\nEthereum is currently in a bearish trend, with several technical indicators signaling further downward pressure.\n\nEther has slipped to the lower band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting oversold conditions and further price declines. This could deter investors and traders from buying in until clearer signals emerge.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is below the signal line, indicating a bearish trend continuation. This reinforces Ethereum\u2019s negative sentiment and may prompt cautious behavior among investors.\n\nFurthermore, the SuperTrend indicator displays a sell signal, indicating that sellers are in control and may remain so in the near term.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 38, signaling that Ethereum is currently oversold. However, this does not necessarily indicate an immediate reversal in price, and investors should exercise caution when considering entry points.\n\nOverall, Ethereum\u2019s technical indicators paint a highly bearish picture, with multiple signals pointing to further downside potential.\n\nInvestors looking to enter the market may wait for the price to break above the previous $3,059 support level, which has now become a resistance. A break above this level will confirm a strong bullish momentum.\n\nHowever, given the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, traders should trade with caution and implement risk management strategies to protect their investments.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Withdraw ETF Fillings: What It Means for Ethereum Investors?\n\nGrayscale, a major crypto asset manager, has pulled back its filing for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). These moves surprised analysts like James Seyffart, who called it a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d tactic.\n\nUPDATE This is interesting. @Grayscale just withdrew their 19b-4 filing for an #Ethereum futures ETF. This was essentially a trojan horse filing in my view, in order to create the same circumstances that allowed Grayscale to win the $GBTC lawsuit (approve futures deny spot) pic.twitter.com/Kihj2dlQx1 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 7, 2024\n\nIn the analyst\u2019s words: \u201cIn my mind, might as well make the SEC write up an approval or denial for an ETH futures ETF and go from there?\u201d He suggests a discussion between the SEC and Grayscale must have prompted the withdrawal.\n\nNate Geraci, another analyst, said last month that there\u2019s a possibility that the SEC will not approve the ETH ETF. He predicted that if the SEC rejects Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF application, they might take legal action again.\n\nHowever, in a recent X thread, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, sees this withdrawal as a positive sign. He thinks Grayscale might not sue the SEC again.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s latest move could positively affect Ethereum\u2019s price, as it shows its commitment to working with regulators rather than engaging in legal battles.\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum is still down, investors might want to consider this low-cap project, which is trending in the market.\n\nDogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) At Over $13 Million \u2013 Ape In Early For Massive Gains\n\nThe Doge-inspired meme coin, Dogeverse, has seen remarkable success since its inception, echoing the enthusiasm once ignited by Dogecoin. Dogeverse aims to unite the crypto meme community and pioneer multichain utility development.\n\nFrom its presale phase, Dogeverse quickly captivated the attention of the meme coin industry, garnering significant interest with its reasonable pricing point. The presale has raised over $13 million and is rapidly winding down as May progresses, reflecting the project\u2019s appeal among investors.\n\nThe presale\u2019s concluding discount price of $0.00031 shows that the project is affordable. Interestingly, this low rate could attract even more investors in its final stages.\n\nWhy DOGEVERSE Looks Promising to Investors and Enthusiasts\n\nDogeverse stands at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market, poised to revolutionize the meme coin landscape with its multichain capabilities. Its allure lies in the adoption of multichain technology facilitated by Wormhole and Portal Bridge technologies.\n\nBy transcending the limitations of a single blockchain, Dogeverse offers unparalleled speed and convenience.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum could use a much better system for charging transaction fees from its users, the network's chief architect Vitalik Buterin argued in a widely circulated essay published Thursday.\n\nButerin's post, which laid out a path toward a more customized and equitable system, immediately garnered reactions from two principal groups: Ethereum users, who expressed their excitement at the prospect of lower fees on the network\u2019s costly mainnet; and Solana users and developers, who noticed that Buterin's proposal sounded an awful lot like the Solana network's own fee model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a Solana-esque approach,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, a prominent Solana builder and the co-founder and CEO of infrastructure startup Helius Labs, told Decrypt.\n\nSo just how similar is Buterin\u2019s \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d proposal to Solana's \"local fee markets\"?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas fees refer to the transaction costs that blockchain users pay to the network. This system is in many ways what gives tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) their value. You need ETH to pay gas if you want to do just about anything on the Ethereum network, just like you need SOL to do things on Solana. When there's a lot of activity on the network, gas fees go up. And when there's less activity, gas fees go down.\n\nIn some ways, Solana's current gas fee structure and Vitalik's \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d proposal stem from the same philosophy: In the name of fairness, different types of on-chain transactions should cost different amounts, depending on demand. But in practice, leaders of both networks appear to have different ideas about how to implement such a philosophy\u2014leading to a potentially significant difference in user experience.\n\nSolana currently operates on a \u201clocal fee markets\u201d structure, wherein gas fees are calculated on a per-account basis, project by project. In this system, spikes in gas fees due to network congestion are effectively quarantined to specific projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, a spike in gas fees induced by a hot Solana NFT mint should only impact users who are interacting with that project\u2014users elsewhere across the entire Solana network should be unaffected. (There is currently some disagreement within the Solana community about whether local fee markets actually work as effectively as intended, in part due to the hyper-congestion that can occur in crowded mini-gas ecosystems.)\n\nBut Solana\u2019s setup makes a clear contrast to Ethereum\u2014where demand for wildly popular NFTs has previously clogged the entire network, sending gas fees skyrocketing for everyone.\n\nEthereum is in its Solana era https://t.co/hGfLU3zqPP \u2014 Alex Kroeger (@alex_kroeger) May 9, 2024\n\ndid he just copy this off solana \u2014 willo (@willo_0x) May 9, 2024\n\nEthereum \ud83e\udd1d Solana \u2014 Sam Ragsdale (@samrags_) May 9, 2024\n\nThe \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d concept proposed by Vitalik Buterin does seek to make Ethereum transaction costs more equitable. But it doesn't appear to outline a boutique system like Solana\u2019s, in which every individual project on Ethereum would become its own siloed gas ecosystem.\n\nInstead, multidimensional gas on Ethereum would only distinguish between different macro categories of effort required to complete network transactions, Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. For example, computation, storage, and calldata might fetch different premiums at a given moment, depending on demand. Different on-chain transactions consist of different ratios of those categories of computing.\n\nPer Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, which went live in March, constituted the debut of such a system by sending layer-2 data, the sort that comes from layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, to \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs feature different prices and different limits than the rest of an Ethereum block.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt a macro level, expanding multidimensional gas to differentiate between more computational categories might improve Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, and in Buterin's view, significantly increase scalability of the network\u2019s mainnet.\n\nBut it likely wouldn't insulate Ethereum users from spikes in network volatility induced by trending projects\u2014it\u2019s not that boutique in design.\n\nSo, all that is to say: Solana and Ethereum maximalists, fear not. There will still be plenty of differences to pick apart.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes EIP-7702: a revolution for Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the visionary co-founder of Ethereum, together with co-authors Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett, has recently presented a revolutionary proposal: the EIP-7702.\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the concept of \u201caccount abstraction\u201d on Ethereum, introducing new flexibility and potential to externally owned accounts (EOA), such as regular wallets, allowing them to temporarily take on the functions of a smart contract during a transaction.\n\nWhat is EIP-7702? The proposal by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe EIP-7702, or Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7702, is a technical proposal that aims to extend the capabilities of externally owned accounts on Ethereum, allowing them to behave like smart contracts.\n\nNormally, EOAs are simple wallets that can send and receive funds, but cannot execute arbitrary code like smart contracts.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of EIP-7702, these accounts will be able to temporarily activate smart contract capabilities to perform complex operations, and then return to their original state once the transaction is completed.\n\nThe need for such innovation stems from the current limitations of EOAs, which cannot directly participate in more complex transactions without the intermediation of a smart contract.\n\nThis not only complicates some operations but also limits the possibilities of automation and customization for Ethereum users. With EIP-7702, users will be able to take advantage of the flexibility of smart contracts while maintaining the simplicity and security of a normal wallet.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in EIP-7702 provides that an EOA can temporarily activate a set of functionalities typical of a smart contract, such as the execution of specific code, at the time of the transaction.\n\nThis process is possible thanks to a modification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that recognizes and treats these \u201cenhanced\u201d EOAs for the necessary duration. Once the transaction has been executed, the account returns to its original EOA state, ensuring security and stability.\n\nI benefits:\n\nGreater Flexibility: Users can customize their transactions tailored to specific needs, without the need to interact with external smart contracts. Gas Efficiency: Reducing the need for intermediary smart contracts can result in a significant reduction in gas costs, essential for large-scale operations. Usability: By maintaining the basic structure of EOAs, users will enjoy a less complicated and more direct user experience.\n\nThe future of Account Abstraction and its economic implications\n\nOne of the most promising aspects of EIP-7702 is its potential ability to transform the economy of smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, the creation and maintenance of smart contracts require significant resources, both in terms of development and execution costs, mainly due to gas consumption.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal could simplify this process, reducing the need for multiple contracts for operations that a user wants to perform repeatedly, thus lowering overall costs and making blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThis increased accessibility could have direct repercussions on the adoption rate of Ethereum. With lower entry barriers, more companies and individuals could be incentivized to explore and adopt Ethereum-based solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of such proposal could stimulate a new wave of innovations in sectors such as gaming, digital art, and digital asset management, where the need for complex and personalized interactions is particularly felt.\n\nThe issue of security is central in the debate on EIP-7702. Increasing the complexity of EOAs could trigger new security risks that must be carefully addressed.\n\nThe Ethereum community will need to work together to develop new security protocols that can adequately protect enhanced accounts against malicious attacks, while at the same time preserving the fluidity and efficiency of transactions.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of EIP-7702 could require a review of Ethereum\u2019s governance regulations, as the current framework may not be fully equipped to handle the changing dynamics of accounts and their interactions.\n\nActive participation of the community, through improvement proposals and voting, will be essential to ensure that the changes not only enhance the technology, but also reflect the values and needs of Ethereum users.\n\nPossible Implications of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Choice on EIP-7702 on Ethereum\n\nIf implemented, EIP-7702 could lead to a significant evolution of decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, making the platform even more attractive for developers and end users.\n\nThe ease with which accounts can be adapted for specific functions could also stimulate innovation in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital identity.\n\nDespite the numerous advantages, the EIP-7702 presents some challenges, especially regarding security.\n\nThe increase in functionality of EOAs could potentially expose them to new attack vectors. Therefore, it will be essential to implement robust security measures to protect users and maintain the integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe EIP-7702 represents a significant step forward in the attempt to make Ethereum a more accessible and powerful platform. Although there are challenges to overcome, the potential for significant improvements in transaction management and interaction with the blockchain is evident.\n\nOver the next few months, the Ethereum community will have the opportunity to evaluate, discuss, and potentially adopt this proposal, continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchain technology."

        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz's recent disclosure has sparked widespread intrigue within the cryptocurrency community, shedding new light on his early involvement in Ethereum and the significant gains he accrued. Schwartz revealed that he secured a substantial 40,000 ETH during Ethereum's pre-ICO phase, a move spurred by his acquaintance with Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwartz's entry into Ethereum predates its public pre-ICO, with Buterin extending a personal invitation for him to participate. Motivated by a desire to support Buterin, Schwartz invested 20 BTC without much deliberation, resulting in the acquisition of the substantial ETH holdings.\n\nThe other part of this story was previously known. Many times before, the Ripple CTO has said that he sold this colossal amount of altcoins as soon as the price reached $1 and used it to buy solar panels for his home. While this move may raise eyebrows, Schwartz brushed off concerns, attributing it to a common experience among early crypto adopters, citing missed opportunities such as Bitcoin's meteoric rise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knew Vitalik. He invited me to participate. I wanted to support him, so went in for 20 BTC. I didn't really ask any questions. It got me 40,000 ETH. I thought of it as helping an acquaintance. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) May 10, 2024\n\nThe intertwining histories of Ripple and Ethereum add complexity to the narrative. Buterin's stint at the company, cut short due to visa complications, underscores the connections between the two projects. Yet, tensions have arisen in recent years, exacerbated by Ripple's legal battle with the SEC. Buterin's criticisms of Ripple's actions and their potential implications for Ethereum's regulatory standing have further strained relations.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAs of now, the astronomical rise in Ethereum's value, currently hovering around $3,000 per ETH, places Schwartz's early investment at a staggering $120 million valuation. Even the initial 20 BTC used to purchase ETH is now valued at $1.3 million."

        "content": "Solana is quickly catching up to Ethereum on the fees front.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum ecosystem still commands investors\u2019 trust.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] vs. Ethereum [ETH] debate resurfaced again on Crypto Twitter following reports that the former could soon flip the latter on the fees front.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Dan Smith, Solana was quickly closing in on Ethereum on transaction fees. Smith claimed that,\n\n\u201cSolana will flip Ethereum in transaction fees + captured MEV this month, maybe even this week\u201d\n\nTransaction fees refer to charges linked to network activity, while MEV means validators\u2019 highest value derived by maximizing block production or \u2018confirmation.\u2019\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: fees and other fronts\n\nSmith backed his argument with data, noting that there was about a $300K difference between Solana and Ethereum\u2019s fees.\n\nThe chart showed Solana recorded a significant surge in 2024, closing most of the gap with Ethereum.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Artemyz\u2019s data confirmed the trend on the fees front. The data showed that Ethereum network fees had dropped significantly since the end of February.\n\nOn the 7th of May, Ethereum fees hit $2.8 million, while Solana had $1.6 million.\n\nHowever, other market watchers argued that Ethereum transaction volume should include all L2 to capture its \u201creal value.\u201d To which, Dan Smith responded,\n\n\u201cThe question is whether or not pushing activity to L2s where ETH, the asset is used as a currency, drives enough value back to the L1 to compensate for the loss of L1 activity\u201d\n\nDespite its network challenges, Solana, on average, has cheaper transaction charges than Ethereum.\n\nReacting to Smith\u2019s projection of SOL eclipsing ETH, crypto analyst Ansem wondered,\n\n\u201cAnd it is still 100x cheaper to transact on for users, really think about this & explain to me in detail why ETH is still worth 5x more by market cap\u201d\n\nThings are also hitting up on the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) front after Solana\u2019s Jupiter exchange outperformed Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap on the Unique Active Wallets (UAW) front.\n\nLike Ansem, most market watchers underscored SOL as grossly undervalued, especially after last week\u2019s pullback.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum had a commanding lead on TVL (Total Value Locked) and overall token value on price charts.\n\nSolana had $4 billion in TVL, while Ethereum\u2019s reading stood at $53.3 billion at press time, underscoring that Ethereum had more investors\u2019 trust."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThanks to insights from Vitalik Buterin and contributions from experts like Ansgar Dietrichs, Barnabe Monnot and Davide Crapis, we are getting familiar with the concept of \"multidimensional gas.\" Traditionally, Ethereum has used a unit called \"gas\" to measure and price the computational efforts required for transactions and operations. This includes calculations like adding and multiplying, managing data storage, bandwidth and even complex processes like generating cryptographic proofs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent proposal involves transitioning from a single-dimensional gas model to a multi-dimensional one, addressing the inefficiencies of treating different types of computational resources as equivalents. The current system, while simple, does not accurately reflect the varying demands different operations place on the network, which can lead to either over or under-utilization of resources.\n\nButerin uses a straightforward diagram to explain that while the gas limit might suggest a block can safely handle a certain amount of computation and data, the reality of what is safe can be quite different. This misalignment could potentially allow for blocks that are either too safe and under-utilized or too risky and overloaded.\n\nWith the introduction of multi-dimensional gas on Ethereum via EIP-4844, the network can now process different types of demands more efficiently. This change has already started to show benefits. Blobs, for example, will allow these rollups to operate much more cheaply, increasing transaction volume threefold without significantly raising block size, thus maintaining network safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe update also anticipates future enhancements, such as better support for \"stateless clients\" \u2014 a new type of Ethereum client that does not need to store a complete copy of the blockchain. These clients rely heavily on proof systems, and the current shift toward multidimensional gas could facilitate a smoother implementation of these systems by allowing the network to handle proofs more efficiently without compromising on security or inflating costs for users.\n\nThis multi-dimensional approach allows Ethereum to fine-tune how it manages different resources, potentially increasing throughput without risking safety. It marks a sophisticated step forward in blockchain technology, promising to make Ethereum more scalable, efficient and ready for future demands."

        "content": "ETH has struggled to initiate an uptrend on the charts\n\nMost market indicators and metrics looked bearish\n\nAt press time, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] daily and weekly price charts remained green. However, the trend might be short-lived. In fact, as per a recent analysis, there may be chances of ETH dropping to $2.7k before it even begins a bull rally. Hence, AMBCrypto checked ETH\u2019s current state to better understand what to expect in the short-term.\n\nBears v. Bulls for Ethereum\n\nEthereum was somewhat bullish on the charts in the last 24 hours, with its price hiking by just over 1%. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,035.04 with a market capitalization of over $364 billion.\n\nHowever, bears might soon step up, with a recent analysis suggesting that ETH might drop to $2.7k. Crypto Tony, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared this projection, highlighting ETH\u2019s possible future trajectory. As per the tweet, ETH\u2019s price will first reach its support level of $2.7k, before beginning a rally, which might allow it to touch $5.4k.\n\nThe possibility of ETH dropping to $2.7k seems likely since investors\u2019 confidence in the token has fallen dramatically. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data also revealed that ETH\u2019s weighted sentiment was in the negative zone \u2013 A sign that bearish sentiment retained its dominance in the market.\n\nApart from that, quite a few other metrics also looked somewhat bearish too.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow spiked, reflecting a hike in selling pressure. The fact that investors have been selling ETH was further proven by its supply on exchanges, which increased over the past week.\n\nNotably, while investors sold their holdings, whales went the other route as they kept accumulating \u2013 As evidenced by the slight rise in the supply held by top addresses.\n\nFuture targets\n\nAMBCrypto reported previously that the crypto-market was bearish on Ethereum. To see whether that was still the case, we then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart. As per our analysis, market indicators continued to remain bearish.\n\nThe token\u2019s price was resting lower than its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was under the neutral level. Additionally, ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also went south, suggesting that the chances of ETH dropping to $2.7k were high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThat being said, investors should not worry about ETH\u2019s price trend being all bad since there is a possibility of a trend reversal before $2.7k.\n\nIf ETH manages to test its support near $3k, then the scenario might turn bullish. A drop below that level would result in ETH touching yet another resistance near $2.92k, depending on whether it might rebound if things fall into place."

        "content": "While Ethereum struggles to regain the Q1 2024 momentum, currently tethered close to the psychological $3,000 level, one trader remains bullish.\n\nTaking to X, the analyst posts several reasons to negate concerns by skeptics even with the coin trading 30% from March 2024 highs when prices broke above $4,000. By this take, doubts about future gains could be unfounded as they paint an overly pessimistic outlook for the second most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Is Under Pressure: Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthereum is in a bearish breakout formation at press time following sharp losses in mid-April. Although there are hints of strength, the rejection from $2,800 wasn\u2019t enough to assuage fears.\n\nAs prices range within a $500 zone capped at $2,800 and $3,300, bulls have a chance, though sellers could also press lower, continuing the losses of April.\n\nThere are multiple reasons to support the bearish forecast. Some investors, the analyst observes, are still hesitant to get exposure to ETH because of Bitcoin and its swelling layer-2 ecosystems.\n\nThe launch of the Runes Protocol saw activity flow to Bitcoin, pushing transaction fees on the world\u2019s most valuable network. Trading fees have fallen, as seen on YCharts on May 10.\n\nBeyond this, there are concerns that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might classify ETH as a security, leading to stricter regulations. Moreover, Solana, a modern high-throughput blockchain, is seen as a stiff competitor considering its surge in activity, mostly from meme coin projects.\n\nAnalyst: Here\u2019s Why ETH Will Rise\n\nThough the threat from Solana and other low-fee and scalable platforms, on top of the United States SEC concerns, is real, the analyst is upbeat. Explaining in a bid to dismantle cause for worry, the analyst dismisses the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem as \u201ctrash.\u201d Though popular, the analyst thinks it will always be inferior to Ethereum\u2019s in functionality and practicality.\n\nBeyond this, the analyst adds that though the United States SEC threat exists, it\u2019s unlikely to be successful. Even if it is, powerful political and economic forces like Wall Street will continue to support Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nThus far, Wall Street players like BlackRock have expressed interest in issuing spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has boosted confidence.\n\nRelated Reading: XRP Ledger Validator Launched By Japanese Financial Titan: Details\n\nMoreover, the analyst downplayed Solana\u2019s strengths, suggesting its scalability and growth might be exaggerated.\n\nSpecifically, the analyst noted the existence of equally superior layer-2 scaling solutions for the Ethereum-like Base. From a security perspective, Solana also has limited client diversity, negatively impacting the network reliability.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Community is bearish on Solana and Ethereum, but experts are still very bullish on SOL.\n\nCrypto markets are still correcting, with most altcoins currently in the red.\n\nThe crypto market is still reeling from a strong case of the corrections, and altcoins are having it worse than all.\n\nAt press time, almost all the altcoins on the top 25 are in the red, having seen a slight decrease on daily charts. Is there a bearish storm on the horizon? Or are we still on for an altseason?\n\nSolana and Ethereum inspire bearish sentiments\n\nTwo top altcoins have stood out among the crowd, seemingly dancing with the bears. Both coins have dropped from the critical support levels of $2,995 and $145.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum [ETH] was worth $2,968 and Solana [SOL] was at $141.\n\nData from CoinGecko says that the community is mostly bearish on both tokens right now.\n\nJust two days ago, Glassnode shared that Ethereum\u2019s performance is much weaker than Bitcoin [BTC], despite the opposite being the case only a month prior.\n\nThis is a stark reversal from its previous position, where it had shown dominance over Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price drop has been massive, with its deepest drawdown reaching 44% over the cycle, which is more than double that of Bitcoin\u2019s 21%.\n\nThis highlights Ethereum\u2019s struggles and underperformance relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Short-Term Holder Cost Basis for Ethereum, which typically offers support, shows that current prices are hovering very close to the cost basis of recent buyers.\n\nGlassnode warns that this situation has created a precarious scenario where any further market dip could trigger a sell-off panic.\n\nA silver lining\n\nDespite the gloomy outlook, not all hope is lost. Solana, for instance, seems to have weathered what might have been its last major correction for this market cycle.\n\nAccording to a well-followed crypto analyst known as Inmortal, the only support level Solana needed to defend is $120.\n\nHe is still expecting a rally, with his projections suggesting a climb to a new high of $320 some time later this year.\n\nFurthermore, there are indicators that Solana might soon overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction fees.\n\nDan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, suggested that Solana could surpass Ethereum in transaction fees and capture maximal extractable value (MEV) as early as this month.\n\nMEV represents the maximum profit that can be extracted from blockchain transactions through means like arbitrage.\n\nOn the 7th of May, Solana\u2019s total economic value was reported at $2.8 million, nearing Ethereum\u2019s $3.1 million. Elite figures like Arthur Hayes are also still highly bullish on SOL.\n\nInterestingly, however, the community seems to be highly bullish on the broader altcoin market, especially AI tokens like Fetch.ai [FET].\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nMeme coins like Pepe [PEPE] and Bonk [BONK] are still seeing new holders every single day, suggesting that investors and traders are still very much expecting a bull run for 2024.\n\nSo, yes, the bears might have managed to snatch control. But it is likely to be temporary."

        "title": "Solana vs. Ethereum: Lower Fees & Rising Altcoins - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) is emerging as a formidable contender to Ethereum (ETH), driven by its lower fees and high-speed transactions. As the crypto space eagerly anticipates a potential shift in dominance, two coins, ENA and ALGT, stand out as promising candidates ready for significant growth.\n\nWith Solana\u2019s rise and the promising prospects of Ehtena (ENA) and Algotech (ALGT), investors are keenly observing the market for opportunities that could potentially reshape the landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nSolana closing in on Ethereum: Transaction fee race and network challenges\n\nThe Solana network appears to be gaining ground in transaction fees, potentially signaling a significant development in its rivalry with Ethereum. According to Dan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, Solana might surpass Ethereum in transaction fees as early as this week. This shift could mark a milestone in Solana\u2019s quest to be dubbed an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nCaptured maximal extractable value (MEV), a measure of profits mainly garnered through arbitrage trading, is also expected to tilt in favor of Solana soon. On May 7, Solana\u2019s total economic value nearly matched Ethereum\u2019s, standing at $2.8 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s $3.1 million.\n\nDespite these strides, Ethereum still leads in daily transaction fees, with over $2.75 million generated in the past 24 hours compared to Solana\u2019s $1.49 million, as per DefiLlama data. Additionally, Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) remains relatively small at $3.94 billion, accounting for about 7.4% of Ethereum\u2019s $53 billion TVL.\n\nLaunched in March 2020, Solana promised to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues with a claimed throughput of 50,000 transactions per second. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions, Solana adopts a monolithic approach to scalability as a standalone blockchain network.\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s approach has faced criticism, particularly due to previous outages. In early April, a surge in demand for memecoins led to approximately 75% of Solana transactions failing due to network overload. Additionally, on Feb. 6, block production on Solana halted for about five hours before engineers and validators managed to restart the network, according to Solana\u2019s status page.\n\nEthena surges: AI-Driven Algotech emerges as top cryptocurrency pick\n\nLike Solana, Ethena (ENA) and Algotech are ready to lift off, currently ENA trading at $0.9012, marking a 2.96% rise in the past day and a notable 17.46% increase over the previous seven days. With a market capitalization of $1.37 billion, ENA secures its position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAlongside Ethena analysts are favoring Algotech as a superior long-term investment. The company distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency realm by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its framework, a unique feature absent in traditional DeFi projects. This integration empowers users with AI-driven trading strategies, minimizing errors, and amplifying market analysis for improved trading outcomes.\n\nAlgotech\u2019s profitability has been showcased, rewarding early investors with significant returns. Participants in the initial presale phase acquired tokens at $0.04, witnessing a doubling of their investment as the token price surged to $0.08 in the current third stage. As the presale progresses to its final fourth stage, it continues to allure new investors with an anticipated 87.5% increase, targeting a listing price of $0.15.\n\nIn addition to its technological innovations, Algotech enhances its appeal through promotional giveaways, featuring high-end Apple products. This initiative not only attracts potential investors but also fosters engagement and incentivizes participation in the Algotech ecosystem.\n\nFor further details about Algotech:\n\nVisit Algotech Presale\n\nJoin The Algotech Community\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

        "title": "Can SOL flip ETH? Solana surpasses Ethereum in DEX volume - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In a significant shift within the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector, Solana (SOL) has recently outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in daily trading volumes, sparking discussions about its potential to challenge Ethereum\u2019s long-established dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs of May 8, Solana\u2019s 24-hour trading volume reached $1.314 billion, slightly edging out Ethereum\u2019s $1.29 billion. This development not only underscores Solana\u2019s expanding influence in the DeFi sector but also highlights its potential to be a leading market player.\n\nNFT trading surge and market dynamics\n\nOn May 8, the daily count of non-fungible token (NFT) traders on Solana reached a multi-month high, with 123,426 traders engaged, according to CryptoSlam. This marked a 111% increase from the previous day\u2019s count of 58,405 traders.\n\nSolana NFT Sales Volume. Source: CryptoSlam\n\nDespite this vibrant activity, Solana\u2019s NFT market experienced a 16% decline in sales volume on the same day, totaling $3.01 million, down from $3.5 million. This drop coincided with a 7% decrease in Solana\u2019s value between May 7 and 8, with the price standing at $153.3 at press time.\n\nThe fluctuating price potentially makes buying and minting NFTs more accessible but could deter high-value transactions, particularly from investors speculating on price appreciation.\n\nEconomic value and the potential to outpace Ethereum\n\nDan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, highlighted an emerging shift in economic dynamics. On May 7, he noted that Solana\u2019s total economic value from transactions was nearing that of Ethereum, particularly in terms of transaction fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV).\n\nMEV represents potential profits that validators can secure through strategic transaction orders. Solana\u2019s advantage in MEV is bolstered by its lower fees and faster transaction speeds, which enable more frequent and cost-effective arbitrage opportunities compared to Ethereum.\n\nAlright you guys really ran with this one without any evidence but here's the data\n\n\n\nDefining \"total economic value\" (shill me better names) as total transaction fees + captured MEV returned to validators\n\n\n\nYesterday\n\nEthereum: $3,165,772\n\nSolana: $2,803,313 https://t.co/sZAvN0MCUV pic.twitter.com/QqXStScrvk \u2014 Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 7, 2024\n\nOn May 6, the combined figures for Ethereum stood at $3,165, while the exact figure for Solana was not far off, at $2,803. Smith\u2019s analysis suggested that Solana could \u201cflip\u201d Ethereum soon, perhaps within a week. Moreover, Solana\u2019s fees have reached 50% of Ethereum\u2019s over recent days, a sharp increase from just 1% during the 2021 bull run.\n\nHowever, this strategy is not without its drawbacks, as Solana\u2019s network has faced congestion issues, with a high transaction failure rate of about 60%, raising concerns about reliability and consistent execution by validators.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nDespite these advances, significant challenges remain for Solana. Its total value locked (TVL) as of May 10 was $4.14 billion, substantially lower than Ethereum\u2019s $53 billion.\n\nSolana has also suffered from multiple outages, including a notable incident on February 6 when block production halted for approximately five hours due to overwhelming demand. These reliability issues could undermine confidence in Solana\u2019s long-term stability and operational efficiency.\n\nAs Solana\u2019s MEV extraction capabilities grow, it presents both opportunities and challenges. Increased front-running risks and higher transaction costs could affect traders negatively, while enhanced validator incentives might spur further demand for SOL.\n\nWatching how Solana and Ethereum will adapt and compete in this evolving market remains a critical area for both investors and enthusiasts in the DeFi space.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
