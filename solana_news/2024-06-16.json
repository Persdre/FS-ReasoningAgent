        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Ethereum While It's Below $4,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Is Ethereum on its way to a new all-time high? These three factors say yes.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC -2.22%) captured the imagination of crypto investors. But don't sleep on Ethereum (ETH -4.27%). Up 54% year to date, it has largely kept pace with Bitcoin, and it has one new catalyst in place that could send it soaring in the second half of the year.\n\nSo this could be the time to put Ethereum on your investment radar. There are three good reasons why it could soar past the $4,000 mark on its way to a new all-time high.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nThe big catalyst, of course, is the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. If they enjoy anywhere near the same success as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could send the price of Ethereum soaring. During the first six months of the year, the spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $30 billion from investors, and that is what led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in price by 60%. The current thinking is that the new spot Ethereum ETFs could pull in as much as $3 billion in their first six months.\n\nThe only question, really, is when the new ETFs will start trading. The original consensus was the end of May. That was then pushed back to the end of June. And now SEC head Gary Gensler says it will be sometime before the end of the summer. Maybe by the time you're back from summer vacation, you'll be able to buy them.\n\nEthereum's market dominance\n\nOne underappreciated fact about Ethereum is just how dominant it is in many niches of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, web3, and the metaverse, Ethereum is the clear market leader. Its blockchain technology powers so many of tomorrow's most powerful and interesting apps. That means more users, more developers, more active wallets, more transactions, and more cash flows than any other blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCase in point: In the world of DeFi, Ethereum currently accounts for 60% of all total value locked (TVL), one of the most important metrics for blockchain performance. By way of comparison, its chief rival Solana (SOL -4.85%) has only a 4% market share. Other up-and-coming rivals -- such as Sui and Aptos -- barely show up as blips on the radar. Thus, this group of \"Ethereum killers\" could pose less of an existential risk to Ethereum than originally feared.\n\nNew blockchain upgrades\n\nI can't think of another cryptocurrency that gets more attention for its blockchain upgrades than Ethereum. It has followed up The Merge (a massive blockchain upgrade) with a number of smaller technical upgrades meant to make its blockchain faster and cheaper to use. Last year, we had Shapella. Earlier this year, we had Dencun. And now the buzz is building for the next upgrade, known as Prague-Electra.\n\nThere are two reasons these stepwise upgrades are so important. First of all, they make it easier for Ethereum to fend off its rivals. Yes, Solana might be faster and cheaper to use right now, but Ethereum is doing everything in its power to narrow the gap. The ultimate goal is the ability to process 1 million transactions per second, and each new upgrade brings Ethereum closer to this target.\n\nAlso, each new upgrade helps to build confidence in Ethereum's roadmap for the future. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which often seem to have a helter-skelter feel to their overall development, Ethereum lays out a roadmap at the start of every year and patiently explains how all the steps in this roadmap fit together. I've always viewed this process as similar to the way that publicly traded corporations give guidance about upcoming results.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nGiven these three factors, I think there's a reasonable chance that we could be talking about a new all-time high of $5,000 for Ethereum sometime by early 2025. That's a 40% gain from today's price of $3,500.\n\nBut $5,000 may be entirely too low a future projection for Ethereum. It's not hard to find analysts predicting a price of $10,000 for Ethereum. And investment firm VanEck thinks Ethereum is on a rocket to $22,000 by the year 2030.\n\nIn many ways, this depends on how well those new spot Ethereum ETFs perform. If the end of summer comes and they still are not trading, or if new investor inflows disappoint, then it might be time to tamp down expectations. If you are comfortable with assuming that risk, it could be time to start thinking about investing in Ethereum while it's still trading below $4,000."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a bold prediction that has captured the attention of the crypto community, prominent analyst Jelle has forecasted Ethereum (ETH) to reach an all-time high of $5,000 by the end of the year. This comes on the heels of ETH successfully turning the $3,500 level into solid support, a milestone Jelle highlighted in a recent tweet .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $3,540, reflecting a slight decline of 0.33% over the past 24 hours. Despite this minor dip, there has been a significant increase in trading volume, which has surged by 22.88%, amounting to $12,881,843,193. This uptick in trading activity signals growing investor interest and potential momentum for Ethereum in the near term.\n\nAnalyst optimism amid market trends\n\nAlthough Ethereum has experienced a slight bearish trend recently, market analysts remain optimistic about its future performance. Jelle\u2019s prediction is based on recent price action, where ETH turned the $3,500 level into a critical support zone. This technical development is seen as a positive indicator , suggesting that Ethereum has the potential to push higher in the coming months.\n\nA major catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s projected rise is the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Expected to start trading within the next couple of months, these ETFs are likely to attract substantial institutional investment, providing a significant boost to Ethereum's price. The introduction of spot ETFs is seen as a pivotal moment for ETH, potentially leading to increased adoption and market confidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s journey to $5,000 is not without challenges. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and various factors, including regulatory developments and macroeconomic trends, could influence its trajectory. However, the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, coupled with its growing ecosystem and the upcoming launch of spot ETFs , provide a strong foundation for potential growth.\n\nIn addition to the technical analysis, Ethereum\u2019s development continues to progress. These advancements are expected to enhance the network's scalability, security and sustainability, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position on the market. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on Ethereum to see if it can achieve this new milestone and redefine its place on the cryptocurrency landscape."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Millionaire Maker? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum still has upside potential. But does it have enough to make you a millionaire?\n\nThere's no denying that Ethereum (ETH -4.16%) has been one of the best crypto investments of the past decade. At its current price of $3,500, Ethereum is up more than 10,000-fold from its initial price of just $0.31. As a result, an investment of just $100 in 2015 would have likely been enough to make you a crypto millionaire today.\n\nBut we're moving into Ethereum's second decade now, and it's no longer a slam-dunk certainty that you can become a crypto millionaire by investing at today's prices. If you are thinking about investing in it for that purpose, here are three important questions to ask yourself.\n\n1. Does Ethereum still have 1,000x upside?\n\nLet's assume for a moment that you have $1,000 to invest in Ethereum right now. For that initial investment to grow to $1 million, it would need to increase in value 1,000-fold. A decade ago, that was certainly possible. But what about today?\n\nRemember: In 2015, Ethereum had the all-important first-mover advantage. It was literally the first smart-contract blockchain platform, and that opened up all kinds of new opportunities that even Bitcoin (BTC -2.10%) couldn't match.\n\nSo Ethereum went on to create, define, and control entire sectors of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to blockchain gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it was not just the first to market. It was also best to market.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum no longer has the first-mover advantage. There are plenty of new challengers, and plenty of blockchains that can offer exactly what it can offer, if not more. So it only makes sense that the explosive growth that characterized the early years of Ethereum might no longer be possible. That's bad news if you're expecting 1,000x upside.\n\n2. How long can Ethereum remain the market leader?\n\nThere are now three direct Ethereum challengers -- Solana (SOL -4.76%), Avalanche (AVAX -6.54%), and Cardano (ADA -4.85%) -- that rank among the top 15 cryptocurrencies in market cap.\n\nThe appearance of these new challengers means that Ethereum's dominant market share in the various niches is slowly being eroded. So even if it is able to create entirely new blockchain niches (as it has for the past decade), the share of the market it will capture will likely continue to shrink over time.\n\nOf even more concern, some of these blockchain rivals are being viewed by investors as potential \"Ethereum killers.\" This poses a clear existential threat.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing blockchains, users and developers have a choice. And if the new Ethereum rivals continue to claim much higher speeds, enhanced throughput capacity, and lower fees, which blockchains do you think users are going to choose?\n\n3. What will be the effect of the new ETFs?\n\nLastly, there's the question of just how much of a lift the new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are going to provide. Just about everyone agrees that there was much more demand and hype for the new spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more than $30 billion in customer funds. However, JPMorgan Chase thinks that the new spot Ethereum ETFs will pull in only $3 billion.\n\nAs a result, the spot Ethereum ETFs are likely to be much less impactful than many people think. If you're expecting the price of the crypto to soar as soon as these new ETFs start trading, you might be disappointed.\n\nSetting realistic expectations\n\nThis might be tough to acknowledge, but Ethereum might only have 10x upside over the foreseeable future. And even that could be too optimistic. Given its current market cap of just over $400 billion, a 10-fold increase in value would imply a new market cap of $4 trillion. That's significantly more than Nvidia, which now has a lofty $3 trillion market value.\n\nA $4 trillion valuation might have been possible back when Ethereum had a clear economic moat to keep away potential challengers. But the barbarians are now at the gate, and some of them are crossing the drawbridge.\n\nFor that reason, I'm unconvinced that Ethereum is still a millionaire maker. Unfortunately, if you are really serious about becoming a millionaire, you might need to find \"the next Ethereum\" -- an undiscovered crypto with 1,000x upside that you can buy for mere pennies. And that, as we all know, is a lot harder to do than it sounds."

        "title": "New scaling milestone for the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In recent days, an important milestone has been reached regarding the scaling of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and its layer-2 and layer-3.\n\nJust yesterday, in fact, the all-time high of the number of daily transactions recorded overall on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 and all its upper layers was registered.\n\nAccording to the data from L2BEAT, the average daily TPS on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1, that is, its actual blockchain, has settled at a modest 13 tx/s, but the overall figure, which also includes the upper layers, has approached 246 tx/s.\n\nJust think that seven days ago the average TPS on layer-1 was practically the same, but with the upper levels it was just 123 tx/s, or about half. At the beginning of the year, it was only 73 tx/s, while the one on layer-1 has always been more or less around 13.\n\nThe second layer and the scaling of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain\n\nWhat is making the most difference is the layer-3 Xai, a scaling solution for gaming created by Offchain Labs, the company behind Arbitrum One.\n\nJust yesterday it recorded a TPS of over 101 tx/s, followed far behind by layer-2 Base at about 33 tx/s.\n\nIt should be noted that there are two other upper layers that have recorded a higher daily average TPS than Ethereum, namely Arbitrum, with more than 20 tx/s, and Proof of Play Apex with almost 16.\n\nMoreover, both Taiko and Blast are also recording interesting numbers, because they are both above 11 transactions per second.\n\nL2BEAT monitors as many as 74 chains, including layer-1 (Ethereum), layer-2, and layer-3, although for about ten of these it is not managing to collect data.\n\nIn the last twelve months, the daily average TPS of Ethereum has remained more or less constant around 12 or 13 tx/s, while the overall TPS was just 30 tx/s, which is slightly more than double that recorded on layer-1.\n\nAs recently as February of this year, the overall TPS was still only at 40, but after the Dencun update in March that reduced fees on the upper layers, it skyrocketed first to 100 and then recently well beyond 200 tx/s.\n\nThis makes it very clear that by now the majority of transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem do not occur on layer-1 (the native Ethereum blockchain), because there they are relatively slow and expensive, but on the upper layers where they are faster and above all much more economical.\n\nThe fees\n\nThe average cost per transaction on the Ethereum blockchain yesterday was over $2. Five days ago, however, it was over $6, and a good ten days ago it had risen to almost $9. Not to mention the fact that on March 5th it skyrocketed to over $30.\n\nInstead, according to the data from L2BEAT, yesterday on Base the average cost per transaction was 0.4 thousandths of a dollar, or 0.0004$.\n\nOn Optimism it was 1 thousandth, and on Arbitrum slightly above 2 and a half thousandths.\n\nThe difference is truly remarkable, and this is due to the fact that on layer-1 it is not possible to reduce costs by increasing TPS, while the upper layers can scale much more easily.\n\nIt should be remembered that the average cost of a single transaction depends on the level of network congestion, so a network that supports higher TPS can clear the queue of pending transactions much faster, greatly reducing congestion.\n\nInstead, on layer-1 like Ethereum and Bitcoin it is not possible to increase the number of validated transactions per second, making it very difficult to reduce congestion in case of many requests.\n\nThe price of ETH\n\nThis remarkable increase in on-chain activity has not, however, had positive effects on the price of ETH, also because ETH is used to pay the cost of transactions on layer-1.\n\nAbout ten days ago it had risen above $3,800, but starting from Friday, June 7, it began to fall.\n\nFirst it went back to $3,600, and then it dropped below $3,500.\n\nIn particular, last Friday for a brief moment it had also dropped below $3,400, but at that point, it recorded a quick rebound that in fact then brought it back around $3,500.\n\nThe current price levels are in line with those of mid-April before the early sell-the-news on Bitcoin was triggered about a week before the halving.\n\nAt that time, the price of ETH dropped to $3,000, and then fell below $2,900 during the month of May.\n\nIt then recovered after the news of the possible approval of spot ETH ETFs in the USA (which later happened), but since we are still waiting for their actual debut on the stock exchange, there is still a lot of calm and uncertainty at the moment.\n\nIt is worth noting that the current price of ETH is still 28% lower compared to the all-time highs of late 2021, while for example that of BTC is -% from the all-time highs of March."

There would be no ETFs if the Bitcoin ETF had failed.\u201d\n\nHe added that Wall Street loves the \u201cnext hot new thing\u201d because it\u2019s something it can talk to its consumers about and sell their products.

They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, thus providing a more accessible and regulated investment vehicle.\n\nThis approval sparked significant interest and investment inflows, highlighting the growing acceptance and institutional interest in digital assets.\n\nThe success of the Bitcoin ETF has paved the way for further crypto-related financial products, and the market has been keenly awaiting similar developments for other such products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe anticipation for Ethereum ETFs has been particularly high, especially following the positive signals from regulatory authorities. The funds received initial approval in late May, but will not start trading until funds\u2019 S-1 registration forms are approved.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday indicated that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs might be completed by the end of the summer.\n\n\u201cIndividual issuers are still working through the registration process that's working smoothly, and I envision sometime over the course of the summer,\u201d Gensler said during a Senate hearing Thursday.\n\nTradFi butts in\n\nDespite the added mainstream attention coming with ETFs, Quigley expressed dissatisfaction with the increasing involvement of traditional finance in the crypto space.\n\n\"I was happy with crypto without Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be smaller? Of course. But I didn't feel the need to keep growing the size of crypto now.\u201d\n\nHe warned that Wall Street's aggressive marketing of crypto products could lead to significant risks, especially if institutional investors pull out during market downturns.\n\nDespite his reservations about Wall Street's involvement, Quigley acknowledged that a significant capital influx is essential for substantial market growth.\n\n\"If you want a massive amount of capital, then yes, you have to do things like ETFs,\" he conceded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile ETF hype was partially credited with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high price above $73,700 in March, alongside anticipation for April\u2019s quadrennial halving event, BTC has yet to seriously challenge that mark again in the months since\u2014and is down this week at a current price of just under $67,000.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s price typically climbs six months or more after the halving, which constrains the expanding supply, as the impacts of that event start to be felt. Quigley believes that historical patterns will continue along that path as well.\n\n\"It can't go higher because it's not the right time,\" he said, predicting a significant price increase ahead.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum To Surge 50% This Year Against Bitcoin - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum is poised for a huge surge this year of up to 50% to rival Bitcoin, according to a new analysis of chain data. According to a technical setup called the inverse-head-and-shoulders (IH&S), Ether is expected to boom over the next few months, mimicking a similar bullish pattern to 2021 where it competed with BTC in terms of growth.\n\nThe IH&S pattern is characterized by the formation of three troughs below a common neckline resistance. These formations are the middle trough (head), which comes to be deeper than the other two troughs (shoulders), which are roughly of the same length.\n\nIf the IH&S pattern resolves when the price breaks above the neckline resistance after the formation of the right shoulder, the price rises by as much as the maximum distance between the head\u2019s lowest point and the neckline resistance. In simpler terms, Ethereum\u2019s growth between 2019 and 2021 followed this pattern. In that period, it competed with Bitcoin in terms of the best-growing cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso Read: Bloomberg Analysts Move Up Expected Ether ETF Launch to July 2\n\nEthereum And Bitcoin To Flip This Summer Following Ether ETF Approval?\n\nOn Monday, the ETH/BTC pair flipped as the head trough appeared. To begin this surge, it will next need to reach the common neckline resistance level at around 0.061 BTC. Upon doing this, Ethereum will be in business and will need to retest the neckline before a breakout commences. This breakout may see ETH boom to new highs in the coming months. You can see these patterns forming on Ethereum\u2019s price chart.\n\nFollowing the latest approvals of Spot Ethereum ETFs, the Ether community is as bullish as ever. The news of the asset being on its way toward public trading fuels its battle against Bitcoin. While BTC remains the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has always been close behind in terms of trading volume. Many bullish price predictions expect Ether to reach all-time highs next month, as soon as the SEC fully approves ETFs. When trading commences, the asset will possibly see a similar boom to Bitcoin in January 2024."

        "title": "Mean reverting Trading System on cryptocurrencies: a strategy to exploit the false breakouts of Ethereum (ETH) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In order to diversify the basket of systematic trading strategies, this article will attempt to evaluate whether it is possible to approach trading on Ethereum (ETH) with a \u201cmean reverting\u201d strategy based on false breakouts. Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has historically shown a predominantly \u201ctrend following\u201d behavior, therefore seeking trend reversals might seem like a counterproductive choice.\n\nWith the recent evolution of the crypto market, it might be useful to consider incorporating a strategy into your portfolio that takes advantage of the \u201cmean reverting\u201d trend, which seems to be increasingly present in this market as well, fueled by growing liquidity.\n\nTo do this, an attempt will be made to define a trading system that can take advantage of false breakouts at the previous session\u2019s low levels, which increasingly often result in rebounds rather than downward trend extensions. Upon breaking the previous day\u2019s low, the condition will be met to enter long if the price returns to the just-broken low level.\n\nStructure and initial results of the mean reverting trading system on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe strategy, which will be built only on the long side, assumes entering after bearish market movements with the idea that breaking the previous day\u2019s low could lead to a rebound.\n\nThe session is calculated using the exchange\u2019s time (normally Greenwich Mean Time, GMT) from midnight to 11:59 PM, considering a historical data series from 2016 to today (May 2024). A fixed amount of $10,000 per trade is set, with an initial stop loss of $3,000.\n\nPositive results are obtained right from the start, with a growing equity line. In the following figures, it can be seen how the total profit of the system exceeds $71,000 in just 75 trades, with an average trade of $1,100. These results might seem overly positive, but in reality, they indicate a still rough strategy, given the few very long-duration trades, as confirmed by the high value of the average trade.\n\nAlthough it provides interesting metrics, the low number of operations makes the statistic not very robust, in addition to being not very applicable in real trading given the long duration of many trades.\n\nIt is therefore appropriate to limit the duration of the trades, perhaps finding a compromise between average trade and number of operations through an optimization of the parameters used.\n\nFigure 1. Equity line of the mean reverting trading system on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFigure 2. Average trade of the trading system mean reverting on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFigure 3. Summary of the performance of the mean reverting trading system on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOptimization to determine the ideal duration of trades\n\nAs a first step, we will try to limit the duration of the trades by imposing closure after a certain number of days. By optimizing between 5 and 120 days, the values in figure 4 are found. As noted from the graph in figure 5, around 55 days there is an area with good values of average trade and net profit on drawdown. This is still a rather long duration compared to the event that generates the market entry (false breakout of the previous lows), but the optimization shows that it is not possible to achieve noteworthy results with shorter duration trades. Therefore, as an example, we will choose to close the trades at most after 55 days.\n\nFigure 4. Optimization of trade duration (expressed in days).\n\nFigure 5. Chart of the main results of the optimization.\n\nThe total profit of the system has dropped to about $46,000 with an average trade of $130, values lower than the previous ones, but definitely more realistic considering that they are obtained in 354 operations, a number that makes the statistics more robust and the trade time horizon more sustainable. However, there might still be room to improve the metrics and get closer to a strategy that can be considered for live trading. For example, one could filter the entries with price patterns, trying to operate only when there are ideal conditions.\n\nAnalysis of price patterns to improve the results of the mean reverting trading system on Ethereum\n\nIn this regard, a proprietary list will be used that brings together many price combinations, different from each other, which will serve to understand in which situations Ethereum (ETH) seems to work best with the logic of false break out being tested.\n\nFigure 6. Optimization of price patterns to improve the effectiveness of trades.\n\nThe case \u201cPtnNeutYes=4\u201d (figure 6) identifies the days following a session with little conviction. These are days in which the \u201cbody\u201d of the daily candle (open-close) was not greater than 75% of the total range of the daily candle (high-low). Therefore, one would want to avoid those situations where the \u201cbody\u201d is greater than 75% of the total range of the session.\n\nIt is noted how in fact MyPtn number 4 manages to increase the average trade (152$) and the net profit (49,209$). The drawdown also decreases and stands at -6,697$. A good improvement, also visible from the shape of the equity which is decidedly more regular (figure 7).\n\nFigure 7. Equity line of the mean reverting trading system with the application of Pattern 4.\n\nFigure 8. Average trade of the mean reverting trading system with the application of Pattern 4.\n\nThese good results are certainly far from those that would have been achieved with the simple \u201cbuy & hold\u201d of Ethereum (ETH) from 2016 to today (figure 9) in terms of absolute profits. But it must be considered that the fluctuations of the \u201cbuy & hold\u201d are not comparable to those experienced by the trading system, making the former a definitely less sustainable approach. In addition to this, it should be noted that the trading system uses a fixed size, while applying the \u201cbuy & hold\u201d is like reinvesting the profits obtained.\n\nFigure 9. Buy & hold of Ethereum (ETH) since 2016 with $10,000.\n\nFinal considerations on the mean reverting trading system on Ethereum\n\nIn conclusion, it has been shown how it is possible to operate with a mean reverting approach even on an instrument like Ethereum, typically trend following, which with the general growth of the mercato crypto presents more and more opportunities for reversal. The trading system developed in this article is certainly not ready for live trading, but the reader is left with the task of further experimenting and optimizing this idea to refine it and transform it into a real operational strategy.\n\nSee you next time and happy trading!\n\nAndrea Unger"

This brings the project\u2019s total funding to date to $22 million. The company plans to use these funds to support the initial stage of its open testnet, dubbed Helium, which will enable developers to deploy smart contracts to the Fhenix network for the first time.\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a novel form of cryptography that allows data to be computed blindly without ever needing to be decrypted. Fhenix is the first blockchain to natively integrate FHE in order to deliver an EVM-compatible smart contract platform that allows developers to encrypt all or part of their Solidity-based applications using familiar tools without any prior knowledge of FHE encryption.\n\n1 View gallery Blockchain.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent reports by crypto journalist Colin Wu reveal a significant transaction involving Ethereum (ETH), worth $64.4 million. The funds were moved from an account previously associated with the Ethereum Foundation, identified as \"0x8e23,\" to a newly created address, \"0x8798.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original transaction in which the Ethereum Foundation sent 44,167 ETH, then worth $40,930, to \"0x8e23,\" took place nine years ago on Nov. 20, 2015. As of now, this amount of Ethereum is equivalent to $154.58 million.\n\nThis is not the first time that one of the key entities associated with the major altcoin token may have sold its ETH. However, it is one of the largest in recent times, with previous recent cases not exceeding 100 ETH, or $350,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, justified these sales with the need to cover the operating costs of the organization, or charity. Whether the possible sale of ETH worth tens of millions of dollars is justified by such a need remains a question.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price outlook\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the main altcoin continues to torment traders in the range of $3,400 to $3,900, and it still will not update its all-time high at $4,868.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nUncertainty is added by the low-liquidity summer market and confusion with the dates related to the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. However, experts expect the situation to be resolved soon."

Solana has recently eclipsed Ethereum in terms of active addresses and trading volume, boasting over one million active addresses and climbing, challenging Ethereum\u2019s market dominance.\n\nAlthough Solana is advancing, Ethereum maintains a strong position due to its comprehensive security measures and network activity. Industry experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s dedication to security and scalability will help it retain its leading role. As this rivalry deepens, the crypto community is eager to see which blockchain will lead beyond 2024.\n\nXRP\u2019s Market Recovery Post-SEC Legal Battle\n\nXRP has encountered notable hurdles, particularly following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple, which caused it to fall from the third to the seventh position in digital asset rankings. Despite the ongoing legal battles providing some clarity, Ripple faces unresolved regulatory issues that continue to affect XRP\u2019s market performance.\n\nCrypto enthusiast Bill Morgan pointed out that XRP is lagging behind its peers. For XRP to experience a price recovery, it needs to overcome these regulatory challenges and secure key support levels. The future of XRP is filled with uncertainties, leaving the community watching closely to see if it will regain its previous stature.\n\nRevolutionising Mobile Mining: BlockDAG\u2019s X1 App\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s X1 app is transforming the mobile mining landscape with state-of-the-art features that ensure efficiency and simplicity, positioning BlockDAG at the forefront of the crypto mining industry.

        "content": "Ethereum price jumped 8% over the weekend as the asset experienced renewed investor interest. The price dipped to $3,362 before beginning an uptrend throughout the weekend. By Monday\u2019s European business hours, ETH hovered around $3,586, marking a 1.2% increase in 24 hours but a 2.7% drop over the past 7 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s price remained in a consolidation zone, with an anticipated directional move expected soon.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Bulls Take Advantage of Major Support\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH price witnessed an 8-day continuous fall last week, going from $3,878 to $3,362. In the drop, the asset broke a critical support level responsible for holding it above $3,650. Bears took advantage of the ensuing panic to drive prices even lower.\n\nThe bulls eventually utilized another stronger support structure between $3,400 and $3,250 to bounce Ethereum price action back into an uptrend. The asset may have entered another consolidation zone between $3,600 and $3,300, but it is too early to tell. The bulls\u2019 main challenge lies in breaking above the $3,600 support-turned-resistance. If they succeed, ETH price may rise to $4,216, with some resistance around $3,800 and $3,900.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is at a crucial place on its daily chart, trending around a key support level ($65,000). On Friday, bears managed to push the price below the support level, but they were met with hostile rejection from the bulls. A clean break below this level would result in a further downside to $57,000. On the flip side, this support level is strong and has been tested three times before. A bounce from here may result in a BTC price surge to $72,500. A break above this might easily launch Bitcoin to new all-time high prices.\n\nSpot ETF S-1\u2019s Will Likely be Approved by the End of Summer\n\nGary Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchanges Commission (S.E.C.), hinted at a likely Ethereum ETF S-1 approval by the end of summer. This news may have likely caused the reversal in Ethereum price over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum blob usage has been trending up for about 5 weeks now as rollups continue to see more and more activity. Blobs improve the efficiency of Layer 2 (L2) transactions, reducing congestion and potentially cutting down on gas fees.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSpot ETFs for crypto assets have historically been great price boosters. As summer approaches an end, the crypto markets watch closely for Ethereum Spot ETF approval. By releasing this information, Ethereum investors are now in a buy-the-rumor phase that may last until the eventual approval of the ETF.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Crypto Market Heats Up: Ethereum ETF, Bitcoin's $85K Prediction, and Furrever Token's Referral Rewards - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "New York City, NY, June 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as several key developments take center stage. Ethereum's anticipated ETF approval, Bitcoin's potential rise to $85K, and the growing interest in Furrever Token's unique referral rewards are capturing the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nEthereum ETF Anticipation\n\nEthereum is on the brink of a significant milestone with the potential approval of its Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Market analysts predict that this approval could occur as soon as July 2, marking a crucial step forward for Ethereum. An approved ETF would offer a regulated investment option for both institutional and retail investors, likely leading to a substantial influx of capital into Ethereum.\n\nRecent comments from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler have fueled optimism, suggesting a favorable stance towards ETFs. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas notes that the final approvals may follow minor adjustments between issuers and the SEC. This development could pave the way for a significant market event, boosting Ethereum's price and solidifying its status as a mainstream investment option.\n\nBitcoin Targets $85K\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is poised for a potential surge to $85K, driven by increasing mining costs and historical price patterns. The relationship between rising mining expenses and Bitcoin's price suggests that BTC could reach new heights as miners seek profitability. Historically, Bitcoin's price has often increased to match or surpass mining costs, indicating a potential rise to $85K.\n\nThis upward trajectory is supported by growing institutional interest and favorable market conditions. Analysts forecast that Bitcoin's price could exceed $85K, driven by heightened demand from both retail and institutional investors. The strong fundamentals and increasing mining costs create upward pressure on Bitcoin's price, making this prediction plausible.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token's Delightful Rise with Referral Rewards\n\nFurrever Token, a cryptocurrency themed around cats, is making a notable impact with its innovative approach and engaging referral system. Designed to create a joyful and engaging experience, Furrever Token aims to build a whimsical crypto ecosystem centered around delightful cat imagery and community involvement.\n\nThe token's referral system is a key feature, offering users a 10% bonus in $FURR tokens for every deposit made through their personal referral link. This incentive has significantly driven community growth and engagement, allowing users to earn additional tokens and actively participate in the ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.000732, Furrever Token offers presale investors the potential for up to 15X returns post-launch.\n\nHaving raised over $1.3 million in nearly three months, Furrever Token is in stage 9 of its presale, with a goal to raise $1.9 million. The anticipated launch on PancakeSwap is expected to draw considerable interest due to the token's unique appeal and innovative features. Furrever Token's mission to foster a fun and vibrant crypto community sets it apart in the crowded market, attracting both new and experienced investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe convergence of Ethereum's potential ETF approval, Bitcoin's expected surge to $85K, and Furrever Token's engaging referral rewards is creating an exciting landscape for crypto investors. As Ethereum moves closer to regulatory approval, Bitcoin aims for new highs driven by rising mining costs, and Furrever Token offers unique community-driven opportunities, this period marks a significant turning point in the digital finance narrative.\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on these dynamic developments may find substantial rewards in the coming months. Whether you're interested in Ethereum's ETF-driven growth, Bitcoin's bullish outlook, or Furrever Token's charming and profitable ecosystem, now is the time to explore these opportunities and potentially realize significant gains. The crypto market is heating up, and these developments are set to make waves across the financial landscape.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "There has been a lot of changes in the price of Ethereum in the recent past. ETH price fell to $3,368 on June 14 before rising to $3,512 and remaining above $3,500 at the time of writing. At the moment, ETH is trading at over $3,548, which has risen by 0.34% in the last day even as it fell by 2.96% in the past week. These price movements have been felt in both the long and short positions in the market.\n\nOther on-chain metrics include changes in ETH\u2019s realized profit, which is the total value of all coins that have been moved and sold at a price lower than the current market value. The realized profit for ETH was $55.18 million on June 12 and increased to $104.58 million by June 14.\n\nThis increase may therefore be an indication of the holders taking profits which if the pressure is sustained may lead to a price drop. Nevertheless, if the profit taken hits the market at $3,400 \u2013 $3,600 levels, it might trade between this range in the coming days."

        "content": "NOT followed TON\u2019s price direction as demand pushed the volume to $1.37 billion\n\nToken seemed overbought, pointing to a possible fall to $0.016 on the charts\n\nNotcoin [NOT] defied the broader market \u201cred period\u201d as the price climbed by 7.22% in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, this happened at a time when Bitcoin [BTC] slid to $65,103 before slightly recovering above $66,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] also registered a decline to $3,381 around the same time. The performance underscores Notcoin\u2019s next-to-nothing correlation with the top two cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt press time, NOT changed hands at $0.020. On 14 June, however, the token had initially tapped $0.022 on the price charts.\n\nNOT sentiment bullish, goes with TON\n\nHowever, Notcoin is not alone in its rise as fellow Telegram-linked project Toncoin [TON] joined in too. A few weeks ago, AMBCrypto had reported how NOT did not follow the same trend as TON.\n\nOn the back of the latest price hike, it would seem now that the two have aligned.\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, we also found that sentiment around Notcoin has been incredibly bullish. Using the Weighted Sentiment metric, for instance, AMBCrypto observed that the reading was 0.178 on 13 June. However, at press time, the same metric had hit 0.617.\n\nThe notable hike within a short period implies that online comments about NOT were much more positive than those that were bearish about the token.\n\nApart from the price hike and bullish sentiment, Notcoin\u2019s volume surpassed the $1 billion mark. The increase in volume constituted a 131% hike in the last 24 hours.\n\nTrading volume is crucial for a cryptocurrency\u2019s price and direction. It indicates if market participants are interested in a token.\n\nHeavy movement of the volume, alongside a price increase, suggests an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, if the spike comes with a price fall, it implies a hike in selling pressure.\n\nNotcoin\u2019s price may go down later\n\nFor NOT, it was the former. However, it is unlikely that NOT\u2019s volume would hit $4 billion like it did when the price hit an all-time high of $0.029 on 2 June.\n\nEvidence of this was reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is an oscillator that measures speed and changes in price movements.\n\nA value of over 70 indicates that an asset is overbought. When it is less than 30, it means that it is oversold. In Notcoin\u2019s case, the RSI on the daily chart had a reading of 74.27.\n\nSimply put, the token was overbought. Thus, the price might begin a slow reversal down the chart. If this happens, the price of NOT might fall to $0.016 within a few days.\n\nHowever, this prediction would be invalidated if the broader market condition changes. Assuming prices across the board begin to move north, NOT might follow suit.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s NOT\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nShould this be the case, the value of the token might jump to $0.022 once more. Besides that, market participants should be on the lookout for developments or announcements around the project as this could also impact the price."

        "content": "Both longs and shorts experienced a turbulent time after ETH\u2019s price went up and down\n\nRealized Profits increased, indicating that the value may fall below $3,400\n\nThe high volatility in the market caused liquidations in the market to hit $215 million. Out of this, Ethereum [ETH] contracts accounted for $50.61 million, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nLiquidations occur when a trader does not have a sufficient margin balance to keep a position open. The forceful closure is necessary to avoid further losses.\n\nStormy season for the market\n\nFor ETH, the high liquidations could be linked to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. A look at the price action revealed that it dropped to $3,368 at some point on 14 June. Later on, the value rose to $3,512, before settling above $3,500 at press time.\n\nAs a result of these price swings, both longs and shorts were not spared. Longs refer to traders betting on the price of an asset to hike. Shorts, on the other hand, are traders with stakes on a price decline.\n\nHowever, traders seemed to expect the depreciation in price. This, because of the Put/Call ratio before Friday\u2019s options of expiry. According to Deribit, the derivatives exchange, Ethereum\u2019s Put/Call Ratio was 0.37.\n\nSince the ratio was below 0.50, it meant that expectations have been bearish. However, it did not seem the participants anticipated the high level of volatility.\n\nIn terms of the price, AMBCrypto looked at the Realized Profit too. As the name implies, this denotes the total of all moved coins whose last price was lower than its press time value.\n\nETH plans to swing between $3,400 and $3,600\n\nOn 12 June, ETH\u2019s Realized Profit was $55.18 million. By 14 June, the value had risen to $104. 58 million. An increase in this metric implies that holders are booking profits, and this could lead to a price fall on the charts.\n\nHowever, if the metric stabilizes itself, selling pressure reduces across the market. For Ethereum, Realized Profit seems to have settled around the aforementioned value. Therefore, it might be likely for the altcoins to trade between $3, 400 and $3,600 over the next few days.\n\nAMBCrypto also analyzed Exchange inflows and outflows to assess ETH\u2019s next movement. Exchange inflows track the number of coins sent into exchanges.\n\nIf this increases, it means that holders are planning to sell. When this happens, the price of a cryptocurrency usually decreases. Exchange outflows, on the other hand, measures the number of coins sent out of exchanges.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Exchange inflows were $34,400 while the altcoin\u2019s outflows were 24,100. The difference in the flows implied that there were more ETH up for sale, than those retired to cold wallets.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIf this continues, the price of the cryptocurrency might drop below $3,400 like it did on 14 June. On the other hand, a fall in selling pressure could halt this decline and ETH might keep consolidating on the charts."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Down: Why is ETH Price Crashing? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing a week-long downward trend, Ethereum's price has also felt the impact of this market pressure, mirroring the current volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a notable decline in its price lately. This fluctuation highlights the ongoing instability and interconnectedness of cryptocurrency prices. Yet, Why is Ethereum price crashing? Let's take a look at this in more detail.\n\nHow has the Ethereum Price Moved Recently?\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart- TradingView\n\nAs of today, Ethereum is priced at $3,561.84, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12.75 billion, a market cap of $427.91 billion, and a market dominance of 17.63%. Over the last 24 hours, ETH has seen a slight decline of 0.30%.\n\nEthereum hit its peak price of $4,867.17 on November 10, 2021. Its lowest price was $0.420897, recorded on October 21, 2015. Since reaching its all-time high, the lowest price ETH has dropped to is $897.01. The highest price it has reached since this cycle low is $4,094.18. Currently, the sentiment for Ethereum price predictions remains neutral, with the Fear & Greed Index showing a reading of 71, indicating a state of greed.\n\nThe circulating supply of Ethereum stands at 120.14 million ETH. Over the past year, the supply has decreased by 0.24%, equating to a reduction of 292,161 ETH.\n\nWhy is Ethereum (ETH) price down?\n\nThe decline in Ethereum's price can be attributed to several key factors. First, the anticipation of an important Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the release of U.S. inflation data are creating uncertainty in the market. Investors often react to such economic indicators with caution, leading to a decrease in buying activity.\n\nFurthermore, there is a noticeable shift in the behavior of Ethereum's largest holder groups. These major stakeholders are showing a reduced tendency to accumulate more ETH, which is contributing to increased selling pressure in the market. This combination of macroeconomic concerns and changes in accumulation sentiment among significant holders is driving the current downward trend in Ethereum's price.\n\nWill Ethereum Reach $4000?\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to reach the $4000 mark is supported by several key indicators and market dynamics. Over the past year, Ethereum's price has increased by an impressive 106%. This significant growth showcases robust demand and strong investor confidence in ETH. Such a substantial annual performance suggests a positive trajectory that could potentially drive the price towards $4000.\n\nIn addition to its overall growth, Ethereum has outperformed 50% of the top 100 crypto assets over the last year. This relative strength indicates that Ethereum is not only growing but also maintaining a competitive edge in the broader cryptocurrency market. This competitive position often attracts further investment and interest, contributing to price appreciation.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ethereum is currently trading above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely followed indicator used to assess the long-term trend of an asset. Trading above the 200-day SMA suggests that Ethereum is in a sustained uptrend, providing a favorable condition for reaching higher price targets like $4000. Moreover, in the past 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 16 green days, accounting for 53% of the time. This positive momentum reflects consistent buying interest and bullish sentiment among investors, which, if sustained, could support further price increases.\n\nHigh liquidity, backed by Ethereum's substantial market cap, ensures that large trades can be executed without significantly impacting the price. High liquidity is crucial for sustaining price increases, indicating a healthy market where buying and selling activities can occur smoothly. This liquidity, combined with the other positive indicators, provides a solid foundation for Ethereum's potential rise to $4000.\n\nWhile the path to $4000 is not guaranteed and depends on multiple factors, the current indicators and market conditions suggest that it is possible. Investors should stay informed about market trends and macroeconomic factors while considering both the opportunities and risks involved. Continued positive market sentiment, stable or improving macroeconomic conditions, and ongoing technological and ecosystem developments within Ethereum can significantly bolster its chances of reaching this price level."
