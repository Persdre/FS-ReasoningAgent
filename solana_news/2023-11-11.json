        "title": "What Is the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade? - Binance Academy",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade aims to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency within the Ethereum network, introducing the concept of proto-danksharding.\n\nDanksharding represents the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade that enhances data management and transaction processing.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade is designed to bring faster transaction processing times, reduced transaction costs, and optimized data management. Potential risks include impacts on existing smart contracts and the integration of new data storage techniques.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the introduction of sharding are vital components of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. PoS reduces energy consumption by replacing miners with validators, who are selected to create new blocks based on the amount of ETH they stake.\n\nMeanwhile, sharding increases transaction speed by partitioning the Ethereum network into smaller pieces (shards), with each capable of independently processing transactions and smart contracts. The shift from PoW to PoS enables secure and efficient sharding by randomly assigning validators to specific shards, preventing manipulation and enhancing performance.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade represents an important advancement in the Ethereum blockchain, aimed at fortifying the network's scalability, security, and overall efficiency. This upgrade introduces the concept of proto-danksharding, an important step toward optimizing data management and enhancing transaction affordability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging innovative data storage techniques, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade is poised to revolutionize the way the network processes transactions, paving the way for a more accessible and seamless user experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade (also known as the \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d upgrade) is a concerted effort by Ethereum to bolster its infrastructure and address unresolved issues after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is based on four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs): EIP-4844, EIP-1153, EIP-4788, and EIP-6780. Together, the implementation of these EIPs can provide many benefits, including improved scalability, enhanced data storage and availability, and reduced transaction costs.\n\nWith a primary focus on optimizing the execution layer (Layer 1), the Cancun upgrade prepares the network for the future implementation of full data sharding, a vital component in Ethereum's long-term development strategy.\n\nSharding refers to splitting a blockchain database into smaller portions, called shards, for higher efficiency, and the Cancun upgrade introduces a specific type of sharding known as proto-danksharding (discussed below).\n\nThe goal of the Cancun upgrade is to increase the network\u2019s transactions per second (TPS), aligning with Ethereum's roadmap's \"Surge\" phase, aiming to scale performance to 100,000+ TPS.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade \u2013 along with the subsequent Deneb upgrade \u2013 represents a significant milestone in Ethereum's journey towards establishing itself as a leading decentralized finance platform.\n\nDanksharding and Proto-Danksharding\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding are different iterations of the sharding technology developed for Ethereum. Named after Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist, danksharding is a type of sharding that serves as the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade. It concentrates on optimizing data availability for rollups within the Ethereum network.\n\nTechnically speaking, danksharding is a design that introduces the concept of a merged market fee. While traditional sharding has different blocks and block proposers for each shard, there is only one block proposer in danksharding. In simple terms, danksharding can enhance transaction processing and streamline data storage by simplifying the sharding architecture and prioritizing data management.\n\nIn the context of the upgrade, proto-danksharding (introduced by EIP-4844) serves as a prototype of danksharding. It\u2019s a temporary solution that can significantly reduce gas fees associated with rollups before the complete implementation of the danksharding framework.\n\nBlob-carrying transactions\n\nBlob-carrying transactions were introduced along with proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to help reduce gas fees. Blob-carrying transactions allow the temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data, meaning extra data can be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\nBenefits of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade can provide a range of benefits, including faster transaction processing, reduced transaction costs, optimized data management, and improved cross-chain communication. By introducing the concept of blob-carrying transactions, the upgrade aims to streamline data processing and enhance overall network efficiency.\n\n1. Better scalability: Proto-danksharding introduces temporary data storage capacity, allowing Layer 2 rollups (and the network as a whole) to process more transactions per second.\n\n2. Reduced transaction costs: Blob-carrying transactions allow extra data to be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\n3. Optimized data management: EIP-1153 can optimize block space and reduce on-chain data storage costs.\n\n4. Better cross-chain communication: EIP-4788 aims to improve interoperability between different blockchain networks by exposing the Beacon chain to execution layers.\n\n5. Improved security: EIP-6780 can reduce the risk of smart contract termination by disempowering the SELFDESTRUCT code, enhancing the security of user data and funds.\n\nPotential Risks of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThere might be risks related to the potential impact of the upgrade on existing smart contracts and the intricacies of integrating new data storage techniques. These require extensive testing and careful consideration during the implementation phase to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024 (at epoch 269,568). Node operators and stakers must upgrade their software to releases listed in the official announcement.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade marks a significant leap forward in Ethereum's quest for improved scalability, efficiency, and user experience. By introducing proto-danksharding and laying the groundwork for future advancements, the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will likely enhance the realm of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "content": "Ethereum price has been consolidating along an ascending trendline for the past eighteen months, with the $2,035 level holding as resistance.\n\nThe overall price action has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which forecasts a $4,736 price target for ETH.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated once the altcoin breaks and closes below the ascending trendline at the $1,500 psychological level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is bullish on lower and higher timeframes alike, as token holders ride the wave of what already seems to be the making of a bull market. On the higher timeframe, however, the target objective for the largest altcoin by market capitalization looks overly ambitious, but not impossible as community members turn faces toward the exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative and the much-anticipated Bitcoin (BTC) halving, together with their combined effect on asset prices.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC rages on, $40,000 may not be hopium after all\n\nEthereum price 18-month ascending triangle forecasts $4,736 target\n\nEthereum (ETH) price consolidating above an ascending triangle, combined with the effect of the formation of multiple local tops around the$2,035 level has led to the formation of an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nSuch a technical formation is created when the asset\u2019s price lead to the formation of a horizontal line connecting the swing highs, while a rising trendline trails it from below connecting the swing lows. Together, the trendlines form a triangle, with traders watching for breakouts from the horizontal trendline. The target objective for such a technical formation is determined by measuring the height of the triangle and superimposing it at the breakout point.\n\nFor Ethereum price, the height of the triangle is around 134%, from $865 to $2,035 on the weekly timeframe. Superimposing this percentage difference on the weekly chart puts a target objective of $4,736.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) spurs optimism, moving north to signify rising momentum while its position at 64 shows there is still more room to the north. Effectively, the Awesome Oscillators (AO) histogram bars are also flashing green to show the bulls maintain a strong presence in the ETH market.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flip side, profit-taking could nullify the projection by sending Ethereum price south, potentially losing the support offered by the ascending trendline at the $1,500 psychological level. This would invalid the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis hinted at a potential boom for Ethereum with the registration of BlackRock\u2019s IShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware. Expressing confidence in this prediction, Davis speculated that BlackRock wouldn\u2019t undertake such a move unless they were pretty sure about obtaining approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nHe playfully suggested that beyond Ethereum, BlackRock might eventually explore ETFs for other cryptocurrencies like Chainlink, Solana, and even Dogecoin. While BlackRock isn\u2019t the first to file for a spot in Ethereum ETF, joining others like Invesco and Hashdex, Davis sees this as a sign of institutional interest aligning for a significant influx of institutional money.\n\nHighlighting potential numbers, Davis discussed the current Ethereum holdings on exchanges, which amount to about 14 million ETH or $28 billion at the current price. He estimated that if Ethereum attracts half the inflows that Bitcoin does into ETF products, it could result in up to half of the available coins being acquired in the first year alone.\n\nReferencing Galaxy Digital\u2019s estimates for a Bitcoin ETF, Davis halved the numbers for Ethereum, projecting $7 billion in the first year, $14 billion in the second, and $20 billion in the third. He said that such inflows, coupled with increasing demand, could lead to a situation where every Ethereum is bought up within three years.\n\nBeyond BlackRock\u2019s potential move, Davis touched on other bullish catalysts for Ethereum. These include the monthly MACD nearing a bullish cross, with Ethereum catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s trend. Additionally, he noted that 28.3 million ETH is currently staked, creating an over 2-year exit queue and restricting immediate dumping on the market. Davis also pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s deflationary nature, EIP-4844 reducing gas fees on layer twos, and the ongoing migration to layer twos would further drive Ethereum\u2019s growth."
