        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Future Outlook - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The analysis of the price of Ethereum (ETH) is a recent and central topic in the world of cryptocurrencies, with experts actively discussing the future market dynamics.\n\nRecent developments have captured the attention of investors: the possibility that the price of Ethereum reaches 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs and the future implications of the approvals of spot Ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum: short-term price outlook and the analysis of the impact of the ETF\n\nArthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, has suggested that the price of Ethereum could reach 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs. This prediction is based on a combination of technical and fundamental factors. In particular, Cheong highlights the growing adoption of Ethereum in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, which are driving the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous improvement of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, such as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d upgrade, promises to solve scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. These developments could further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nL\u2019approvazione degli ETF spot Ether da parte della SEC statunitense rappresenta una svolta significativa per il mercato delle criptovalute. Secondo esperti come Bill Hughes di Consensys, questa mossa \u00e8 un\u2019ammissione implicita che Ethereum \u00e8 considerato un bene commodity.\n\nThe adoption of ETF on Ethereum could make the cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors, increasing liquidity and stabilizing prices.\n\nEric Balchunas, analista di Bloomberg, prevede che il lancio degli ETF su Ethereum seguir\u00e0 uno schema simile a quello degli ETF su Bitcoin, con una competizione intensa tra gli emittenti. Tuttavia, Balchunas nota che gli ETF su Ethereum potrebbero generare un volume inferiore rispetto a quelli su Bitcoin, stimando una raccolta totale di circa 1-2 miliardi di dollari nelle prime settimane.\n\nMatthew Sigel di VanEck, uno degli emittenti di ETF, highlights the importance of presenting Ethereum as an asset with intrinsic value, especially to tech and equity investors.\n\nSigel believes that many of these investors are not yet aware of the potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nGlobal competition and regulatory outlook\n\nYat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, observes that the approval of ETFs on Ethereum in the United States could stimulate other jurisdictions to follow suit.\n\nCountries like the Regno Unito, Singapore, Giappone, and Emirati Arabi Uniti might be incentivized to introduce their own crypto-based ETFs to avoid falling behind in the global competition.\n\nSiu emphasizes that this competition could lead to interesting developments and a change in sentiment in the United States towards greater acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTuttavia, la trasparenza delle normative rimane una preoccupazione, come evidenziato da Hughes, che critica la SEC per la mancanza di chiarezza sulle implicazioni delle sue decisioni.\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price and its future prospects are influenced by a series of interconnected factors. The forecast of a short-term price increase up to 4,500 dollars reflects the optimism about the growing adoption and technological improvements of Ethereum.\n\nAt the same time, the approval of Ethereum ETFs could represent a breakthrough for traditional investors\u2019 accessibility to the cryptocurrency market, further stabilizing the price.\n\nThe global competition for the introduction of cryptocurrency ETFs and regulatory developments will continue to play a crucial role in determining the future of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and market observers will need to closely monitor these developments to adapt their investment strategies in a rapidly changing environment."

        "content": "The upgrade will replace EIP-3074 with EIP-7702, proposed previously by Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s anticipated Pectra upgrade is now scheduled for release by the end of Q1 2025, according to recent updates from Ethereum developers. Pectra is the next major milestone on Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap, following the Dencun upgrade which was successfully deployed in March.\n\nSome more up to date thoughts the next hard fork after Cancun, Pectra (Prague + Electra):\n\n* Ship Pectra by end of Q1 2025.\n\n* Include PeerDAS for Rollups to scale.\n\n* Include EOF for improving the EVM on both L1 and L2. Longer doc inside.\n\nExcited for the conversation to continue. https://t.co/lNwYg0I4vj pic.twitter.com/80dJfALaSv \u2014 Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) May 23, 2024\n\nThe decision comes after Ethereum developers evaluated multiple timeline scenarios. The team has opted against a rushed release before Devcon in November 2024, favoring a more cautious approach that allows for the inclusion of additional, impactful user features.\n\n\u201cWe are observing that this is also what happened with Cancun, so being realistic, my vote would be to aim to ship Prague in Q1 2025. With today\u2019s scope, delaying Prague seems to have marginal impact on users and allows us to consider expanding the scope to include more impactful features for users,\u201d Ethereum developers noted in a document.\n\nDevcon is the largest developer summit in the Asia Pacific region. This year, the event will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12-15, aiming to bring together developers, technology leaders, and dev-tool companies to learn, discuss, and debate the key opportunities and challenges in the developer ecosystem.\n\nAvoiding releasing the Pectra upgrade before/during Devcon will allow the developer team to effectively monitor the execution of Pectra.\n\nDuring the deployment of Dencun on the Goerli testnet in January, Ethereum developers encountered difficulties achieving consensus within the expected timeframe. The issue was then resolved, allowing the Goerli testnet to finally reach consensus.\n\nIn addition to the upgrade timeline, the focus is on improvements in the consensus layer scope and execution layer scope. Developers aim to integrate PeerDAS into Pectra to enhance Ethereum\u2019s Data Availability capacity ahead of the Osaka upgrade, as noted in the document.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Osaka upgrade is a future hard fork that is expected to include features that were previously considered for the Pectra upgrade but have been postponed. Specifically, the Osaka upgrade is likely to include the implementation of Verkle Tree, a new data structure designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and decentralization.\n\nDevelopers also considered the inclusion of EOF to improve smart contract security and developer experience, as well as other enhancements like replacing EIP-3074 with EIP-7702 for better account abstraction compatibility, and patching EIP-2935.\n\n\u201cWe need to decide on EIP7702 on ACDE, and if so, implement it as a replacement for EIP-3074. We think it makes sense to do so as it\u2019s a more native-AA compatible solution because of the new transaction type vs an opcode,\u201d Ethereum developers wrote.\n\nEIP-7702 is a new transaction type proposed by a group of prominent Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, earlier this month. The proposal is expected to bring similar benefits to EIP-3074 while addressing its potential risks."

        "title": "Crypto Highlights: Bitcoin Price Volatility, Ethereum ETF Hopes, and Furrever Token's $1.2M Presale Finale - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with significant developments influencing investor sentiment and market dynamics. Recently, Bitcoin has faced potential price risks, Ethereum has generated buzz with ETF speculations, and Furrever Token is nearing the end of its successful $1.2 million presale. Here's an in-depth look at these key events and their potential impacts on the market.\n\nBitcoin Faces Price Drop Risks\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing potential price risks that have raised concerns among investors. A significant factor contributing to these fears is the activity of long-term holders. According to a recent analysis by analysts, these holders, who have amassed significant quantities of Bitcoin over time, are showing signs of profit-taking. This behavior often precedes a price drop, as large sell-offs can create downward pressure on Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe data suggests that long-term holders have been moving their BTC to exchanges, indicating a potential intent to sell. This trend, if it continues, could lead to increased volatility and a further decline in Bitcoin's price. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as regulatory developments and changes in investor sentiment, are also playing a role in the current market dynamics.\n\nDespite these concerns, Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption is growing, with major companies and financial institutions recognizing Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. The integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class provides a solid foundation for its future growth.\n\nEthereum ETF Hopes Stir Optimism\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has generated significant buzz with the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. A recent report by a trusted source highlights that industry experts, including Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, believe that a spot Ethereum ETF could be beneficial for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Ethereum. This could lead to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of ETH. Furthermore, an Ethereum ETF would signify a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial markets, paving the way for further innovation and adoption.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cautious in its approach to approving cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the growing interest from institutional investors and the increasing pressure from the crypto industry could eventually lead to a favorable decision.\n\nThe anticipation of an Ethereum ETF has already had a positive impact on market sentiment. Investors are hopeful that this development will bring more legitimacy to Ethereum and attract a new wave of capital into the market. As the industry awaits the SEC's decision, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF remains a key factor to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token\u2019s $1.2 Million Presale Nears to an End\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum navigate their respective challenges and opportunities, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves with its unique approach to the crypto market. Furrever Token aims to create a heartwarming ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery, offering a refreshing contrast to the often serious and technical world of blockchain projects.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a resounding success, raising over $1.2 million as it nears its end. This achievement highlights the strong interest and support from the crypto community. Built on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token has a total supply of around 9 billion tokens. Of these, 65% are available during the presale, 25% are allocated for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and 10% are reserved for the team, with a one-year lock on these tokens.\n\nFurrever Token's appeal lies in its blend of fun and innovation. The project integrates cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals, transforming everyday interactions into delightful experiences. Community engagement is a cornerstone of the Furrever ecosystem, with regular challenges and events that encourage users to share their love for cuteness. Future surprises, featuring exclusive cat content, are also planned to keep the community engaged and entertained.\n\nSecurity and compliance are paramount for Furrever Token. The project\u2019s smart contract has been audited by Securi Lab, ensuring a secure and reliable platform for users. The team, while not doxxed, has shown commitment to the project's longevity by locking their tokens for a year. The organic growth of the Furrever Token community, with nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram, further underscores its legitimacy and potential.\n\nAs the presale nears its end, now is the ideal time to invest in Furrever Token. The combination of a strong community, innovative approach, high return rates, and robust tokenomics makes Furrever Token a standout option for those looking to capitalize on emerging trends in the cryptocurrency market. With its unique blend of cuteness and substantial growth potential, Furrever Token presents a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin faces price risks and Ethereum generates optimism with ETF speculations, Furrever Token's successful presale and engaging community offer a unique and promising investment avenue. The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market continues to offer opportunities for those willing to explore beyond the mainstream and invest in projects with distinctive value propositions.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nJoin $20,000 Furrever Token Giveaway\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "How Green Is Ethereum? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum's update in September 2022 was called the Merge. Developers integrated the long-anticipated transition to proof-of-stake in this update (among other issues) significantly reducing the blockchain's energy requirement. The new Ethereum chain, which was called Ethereum 2.0 until the Ethereum Foundation requested that it not be, reduced energy use and promised faster transactions and lower gas fees. Read on to discover how green Ethereum is and learn about its plans that may be even more environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum blockchain upgrade was called the Merge.\n\nThe upgrade enhanced the network and reduced energy consumption.\n\nIts proof-of-stake validation mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work mechanisms.\n\nGas fees fell after the Merge (not because of it), but they aren't as low as from 2017 to 2020.\n\nThe Merge set the stage for further scalability enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nEthereum and Energy Use\n\nEthereum is a software platform that is open to anyone. It is commonly associated with ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency that is bought and sold by investors. Ethereum can be used by anyone for different reasons, including banking and finance, network and application building, and peer-to-peer financial networking without the need for middlemen.\n\nEthereum was created in 2013 and launched two years later by Vitalik Buterin. It is among the most well-known names in the cryptocurrency markets, coming in as the second-largest by market capitalization after Bitcoin. As of May 27, 2024, Ethereum's market cap was $466.67 billion. But, Ethereum mining is no longer possible after the move from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-stake reduced the blockchain's energy use by more than 99%.\n\nPoS differs from PoW in that it is not a network-wide competitive process of encrypting information through a hashing algorithm. PoS still uses a hashing algorithm and verifies transactions through a consensus layer, but the validators are randomly chosen by the network based on the amount of ether they have staked. Staking means offering ether as collateral to become a network validator so the participant can earn ether rewards.\n\nSelecting one semi-trusted validator to hash the information in a block and verify it uses far less energy than a competition. So, Ethereum is much more green in terms of energy consumption than it used to be.\n\nWere Ethereum Gas Fees Reduced?\n\nTransaction fees rose on the Ethereum network in 2020 because of increased network activity. At the time, the transactions of originators who offered the most in fees were placed in front of those who paid less. This created a fee war of sorts, with users trying to get their transactions validated quicker and miners charging more for prime validation spots.\n\nAn earlier attempt to fix rising costs tried to remove the transaction auction mentality from the network by imposing a base fee and a priority fee. The priority fee is similar to a tip to validators for them to choose to process one transaction instead of another. This was ineffective at lowering transaction fees because users still increased their tips to get transactions approved faster.\n\nEthereum is on its way to becoming a greener blockchain and network. Future upgrades are expected to make it more efficient, scalable, and less costly.\n\n\n\nEthereum Transaction Speeds\n\nThe Merge, which was an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain to a different version set the stage for future upgrades. Many people called the upgrade Ethereum 2.0, It was the most significant update to the system. Although it didn't improve transaction speeds at the time or even a few years later, future upgrades will introduce improvements in network speed and scalability.\n\nIs Ethereum Green?\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the blockchain and network consume 0.0026 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr). This translates to the equivalent of 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Compare this to Bitcoin's 149 TWh/yr and global data centers' 190 TWh/yr. Ethereum also consumes less energy than video gaming in the U.S. (34 TWh/yr) and less than Google (19 TWh/yr).\n\nThe University of Cambridge's Judge Business School researched the energy sources for the Ethereum network after the Merge. According to its findings, 48% of Ethereum's energy comes from sustainable sources like wind power, nuclear power, and other renewables. The remaining 52% is powered by natural gas (30%), coal (19%), and oil (3%).\n\nAccording to similar reports, Ethereum is greener than it was before switching to PoS. However, there are many more upgrades planned that have the potential to make it even more efficient and eco-friendly.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight new spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May 2024. Trading will take place on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX. There is no initial trading date as of yet, as the SEC is still working on final approvals. The move follows the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January 2024\u2014three years after Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched.\n\nThe Green Future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum has plans for upgrades to bring a new concept to the blockchain, which is expected to allow it to scale and increase transaction processing speeds. In March 2024, the Dencun Upgrade was released.\n\nThis upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, a process where second-layer rollup providers can send Binary Objects (also known as blobs) to the Ethereum main chain. Blobs are much cheaper to send than rollups, so transaction fees are expected to drop when full danksharding is released.\n\nThe full upgrade to danksharding is expected to allow Ethereum to scale up to more than 100,000 transactions per second and be cheaper, both of which will contribute to its greenness.\n\nFuture upgrades will address issues regarding:\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nDecentralization\n\nProtocol risks from Maximal Extractable Value\n\nBlock verification\n\nComputational costs\n\nMaximal Extractable Value is the maximum amount of value a validator or miner can get from a block in excess of the block reward and usual fees.\n\nThe lesser the blockchain costs, the more decentralized it becomes and the more efficient it will be. However, there are concerns whether decentralized applications built on Ethereum will consume more energy. Ethereum has positioned itself as the platform of choice for Web3 development.\n\nWeb3 is a concept of restructuring the backend of the internet, where control of people's information, data, and digital creations are returned to them. Many steps must be taken and hurdles overcome before blockchain technology can be used to create the new internet infrastructure conceived by developers.\n\nIf Ethereum is the platform used to create applications for this emerging and in-development restructuring, its eco-friendlier network might not be as environmentally friendly. However, it could be even more so\u2014there is no way to tell.\n\n\n\nDoes Ethereum Use Energy? Yes, Ethereum uses energy. It is a blockchain, a distributed ledger secured by cryptography, which requires energy to run and use.\n\nIs Ethereum Environmentally Friendly? Ethereum's carbon footprint is much less than it was before September 2022 but it still uses energy. Nearly half of its network is located in developed areas that use sustainable energy sources. About 30% of the remaining half is powered by natural gas, 10% by coal, and 3% by oil.\n\nHow Much Energy Did Ethereum Use Before the Merge? According to data from the University of Cambridge's Sustainability Index, Ethereum used about 21.41 THh of electricity per year and released 10.26 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor Ethereum, the evolution to a better-performing, more accessible network has begun. Continued updates promise to cut back on emissions and make the network more energy-efficient while improving speeds and cutting transaction costs. However, Ethereum has much ground to cover to get to the levels of efficiency it wants, both in speed and environmental friendliness."

        "title": "Comparing smart contracts across different blockchains from Ethereum to Solana - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The crypto industry has several unique approaches to smart contract execution and decentralized applications (DApps). These innovations are driven by the need for scalability, security, and efficiency, allowing developers to build increasingly sophisticated applications. Yet, what is so different between the smart contracts on different blockchains? Which is the smartest smart contract platform?\n\nTuring completeness is a key aspect of smart contracts. Turing completeness is a concept from computational theory that refers to a system\u2019s ability to perform any computation given enough time and resources. It is named after the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who developed the concept in the context of the theoretical Turing machine.\n\nAmong the leading blockchain platforms, Ethereum, Internet Computer (ICP), Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana stand out for their distinct strategies in leveraging Turing completeness and smart contracts. This article explores how each platform addresses the challenges and opportunities in the blockchain space, highlighting their specific capabilities and contributions to the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stands as a cornerstone of the Ethereum network, a decentralized platform enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed specifically for Ethereum, facilitating the computation of state changes after each new block addition. Its Turing completeness allows for executing any computation given sufficient resources, making Ethereum capable of supporting complex smart contracts and DApps. This capability, however, necessitates a gas mechanism to measure and manage the computational effort required for each operation. Gas prevents infinite loops and ensures network stability by requiring users to specify a gas limit for their transactions, halting any that exceed this limit.\n\nSmart contract development on Ethereum primarily uses Solidity, a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level programming language influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. Solidity supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, enabling developers to write smart contracts that implement intricate business logic and generate a chain of transaction records on the blockchain. Compiled into EVM bytecode, Solidity code is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, where the EVM executes it to perform the specified operations.\n\nSecurity is paramount in Ethereum smart contracts, given their immutable nature and the significant value they often control. Common vulnerabilities include reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and improper use of delegatecall. High-profile incidents like the DAO hack and Parity wallet issues highlight the importance of secure coding practices.\n\nDespite its theoretical Turing completeness, the EVM faces practical limitations due to the gas mechanism. Gas limits curtail infinite loops and excessively complex computations, ensuring the network remains functional and efficient. This practical constraint is crucial for maintaining network stability, though it limits the complexity of operations that can be executed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Turing completeness has enabled a wide range of applications, including fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens, DeFi platforms, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These capabilities have fostered a thriving ecosystem of DApps and services. Additionally, EVM compatibility allows developers to port their DApps and tokens to other EVM-compatible chains like Polygon and Avalanche, enhancing interoperability and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s pioneering role in blockchain technology drives innovation and adoption in the decentralized application space. Its Turing completeness, coupled with the flexibility and security measures of the EVM, positions Ethereum as a leading platform for developing and deploying smart contracts and DApps.\n\nThe Internet Computer Protocol Smart Contracts & Canisters\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, introduces a novel approach to decentralized applications (DApps) and services through its unique architecture. At the core of ICP are canister smart contracts, which combine code and state, allowing for sophisticated computation and data storage. These canisters are Turing complete, enabling the execution of any computation given sufficient resources. This capability supports the development of complex DApps entirely on-chain, offering a scalable and efficient platform.\n\nOne of ICP\u2019s standout features is its reverse gas model. Unlike traditional blockchains, where users pay transaction fees, ICP developers pre-pay for computational resources by converting ICP tokens into cycles. These cycles, which are stable and pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), cover the costs of computation, storage, and bandwidth. This model eliminates the need for end users to hold tokens or pay gas fees, simplifying the user experience and enabling developers to implement their own tokenomics and monetization strategies.\n\nICP\u2019s interoperability extends to other blockchains, notably through its direct interaction with the Bitcoin network. Features like Threshold ECDSA and the Bitcoin adapter enable canisters to securely hold, receive, and send BTC. Furthermore, ICP has introduced an API that allows its smart contracts to communicate with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity and integration with other blockchain ecosystems.\n\nSecurity and scalability are paramount for ICP. Chain-key cryptography ensures the security and integrity of smart contracts through secure key management and digital signatures. ICP\u2019s architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding new subnets, allowing for the deployment of an unlimited number of canisters and storing vast amounts of data. This scalability is essential for large-scale applications, ensuring the platform can grow to meet increasing demands.\n\nPractical considerations for developers include managing the cycle balance of their canisters to ensure continuous operation. Tools like CycleOps automate this process, making it easier to maintain and top up canisters as needed. The stable cost of cycles also makes ICP an attractive platform for building cost-effective and scalable DApps, providing predictable and manageable expenses for developers.\n\nICP supports various applications, from simple, smart contracts to complex multi-canister projects. Decentralized social media platforms like DSCVR, decentralized email services like Dmail, and various DeFi applications exemplify the diversity of use cases on ICP. The platform\u2019s aim to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services emphasizes its potential to revolutionize how applications are built and operated, offering security, scalability, and user-friendly experiences.\n\nThe Internet Computer\u2019s approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, a reverse gas model, and robust interoperability features, positions it as a powerful platform for the next generation of decentralized applications and services. Its emphasis on security, scalability, and cost efficiency further enhances its appeal, making it a significant player in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nPolkadot Smart Contracts on Parachains\n\nPolkadot is designed to enable interoperability among various blockchains through its unique architecture. The network\u2019s core comprises the relay chain and parachains, each playing a distinct role in maintaining the system\u2019s functionality and scalability. The relay chain serves as the central hub, providing shared security, consensus, and interoperability, while the parachains are independent blockchains tailored for specific use cases, supporting a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nAs a layer 0 protocol, the relay chain does not natively support smart contracts but facilitates the coordination and security of connected parachains. These parachains can communicate with each other and external blockchains via bridges, enabling seamless asset and data transfers across different networks. This interoperability is a key feature of Polkadot, fostering a cohesive ecosystem where various blockchains can operate together.\n\nPolkadot supports smart contracts through several environments, notably ink! and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Ink! is a Rust-based language explicitly designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing developers to write efficient and secure WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts. Polkadot also supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via the EVM pallet, enabling developers to port their existing Ethereum DApps to Polkadot with minimal modifications.\n\nParachains like Moonbeam and Astar Network exemplify Polkadot\u2019s versatile smart contract capabilities. Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible parachain that supports Solidity smart contracts, allowing developers to utilize familiar Ethereum tools and libraries. Astar Network supports EVM and Wasm smart contracts, offering true interoperability with cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and cross-virtual machine (XVM) capabilities. Phala Network, another notable parachain, provides Turing-complete smart contracts with enhanced privacy and security through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Phat Contracts for off-chain computation.\n\nThe Substrate framework underpins Polkadot\u2019s development, providing a modular toolkit for building blockchains and parachains. Substrate supports multiple programming languages, including Rust, Go, and C++, offering developers flexibility. Polkadot\u2019s testnets, such as Kusama and Rococo, provide real-world environments for testing and optimizing smart contracts before deployment on the mainnet.\n\nSecurity in Polkadot is bolstered by its shared security model, where the relay chain ensures the collective security of all connected parachains. This shared security mechanism is critical for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the network. Comprehensive security audits, both manual and automated, are integral to Polkadot\u2019s approach, with tools and services from firms like ImmuneBytes and Hacken helping to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s use cases span various sectors, with DeFi being a prominent area. Projects like Acala Network offer DeFi products, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), staking, and stablecoins, leveraging EVM and Substrate-based smart contracts. Phala Network\u2019s privacy-preserving smart contracts enable secure DeFi applications, such as confidential trading and data management.\n\nCross-chain interoperability is a hallmark of Polkadot, supported by various bridge solutions that connect with external blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. These bridges facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, expanding the reach and utility of the Polkadot ecosystem. Additionally, Polkadot supports gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) applications through parachains like Astar Network, providing a versatile platform for innovative gaming experiences and digital asset management.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s architecture, combining the relay chain and parachains, creates a robust and scalable environment for developing Turing-complete smart contracts. Its support for multiple smart contract languages and environments and a strong emphasis on interoperability and security position Polkadot as a leading platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nCardano Smart Contracts\n\nCardano, a blockchain platform known for its research-driven approach, offers a unique environment for developing smart contracts. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on a single Turing-complete language, Cardano employs a dual-language approach to balance flexibility and security. This includes Plutus, a Turing-complete language, and Marlowe, a non-Turing-complete domain-specific language (DSL) tailored for financial contracts.\n\nBased on Haskell, Plutus allows developers to write complex and expressive smart contracts. Its features include higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, and immutable data structures, hallmarks of functional programming. Plutus contracts consist of on-chain code that runs on the Cardano blockchain and off-chain code that operates on the user\u2019s machine, helping to manage computational resources efficiently. Using Haskell\u2019s strong type system and formal verification capabilities ensures the correctness and security of smart contracts, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nMarlowe, in contrast, is designed specifically for financial agreements and is non-Turing-complete. This design choice guarantees termination, meaning contracts will always complete their execution, avoiding issues like infinite loops. Marlowe\u2019s simplicity and safety make it accessible to users without programming experience. It supports visual programming and traditional coding through the Marlowe Playground, a sandbox environment for developing, simulating, and testing contracts.\n\nSecurity is a critical focus for Cardano, with formal verification and thorough code audits emphasized to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment. The Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) model used by Cardano ensures that transactions are deterministic and predictable, enhancing security by simplifying transaction validation and reducing the risk of unexpected outcomes. Additionally, Cardano treats tokens as native assets, simplifying token transactions and minimizing the risk of smart contract exploits.\n\nDeveloping smart contracts on Cardano requires familiarity with Haskell for Plutus and an understanding of Marlowe for financial contracts. Educational resources like the IOG Academy provide learning paths for developers and financial professionals. Tools like the Marlowe Playground and the Plutus development environment aid in simulating and testing contracts before deployment, ensuring they function as intended.\n\nCardano\u2019s approach to scalability includes Hydra and Mithril, solutions designed to enhance throughput and reduce overhead. These technologies make the platform suitable for large-scale applications. Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, is energy-efficient and scalable, addressing the limitations of older blockchain networks.\n\nBy combining Turing-complete and non-Turing-complete languages, Cardano aims to offer a robust and secure environment for developing decentralized applications. Its emphasis on formal verification, security, and scalability positions it as a strong competitor in blockchain, capable of supporting a wide range of innovative and secure applications.\n\nSolana Smart Contracts\n\nSolana is engineered to support decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with a focus on speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) plays a central role in achieving these goals by providing the execution environment for Solana\u2019s smart contracts. Designed to handle high transaction throughput and low latency, the SVM ensures efficient processing, leveraging Turing completeness to enable any computation given sufficient resources.\n\nThe SVM\u2019s Turing completeness allows developers to create complex and versatile smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. Solana\u2019s unique architecture, including the Sealevel parallel execution engine, significantly enhances the network\u2019s throughput and efficiency by processing multiple transactions simultaneously. This parallel execution capability is crucial for maintaining the high performance that distinguishes Solana from other blockchain platforms.\n\nSmart contract development on Solana primarily uses Rust and C, chosen for their performance and safety features, which are critical for developing secure and efficient contracts. The Anchor framework further simplifies this process by providing tools and libraries that streamline development and ensure best practices. To set up the development environment, developers install the Solana Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Rust, essential for deploying and managing smart contracts on the network.\n\nSolana\u2019s Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism is a key innovation that timestamps transactions to create a verifiable order of events. This reduces the time required to reach consensus and enhances network speed and efficiency. Combined with other architectural innovations, PoH allows Solana to process over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain platforms.\n\nUnlike traditional EVM-based blockchains, Solana\u2019s smart contracts are stateless, meaning the contract logic is separated from the state, which is stored in external accounts. This separation enhances security and scalability by isolating the contract code from the data it interacts with. Solana\u2019s account model allows for program reusability, enabling developers to create new tokens or applications by interacting with existing programs, reducing the need to redeploy smart contracts, and lowering costs.\n\nSecurity remains a priority in Solana\u2019s ecosystem. Common vulnerabilities include account management errors, arithmetic errors, and potential reentrancy attacks. Comprehensive security audits, combining manual code reviews and automated testing tools, are employed to identify and mitigate these risks. The Solana community actively audits and secures smart contracts, fostering a collaborative environment focused on enhancing security.\n\nGaming applications on Solana benefit from its speed and scalability, allowing for fast and reliable transaction processing essential for immersive and interactive experiences. Additionally, Solana supports various Web3 projects, enabling decentralized social networks, content platforms, and other applications that leverage blockchain technology for enhanced security and user control.\n\nSolana\u2019s unique approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, stateless architecture, and innovative consensus mechanisms, positions it as a leading platform for decentralized applications. Its focus on speed, scalability, and low costs makes it an attractive choice for developers and users, driving its adoption and fostering a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nSmart Contract Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the diversity in approaches to Turing completeness and smart contract execution across platforms like Ethereum, ICP, Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana showcases the innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEach platform offers unique strengths\u2014whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s extensive DApp ecosystem, ICP\u2019s user-friendly model, Polkadot\u2019s interoperability, Cardano\u2019s focus on security, or Solana\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability. These differences provide developers with a rich selection of tools and environments to build the next generation of decentralized applications, driving the evolution and adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u2018best\u2019 blockchain for smart contracts \u2013 each has its benefits, and ultimately, network effects and adoption are what will showcase the strengths of each chain. A multichain future is now all but certain, with many blockchains serving different parts of the global economy.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

        "title": "Ultimate Investment Guide: Furrever Token Set to Achieve Bitcoin and Ethereum-Level ROI in 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $68,000, trading at $67,183 with a 3% decrease in the last 24 hours, raising concerns of a potential downtrend. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) remains stagnant at $3,800 despite the approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs, showing no significant uptrend. On the other hand, Furrever Token (FURR) captivates investors with its promising presale, nearing $1.1 million raised, and potential for a 1500% increase in value post-launch.\n\nBTC Falls Below $68,000 \u2013 Will the Decline Persist?\n\nInvestors and traders are especially showing new interest to Bitcoin strategies now that its current position and price fluctuations are driving this new found wave. Bitcoin which was trading at $/$67,183 began to decrease by 3. 3% in the last 24 hours, has a transaction volume of 36$, a monthly volatility of 4%, a monthly average price of 350$ and a Year to date return of 19%. 7 billion.\n\nAnalyzing the global market, it is possible to say playing a Capstone project budget of $1. 2.3 Q It is worth mentioning that bitcoin remains the most valuable coin in the market of cryptocurrencies with the worth of more than 3 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is down 3% to 67,183 from its price earlier today. While analyzing the overall price fluctuations of this token, users are going to observe that in the last 24 hours 3% price swing indicates a bearish trend. Yet, these figures $68,263, especially emphasizing the pivot point belong to the direction of the current increase trend.\n\nThe 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is located at $68,615, which forms a resistance level near the pivot point. Technically, Bitcoin is trading below the pivot point, indicating a potential downtrend. As an entry strategy, selling below $68,263, targeting a take profit level of $66,357 and setting the stop loss at $70,029 could be recommended. This strategy can enable investors to take advantage of possible further declines while managing risk.\n\nHow Did Ethereum Price React After Approval: Has the Expected Rise Come?\n\nFollowing the approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC last night, ETH price remained stagnant at $3,800 and showed no signs of a significant uptrend. Despite this, ETH experienced a significant increase of over 30% last week. Investors are currently taking a cautious stance and are watching to see if this development will result in a \u201cnews sell\u201d event.\n\nAhead of the US SEC announcing its Ethereum ETF approval decision, ETH price witnessed some sharp fluctuations. In the tense hours before official approval, ETH initially fell to $3,500 during the traditional US market close. It later approached $3,900 after initial unconfirmed reports emerged pointing to confirmation, and ultimately settled above $3,800 after confirmation. In the midst of these huge price swings, it turned out that a whale made a staggering sale of 7,900 ETH worth $29 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the turbulent period, liquidation of leveraged crypto derivatives positions reached over $350 million throughout the day, the highest figure since May 1, according to CoinGlass data. The majority of these liquidated positions were long positions anticipating price increases and totaled approximately $250 million. This shows that traders who had overextended themselves with leverage were surprised by the sudden price drop. Among those affected, ETH traders bore the brunt, with $132 million in liquidations.\n\nApproval of spot Ethereum ETFs could bring inflows of more than $500 million, as analysts estimate. However, it may take some time for this to happen and the uptrend to begin. Some on-chain indicators suggest that Ethereum could form a base above $4,000 and continue to rise to $5,000-6,000 by August this year. While the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has led to strong institutional inflows, it will be interesting to see whether the ETH ETF launch will lead to greater institutional adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: The Upcoming Game-Changer in Meme Coins\n\nFurrever Token is poised to capitalize on the growing interest in meme coins with its charming cat-themed imagery. Currently in the final phase of its presale, the token has already raised over $1.1 million, aiming to reach $1.9 million before its official launch on PancakeSwap. The potential for a 1500% increase in value post-launch positions Furrever Token as a highly attractive investment. Early presale participants, with tokens priced at $0.000648, stand to benefit significantly from this anticipated growth.\n\nFurrever Token's engaging approach, featuring cat-themed stickers, visuals, and community challenges, promotes a vibrant community.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Bullish Outlook: Could We See New All-Time High? - CoinGape",
        "content": "After a 25% hike the previous week, the Ethereum price surged to the month-high of $3937 just hours ago. The second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is bullish, with constant gains, pushing its market cap to $467.8 Billion. Moreover, the number of transactions and network activity has surged by multiple folds, bringing the trading volume to $17.8 Billion after 65% gains. However, this is just the beginning for ETH price as the various analyses and predictions talk of the price surpassing any previous record.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe effect of Ethereum\u2019s bullish outlook isn\u2019t limited to itself only, as the entire crypto ecosystem is affected positively. The total value locked (TVL) in the decentralized finance (DeFi) has surged to $117 Billion, a new two-year high record. More importantly, 60% of the locked value is of Ethereum. Moreover, the Ethereum layer2 blockchains are also in its highest TVL zone, which comes to around $47 Billion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s backing this price rally, and how high Ethereum price can go after this? Let us discuss that in this blog.\n\nFactors Backing The Ethereum Price Surge\n\nEthereum\u2019s price began to rise right after the Bloomsberg analyst predicted Ethereum ETF approval, and then once they got approved, the price went crazy. Even without the beginning of the ETH ETF transaction, the hype has surfed to the roof. The hype is understandable by Kavita Gupta, the Delta Blockchain Fund General Partner, denoting Ethereum as Digital Oil. This statement comes after an interviewer asked Kavita what Bitcoin is called Digital Gold and what\u2019s Ethereum for her.\n\nEthereum ETF approval is much bigger than Bitcoin ETF as Ethereum is not just cryptocurrency, it is the creator in the crypto industry, which will boost the Ethereum ETF higher than Bitcoin\u2019s. Many analysts have claimed Ethereum might surge above $11K by the year\u2019s end and even higher the next, solely because of the Ethereum ETF popularity.\n\nCan Ethereum Surge To An ATH?\n\nEthereum\u2019s hype has directly hinted at its rally to the ATH target of $4,891.70. Confirming the same, Arthur Cheong, the CEO of Defiance Capital, has predicted the ETH price to hit $4500 before the trading goes live for the Ethereum ETF.\n\n4.5k before spot ETF go live for trading imo. \u2014 Arthur (@Arthur_0x) May 26, 2024\n\nAs the trading volume is the favorable factor for the price surge along with many other bullish indicators, ETH price might hit a new ATH soon. However, if Ethereum fails to break the resistance between $3900 & $4000, the price can decline. Regardless, the analytics for now talk of Ethereum price to hit $4500 before finding its way to $4891.70 and higher.\n\nNot only this, it is clear that Ethereum follows the price trajectory of Bitcoin. Based on that Ethereum may rise as high as $6000 in the next two months, just the way Bitcoin did. Moreover, the top crypto personalities are looking forward to Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy founder, investing in Ethereum next. It will be another milestone, as Microstrategy boosts the Bitcoin price, and the same might happen for Ethereum.\n\nContinue Reading 4 Top Altcoins To Rally This Week\n\nPooja Khardia With a deep-seated passion for reading and five years of experience in content writing, Pooja is now focused on crafting trending content about cryptocurrency market.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paves the way for broader institutional adoption and increased exposure of digital assets to traditional investors. Since the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, eyes have been on Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Now that Ethereum ETFs have received the green light, the market is buzzing, anticipating a new wave of massive investments. This new investment opportunity could transform market dynamics and provide significant benefits not only to Ethereum but also to several other cryptos closely linked to its ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the three cryptos best positioned to benefit from this approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has already seen a dramatic rise since the beginning of the year and even in recent days. Currently, the price of ETH is around USD 3,801.94, with a market capitalization of nearly 456 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding 10 billion dollars. Despite this impressive growth, the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC opens the door to an even more significant increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nThe approval of ETFs means that institutional investors, who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market due to its complexity and perceived risks, can now invest in Ethereum through traditional and regulated financial channels. This will significantly increase the potential demand for ETH. The legitimacy brought by SEC approval will enhance investor confidence in Ethereum, thereby stimulating interest and purchase of ETH.\n\nThe influx of new capital into Ethereum through ETFs will also improve market liquidity. Better liquidity means that transactions can be executed more quickly and with less volatility, which is attractive to large investors. This increase in liquidity can stabilize Ethereum\u2019s price in the short term while creating a solid foundation for continued growth.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Currently, the price of the Polygon crypto is around USD 0.7225 with a market capitalization of 7.15 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 175 million dollars. Polygon has already demonstrated notable growth as a scaling platform, attracting the attention of blockchain developers and users.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC has the potential to catalyze a new wave of adoption and use of Ethereum. As demand for Ethereum increases, scaling solutions become crucial to manage the growing volume of transactions on the network. Polygon, as the main layer 2 solution for Ethereum, is particularly well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic.\n\nPolygon improves Ethereum\u2019s scalability by enabling faster and cheaper transactions, which is essential to maintaining the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency in the face of growing demand. With the expected influx of capital following ETF approval, Ethereum users will seek ways to reduce transaction costs and improve transaction speed, thereby increasing demand for Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Polygon benefits from its compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing developers to easily deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects on its platform. This compatibility already attracts a multitude of projects, and the increased interest in Ethereum due to ETFs could strengthen this trend, attracting even more developers and users to Polygon.\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap, the leading decentralized trading platform (DEX) on Ethereum, plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by allowing users to trade cryptos directly without going through a centralized exchange. Currently, the price of its crypto UNI is USD 11.40, with a market capitalization of 6.83 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 473 million dollars.\n\nWith the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, Uniswap is in an advantageous position to benefit from the influx of capital and increased interest in Ethereum. ETFs make buying Ethereum more accessible to institutional investors, which should increase demand for ETH. This increase in demand will also lead to an increase in transactions on Ethereum, which directly benefits decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap.\n\nAs the most popular decentralized trading platform, Uniswap is likely to see a significant increase in trading volumes. The higher the trading volumes, the better the liquidity on Uniswap, making trades more efficient and attractive to investors. This could lead to an increase in the value of the UNI crypto, used for governance and liquidity rewards on the platform.\n\nWith the approval of Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum, Polygon, and Uniswap are three cryptos particularly well-positioned to benefit from this influx of capital and increased interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the crypto market is extremely volatile, and prices can fluctuate unpredictably. Nothing is very certain!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\n\n\n\nMicroStrategy's Chair, Michael Saylor, views the SEC's approval of a spot Ethereum ETF as a positive development for Bitcoin. He anticipates this move will draw more institutional investors into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nIn early May, Saylor expressed concerns about the SEC potentially taking action against significant alternative crypto assets (altcoins). This raised worries within the crypto community that the SEC might classify Ethereum ETF and other altcoins as securities, leading to stricter regulations and potential limitations on trading these assets.\n\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the SEC's approval of all spot Ethereum ETFs differed from earlier expectations. Michael Saylor has adjusted his previous stance and now welcomes the SEC's decision.\n\n\n\nFollowing the SEC's approval of several spot Ethereum ETFs in late May, Saylor expressed his belief that this development could be even more beneficial for Bitcoin. He suggested that the broader recognition of crypto as an asset class, facilitated by the ETFs, would strengthen Bitcoin's position within the industry due to its established presence. He further indicated that these ETFs might act as a stabilising factor for Bitcoin in the regulatory landscape.\n\n\n\nSaylor further emphasised that the SEC's decision could accelerate institutional investors' adoption of crypto assets. This could lead to a potential allocation of 5-10% of their investment portfolios towards cryptocurrencies. Within this allocation, he projects Bitcoin to capture a significant share, potentially around 60-70 percent, due to its established position in the market. He explained this by suggesting that previously hesitant investors might now view crypto as a legitimate asset class due to the existence of ETFs. Saylor anticipated that these investors would likely diversify their crypto assets holdings. Still, Bitcoin, as the established leader in the space, would likely receive the largest share of their crypto assets allocations.\n\n\n\nSaylor elaborated that just two weeks prior to the SEC's decision, the expectation was that Bitcoin would be the sole cryptocurrency offered as a security through a spot ETF by Wall Street institutions, effectively solidifying its position as the only legitimate crypto asset class.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Laetitia B.\n\nEach bull run in the past has gone through different phases stimulated by a capital rotation. In general, bitcoin is often the leader of the bull run and the favorite in the early phases. Following Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to bitcoin, we will look at the factors favorable to a capital rotation towards Ethereum.\n\nThe Principle of Asset Rotation\n\nIn traditional finance, there are several types of asset rotations. This can involve a sectoral rotation (technology, industrial, financial, health\u2026) or a rotation of asset types (bonds, stocks, commodities, forex\u2026). Capitals move according to the context and the economy. The rotation can come from profit-taking after a significant performance to move into another sector or a less valued type of asset while following the economic context. This is often the case between cyclical and defensive sectors, for example.\n\nLet\u2019s also take an example over a very long-term horizon, that is to say over several decades, we can see this cyclical rotation between commodities and the S&P500 index in the graph below:\n\nThis type of graph highlights that in the coming years, performances in commodities should be more advantageous than in the S&P500.\n\nThe Different Phases in Crypto\n\nWhen we look at the cryptocurrency market, there are several phases in terms of rotation, whether it is between bitcoin, Ethereum, large caps, and altcoins. And generally, this comes from a progressive rotation.\n\nPhase 1: Bitcoin is the leader, the store of value in the crypto market. It is the oldest and most democratized in the cryptocurrency sphere. It is on bitcoin that the first capital inflows arrive at the beginning of a bull market. Since 2024, bitcoin has been available in spot ETF form, which is an advantage to stimulate demand. And in parallel, when the demand is stimulated, it increases the capital inflows. During phase 1, bitcoin tends to outperform Ethereum. And it is only when Ethereum starts to approach bitcoin\u2019s performance that phase 2 is near. We can possibly see this rotation with the example below which highlights the ETC/BTC ratio:\n\nPhase 2: Ethereum, which is the number 2 cryptocurrency in the crypto sphere, outperforms bitcoin. This can be seen in the graph below with the 2021 bull run.\n\nPhase 3: It is the turn of large capitalizations (Doge, LTC, XRP\u2026) to outperform bitcoin.\n\nPhase 4: The altcoin season begins when there is a large capital rotation. That is to say, the money invested in bitcoin at the beginning of the bull run moves to other cryptocurrencies, small and mid-capitalizations, or even memes. During the altcoin season, we see a reduction in bitcoin dominance. Here is a graph that highlights this:\n\nTo better illustrate this in general terms, here is the chronology below:\n\nThe Economic Environment and Different Phases in Cryptocurrency Markets\n\nThe evolution of cryptocurrency is quite cyclical, just like the economy. That is to say, we find cycles of growth and cycles of decline. Like any riskier asset class, it evolves according to a favorable and accommodating context. A favorable context can be defined in several ways. For example, when growth rebounds, we have an acceleration of growth, which is a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. Consumer sentiment is positive and this encourages capital inflows. Conversely, when we face an economic slowdown, it is often represented by a bear market in cryptocurrencies. Each cycle often averages one and a half to two years, just like economic cycles. Therefore, if we add up a bull market and a bear market, it represents 4 years, just like the halving process:\n\nAnother positive element for performance is also liquidity. When liquidity is abundant, cryptocurrencies thrive. For example, injections of liquidity during COVID led to more capital circulating in the markets. Financial conditions were highly relaxed. Therefore, more money in circulation to buy the same good implies a price increase.\n\nRegarding liquidity in the current situation, we can see the graph below highlighting the evolution of liquidity and bitcoin:\n\nRemaining in the same context, that is, liquidity, we can also see favorable seasons (summer and fall being the best):\n\nThe Delay of Ethereum Explained by Several Factors\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum is often delayed compared to bitcoin during the first months of a bull run. This is mainly because capital first flows into bitcoin, the store of value. As for Ethereum, it is no longer the only one well-positioned as it is closely followed by Solana. This also implies competition. That said, like bitcoin, Ethereum should benefit from more incoming flows since the approval of ETFs is official. Such products imply more potential to attract new investors, whether for tax reasons (introduction of the product into tax-advantaged accounts) or simply because an ETF is an easily accessible product (no need to open multiple brokerage accounts) and is inexpensive. This is why approval would be a good catalyst for catching up with bitcoin. Therefore, there are several arguments that align for Ethereum\u2019s outperformance, such as a favorable context, new available products, and the phase timeline (as indicated above).\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum, Which to Choose?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have different strengths that can help diversify a crypto portfolio. One of bitcoin\u2019s peculiarities is that it has a limited supply of 21 million, and its production is halved every 4 years. This can be seen as a safe haven, especially in countries suffering from hyperinflation. Ethereum also has certain peculiarities, such as the fact that it can be used to host other cryptos and decentralized applications.\n\nThe more adoption and democratization continue with the same dynamic, the more we will face new products as approvals will be increasingly easier. For example, we could have an ETF that brings together bitcoin and Ethereum to simplify the choice. This opens many possibilities in terms of capital.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can conclude that the capital rotation system is cyclical and that Ethereum has several reasons to take the lead and outperform bitcoin for the rest of the cycle. One of the major catalysts for this would be, like bitcoin, ETF approval. This will improve liquidity in the coming months.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

The hype behind Ethereum ETF has driven the price of ETH by 1.50% to around $3,805 in the last 24 hours.\n\nInvestors expect the upward trajectory to continue and the coin to break into $4,000 in the coming days.\n\nWith an increased market capitalization and trading volume of $452.70 billion and $32 billion, the interest in Ethereum ETF can potentially push the coin past its previous all-time high to $5,000 later in the year.\n\nAs the situation develops, crypto traders expect Ripple, an owner of XRP, to apply for an XRP ETF following the success of 13 Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications in January.\n\nThe hope is to boost the value of XRP with the hype, legality, and liquidity that a potential ETF can bring. Other altcoins could also be in the mix for a future application similar to Ethereum ETF, with investors mooting a Solana ETF.\n\nHowever, if crypto traders are simply looking to improve the price of their assets and portfolios, RCO Finance\u2019s (RCOF) crypto trading platform offers far easier ways to improve portfolio performance and increase profits.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF) to Protect Portfolio Values in Uncertain Times\n\nAs news of Ethereum ETF saturates the market, holders of RCOF could see their chances of improving profits rise significantly. RCO Finance is in its presale stage, and even then, it promises investors a potential 1000% profit.\n\nThis platform helps users improve their profit margins by lowering transaction costs, offering opportunities to earn passive income, and offering interest on presale tokens. Investors never need to go through the troubles of a Solana ETF or Ripple XRP ETF.\n\nThe platform\u2019s main selling points could make it the perfect investment vehicle for crypto traders to bridge the gap between the cryptocurrency market and the traditional investment market. The platform can also serve as a safe zone from volatility, which is common in crypto.\n\nWhy Crypto Investors Should Consider RCO Finance (RCOF) Ahead of a Potential Ripple and Solana ETF\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF) is a crypto trading platform that allows users to exchange digital assets for traditional investment options such as stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.\n\nAmid speculations around a potential XRP ETF and Solana ETF application, XRP and Solana (SOL) investors can easily diversify their portfolios using the profitable options provided by RCO Finance (RCOF).\n\nThe investment options provided in this platform could improve users\u2019 portfolios and profit margins more than any potential XRP ETF or Solana ETF could.\n\nThis crypto trading platform also offers an AI trading tool that uses advanced machine learning to analyze market trends and identify potential investment opportunities. The tool can also assist users in making trades when offline.\n\nHowever, if you would rather not risk your funds, investors can earn passive income by providing liquidity pools through the platform\u2019s automated market-making (AMM) option.\n\nRCO Finance\u2019s (RCOF) crypto trading platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure trading platform for all users. Blockchain protocols will also verify and authorize transactions on RCO Finance (RCOF) to prevent fraud and fund loss.\n\nThe RCO Finance (RCOF) token has passed its audit and is currently in the first stage of its presale. The coin is available for $0.0127 per coin. When this token enters its second presale stage, crypto traders can make more than 1,000% ROI.\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\n\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\n\nJoin The RCO Finance Community"

        "content": "After approving spot ETFs for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, in January, and watching them rake in almost US$60 billion in assets, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the CBOE, Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges to trade in ETFs tracking Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s only real competitor\n\nNine issuers are looking to bring Ethereum ETFs to market, including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency, ETH, has gained 115.19 per cent year-over-year, and 1,552.35 per cent since 2019, last trading at C$5,363.76 per token\n\nAfter approving spot ETFs for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, in January, and watching them rake in almost US$60 billion in assets, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the CBOE, Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges to trade in ETFs tracking Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s only real competitor.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain network that enables parties to do business with one another through smart contracts, which are agreements that execute based on agreed-upon criteria without the need for a middleman. The network is host to some of the largest and most well-known projects in the cryptocurrency space, including UniSwap, Curve, Chainlink and Decentraland. Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ETH, has gained 115.19 per cent year-over-year and 1,552.35 per cent since 2019, last trading at C$5,363.76 per token, granting it a market capitalization of about C$650 billion, almost three times less than Bitcoin\u2019s C$1.9 trillion.\n\nWhile financial institutions still need to have individual fund registrations approved before trading in Ethereum ETFs can begin \u2013 nine applications are under consideration including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock \u2013 the SEC\u2019s open-mindedness towards crypto in 2024 is in stark contrast to its historical skepticism towards the speculative asset class, opening an increasing number of investors up to the idea of holding an allocation. Canadians, for their part, have had access to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs since 2021, and benefit from products from reputable providers to gain exposure.\n\nWith eyes on catching short-term gains tied to individual fund approvals by the SEC, as well as aligning yourself with crypto\u2019s potential for outsized long-term returns, let\u2019s break down how Canada\u2019s Ethereum ETFs stack up against one another.\n\nThe 3iQ Ether Staking ETF\n\nTicker: ETHQ.\n\nNet asset value: C$72.6 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 1.56%.\n\nDifferentiator: Unitholders can earn yield through Ethereum staking, which involves locking up investments in ETH to help to run the network. The fund was also first to market with staking capabilities.\n\nCI Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nTicker: ETHX.B.\n\nAssets under management: C$654.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.4%.\n\nDifferentiator: Galaxy is one of the pre-eminent crypto players across capital markets, asset management and infrastructure solutions.\n\nEvolve Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHR.\n\nAssets under management: C$91.8 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.75%.\n\nDifferentiator: The fund is the first in the world to offer exposure to the Ethereum network in the form of an ETF.\n\nFidelity Advantage Ether ETF Fund\n\nTicker: FETH.\n\nAssets under management: C$19.2 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.95%.\n\nDifferentiator: Besides being one of the world\u2019s most well-respected financial institutions with more than 75 years of history and more than 50 million individual clients, Fidelity is also a crypto pioneer, having entered the industry all the way back in 2014.\n\nPurpose Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHH.\n\nAssets under management: C$478.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: Up to 1.5%.\n\nDifferentiator: Investors who open a position in ETHH have the option to complement this exposure with the Purpose Ether Yield ETF (TSX:ETHY), which writes covered calls and currently pays out an annual yield of more than 9 per cent. Unlike ETHQ, whose yield is reflected in unit price appreciation, ETHY pays its distributions in cash.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a novice or an enthusiast, cryptocurrencies remain a new and volatile asset class with a little more than 15 years of market history, hardly enough for investors to expect reliable capital appreciation, despite the multitude of crypto millionaires who attract many retail participants into the space. This is why it\u2019s essential to have a plan for any dollars you intend to allocate, ensuring that you minimize avoidable regret through awareness of the range of possible outcomes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out whether crypto suits your investment needs, check out last year\u2019s \u201cHow to invest in cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nJoin the discussion: Find out what everybody\u2019s saying about Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies on Stockhouse\u2019s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Bullboard, and check out the rest of Stockhouse\u2019s stock forums and message boards.\n\nThe material provided in this article is for information only and should not be treated as investment advice.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s NFT buyers and sellers remained higher than those of Ethereum\n\nSOL\u2019s price gained bullish momentum, but the trend might change\n\nSolana [SOL] has once again dominated its competitors like Ethereum [ETH] in the NFT space over the past month. Now, while this seems optimistic at first glance, there might just be more to the story. Let\u2019s have a look at how both of these NFT giants fared against each other.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum\n\nCoin98 recently shared a tweet underlining the latest datasets from the NFT ecosystem. According to the same, Solana is now ranked #1 on the list of blockchains in terms of the most NFTs created in the last 30 days. Apart from Solana, Polygon and Base also made it to the top three on the same list.\n\nHere, what is also worth mentioning is that Ethereum took the 10th spot on the list. While 32 million NFTs were created on Solana, only 1 million NFTs were created on Ethereum. This gave SOL a whopping lead of 31 million.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that STEPN, SMB Gen2, and Mad Lads were the top NFT collections on Solana last month. Oddly enough, y00ts and DeGods, two projects that recently migrated to Solana, couldn\u2019t make it to the top 5.\n\nWhile the aforementioned datasets imply one thing, a look at the bigger picture might imply something different entirely. For instance, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoSlam\u2019s data revealed that while Solana\u2019s monthly NFT sales volume was merely $99 million, Ethereum\u2019s sales volume stood at $193 million.\n\nNonetheless, Solana\u2019s number of NFT buyers and sellers remained significantly higher than that of Ethereum.\n\nSOL turns bullish\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s performance in the NFT space remained positive, SOL\u2019s price action once again turned bullish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL\u2019s price surged by over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $169.30 with a market capitalization of over $76 billion.\n\nThanks to the latest price uptick, the token\u2019s weighted sentiment hiked too. This meant that bullish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. Additionally, its social volume also appreciated on the charts, highlighting SOL\u2019s popularity.\n\nHowever, this trend might not last as a key derivatives market indicator flashed bearish signals at press time. Coinglass\u2019 data revealed that Solana\u2019s long/short ratio fell over the last 24 hours.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nHere, a low ratio is a sign of bearish sentiment, where there is more interest in selling or shorting assets."

Traders might be assessing the sustainability of the recent gains before committing to further positions.\n\nThe $1.27 level could also serve as a new support if ONDO maintains its foothold, or it might see further dips if the selling pressure increases.\n\nIf ONDO rebounds from its current level and breaks through the resistance at $1.32, it could set the stage for an upward trend towards $1.5 and even $2.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ONDO\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nThe potential for ONDO to achieve a $2 valuation is quite strong, but it\u2019s important to recognize that various factors beyond technical analysis influence crypto prices.\n\nThough we are right at the edge of what might be the greatest crypto bull run ever, the market remains incredibly volatile. Proceed with caution. Always DYOR!"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently at the forefront of an impending market surge, as indicated by a significant technical breakout. According to crypto analyst Jelle, Ethereum has recently emerged from a bearish pattern particularly breaking out from the \u201cfalling wedge\u201d and flipping key resistance into support zones.\n\nJelle reveals that Ethereum is currently pushing for the $4,000 mark which makes the possibility of reaching new heights seems more tangible. This movement marks a significant turnaround from previous trends, setting the stage for potentially record-breaking price levels.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Bullish Turn: Analyst Highlight Positive Bias In ETH Options Across All Expiries 4 months ago\n\nThe Bullish Shift: Ethereum Breakout from a Falling Wedge Explained\n\nJelle\u2019s recent observations come during a period of strong performance for Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency showing a 30% increase in value over the past week alone.\n\nEthereum stands at $3,951 at the time of writing, having climbed an additional 2.5% in just 24 hours. This notable uptrend underscores the growing investor confidence and market momentum that could drive Ethereum\u2019s value to new records.\n\nNotably, a falling wedge pattern in technical analysis is a signal that often precedes a bullish market reversal. Characterized by converging trend lines that meet at a downward slope, this pattern typically concludes with a breakout to the upside as buying pressure overcomes selling momentum.\n\n$ETH broke out from the falling wedge, then flipped key areas into support & now pushes for $4,000. New highs, and new all-time highs are next. Higher. pic.twitter.com/pjrk8X2FYA \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) May 27, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent breakout from this pattern signifies a potential reversal of its prior downtrend and transforms previous resistance levels into new supports, laying a foundational bullish sentiment.\n\nThis technical progression is critical as it indicates a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, suggesting that Ethereum might recover from its previous lows and embark on a sustained upward trajectory.\n\nAnalysts like Jelle see this as a precursor to more aggressive buying behavior, potentially propelling the asset toward unprecedented price levels.\n\nBroader Market Sentiments And Predictions\n\nThe positive outlook for Ethereum isn\u2019t isolated. Notable crypto analyst Defi Mochi predicts that the ETH price could soar to between $9,500 and $12,000.\n\nAccording to Mochi, this projection is based on a combination of factors, including increasing political support for cryptocurrencies and the fact that Bitcoin has yet to reclaim its all-time high.\n\nWith that said my realistic target for $ETH is approximately in the $9.5k to $12k range. Given\n\n\u25c6 increased political support for crypto\n\n\u25c6$BTC being barely at previous ATHs\n\n\u25c6 increased adoption of $ETH by institutions I Think none of us are bullish enough on Ultrasound Money. \u2014 Defi_Mochi (@defi_mochi) May 26, 2024\n\nInstitutional investors\u2019 adoption of Ethereum is also a critical factor in the prediction. As more institutions integrate ETH into their portfolios, their market dynamics are expected to stabilize further, attracting more significant investment flows.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nArthur, the founder of DeFiance Capital, aligns with this bullish sentiment, forecasting that Ethereum could reach $4,500 shortly.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, Chart from TradingView"
