        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. They also discussed interoperability and central bank digital currencies.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article JPMorgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Solana flips XRP once more, closes in on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s native asset SOL flipped XRP this morning to again become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAfter gaining more than 700% since its market bottomed out at the end of last year, SOL is now valued at nearly $34 billion. XRP and SOL trail only binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThis makes SOL one of the best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies of 2023. XRP, meanwhile, has only made about 80% \u2014 about the same as ether \u2014 but both have underperformed against bitcoin this year.\n\nXRP must still deal with a jury trial in Ripple\u2019s long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission saga. A federal court in July found the firm\u2019s programmatic sales to retail investors through crypto exchanges and other platforms didn\u2019t amount to securities, while direct sales to institutional investors did.\n\nRead more: Judge rules in SEC case vs Ripple\n\nThe trial, set for next spring, should finally determine to what extent Ripple Labs is culpable for flouting US securities laws, after the SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in October. A settlement in the meantime is still possible.\n\nWhile Solana spent most of the third quarter of 2021 \u2014 peak bull market \u2014 ahead of XRP and a top-five coin behind tether, its more recent overperformance can in part be explained by how severely it crashed around the FTX debacle last November.\n\nClick play to watch Solana recover from its crash last year\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was invested heavily in projects across the Solana space, including SOL itself, and the crypto crashed by nearly two-thirds in three days when the market lost faith in cryptocurrencies orbiting the FTX co-founder. BTC and ETH meanwhile took only a 20% hit.\n\nSolana was a top-10 token before FTX\u2019s downfall, worth about half as much as XRP. In the months after, Solana ranked at the tail end of the top 20, behind polkadot (DOT), tron (TRX) and memecoin shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nNever underestimate the power of dog coins\n\nSolana has been busy catching up all year, propelled in part by a commitment from its developers to shake the network\u2019s association with Bankman-Fried, whose entities still hold claim to nearly $2 billion in SOL at current prices to be unlocked over the next few years.\n\nThe network boasts much of the same utility as smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, Avalanche and BNB Chain, albeit with its own unique brand of consensus, technology and tokenomics developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\n\nApps and tokens run atop Solana, including decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSolana\u2019s overall dominance, which measures how much of the entire market is SOL, is at 2.13%, 0.6 percentage points lower than its November 2021 record.\n\nHype around new Solana-centric projects has helped inspire a certain Solanaissance. BONK, the network\u2019s resident dog coin, has seen its price multiply 100 times over the past two months \u2014 even after a healthy 50% correction this week.\n\nRead more: BONK\u2019s price pumped harder around Coinbase listing than any other crypto this year\n\nBONK mania even led to significant markups for Solana-branded smartphones upon realization that each one had been preloaded with 30 million BONK ($550) \u2014 about the same as the retail value of the device.\n\nElsewhere, the liquid staking protocol Jito airdropped $165 million worth of its new token, JTO, to its users earlier this month. Traders pushed the price of JTO higher following the distribution, with the whole process adding about $300 million in market value to the Solana ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet.. BONK and Jito are combining forces to seed Solana users with Christmas cheer\n\nThe anticipation of further airdrops scaled to Solana activity has since helped drive on-chain volumes to yearly highs.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) across its network is also up, now at $1 billion compared to $300 million in September.\n\nAlthough, that jump is mostly attributed to the rising price of SOL; there\u2019s currently 14 million SOL locked on the network right now, one-third less than the 21 million SOL staked at the start of the year, and 25% less than in September.\n\nSolana almost closer than ever to flipping Ethereum\n\nIn any case, now that SOL seems set to stay ahead of XRP, some might wonder how far away it is from eclipsing BNB. The token is the native asset for Binance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain, and Binance users can also use it to cover trading fees and participation in initial coin offerings and the like.\n\nBNB faces its own set of challenges due to Binance\u2019s run-in with US regulators, which has resulted in mammoth fines, a years-long financial surveillance mandate and the exit of co-founder Changpeng Zhao as CEO.\n\nRead more: Binance says the SEC can\u2019t use DOJ plea deals as proof of guilt\n\nTurns out, outside of the last bull market\u2019s peak in late 2021, solana has never been closer to flipping BNB in their shared history. BNB\u2019s market cap is now just 20% more than SOL\u2019s, down drastically from 300% higher only three months ago.\n\nThe gap between Solana and Ethereum is still a long way off completely closing\n\nSolana\u2019s hopes of flipping Ethereum seem far less realistic right now. But there is progress: Ethereum\u2019s market value is now about 700% more than Solana\u2019s, its lowest point since peak bull market in 2021.\n\nETH was worth nearly 40 times more than Solana at the start of the year.\n\nSOL would still need to hit a price equal to more than twice its current all-time high, multiplying eight times to $625, to reach ETH\u2019s current valuation. Ethereum, of course, would have to stagnate the entire time.\n\nSo, if Solana flipping Ethereum were to happen at all, it would likely take multiple bull and bear cycles for Solana to properly narrow the gap.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana has overtaken Ethereum in terms of 24-hour DEX trading volume yet again. Data indicates that Solana's trading volume has reached $1.262 billion, marginally surpassing Ethereum's $1.167 billion. Arbitrum, BSC, and Avalanche follow behind.\n\nThis development marks yet another significant milestone for Solana since Ethereum has long been considered the dominant force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nAnalyzing the top chains by trading volume\n\nThe landscape of DEX trading is fiercely competitive, with various blockchains vying for the top spot.\n\nSolana's recent surge to the forefront is attributed to several factors, including the total value locked (TVL) on its platform, which has topped $1 billion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis resurgence has been driven by rising asset prices and consistent inflows to DeFi protocols.\n\nDecentralized exchanges on Solana, such as Orca, have seen remarkable increases in trading volume.\n\nSolana's market cap surpasses XRP\n\nFurther cementing its position in the cryptocurrency market, Solana's market capitalization has now outstripped that of XRP.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Solana's market cap stands at $35.42 billion. In contrast, XRP's market cap is slightly behind at $33.74 billion.\n\nSolana's recent performance can be partly attributed to the rise of meme coins like Bonk, a dog-themed token that now boasts a market cap of more than $1.2 billion. The speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins has played a significant role in the recent rally."

        "content": "The Lisk blockchain, at the forefront of the Web3 ecosystem, has recently announced an epochal transition to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution.\n\nWith the support of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack and Gelato\u2019s advanced infrastructure, Lisk is poised to play a crucial role in bringing Optimism Superchain\u2019s vision to life. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe strategic transition of the Lisk blockchain to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution\n\nAs anticipated, Gelato has officially announced the expansion of its versatile all-in-one platform, known as Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nThis growth includes support not only for Polygon CDK, but also for OP Stack, the open-source modular development framework developed by Optimism Collective.\n\nIn this expansion phase, Gelato has opened its doors to Lisk, a top-level blockchain launched in 2016, so that it can join the Ethereum ecosystem by migrating to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2.\n\nLisk will become part of OP Mainnet, Base, and other OP chains, distinguishing itself as the first level 1 to commit to Optimism\u2019s Superchain vision.\n\nThe addition of OP Stack support by Gelato underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to revolutionizing the blockchain landscape.\n\nThe democratization of access to a modular block space allows a wide range of creators to easily implement their own level 2 blockchains, ready for launch.\n\nThis crucial step unlocks the potential of the main cryptographic applications, ushering in a new era in the adoption of blockchain, as highlighted by Luis Schliesske, founder of Gelato.\n\nDesigned to mitigate congestion issues on the main Ethereum network, OP Stack represents the open-source codebase and standards that power the Optimism ecosystem, aiming to support the Superchain.\n\nThanks to Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, OP Stack not only manages the implementation, hosting, and monitoring of new Layer 2 chains, but also obtains native integrations with Gelato\u2019s leading Web3 middleware services.\n\nThese include automation, off-chain data, and account abstraction, which enable a superior user experience. Additionally, the platform provides immediate access to high-level web3 services such as Etherscan, The Graph, LayerZero, and many others.\n\nThe Web3 revolution of Gelato\n\nLevel 2 chains implemented with Gelato, including Lisk, not only gain the benefits of the underlying blockchain, but also a fully production-ready web3 development environment.\n\nThis is a milestone for web3 development, as developers have access for the first time to an OP chain with end-to-end services and all infrastructure dependencies implemented from the start.\n\nBen Jones, head scientist at the Optimism Foundation, expresses enthusiasm for the extension of support from Gelato to Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk.\n\nGelato has already demonstrated its efficiency by executing one million transactions on OP Mainnet for projects like Synthetix, Lyra, and Velodrome. Jones anticipates that Gelato, with its developer experience, will contribute to turning Superchain\u2019s vision into a tangible reality.\n\nThrough Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, implementing your own complete OP chain of services becomes a simple process, without the need to write code.\n\nThis allows developers to focus on growing their core business, while Gelato handles the implementation and maintenance of the chain.\n\nDominic Schwenter, Chief Project Officer at Lisk, emphasizes that the use of Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to focus on creating products and tools appreciated by developers and end users, allocating resources to the development of Superchain.\n\nGelato and Optimism share a vision of a world where thousands of blockchains are interconnected, allowing for horizontal scaling of web3 applications. The Gelato Rollup-as-a-Service platform positions itself as a key component of this environment, managing clients\u2019 blockchains and providing an end-to-end development environment with essential infrastructure services for integrated developers."

This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

        "title": "Trading Veteran Peter Brandt Shorts Ethereum to $650 After Calling it \"Piece of Junk\" - Bitcoinsensus",
        "content": "Renowned trader Peter Brandt shorts Ethereum to $650, deeming it a \u201cpiece of junk,\u201d echoing concerns about its viability.\n\nDespite bearish sentiments, Ethereum\u2019s community support and ongoing development efforts present a counterbalance to negative predictions.\n\nIn a recent update, veteran commodity and forex trader Peter Brandt expressed a highly bearish view on Ethereum (ETH). Brandt, known for his candid opinions, went a step further by shorting Ethereum to $650, labeling it a \u201cpiece of junk.\u201d\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThis negative sentiment toward Ethereum is not isolated. Patrick Riley, Founder and CEO of Reaper Financial, has previously criticized Ethereum, likening it to a \u201cdying horse.\u201d Riley believes that XRP stands to benefit from Ethereum\u2019s perceived weaknesses.\n\nBrandt\u2019s Scathing Remarks on ETH\n\nBrandt, with a following of 707.7K on the X platform, conveyed his critical stance on Ethereum. He highlighted the disparity between Ethereum and Bitcoin, dismissing Ethereum as a store of value. He further criticized Ethereum\u2019s functionality and gas prices, branding it as a \u201cpiece of junk.\u201d Brandt boldly predicted that Ethereum might no longer be listed as an asset within the next decade.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1735433545458520178?s=20\n\nShorting ETH to $650\n\nUndeterred by potential market movements, Brandt followed through with his words by shorting Ethereum. His targets ranged from $1,000 to $650, showcasing his confidence in a significant downturn for the cryptocurrency.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1736725295628276152?s=20\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

The trading volume surged by 29.42%, with $10.45 billion worth of ETH changing hands on crypto exchanges. Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,120 and $2,249 during this period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Metrics\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s performance, it is up by 0.78% in the weekly charts. However, double-digit gains are evident in the monthly and annual charts at 14.3% and 89.8%, respectively. Despite being 54% down from its November 2021 all-time high of $4,891, optimism prevails regarding a potential narrowing of this gap in the coming year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Community Support\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain boasts robust support from the crypto community, primarily due to its flexibility in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Developers favor the platform for its adaptability and continuous efforts to enhance its ecosystem.\n\nAlso Read: US SEC Delays Decision on Multiple Ethereum ETFs, Public Input Invited\n\nPositive Developments in Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to improving its economy is evident through its shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin is actively involved in redesigning the network to boost performance and staking features.\n\nFuture Expectations for Ethereum\n\nDespite recent criticisms and shorting actions, Ethereum is expected to rally alongside Bitcoin next year. This optimism stems from two major upcoming events: the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US and the halving, both of which are anticipated to significantly impact BTC prices.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum finds itself at a crossroads with divergent opinions from industry figures. While Peter Brandt\u2019s bearish stance and shorting activities cast a shadow, Ethereum\u2019s strong community support and ongoing developmental efforts provide a counterbalance. Ethereum is still the biggest altcoin in the world and it\u2019s a go-to layer-1 solution in the industry.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is predicting market corrections for Solana (SOL) and another one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 201,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is setting up to dip below $50, more than 31% below its current value.\n\nAlthough the trader says that a correction is in sight for Solana, he thinks that SOL will eventually recover and regain its bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cSOL: for traders, I think sub $50 is coming for Solana in the mid-term.\n\nFor investors, SOL is going to go to much higher levels in the coming months, so probably just don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one. That\u2019ll be the one to consider shorting, to be honest. I think that this is in its distribution phase for now though.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLisk (LSK), a delegated proof of stake (DPOS) protocol, has unveiled its plans to migrate to Ethereum as a layer-2 scaling solution. According to the update shared on its official X account, Lisk said its layer-2 plot will be achieved in collaboration with Optimism (OP) and Gelato Network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the protocol noted, the push to Ethereum is to advance its key value protocol to bring real world assets (RWA) to emerging markets. Additionally, a switch to Ethereum will optimize its plans to provide a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on-chain.\n\nThe switch from a full-blown layer-1 to a layer-2 protocol is uncommon; however, the ease of implementing the move, as provided by Optimism, makes the transition easier. Lisk now says it is the first L1 blockchain that will join other protocols like Base to contribute to the Optimism Superchain. Recall that Base was designed by Coinbase using the OP technology Stack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Lisk will integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem as a Layer 2 (L2) in collaboration with @Optimism & @gelatonetwork!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Focused on solving local problems in Emerging Markets by bringing solutions around real-world assets (RWA), off-chain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/a05p5ldwEm \u2014 Lisk (@LiskHQ) December 19, 2023\n\nBy committing its developers to the development of Optimism Superchain, Lisk said it will advance the vision of contributing to the future of Web3. It believes its contributions in the long term will contribute to driving mass adoption into the industry.\n\nLisk price reacts\n\nThe announcement of the transition to the Ethereum protocol as a layer-1 network has pushed Lisk (LSK) to a new daily high. At the time of writing, the digital currency has jumped by 6.23% to $1.13, taking its market capitalization to $145,573,784.\n\nThe move to Ethereum might be the ultimate game-changer that Lisk needs to gain mainstream recognition, like other protocols in the L2 arena. Despite its revolutionary offerings and age, the protocol is ranked as the 262nd largest protocol by market capitalization, and its transaction count pales in comparison to OP and ARB.\n\nThis contrasts with Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB) and Polygon (MATIC), whose market cap ranking and total value locked (TVL) compete with many established layer-1 blockchains today."

        "title": "Top Altcoins To Buy On December 20: Ethereum Express (ETE), BONK, Stacks (STX) - CoinGape",
        "content": "Investors are sifting through the noise to identify gems that are likely to significantly breakout ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stand out as the most stable investments in a crypto portfolio, select best-performing top altcoins could be the game changer, considering the gains posted by Ethereum Express (ETH), Bonk (BONK) and Stacks (STX).\n\nAlthough the crypto market widely reversed gains accrued last week from Friday through to Monday, the anticipation of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval in January has helped to steady the prices and may explain the 3% increase in market cap to $1.66 trillion, live data by CoinMarketCap shows.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Express Tops Top Altcoins To Buy For 2024\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is slowly catching investor interest, as one of the most viable tokens that could potentially break out this week. Up 8% in the last 24 hours, the crypto powering the network known for faster, safer, and cheaper layer 1 transactions, is trading at $0.0413.\n\nLike other cryptos, Ethereum Express encountered strong headwinds last week, forcing bulls to temporarily abandon the push for the uptrend at $0.043. A correction followed swiftly, as traders closed positions to protect their capital and accrued gains.\n\nThe first tentative support at $0.03 failed to relieve the selling pressure but ETE respected the next crucial level slightly above $0.021. This support area encouraged traders to enter new long positions, boosting Ethereum Express recovery.\n\nA cup and handle pattern drawn on the four-hour chart reveals a potential 71% breakout to $0.07. However, ETE must rise above the neckline resistance at $0.0413 to validate the breakout.\n\nBased on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator a stronger momentum backs the uptrend in ETE. Therefore, traders considering more exposure, could long Ethereum Express as soon as it breaks or successfully retests the neckline resistance.\n\nBonk Pauses Price Discovery, Here\u2019s What Next\n\nInvestors who bought Bonk to speculate on exchange listings on Coinbase and Binance last week have been selling to lock in the profits made. This has continued to weigh down on the meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, with losses extending from a recent all-time high of $0.000035 to $0.000019, down 1.4% in 24 hours.\n\nDespite the meltdown, Bonk upholds a 160% increase in a fortnight and 445% in a month.\n\nThe outlook from the MACD reinforces the bearish theory. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the confluence support created by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) and the purple horizontal ray at $0.00001891 to trigger another buying spree and boost Bonk\u2019s recovery back to the ATH.\n\nIf the downtrend carries on below the highlighted immediate support, traders may want to consider entering short positions in BONK and targeting lower support areas at $0.000016, $0.000013, and the 200 EMA (in purple) at $0.0000109.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Bonk may resume the uptrend quickly if the confluence support holds and a breakout follows above the descending channel. While Bonk is still one of the best crypto performers in December, finding a good entry position is the tricky part.\n\nStacks Price Prediction: Will STX Validate Cup and Handle Breakout?\n\nStacks price extended the up leg on Tuesday with another 1.5% increase in 24 hours in addition to a 22% growth in seven days and an 87% rise in a month. The token native to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most reliable smart contracts layer, allowing developers to build apps is trading at $1.19 after running into resistance at $1.26.\n\nWith a short-term cup and handle likely to lead to another breakout, the headache investors have is finding a suitable entry position. However, if STX breaks above the neckline resistance at $1.19, the next breakout could rise 30% to $1.82.\n\nFor now, the path with the least resistance based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is downwards. Bears have the upper hand, especially with Stacks trading below a broken support \u2014 now resistance at $1.2.\n\nIf declines continue in the handle section of the pattern, traders may want to spot other tentative support areas, starting with the 20 EMA at $1.12, the buyer congestion at $1.1, and the 200 EMA at $0.895.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Solana Q4 activity soars, outpaces Ethereum: Report - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana has seen a 400% growth in user activity in Q4.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors have also seen considerable growth in the past few months.\n\nDaily user activity on Solana [SOL] has seen a notable rise of almost 400% as the last quarter of the year nears its end. This dwarfed the meager 3% increase seen on Ethereum [ETH], on-chain data provider Messari noted in a new report.\n\nAccording to the research firm, the recent surge in new demand for Solana is due to the series of token airdrops completed by some protocols housed within the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network.\n\nFor example, on the 20th of November, the Solana-based oracle network Pyth (PYTH) completed the airdrop of 250 million PYTH tokens worth around $77 million to its early users.\n\nAlso, on the 7th of December, Jito airdropped some of its native tokens worth $225 Million to some of its users on the Solana network.\n\nJupiter, a swap aggregator and one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana, recently announced that its highly anticipated airdrop of 4 billion JUP tokens will take place in January.\n\nApart from the series of airdrops by projects on the chain, the meteoric rise in BONK\u2019s value has contributed to the upswing in Solana\u2019s network activity.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi and NFT ecosystems see growth\n\nExchanging hands at $0.0000209 at press time, the dog-themed token has rallied by 544.4% in the last month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe airdrops have culminated in a 30% growth in SOL\u2019s value in the last month. According to Messari:\n\n\u201cCombined with the recent airdrops and positive price appreciation, these factors have helped make Solana firmly the second-largest chain by DEX volumes, closely rivaling Ethereum for the top spot.\u201d\n\nIn the last month, there has been a significant increase in activity across the DEXes on Solana. AMBCrypto found that the total volume of transactions completed through Solana-based DEXes has grown by 255% in the last 30 days.\n\nAs of the 18th of December, this totaled $871 million, data from Artemis showed.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAccording to Messari:\n\n\u201cNearly 60% of Solana\u2019s DEX volume is driven through DEX aggregator Jupiter, which has eclipsed Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. Jupiter\u2019s trades are routed to underlying DEXs that settle the order, the largest of which has been Orca. Orca is now the second largest DEX in all of crypto, behind Uniswap V3 on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nFurther, Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) vertical has also seen an impressive performance in the past few months. As highlighted in the report, sales volume on the chain has increased by almost 500% in the last 90 days."

        "content": "Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius has sold off $250 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum, in the last 30 days, according to on-chain data.\n\nCrypto sleuth Apes_Prologue reported that Ether accounted for $243 million, or 97%, of the bankrupt firm\u2019s selling activities during the period.\n\nSeparately, blockchain analytical firm Peckshield confirmed that the defunct lender transferred over 10,000 units of ETH, worth approximately $24 million, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and cryptocurrency brokerage platform FalconX during the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Apes_Prologue added that Celsius also dumped over $3 million in stablecoins, $1.3 million of Chainlink\u2019s LINK, and $1.4 million of Pax Gold. Other assets the firm sold include around $150,000 of Polygon\u2019s MATIC and Avalanche\u2019s AVAX tokens, respectively.\n\nWhy is Celsius selling?\n\nJef Breed, the founder of venture capital firm Breed VC, explained that Celsius might be dumping its ETH bag to capitalize MiningCo, a Bitcoin mining company that would be owned by creditors of the failed firm.\n\nBreed suggested that Fahreint (NewCo), the leading bidder in Celsius\u2019 initial bankruptcy auction, encountered regulatory obstacles in executing its plans for Bitcoin mining and Ethereum staking services. Consequently, the bankrupt company shifted its focus to a mining venture overseen by MiningCo.\n\nAs a result, Breed inferred that the firm had to liquidate a portion of its ETH holdings to secure $250 million in fiat capital, a different approach from the initial plan requiring $450 million in liquid cryptocurrency for Fahreint\u2019s proposed strategy.\n\nWhat next for ETH price?\n\nObservers believe that Celsius\u2019s selling activity might have inhibited ETH\u2019s price from soaring recently.\n\nData from CryptoSlate shows that ETH\u2019s price has considerably struggled against other large-cap cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche, whose values have rapidly risen during the last 30 days.\n\nFor context, SOL\u2019s price increased by around 20% during the last seven days, while ETH is up by only 2% during the same period.\n\nHowever, market analysts suggest that \u201cthe selling pressure may be complete and ETH could rip up over the coming months with the spot ETH ETF narrative on the horizon.\u201d ETH is trading for $2230 as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The transferred stash was worth more than a million at press time.\n\nButerin\u2019s earlier claims of transfers being related to charity started doing the rounds.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin moved 500 ETH, worth $1.08 million as of this writing, to crypto exchange Coinbase, fueling speculations in the crypto community about the intention of the transfer.\n\nAMBCrypto scanned on-chain data and noticed movement of 500 ETH from address labeled \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d to a Coinbase custody wallet on 19th December.\n\nIncoming sell-pressure or just charity?\n\nGenerally, influential investors or whales moving a large chunk of their stashes to exchanges triggers anxiety among participants.\n\nThis is because of the dominant belief that they are likely to be sold off, putting downward pressure on the asset. However, this is not always true.\n\nIn the current scenario, Buterin might be using Coinbase\u2019 institutional custody services to secure his holdings or staking them to collect rewards.\n\nAmidst the suspense around the real intentions behind the moves, an earlier clarification by Buterin started doing the rounds as well.\n\nIn a discussion on decentralized social app Warpast some two months ago, he had said,\n\n\u201cIf you see an article saying \u201cVitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u201d, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other project, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s explanation came in response to intense speculation following large movements of his Ethereum holdings to centralized exchanges back then.\n\nDid whales liquidate their holdings?\n\nHowever, the concerns of the ETH holders were not unfounded. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,209, per CoinMarketCap, with a 24-hour loss of 1.49%.\n\nEthereum whales were active over the last two days. This was evident as transactions worth more than $1 million spiked, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s observation of Santiment data.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMoreover. the amount of ETH moving to exchanges also rose in the same time.\n\nWhen the two indicators were examined together, it appeared that ETH whales did engage in profit-taking, resulting in some sell-pressure for the asset."

        "title": "Up More Than 150% for the Year, These 3 Cryptos Have the Potential to Outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink are three cryptos that could outpace Bitcoin next year.\n\nWithout a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC 0.91%) has been the standout crypto performer of 2023. Up more than 150% for the year, Bitcoin has completely reenergized the crypto market. With Bitcoin currently trading around $42,000, some investors are even speculating that Bitcoin could soar past the $100,000 mark next year.\n\nBut with all the excitement around Bitcoin, investors might be overlooking cryptocurrencies with the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year. Three potential standouts include Solana (SOL 1.03%), Avalanche (AVAX 2.98%), and Chainlink (LINK 0.50%). Let's take a closer look at why you might want to put these cryptos on your investment radar right now.\n\nSolana and Avalanche\n\nBoth Solana and Avalanche are direct competitors to Ethereum (ETH 1.16%), the second-most valuable cryptocurrency. In crypto terminology, all three are Layer-1 blockchain networks. This simply means that they are the core base layer on which everything else is built in the blockchain world. That includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming, and Web3 apps.\n\nIf you compare the market caps of Solana and Avalanche to that of Ethereum, there's still a huge chasm. Ethereum is 8 times the size of Solana and 18 times the size of Avalanche. From my perspective, this gap should be much smaller.\n\nAnd many other investors seem to agree. Avalanche is up a sizzling 270% this year and Solana is up a blistering 630%. With that kind of performance, they are starting to gain the attention of some high-profile institutional investors. For example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, making the case that Solana is a faster and more cost-effective version of Ethereum. The implication, of course, was that Solana might one day overtake Ethereum.\n\nThe big question is whether the first-mover advantage of Ethereum is simply too insurmountable. Ethereum has seemingly been first to market with nearly every major blockchain innovation of the past five years, and that means Ethereum has a dominant position in just about every niche of the blockchain world. So keep your growth expectations for Solana and Avalanche in check.\n\nChainlink\n\nChainlink is the premier decentralized blockchain oracle in the world right now, and it's not even close. While Chainlink currently has a market cap of $8 billion, its nearest competitors have market caps measured in the hundreds of millions. For the year, Chainlink is up about 160%, and is now the 13th-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nAs a blockchain oracle, Chainlink provides data to smart contracts, which are small pieces of self-executable computer code. These smart contracts form the basis of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is why the data provided by Chainlink is so valuable. When smart contracts can't find the data they need on the blockchain, they turn to Chainlink for \"off-chain\" data.\n\nIf you buy into the concept that data is the oil of the digital economy, then you can see why Chainlink is so valuable. What has me especially excited about Chainlink is the potential for an integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In May, Chainlink outlined some of the potential use cases. And then, at this year's Chainlink conference in October, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt (a strategic advisor to Chainlink) hosted a fireside chat with Chainlink founder Sergey Nazarov discussing the intersection of blockchain and AI.\n\nThe big caveat here, of course, is that Chainlink is not an AI company and it's unclear when (or if) there will ever be a formal integration of Chainlink with ChatGPT. So, as an investor, just be aware that you're not getting direct exposure to the AI market by investing in Chainlink.\n\nJust how risky are these cryptos?\n\nWhile all three of these cryptos have the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year, Bitcoin should probably continue to represent at least one-half of your total crypto portfolio. Given that Bitcoin currently represents one-half of the current value of the $1.6 trillion crypto market, this seems like a reasonable rule of thumb.\n\nMoreover, keep in mind that the crypto market is still a volatile place to invest your money. All three of these cryptos are riskier than Bitcoin, and that means you should handle them with extreme care. That said, if you're willing to take on the extra risk, all three of these cryptos could outpace Bitcoin next year."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nTLDR\n\nInvestors seek analysis for Ethereum\u2019s price trend as predictions for a $3k surge roll in.\n\nThe altcoin would trigger a bullish round if it passed the $2,320 resistance.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s presale continues its upward movement, offering significant returns.\n\nThe crypto market has had an insane year, with top DeFi projects bouncing from high to low levels on the chart. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, has experienced its fair share of volatility, seemingly kickstarting the altcoin season at some point and now falling towards its support level. These changes have left investors wondering whether the token can still meet certain predictions and hit $3,000 by year-end.\n\nWhile speculations regarding Ethereum\u2019s features have become a major discussion, a new ETH ICO has been making its rounds in the market, drawing attention to its presale. NuggetRush (NUGX) is an upcoming meme-inspired project that is becoming popular for its play-to-earn mechanism. This article explores Ethereum\u2019s price movement to determine whether a $3,000 bet is realistic while discussing the token\u2019s growth potential compared to NuggetRush\u2019s.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): 2023 Predictions Are In\n\nMultiple analysts have dropped their 2023 predictions for top DeFi projects, and Ethereum has bagged a $3,000 prediction before the month\u2019s end. The altcoin has had a bearish 2023 but recently started chasing Bitcoin\u2019s rally, rising to nearly $2,400 before dropping to around the $2,200 mark. Analysts have predicted a significant surge if the token can pass its resistance of $2,320.\n\nA concrete analysis of the ETH price progression would be difficult, as several happenings also point to a bullish outlook. Recent price movements have left investors skeptical that the token could reach its support levels, ranging between $2,240 and $2,200. This aligns with predictions that the altcoin will consolidate and fall below $1,900 in a downtrend.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from the top platform, Spot On Chain, top whales have been selling their Ethereum coins. FTX and Celsius Network, but bankrupt crypto companies, have made significant ETH transactions, moving their tokens to other wallets and taking advantage of the brief price hike to $2,300. FTX deposited 1,593 ETH worth $3.66 million, while Celsius Network transferred 7,500 ETH worth $17.4 million to FalconX.\n\nEthereum\u2019s circulating supply has also dropped to great lows, hitting about 120 million ETH, a significant number for the altcoin. The pivotal movement is in line with EIP-960, a proposal made by Ethereum founder Butterin to set a hard cap on the Ethereum supply to ensure sustainability.\n\nThe community rejected the proposal, picking a flexible supply over a potential surge from scarcity. The different occurrences within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem point to uncertainty, but investors are convinced that the coin can rally to $2,320. If it hits this mark, it\u2019ll be the best crypto investment for 2023, exceeding $2,400 and potentially hitting $3,000 before the year ends.\n\nNuggetRush Is Making P2E Gaming Work For Miners\n\nNuggetRush has been a major consideration for investors seeking fair entry points and significant growth potential. With its GameFi capabilities, the blockchain ICO offers gaming, investment opportunities, and multiple earning ways.\n\nNFTs play a huge role on this platform, representing game characters and having staking capabilities, from which investors can earn a 20% APY. NuggetRush is built on the Ethereum blockchain, promising security and transparency.\n\nThe blockchain ICO launched its resale recently, and nearly 86 million tokens have been bought off the 215 million hard cap. The presale is now in its third round, selling each NUGX token at 0.013 USDT. This round is set to sell off successfully, with less than 23% of the allocated tokens left.\n\nEarly-stage investors who bought at 0.01 USDT in round one are set to claim a 100% increase in their investments when the token lists at 0.02 USDT. Purchasing in its current round offers a 53% increase compared to the 33.8% increase if Ethereum hits $3,000 this year, making it the best crypto investment for significant returns.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nConclusion\n\nAnalysts have predicted Ethereum to surge to $3,000 before 2023, and investors, knowing the market\u2019s volatility, wonder whether it is a realistic prediction. The token is thriving in the crypto market, with its price movements signifying a potential break and a chance for a huge surge.\n\nNUGX continues to attract investors with its revolutionary model, offering GameFi and charitable features. Its successful presale is a great opportunity for investors to claim tokens at discounted rates, and the list price shows the potential for significant returns, far surpassing Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\n*This article was paid.

        "content": "Solana price is up 550% since early June, defying negativity around the security label imposed by the SEC.\n\nSOL could rise 20% to the $100 psychological level before the close of 2023 if Bitcoin price builds support above $44,200.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated if the purported Ethereum killer records a weekly candlestick close below the $51.63 support.\n\nSolana (SOL) price has been on a tear, standing among the biggest gainers among the crypto top ten. This is despite regulatory FUD, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled SOL a security during its market-wide clampdown against cryptocurrency exchanges. As reported, the hard pump has seen the purported Ethereum (ETH) killer unseat Ripple (XRP) to be the fifth cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAlso Read: Solana, XRP and Cardano receive $16 million weekly inflows as Bitcoin sees outflows\n\nSolana and altcoins could fly if Bitcoin builds support above $44,200\n\nSolana (SOL) price does not show any signs of stopping, pumping hard to outperform its peers. It comes as the Solana ecosystem continues to present itself as a better hub over Ethereum, despite Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko binning the narrative that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, while new projects and airdrops provide tailwinds for Solana price, one analyst @ShadyTheWizard explains that Bitcoin price showing strength is critical to Solana and altcoins rallying. In his opinion, \u201cAs long as BTC can build support above 44.2k, everything will continue to fly.\u201d\n\nSOL/USDT 1-week chart, BTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nSolana price outlook as SOL looks unstoppable\n\nSolana price continues with a bold uptrend, recording pronounced higher highs for the past three months. Judging from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the bulls are still interested, evidenced by its inclination to the north despite SOL being massively overbought.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in the positive territory to show the bulls are in the lead, accentuated by its inclination to the north to show this was the direction with the least resistance.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Solana price extend to tag the $92.76 resistance level. Further north, SOL could extend a neck higher to tag the $100.00 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Solana price could foray into the weekly supply zone stretching between $104.70 and $136.90. To confirm the continuation of the trend, SOL must record a weekly candlestick close above the midline of this order block at $120.83.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, a rejection from the immediate barricade at $92.76 could send Solana price south, losing the $67.26 support level. An extended fall could see SOL test the $51.63 buyer congestion level. A weekly candlestick close below this level would invalidate the prevailing bullish thesis.\n\nIn the dire case, the Solana price could extend even lower to tag the support floor at $12.80, with such a move constituting an 85% drop below current levels."

        "content": "For the first time ever, Solana\u2019s daily DEX volume outshone Ethereum, although the reign was short-lived.\n\nThe newfound popularity of meme coin BONK, alongside USDC integration, has fuelled interest in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nSolana boasts cheaper transactions and faster settlement times compared to the congestion of Ethereum.\n\nSince its inception in 2020, Solana has been striving to overcome Ethereum to become the unofficial \u201cKing of DeFi\u201d. Although, in the long-term, that title no doubt still belongs to the Ether ecosystem, for just a moment, Solana managed to wear the crown.\n\nSolana \u201cFlips\u201d Eth For Very First Time\n\nTwo days ago, trading volume on Solana decentralised exchanges (DEX) managed to beat out Ethereum over a 24-hour period. Data acquired from DeFiLlama showed that Solana\u2019s daily volume surpassed USD $1.5 billion (AUD $2.24 billion), while Ethereum trailed behind at approximately USD $1.15 billion (AUD $1.72 billion).\n\nSolana trading volume, source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe \u201cflippening\u201d didn\u2019t last long, with order restored the day after as Ethereum once again reclaimed the throne for daily trading volume. However, the monumental occasion was not lost on Solana\u2019s community and comes amid significant ecosystem growth in the second half of 2023.\n\nI am just pacing around the house and saying whoa over and over at this point https://t.co/SSPZz3bVac \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8| bip-420 (@aeyakovenko) December 16, 2023\n\nBONK and USDC Leading the Charge\n\nThe newfound interest in Solana\u2019s decentralised finance ecosystem is being pushed by two elements: BONK and USDC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBONK is a meme coin in the ilk of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that has recently gained traction, quickly rising to the position of third-biggest meme token by market cap. This has sparked significant community interest, especially amid news that those who purchase a Solana phone were airdropped an amount of BONK worth more than the actual phone at retail. This is no longer the case thanks to a massive increase in demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s integration of the second-most popular stablecoin USDC has seen seasoned DeFi traders flock to the blockchain thanks to its cheap transaction fees and fast settlement times.\n\nThis is happening because ecosystem devs have continued shipping awesome products for the last 24 months. https://t.co/Yddhigq42b \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8| bip-420 (@aeyakovenko) December 18, 2023\n\nSolana Versus Ethereum: Who Will Win?\n\nWhen Ethereum introduced smart contracts in 2017, it revolutionised the blockchain industry. Hundreds of influential decentralised applications brought new utility to the world and helped bring solutions to real-world problems crypto had long wanted to implement. However, as the Ether DeFi world exploded, issues of its own started to arise \u2013 gas fees soared, network congestion thickened and settlement times lengthened.\n\nThese are the keys to Solana\u2019s case for overcoming Ethereum. Transaction fees on Solana are substantially cheaper than Ethereum, and it can handle congestion much better. But does it have the security and app developers on board to finish the job? Only time will tell."

        "content": "JAKARTA - The founder of Ethereum (ETH), Vitalik Buterin, recently caused a commotion among the crypto community. The reason is, he was caught selling a number of meme coins or coin memes in large quantities. Vitalik's meme coin, Doberman (DOBE) and DOJO.\n\nThis sale was revealed from data tracked by PeckShild Alert, a blockchain security firm. This sale raises various speculations about the motives and impacts on the crypto market.\n\nCoins of coin or coin memes are a type of cryptocurrency inspired by the characters, animals, or funny things that are popular on the internet. Some examples of well-known coin memes are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk. Meme coins are usually of low value, but can rise sharply due to the virality factor and community support.\n\nButerin is known as one of the biggest coin meme owners, as his wallet often receives tokens from coin meme developers. Their goal is to increase the credibility and popularity of their project by linking it to Buterin's name. As a result, Buterin's wallet is filled with various kinds of coin memes with a value of millions of dollars.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, Buterin sold 100,000,000,000.111.11 DOBE and 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO through the Uniswap V2 platform, a decentralized crypto exchange protocol. He exchanged the coin meme with Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), the ERC-20 version of Ether (ETH), the original cryptocurrency of Ethereum. The total transaction value reaches around $40,000 (IDR 618.4 million).\n\nThis sale is one of many major transactions made by Buterin in recent months. In September, he moved 2,000 ETH worth about $3.1 million (IDR 47.8 billion) to the Bitstamp exchange. In November, he denied allegations of selling 3.000 ETH, claiming that it was part of a donation for research projects.\n\nButerin himself has not provided an official explanation of the reasons for selling his latest coin memes. However, there are several possibilities to consider. First, he may want to clear his wallet of unwanted or useless assets. Second, he may want to reduce the risk of market volatility that could erode the value of his assets. Third, he may want to allocate funds for other purposes, such as the development of Ethereum or philanthropy.\n\nWhatever the motive, Buterin's selling of coin memes certainly has an impact on the crypto market considering meme coins are very sensitive to market sentiment, so Buterin's actions can trigger chain reactions from crypto traders and investors.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

As per recent regulatory updates on December 18, the SEC has delayed its verdict on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nHashdex\u2019s proposed Ether ETF aims to incorporate a mix of spot Ether and futures contracts. Conversely, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF, considered a strategic move, could compel the SEC to allow the conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to postpone includes initiating proceedings to seek additional public feedback on the viability of these ETFs. The delay also affects the decisions for VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF and the joint application from ARK Invest and 21Shares for their spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nUpdate: There it is. Delay order for @ARKInvest and @21Shares on their spot #Ethereum ETF filing. Expected and was due by December 26th. Final date for these are in late May. https://t.co/Zs6Zsd4uKj pic.twitter.com/9u0nNiPD9O \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, anticipated these delays, expecting a resolution before December 25. He highlighted that a definitive decision from the SEC is expected by late May.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings. Neither were due until Jan 1, 2024.\n\n\n\nMaybe just clearing the queue before the holidays? pic.twitter.com/LdZQxGh43L \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nWhile the SEC has previously greenlit Ethereum futures ETFs, it remains hesitant to approve any spot or hybrid Ethereum ETFs. The focus of the crypto market is also on the SEC\u2019s impending decision regarding 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with a potential decision expected as early as January 10, 2024.\n\nSeyffart, alongside fellow analyst Eric Balchunas, predicts a 90% likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, a development that has positively influenced market sentiment. Over the past six months, Bitcoin has seen a notable 44% price increase, while Ethereum has also enjoyed a 16.8% rise in the same period, according to TradingView statistics."

You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nThe Ethereum platform is an open-source blockchain platform with its cryptocurrency known as Ether (ETH). Ethereum is a blockchain network that allows users to create, monetize, and use Ether, the cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nVitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin announced the creation of the decentralized public ledger in July 2015. It is based on Blockchain technology, making it very difficult or almost impossible to hack, change, or cheat the system because Ethereum is based on Blockchain technology.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is a digital tool, available as either software or hardware, that enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. This wallet facilitates the management of Ethereum accounts, essential for conducting transactions and monitoring balances within the Ethereum network.\n\nEach Ethereum account can have multiple Ethereum addresses, which are public identifiers starting with \u201c0x\u201d and consisting of a string of letters and numbers. While the balance of these addresses is publicly visible on the blockchain, the identity of the address owner remains anonymous, represented only by this unique alphanumeric string.\n\nThe critical component of an Ethereum wallet is the private key, akin to a password. This key allows the user to operate their wallet and manage the funds within it. It\u2019s crucial that this key remains confidential to the wallet\u2019s owner, as anyone who gains access to it can access and potentially control the funds in that wallet.\n\nEthereum wallets come in various forms, catering to different needs and preferences. They can be software-based, residing on desktop or mobile devices, or hardware-based, offering enhanced security by storing information offline. There are also physical wallets, such as those made from paper or titanium, providing an offline method of storing the private keys securely.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum wallets are the interface through which users engage with the Ethereum blockchain, managing their accounts, funds, and interactions with decentralized applications and smart contracts. The choice of wallet type depends on the user\u2019s specific requirements, balancing convenience, accessibility, and security.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges and various services, including marketplaces and lending platforms, offer Ethereum storage solutions known as custodial wallets. These wallets maintain control over the users\u2019 private keys, offering a trade-off between convenience and direct control over funds. While they simplify access to funds, users are reliant on the service\u2019s security measures, increasing the risk of loss through hacking or mismanagement by the service.\n\nFor those seeking to utilize decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain, having access to private keys is essential. DApps are digital applications that operate on blockchain technology, offering a wide range of functionalities.\n\nEthereum wallets vary in their capabilities. While most allow basic functions like sending and receiving Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, others offer additional features. ERC-20 is a standard for issuing tokens on Ethereum, defining a set of rules for their operation. Some wallets enable direct cryptocurrency purchases using credit or debit cards and support for unique digital assets like nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which differ from fungible tokens like Ether (ETH).\n\nThese wallets also facilitate interaction with DApps, which span various domains such as social media, gaming, marketplaces, and financial services. Certain Ethereum wallets come with built-in browsers, making it easier to access these DApps directly. Additionally, linking bank accounts to wallets can simplify crypto transactions, often offering lower fees and the convenience of recurring payments.\n\nSecurity features in Ethereum wallets vary, with some allowing users to specify trusted addresses for fund transfers, and others offering multisignature (multisig) capabilities, requiring multiple approvals for transactions. Multisig accounts are common in blockchain platforms and traditional finance.\n\nWallets differ in the number and type of features they offer, with advanced wallets supporting a mix of Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and other cryptocurrencies to interact with various blockchain networks.\n\nUsers aren\u2019t limited to a single type of Ethereum wallet. With private keys, access is possible via mobile devices, desktops, browsers, or even paper wallets. The method of access can vary, but the underlying blockchain data remains constant.\n\nBelow is a classification of Ethereum wallet types:\n\nMobile Wallets:\n\nThese are applications installed on mobile devices, functioning as light nodes without requiring the entire blockchain download. They are convenient but less secure due to potential device loss or hacking. Mobile wallets often include built-in browsers for DApp interaction.\n\nDesktop Wallets:\n\nRunning on operating systems like macOS, Windows, or Linux, these wallets store keys locally and are used predominantly on desktop computers. They offer enhanced security, with options for full blockchain clients for independent transaction validation.\n\nWeb Interfaces:\n\nOnline platforms that allow wallet interaction through web browsers. They utilize cloud storage for accessibility but can be risky if they require users to trust a website with their private keys.\n\nBrowser Extensions:\n\nAdd-ons for desktop browsers, these wallets store ETH and ERC-20 tokens and are generally considered more secure than web interfaces. They encrypt private keys within the browser for added security.\n\nHardware Wallets:\n\nPhysical devices that store private keys offline (cold wallets), offering high security. They are suitable for large holdings and require physical access and a password or PIN for fund access.\n\nPaper Wallets:\n\nBasic cold wallets involving printed private keys. Highly secure but susceptible to physical damage or loss, paper wallets are inexpensive and easy to create.\n\nEach wallet type presents a balance of security, convenience, and functionality, and users should choose based on their specific needs and risk tolerance.\n\nType Description Mobile Wallets Easy-to-use apps on mobile devices. They offer convenience but can be less secure due to potential device loss or hacking. Useful for interacting with DApps and DeFi. Desktop Wallets Installed on computers, offering higher security than mobile wallets. Ideal for users preferring desktop-based management and offering features like smart contract creation. Web Interfaces Web-based platforms allowing wallet interaction via browsers. Convenient but can be risky due to potential web-based attacks like phishing or DNS attacks. Browser Extensions Add-ons for browsers, enabling interaction with DApps and storage of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Generally safer than web interfaces as they encrypt private keys in the browser. Hardware Wallets Physical devices storing private keys offline. Highly secure (cold storage) but can be costlier, ideal for large holdings or long-term storage. Paper Wallets Basic cold storage method involving printed private keys. Highly secure but susceptible to physical damage or loss. Inexpensive and simple to create.\n\nHot Wallet vs Cold Wallet For Ethereum\n\nFor individuals prioritizing ease of access and a reasonable degree of security, hot wallets present an optimal solution. These wallets are particularly advantageous for managing Ethereum accounts with modest asset values, offering a blend of security and user-friendly functionality. Hot wallets, accessible via the internet, provide the most straightforward and practical option for everyday transactions and engagements within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConversely, users who prefer not to rely on online service providers and are prepared to undertake the responsibility of securing their private keys might find cold wallets more suitable. These wallets, which store information offline, afford users a higher level of control over their assets. They are especially recommended for safeguarding significant cryptocurrency holdings, where the paramount concern is security over convenience. While opting for a cold wallet entails a trade-off in terms of accessibility, it significantly mitigates the risk of total asset loss \u2013 a scenario far more inconvenient than the additional steps required in managing a cold wallet. It is imperative for users of cold wallets to rigorously ensure the safety and confidentiality of their private keys, as this is integral to the security of their substantial assets.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet for NFTs\n\nThe significant popularity of Ethereum, coupled with its extensive developer community, has positioned it as the foremost blockchain platform for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Given this prominence, it\u2019s unsurprising that a majority of wallets now offer support for Ethereum-based tokens, particularly those adhering to the ERC-721 standard. In this context, a pertinent question arises: \u2018Which Ethereum wallet stands out as the preeminent choice for NFTs?\u2019\n\nMetaMask, widely acknowledged as the leading crypto wallet for Ethereum interactions, offers both a mobile application and a browser extension. These tools facilitate effortless access to Web 3.0 marketplaces, streamlining the process with just a few clicks.\n\nWithin the realm of Ethereum NFT wallets, MetaMask is frequently lauded as the superior option by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Its recurring mentions in Ethereum wallet reviews underscore its merits. One of MetaMask\u2019s primary advantages is its user-friendliness, making it accessible to individuals with even a rudimentary understanding of cryptocurrencies. Users can efficiently set up MetaMask to manage ETH, ERC-20, and ERC-721 tokens created on the Ethereum network, as well as assets from other blockchain networks.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s distinction also stems from its open-source nature and the dedication of its development team, contributing to its status as the most favored Ethereum NFT wallet in the community.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet \u2013 Conclusion\n\nIn concluding our exploration of the best Ethereum wallets, it\u2019s evident that each option presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The selection process is largely influenced by individual requirements and preferences, especially considering the diverse functionalities of these wallets. Ethereum, despite being a relatively recent entrant in the cryptocurrency arena, has rapidly ascended to prominence, necessitating a careful choice of wallet for optimal management of assets.\n\nSoftware wallets, or hot wallets, are typically chosen for their user-friendly interfaces and versatility. They excel in providing a seamless experience for purchasing, storing, selling, exchanging, and managing multiple cryptocurrencies within a single platform. These wallets are ideal for those who prioritize ease of use and quick access to their crypto assets.\n\nOn the other hand, hardware wallets, though potentially more costly, offer a significantly heightened level of security and privacy. Unlike their software counterparts, hardware wallets may support a limited range of cryptocurrencies but are unparalleled in safeguarding assets. For those seeking a balance between security and convenience, integrating a hardware wallet with a software or hot wallet can be an effective strategy. This combination harnesses the strengths of both types, ensuring robust security without compromising on accessibility.\n\nAfter thorough analysis and research, we have identified eToro as the standout crypto wallet for 2022. Its appeal lies in its comprehensive security measures, regulatory compliance, and widespread adoption by over 20 million users globally. eToro distinguishes itself not only as a safe and regulated wallet but also as a platform enabling users to trade cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, at competitive rates.
