        "title": "Forget Bitcoin and Ethereum: This Cryptocurrency Is Poised for an Incredible Run - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are waking up after another long slumber. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has gained 92% over the last year, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) climbed 128% higher. From the introduction of new crypto-based investment vehicles to the upcoming halving of Bitcoin-mining rewards, many forces have combined to thaw the latest crypto winter.\n\nBut not every cryptocurrency has been invited to the party yet, even if their growth prospects look at least as promising as Bitcoin's or Ethereum's. In particular, Polkadot (CRYPTO: DOT) seems undervalued and poised to break out in a market-beating run. The official blockchain network of the Web3 Foundation isn't getting the market respect it deserves.\n\nPolkadot's low price sticks out like a freshly stubbed toe if you agree that a decentralized and personalized internet is the future.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell all your Bitcoin and Ethereum to reinvest it in Polkadot today. A diverse portfolio always makes more sense, even in the uncharted waters of the crypto industry.\n\nBut in case you haven't considered adding some Polkadot yet, let me explain why this token is in a prime position to beat both the stock and crypto markets over the next few years.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Polkadot, anyway?\n\nPolkadot is a blockchain network designed to solve a fundamental problem of the crypto world: different blockchains can't easily talk to one other. Imagine a world where your Apple iPhone couldn't connect directly to a Samsung Galaxy device -- that's the old blockchain reality. Polkadot acts as a translator and bridge, allowing blockchains with different purposes and designs to seamlessly communicate and share data.\n\nThe Web3 vision for the internet is all about decentralization and user control. Polkadot makes this possible by enabling customized blockchains (so-called \"parachains\") to plug into its network. These parachains can be tailored for specific uses like gaming, finance, or social media, creating an interconnected ecosystem where value and information flow freely.\n\nThis programming ecosystem supports quick and easy development of apps and programs that take advantage of the best features in many different blockchains. Polkadot makes it easy to store monetary value in Bitcoin, execute Ethereum's smart contracts, collect real-world data from Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), and more.\n\nAnd the DOT token (commonly referred to as Polkadot) is the lifeblood of this decentralized system, passing data between different blockchain networks with ease while ensuring the security of data transfers. Plus, its multichain design allows for many transactions to be processed quickly, avoiding the bottlenecks of less scalable blockchains.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow the DOT blockchain makes money\n\nRunning transactions through Polkadot's proof-of-stake ecosystem generates a tiny fee for the validation nodes that process every request. This toll fee for traveling on the next-generation information superhighway serves as an incentive for helping the system work.\n\nIn this way, increased use of the Polkadot network directly translates to higher demand for DOT tokens, since they are needed to pay transaction fees. As the ecosystem grows and more value flows through Polkadot, the underlying DOT token becomes more valuable.\n\nThe current reward rate for staking your Polkadot tokens stands at 17.3%. That's quite high, in order to motivate more DOT owners to stake their tokens and take a more active role in the system. Less than 53% of all DOT tokens are staked today, below the target rate of 60%. So the reward rate could change over time as the staked portion grows or shrinks. Staking also lets DOT holders participate in network governance, further influencing the value of their holdings.\n\nPlus, that's the raw reward rate for people running their own nodes on the DOT network under ideal conditions. The rate will be lower if your chosen crypto-trading service keeps a part of the staking revenue for itself. For example, my Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) account currently shows a 6.9% earning rate for staking DOT tokens.\n\nThese mechanisms ensure that DOT's value is tied to the growth and success of the Polkadot network.\n\nPolkadot Price Chart\n\nPolkadot has room to grow, but many market makers haven't noticed yet\n\nDOT's 14% gain over the past year pales in comparison to Bitcoin's and Ethereum's returns. Yet those larger crypto names operate in different, often less-dynamic market segments.\n\nWith its interoperability focus, Polkadot sits at the leading edge of Web3 innovation. Market caps are often imperfect metrics in rapidly evolving industries, and DOT's $10.5 billion market value should grow much larger in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIt seems like a gross undervaluation given Polkadot's pivotal role in the emerging decentralized internet. Astute investors can see this mispricing as a chance to buy into a leading Web3 infrastructure play at a significant discount.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Polkadot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Polkadot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Polkadot wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in Bitcoin, Coinbase Global, Ethereum, and Polkadot.

        "content": "For the past decade, Denver has acted as a physical gateway to a new internet intended to be both permissionless and open-sourced. This year\u2019s ETHDenver finds itself at the convergence of several significant events in the crypto space.\n\nThis year\u2019s ETHDenver comes a few weeks before Ethereum undergoes its Dencun upgrade.\n\nDenver is not just home to the Rockies, the largest mountain system in North America. The Mile-High City is where ETHDenver takes place, an annual community-run gathering for those curious about smart contracts, decentralized finance, and blockchain networks.\n\nFor the past decade, Denver has acted as a physical gateway to a new internet, serving as the entry point for people to meet others and coordinate building a digital landscape intended to be both permissionless and open-sourced.\n\nAs snow falls, some crypto enthusiasts are already in Denver, participating in hackathons, networking for potential investment deals, and learning more about the underlying technologies that power decentralized networks.\n\nThis year\u2019s ETHDenver finds itself at the convergence of several significant events in the crypto space. It comes a few weeks before Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network by market cap, will undergo its Dencun upgrade, which is expected to substantially improve transaction cost efficiencies for layer 2 rollups.\n\nThe \u201cinnovation festival,\u201d as ETHDenver\u2019s landing page calls it, also comes as competition among layer 2 scaling solutions is ramping up, with some networks maturing and others just joining the race.\n\nArbitrum\n\nand\n\nOptimism\n\n, with a total locked value of $3.186 billion and $929 million respectively, according to blockchain analytics firm\n\nDefiLlama\n\n, have been operational for several years, gearing up for the next stage of their blockchain networks.\n\nRead more: Is Ether Heading for $3,500?\n\nOn the other hand, new layer 2s, some connected to centralized exchanges such as Base and Mantle, have gone live on public mainnets within the past 12 months.\n\nOne newer layer 2 blockchain network, Blast, has attracted over $2 billion in crypto assets from a total of about 165,000 users, and yet the protocol has yet to activate its public mainnet. The Blast team announced on X that they would roll out Blast\u2019s mainnet on Thursday, the same day ETHDenver founder John Paller and Colorado governor Jared Polls conduct the conference\u2019s opening ceremony.\n\nRepresentatives of Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Mantle, among other Ethereum rollups, will be in Denver.\n\nNew Proposals and Techniques\n\nIn addition to fresh layer 2 entrants, applications and protocols on Ethereum have seen new proposals and techniques. For example, EigenLayer, widely known for introducing a new mechanism called \u201crestaking,\u201d has accumulated $8.88 billion in locked value in its smart contracts since it launched in June 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume, Uniswap, is undergoing community discussions following Uniswap Foundation governance lead Erin Koen\u2019s proposal to distribute fees generated by the protocol to UNI token holders.\n\n\u201c2024 will be a year of growth, but also a year of evolution for crypto\u201d, wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, in a report published in late January. In that vein, Ethereum\u2019s multifaceted landscape is simultaneously maturing and changing, marked by technological experiments and strategic shifts within the space.\n\nContributors from EigenLayer, Uniswap, and other protocols will also be taking part in ETHDenver, and so those attending the conference can expect discussions inspired by panels, fireside chats, and even casual small talk, about the various elements of Ethereum: layer 2 scaling solutions, governance proposals, and staking techniques.\n\nPolitics\n\nETHDenver also comes as crypto lobbyists, lawyers, and regulators are preparing for the upcoming U.S. primary elections slated to start in April. As such, attendees can anticipate people sharing their views on the United States\u2019 current political scene.\n\nPolicymakers have historically played an integral role in the crypto space through legislation and public remarks.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren said on Feb. 2 in a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that \u201ccyber criminals are exploiting cryptocurrency to scam American consumers out of billions of dollars every year.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, has not only released a few NFT collections but also said in a Fox News town hall event in South Carolina on Feb. 24 that he could \u201clive with\u201d people wanting to pay with BTC, after previously being fairly critical of the cryptocurrency.\n\nNotably, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission also approved several spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last month, causing investors to speculate on when the SEC, headed by Gary Gensler, will approve spot ether ETFs.\n\nAt ETHDenver, several political figures will be speaking as well. On Thursday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will be part of a fireside chat about public goods. U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will have a conversation on Saturday with the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, Caitlin Long, about the role of blockchain policy. Colorado\u2019s congressional representative Brittany Pettersen, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, will also be speaking on Saturday about the \u201cCrypto Conversation in D.C.\u201d\n\nBitcoiners, Solana Enthusiasts, and Avalanche Loyalists Pull Up, Too\n\nWhile ETHDenver initially was started by people intimately tied to the Ethereum community, the annual multi-day conference has drawn in individuals and communities outside of Ethereum, such as Bitcoin, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nLast Friday, Solana Foundation developer advocate Nick Frostbutter spearheaded a workshop at ETHDenver to help people get started on Solana.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts can also attend the Hack House hosted by Ava Labs, the software development firm behind Avalanche, another layer 1 blockchain like Ethereum and Solana. \u201cLooking forward to attending ETHDenver next week, going to check out the Avalanche hack House and catch up with some of my good friends in the Ethereum community,\u201d Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, founder and CEO of Ava Labs, wrote on X last week.\n\nDenver will have Bitcoiners, too, as Bitcoin Renaissance, an event focused on the \u201csynergies between Bitcoin and [Proof of Stake] chains,\u201d like Ethereum, takes place on Thursday.\n\nAttendees will have the opportunity to engage, learn, and listen generously to individuals from a diverse range of blockchain ecosystems within and beyond Ethereum, the incumbent leader of smart contract functionality.\n\nIn the waning days of winter, Denver, already a physical portal to a new internet some have named \u201cWeb3,\u201d heralds a dynamic atmosphere where people are meeting up to push the boundaries of decentralized networks.\n\nUnchained is a media partner of ETHDenver and will cover the conference. Stay tuned!"

        "title": "Ethereum Emerges As CRE's Preferred Crypto As Investor Interest Reignites - Bisnow",
        "content": "Nearly a dozen companies, including investors like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, filed applications this week to launch exchange-traded funds using ethereum, the favored cryptocurrency of the commercial real estate world.\n\nMany in CRE dipped their toes into crypto when the craze first hit the financial world years ago. But the renewed interest in the opaque digital currency spurred by a key Securities and Exchange Commission approval last month could open new doors for property investment.\n\nPhoenix-based NAI Horizon Executive Vice President Jeffrey Garza Walker told Bisnow he is hearing new buzz in CRE about crypto, and particularly ethereum, especially as major ETFs roll out. Garza Walker's specialty is industrial assets, and he believes that blockchain will be a normal way to transact commercial real estate within two years.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there's a lot more momentum behind it now, a lot more velocity,\u201d Garza Walker said. \u201cThere's a system in place to look at and start to get comfortable with. As people get more comfortable and feel that this is a safe way to transact, they are going to learn that it's quicker and much more easy than what's been traditionally done.\u201d\n\nEther trades on the ethereum blockchain, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nCrypto is having its biggest week since before the crash in 2022, with investors pouring into the sector. Investments are being made in vehicles that didn't exist two years ago, such as ETFs that can invest directly in cryptocurrencies, like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which pulled in a record $520M in a single day on Tuesday.\n\nUntil recently, ETFs were only allowed to invest in crypto-adjacent entities, such as bitcoin miners. In January, the SEC approved ETFs that invest directly in bitcoin, and the agency may approve ETFs for ethereum in May.\n\nAs the erratic bad boy of the crypto world, bitcoin gets the glory and notoriety, but not wide acceptance by commercial real estate. As crypto's No. 2 entity, ether is a different story, quietly working its way into CRE.\n\nEther experiences less volatility than bitcoin, the stock price of which has whipsawed in the last five years, hitting a two-year high of more than $60K this week. Ether\u2019s share price, meanwhile, reached over $3K this week, a 45% increase over last year.\n\nIn addition to being the more predictable of the two front-runners, ether is widely regarded as the best option for executing smart contracts, which are perhaps the most commonly used application of crypto among CRE professionals. Smart contracts can be executed automatically on ethereum, removing the need for intermediaries, and the system uses a special programming language that allows for high levels of customization.\n\nEthereum is the \u201csettlement layer\u201d of choice of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange platform, according to Aaron Rafferty, co-founder of StandardDAO, a tech company that counts proptech among its specialties. In a crypto context, a settlement is the finalization of a transaction, such as a property sale, when it is stored within the blockchain.\n\n\u201cAny platform utilizing the ethereum blockchain is essentially using smart contracts, which takes money in and distributes dividends once conditions are met,\u201d according to The Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti. \u201cThe transactions are more transparent due to blockchain technology, but what investors really care about are the ease of trading and liquidity and not having to wait months or even years to get their money in or out of a deal.\u201d\n\nEthereum is also pivotal in the tokenization of assets, which allows investors to acquire relatively small pieces of real property, with ownership registered via blockchain.\n\nThe tokenization concept, which uses blockchain to create \u201ctokens\u201d \u2014 essentially ownership units in an asset \u2014 has gotten more attention for artwork than real estate, but commercial property is moving in that direction.\n\nEarly attempts at tokenizing real estate taught the industry some important lessons, particularly around which properties would work with the strategy.\n\nIn 2018, tokenization firms Fluidity and Propellr attempted to tokenize part of a commercial property in Manhattan and failed because investors weren't able to wrap their heads around the concept, Moretti said.\n\n\u201cThe world wasn't ready for it, as only a small number of investors understood,\u201d she said.\n\nBut when the owners of the prestigious St. Regis hotel in posh Aspen, Colorado, decided to tokenize not long after, investors were ready.\n\nInvestors wanted in on the name and reputation of the St. Regis, Moretti said. The property sits at the base of Aspen Mountain in one of the priciest ski towns in the country. It is frequented by celebrities and high-paying business magnates.\n\nThe St. Regis hotel in Aspen, Colorado\n\nWhile crypto-associated ETFs are grabbing headlines, ethereum is poised for an upgrade. An update called Dencun is scheduled to roll out on March 13, promising to make ethereum more efficient and, importantly for real estate, increase scalability for smart contracts.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade will generally reduce the cost to use smart contracts via Ethereum Layer 2s, while retaining the Ethereum network\u2019s underlying security,\u201d Grayscale Investments research analyst Will Ogden Moore told Bisnow via email.\n\nGrayscale is the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager, with more than $10B in assets under management.\n\n\u201cThis dynamic, plus the fact that Ethereum is the second largest crypto protocol by market cap, could encourage commercial real estate industry participants to choose Ethereum Layer 2s as they explore future projects on the blockchain,\u201d Ogden Moore said.\n\nStill, there there are limits to what blockchain tech can do in a real estate context, said DGIM Law partner Isaac Marcushamer, adding that smart contracts might be more automated, but they won't take the place of courts in dispute resolutions or affect due diligence much.\n\n\u201cYou look at zoning, pro formas, environmentals, mechanicals and architectural surveys. I can't conceptualize how blockchain affects any of that,\u201d Marcushamer said.\n\n\u201cBlockchain appears to be a secure way of tracking transactions that you want to make public,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's a really cool way to replace the hundreds of thousands of pages, or millions of pages, that are sitting in the county clerks\u2019 offices.\u201d\n\nBut there's a catch: government approval of such transfers. Control over how that process plays out remains with state or local governments in the United States, and Marcushamer isn't sure that they will come around anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI don't see how, in the buying and selling of real estate, blockchain has the right ingredients yet to make something happen,\u201d Marcushamer said. \u201cMaybe someone will use it as a way to vet that you want to lease an apartment and use it to sign your lease, sure. But those are relatively friction-free transactions today.\u201d\n\nCRE is edging into ethereum-associated blockchain technology, but real estate is still real estate, Marcushamer said, in that it is a slow adopter of new tech.\n\n\u201cBlockchain isn't in its infancy anymore,\u201d Marcushamer said. \u201cI think it's a toddler or a preteen in its evolution. It's starting to have an identity, to be understood for what it is. But the pace of adoption in the blockchain field is going to be slow as we kind of continue to go through this period of uncertainty in real estate.\u201d\n\nThe spiking value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in February is drawing attention to the sector, but since values are volatile, the normalization of crypto ETFs will be more lasting in its impact, Moretti said. Once the big players are in crypto, others will jump in, including real estate players.\n\n\u201cIt's not just a fad, and it's not something that's just played out, because we have these large-scale financial institutions embracing it who have figured out a way to make it more accessible to traditional investors in ETFs,\u201d Moretti said.\n\nWide-scale adoption isn't going to happen instantly, but the momentum is there, with the approval of ethereum-associated ETFs adding to it, she said.\n\n\u201cThe more adoption, the easier it is for the real estate industry to embrace something like this,\u201d Moretti said, referring to the use of ethereum for smart contracts and tokenization. \u201cCompanies like mine are primed for this kind of thing. We're ready for it. Other companies in the real estate industry, not so much, because they haven't been paying attention.\u201d"

It should:\n\nallow for key rotation and key deprecations; be quantum computer resistant; allow batching; allow sponsored transactions.\n\nThe first two goals are clearly not satisfied by Ethereum\u2019s \u201cend user account\u201d (EOA) model, hence the need to move the entire EVM ecosystem towards smart contract accounts (SCAs).\n\n\u201cOne thing that would be good to avoid is essentially creating two totally separate developer ecosystems for smart contract wallets and for EOAs,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nCore developers have previously identified a need to deliver feature upgrades that improve the user experience in the short term, even as they work to deliver on a multi-year roadmap for Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs consider \u2018existential\u2019 upgrade to the EVM\n\nEthereum\u2019s first mainnet foray into account abstraction was EIP-4337, which debuted at the ETHDenver conference in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt was meant to be a testbed,\u201d Ethereum developer Yoav Weiss reminded his colleagues on the call. \u201cIt allows [us] to experiment with account abstraction on different EVM chains without having to reach consensus on how account abstraction works.\u201d\n\nSince then, the improvement has yielded millions of smart contract accounts. Layer-2 networks zkSync and Starknet have even enshrined their own 4337-based native account abstraction approaches.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. These bespoke implementations caused wallet fragmentation \u2014 you can\u2019t use Starknet\u2019s Argent wallet on other chains \u2014 and potentially new attack vectors, according to Weiss.\n\nThe solution is to have a standardized and secure version that any layer-2 can use, enabling a better user experience across chains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen with or without us, so we may as well help them get it right,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nNext steps\n\nDevelopers focused on two competing EIPs that are being considered as a stepping stone towards a more comprehensive smart contract account system on Ethereum: EIP-3074 and 5806.\n\nCore developers Lightclient and Andrew Ashkhmin favored the former, while Weiss outlined some advantages of the latter.\n\nThe consensus was that more discussion is needed, but one thing is clear: Whatever option wins out for Pectra, it should keep open the path for further innovation.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure no EIPs make it hard for us to do account abstraction later, and both of these [3074 and 5806] are fine in that sense,\u201d Weiss agreed.\n\nDevelopers must weigh the need to improve Ethereum for its current users, while remaining aligned on the future trajectory of the network.\n\nAccording to Ashkmin, a software engineer with the Erigon client team, EIP-3074 is fairly EOA-specific but has \u201ca pretty natural path to extend it to be smart contract focused as well.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, said Ahmed Bitar, a core developer at Nethermind, noting that EOAs aren\u2019t going anywhere until \u201cnormal users\u201d (think: your mom) can readily deal with smart contract accounts.\n\nButerin, who doesn\u2019t make decisions but whose opinion carries weight in the Ethereum community, embraced that approach.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly why 3074 and 5806 are being discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long term, if there is an endgame where EOAs get removed as a protocol feature, that will not mean any kind of forced wallet change for users.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs are here and thriving. Is Ethereum next? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its 15th birthday, it is revelling in a long-awaited gift: a bump-up in price and newfound liquidity, thanks in no small part to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpurred by a Grayscale court victory, The SEC's early January decision to grant 11 firms license to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs ushers in a new era for the oldest and most widely accepted digital asset by offering traditional retail investors easier access and giving it more mainstream credibility.\n\nWith the price of Bitcoin jumping more than 50% in 2024 and with Ethereum (ETH) and other digital currencies climbing back to near-record highs, the question now is what's next for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs it a store of value, like gold? Is it a digital replacement to 'paper money,' or fiat currency? Is it a way to help investors diversify their investment portfolios? Or is it the framework for ledger technology that will continue to re-define how digital information is stored, encrypted and valued?\n\nIn the short term, as well, other factors are driving the price of Bitcoin, including an expected \u201chalving,\u201d which cuts in half the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work. The next halving, which happens once every four years is so, is due to occur in April.\n\nIn this segment sponsored by Grayscale, Yahoo Finance Senior Contributor Corey Goldman sat down with a who's who of Bitcoin experts, including Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andy Baehr, Matt Kohrs, host of the crypto-focused Matt Kohrs show, and TechCrunch Senior Cryptocurrency Reporter, Jacquelyn Melinek, to break it all down.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, check out Yahoo Finance Live Monday through Friday.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Corey Goldman and Luke Brooks.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Bitcoin celebrating its 15th birthday this year with the SEC giving the digital asset the gift of additional credibility by allowing retail investors to invest in the tokens via spot ETFs. Indeed, the SEC's early January decision to grant 11 firms license to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs ushers in a new era for the oldest and most widely accepted digital asset by offering traditional retail investors easier access and giving it more mainstream credibility. The question now is, what's next?\n\nTo unpack what's in store for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies I'm joined by several cryptocurrency experts, including Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andy Baehr; Matt Kohrs, host of the crypto-focused \"Matt Kohrs Show;\" and TechCrunch Senior Cryptocurrency Reporter Jacquelyn Melinek.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo some time has passed since the SEC gave license to these new spot Bitcoin ETFs. We know that. For starters, why don't we talk about why it was such a landmark decision? So maybe, Matt, you can talk about it first. You know, what do you feel really sort of pushed the ball forward in terms of this particular SEC stamp of approval?\n\nMATT KOHRS: I think from the retail side, it was more of the first opportunity that the average person now has the accessibility to protection from the government. And now with the continual debasement of the dollar, little protection from that. So I think it's exciting times that we got that regulatory clarity, very much thank you to Grayscale.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Fair enough. And, you know, Jacquelyn, I mean, what are your thoughts? What have we learned so far, do you think, in terms of the SEC's move?\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: I think this was a matter of when, not if this will happen. I've talked to Michael in the past about this. And he said this was a 10-year long process waiting for this moment. The first spot Bitcoin ETF application was filed over a decade ago. And nobody really gave up from that point to this day. And I think in a way, it brought in so much more demand than we even anticipated.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: In terms of what the investor behavior has been-- I mean, you've seen that so far, I mean, what's that taught us? What have we seen so far?\n\nANDY BAEHR: You know, cryptocurrencies are a really unique asset class in that it started from the bottom. It started from individuals and enthusiasts. And it's kind of swimming its way upstream to institutional adoption. So the ETF is the first way at least for Bitcoin for people to have conversations with advisors and advisors to put Bitcoin into their portfolios in a way which reflects their kind of primary financial planning. So it's been a tremendous success.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: All music to your ears, I'm sure.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Indeed.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: You know, I guess the question is, how much of that momentum have you been seeing? What was your-- what's your perspective?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well it is-- I really think crypto's mainstream moment, right? I think for so long, crypto had been outside of mainstream financial services. And the spot Bitcoin ETF wrapper now being in market, now having over 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in market really does weave Bitcoin firmly into the fabric of the financial services landscape. So I do think it's a very, very important moment and one that certainly my team and a lot of folks around the industry are really excited about and wanting to now capitalize on that momentum.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: I mean, in terms of, you know, where things have gone, a bit of time has passed. Have there been any unforeseen surprises?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: You know, I think if anything, a lot of folks maybe thought that it would take longer to see the advised market come online. You know, here in the US, there's about $40 trillion of advised wealth. And so starting to see our clients increasingly move towards that financial advisor audience wanting to have those conversations.\n\nIt really has kind of been two buckets. And they've come online really quickly. One is I'm really scared, and I don't know what to do about this. But my clients are asking about it. Or it's two, I'm personally excited about this. What's going to be the best way to have that conversation with clients? What's the best way to integrate it into portfolios?\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: And, Jacquelyn, what about you for your audience? You know, what are you guys focusing on? And what have you seen that's maybe not what you were expecting?\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: Yeah, I think this just adds a lot of legitimacy to the digital asset sector. I mean, having the SEC approve 11, not 1, 2, 3, 5, but 11 issuers is just like a massive move for the industry. And while there's still an uphill battle for future ETFs-- I'm sure we'll talk about that-- I think it just adds to the fact that this is getting Wall Street and crypto together and providing a bridge for the two.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Now one thing you definitely see-- and I'm going to start with you over here-- I mean, that we've seen since the SEC's approval has been the shift in the price of Bitcoin itself. So maybe you talk-- tell us a little bit about what that means. How does the price of Bitcoin, how is that affected by what the SEC has decided to approve?\n\nANDY BAEHR: For sure. And, you know, just to touch on the earlier point, the market structure around the launch of the ETFs worked immaculately well. And it was probably-- I can't imagine a more difficult 11 different ETF launches, futures markets, spot markets, 24/7 intersecting with 9:30 to 4 o'clock. And everything went off without a hitch.\n\nI think the market gained tremendous confidence that the crypto-native market structure was there to meet the demand for the ETFs and continues to do so. That's critically important considering that banks aren't really participating in this asset class yet. So I think a lot of the strength has come from the fact that the network effect is now going to include ETF holders and their advisors. And that means there's just a wider audience.\n\nSo one of the long-term drivers of the price of Bitcoin is the network, how many people need it and for what they're holding purpose is and for what they're holding duration is. There are other macroeconomic factors which we think drive the price of Bitcoin. There are technical things like the halving coming up, which some people predict will put us-- some stability or some support underneath the price.\n\nBut for the newer investors, especially those who are working with advisors who have more of a long-term view of an allocation, they really should be able to gain some confidence from the stability of the first month out.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Now, one of the things that we saw-- Jacquelyn, I'll just throw this quickly to you-- it was this by the, you know, sort of sell the fact kind of movement once the SEC made its decision or announced what it was doing. What do you attribute to that? I mean because at this point, it has recovered from what we can see. But what was going on in terms of the Bitcoin price itself? And what's next?\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: I think, you know, there's been over $40 billion already put into the Bitcoin spot ETFs across all 11 by market cap. And so as a result, I think you're going to see price go up. And similar to the comment about Bitcoin having supply and demand, constraints will exist there. And I think it's just going to be a pretty positive year for Bitcoin. There's so many points that are just signaling that the demand will continue to increase for Bitcoin, the ETFs, and just the market in general.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is arguably given the digital currency a long awaited seal of approval, though it's also created new factors to consider like volatility and, of course, regulation. Or has it?\n\nQuick question around the room here. We're going to talk a little bit more about exactly what it means. It's one thing to actually have the SEC give it seal of approval. But there's a lot of stuff that goes behind the scenes in terms of what they actually now require. So I'm going to hand that one off to you to start. What's your view? I mean, how are things shaping up there?\n\nANDY BAEHR: Market structure, as we said earlier, has been performing spectacularly well. All of the Bitcoin ETFs are tracking the price of Bitcoin quite well. A lot of people don't understand, the Bitcoin market structure that exists in the crypto-native world is extremely robust and is made up mostly of people who used to be in traditional finance.\n\nSo there are futures markets. There are options markets. There are lending and borrowing markets. I think that the market structure has proven itself clearly robust enough to support spot Bitcoin ETFs in this country as it has in other countries for many years.\n\nAlso, about volatility, Bitcoin used to be about four or five times as volatile as, say, equities. Due to a number of factors, including the growth of the network, Bitcoin actually over the summer was a little bit more volatile than equities are during a turbulent period.\n\nSo the volatility has come down quite a lot as the market has expanded. I think that we have a very good asset to underlie an ETF market that the regulators should be very pleased with.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Just a question related to that. I mean, in terms of what and when is going to be reported to the SEC because that's what they all want-- they want lots of information, you know, regular filings, all that. What are your thoughts, or what are you hearing about what people maybe have to do to prepare based on what's now been approved?\n\nMATT KOHRS: In terms of volatility, gold was volatile. A lot of the times, that's the biggest thing of like, How could this be a store of value? up until 2004 in November when we sold the gold ETF, right? Before that, it was common to have 20% drawdowns. Like, it was nothing.\n\nAnd then once again, as Wall Street actually entered in and there was more money, things settled down. And it started to act the way it was perceived to be. And I have no hesitation that Bitcoin will do the exact same thing.\n\nAnd then with the SEC in terms of regulations and paying attention, well, that kind of gets into the world of, are we talking on Wall Street or native crypto? Obviously, two very distinct veins. I myself prefer to be in control of my own Bitcoin. But I also understand how there's some hesitation that maybe don't fully understand the technological aspects that they would prefer someone to hold the Bitcoin for them, obviously, a trusted party.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: And, you know, maybe that's a great question to pass over to you, which is the focus here is on the retail investor.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Sure.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Right? So at the end of the day, how much do they need to worry about what the SEC is actually looking at versus the institutional players, everybody else behind the scenes?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, this is something that at Grayscale we've been committed to for many, many years. GBTC, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, actually became the first SEC reporting company in January of 2020. And so in many ways, the 10-Ks, the 10-Qs, the 8-Ks, all of the disclosure that we've put into those documents, that has really paved the way forward, not just for GBTC to come to market as an ETF but for all the other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers as well.\n\nAnd so we've really had a constructive dialogue with the SEC to continue to expand our disclosures, expand our reporting, and really continue to try and bridge that educational gap because crypto does move quickly. That's one of the things we've all been talking about today is really that the ecosystem continues to evolve, demonstrate its resiliency. And it's incumbent upon us as industry players to make sure that we're, you know, giving them a trusted source of information.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Fair enough. And, Jacquelyn, I mean, from your perspective again, you know, just looking at your audience, how closely do we have to watch what the SEC is going to say once that reporting starts to come through?\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: I think it's extremely important to watch what the SEC is saying and also what they're not saying. I think the delays last month with the Grayscale and BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF applications speaks volumes by itself. They don't have to say much. And also, the decision, a 3 to 2 vote to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs, was also them saying something that it was like a push/pull situation. Not everyone was on board with each other. And the conversations are still going to be an uphill battle.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: As we all know, Bitcoin is structurally different. It's different than other cryptocurrencies. The question is, you know, how has that impacted the NAV, you know, in terms of looking at some of these spot Bitcoin ETFs and even just other products in general? And how might it affect that net asset value of some other types of potential cryptocurrencies or spot ETF cryptocurrencies going forward?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think one of the most important takeaways for this audience or really anybody thinking about Bitcoin is that there are multiple use cases. And there are multiple truths around Bitcoin. I'd say the narrative that is most solidified itself on Wall Street is probably looking at Bitcoin as digital gold or a digital store of value.\n\nBut that's not to say that other investors aren't also getting very excited about the potential for Bitcoin to be a transactional mechanism to allow us to move value at the same speed that we move information. Other folks may be attracted to Bitcoin for the underlying blockchain technology and all the new use cases that we're beginning to unlock around using that distributed ledger technology to really take care of things like ownership and provenance and authenticity.\n\nAnd that's OK. It's OK for it to mean multiple things to multiple people. And I do believe over time, it will mean even more things to even a larger audience of people.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Matt, I'll throw that same question over to you.\n\nMATT KOHRS: I think from a philosophical standpoint, it's a store of value. I think from a technological standpoint, it's a protocol. But then I think from a realistic standpoint, it is the first globally accessible public money. Right now in this world, half of our population has no access to a bank.\n\nThis, obviously, with other technological developments globally allows them to not have access to a bank but allows them to be a bank. We are on the forefront of an exponential growth of what this means for the financial sector. We've seen this before historically. Money goes in the way of being the most efficient, the most usable. This is the next logical iteration that is being propelled because of the technology that we have, which is blockchain.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: And is the idea behind that-- and I'll ask you this question that-- you know, and again, some people will think of it as, OK, well, if a-- one Bitcoin is worth $50,000-- and then you have this halving coming up-- how does that work? Like, how do you actually create a whole ecosystem of a currency, a global currency, as you mentioned, around something that's very finite and static and--\n\nANDY BAEHR: Yeah, couple of--\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: --has a really high price tag?\n\nANDY BAEHR: --interesting points there. When you say a Bitcoin is worth $50,000, there's two values there. There's Bitcoin, and there's dollars, right? So the value of Bitcoin being linked to dollars might be a way to express a view on Bitcoin. It might be a way to express a view on dollars.\n\nIf you think that dollars are going to come under a tremendous amount of pressure, you're going to hop over to Bitcoin for relative safety. But it can also have a macroeconomic interpretation because what? Dollars have inflation. Dollars have an interest rate. Dollars have policy that's driven by the Federal Reserve.\n\nBitcoin has none of these things, right? Its supply is locked in. There's no policy that's going to change the amount of supply. And that can be an attractive alternative for diversification or just for certainty. So for a small allocation to portfolio, it can actually have a lot of power. Add to that its diversification properties to traditional assets. Add to that its historical right skewed distribution. And suddenly, you might be asking your advisor, can we add more Bitcoin rather than should we be adding any at all?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: And I think, Andy, the other thing that's so interesting about that is that when you look at correlations amongst different asset classes, where you are today in terms of risk/reward on equities, on fixed income, on all the different places that investors have to park cash capital, it's become so concentrated. And so investors are looking to assets like Bitcoin looking to assets like Ethereum to provide that diversification benefit to their portfolios.\n\nAnd as more and more investors do this, they look back at their portfolios. And they talk to their advisor at the end of the year. And they question, well, did I beat the S&P 500 or not? But they also now may start having to ask themselves, well, am I behind from a returns perspective because I also didn't have that incremental additive of Bitcoin or Ethereum in my portfolio?\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: So many of the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is only the beginning with many more types of digital currencies and assets starting with Ethereum, next up. In fact, Coinbase recently wrote about the SEC and the benefits of Ethereum and why a spot ETF makes sense. So what does the future investing in digital currencies and assets look like? I will throw this one over to you, Michael. What is your view?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Grayscale operates Grayscale Ethereum Trust tickery, ETHE. It's the largest Ethereum fund in the world. We have applied to the SEC to uplist ETHE to a spot Ethereum ETF. I think when we examine the crypto landscape, very similar to what we saw in Bitcoin when I was being asked these exact same types of questions, Ethereum has a very, very similar setup in the sense that there is an inextricable tie, almost 100% correlation between Ethereum derivatives, right, the Ethereum futures market and the spot Ethereum market.\n\nAnd so the fact that we now have an ecosystem of Ethereum futures-based ETFs here in the US, there really is no reason to deny the uplisting or the approval of spot Ethereum ETF to come to market as well. Certainly, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest assets by market cap within the crypto landscape. And so my belief, the Grayscale belief is that spot Ethereum ETFs are a matter of when, not a matter of if.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: I think there is maybe some discussion and debate about the when and if scenario. Maybe, Jacquelyn, I can ask you a little bit more about that and what your thoughts are.\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: Yeah, I actually interviewed SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce last month. And I asked her, of course, about the spot Ethereum ETF applications and what the timeline for that is. Of course, she declined to comment. But at the same time, she also said like when the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, it wasn't like the day of crypto dawned on the SEC. It was a big moment for the industry, yes. But that didn't mean everything was changing. There's a whole new leaf.\n\nBut at the same time, she said, we have to be prepared for when that day does come. And maybe it is a matter of when, not if. But the timeline for that is unclear. But I think the amount of demand that we've seen with the spot Bitcoin ETF will show that this is something institutions and investors want regardless if the SEC is in favor of it.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: I mean, there are differences. We know that. So I mean, it's not all going to be the same process necessarily of getting these things approved. Is that fair to say?\n\nMATT KOHRS: To my understanding-- and, obviously, the rest of the panel would love for you to weigh in-- is there a major difference with it currently being a security and not necessarily defined as a commodity when coming into the initial lawsuit that you guys had. It was Bitcoin, clearly, a digital commodity.\n\nANDY BAEHR: The market structure around Ethereum is just about as robust as Bitcoin's. In Canada, you've had Bitcoin and Ether ETF for several years now. I think that the idea-- and actually, the idea of a spot Ether ETF is great because it allows these investors and advisors to think about a completely different investment story with Ethereum as to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin being a store of value, a macro asset, having its own properties. And Ethereum really representing kind of the growth of all these projects, smart contracts, and adoption. They really kind of pair well together. And they work really well as educational tools, which in-- with two-- only two tokens show you the whole breadth of what digital assets can do.\n\nSo we can't wait for that to be the case. We feel that after that, after the two majors are available independently, people will want to move towards an index so that they can get all the next winners of the next generation.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: So, Michael, all of this really speaks to the various types of use cases, right? What about the average investor? I mean, how does an increasing roster, if you will, of cryptocurrencies, what-- how did-- how does that apply? And what do people do with that?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think for the average retail investor, what's been interesting about crypto as an asset class-- I think we were talking about this earlier-- is it actually landed in the hands of retail before it landed in the hands of institutions, which it's never really been the case as other asset classes have been developed on Wall Street. And so there have been some retail investors that have certainly gone involved in crypto, buying Bitcoin directly, or perhaps even buying shares of GBTC in their brokerage account. That's now been mainstreamed not just to retail but to advised wealth and even institutions through the onset of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat we have been hearing, though, from investors, to Andy's point, is that they want to diversify now. They understand the use case of Bitcoin. They understand the role that it plays in their portfolio. And they're not only looking at assets like Ethereum and just kind of going down the market cap list of crypto assets. But then they're starting to think about, well, what else is out there?\n\nAnd so now that Bitcoin has kind of had its mainstream moment, a lot of those questions coming in from investors as to, well, what else should I be focused on? What other areas of crypto can I help even diversify my Bitcoin holdings across?\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Right, that makes sense. And, you know-- and when you had mentioned earlier about it sort of the idea of Bitcoin being this global currency-- so you have sort of two layers there. You have one where you have one digital currency that's actually something that could be used to buy and sell stuff. And then you have another type of currency or future types of cryptocurrencies where you're going to build out investment products. So what do you think is the more, I guess, the quicker route here? Like, what do you think is going to take off first?\n\nMATT KOHRS: I think it's comparing the equivalent would be two blue chip stocks, two different addressable markets, two completely different things. One is a store of value, you-- your own bank. The other one is a completely new vision on technology itself. And I myself, if available on the market, would happily invest in both. I don't think you have to pick between the two because I think strongly that both have a bright future.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Jacquelyn, what are your thoughts?\n\nJACQUELYN MELINEK: I think there are separate groups of people in this. So there will be people who are in it for solely speculative purposes. There are people who are investing long-term. And then as Michael mentioned and Matt, that there will be people who will see the value of this and then explore beyond just buying Bitcoin. There are so many, like, use cases and sectors within this industry beyond just the token. And I think once people dive in and get a little bit of education, curiosity will grow.\n\nANDY BAEHR: Yeah, the-- that first intuition meeting, right? You can only kind of teach or provide intuition for kind of one thing at a time. And Bitcoin's a great place to start, right? So relatively simple blockchain. It's 15 years old. It hasn't changed very much. It kind of has one job.\n\nOnce people get over that and get their intuition together about how blockchain technology really works to the extent that it gives them confidence, moving into Ethereum and saying, oh, I'm going to use that same technology to build stuff on top of, I get that. And now I'm going to use that same blockchain technology to do entertainment or gaming or other kind of functions. And kind of, that's how the world changes a little bit, both in terms of finance and other things that impact. And when-- so when people say digital assets have the same potential as the internet or mobile telephones or things like that--\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: I think Andy is spot on, no pun intended, with our conversation today. It is-- you know, I think there's a lot of questions from investors as to whether or not it's too late. It's too late to start learning. It's too late to start investing in crypto just because it's had the run up that it's had.\n\nIt is still in the early early, early days of this ecosystem. And we are going to continue to see new use cases come unlocked. As the monetary base within crypto becomes larger, that is going to kick off really a flywheel that will lead to development work, new addressable markets, new users. And that's the kind of stuff that I think gets everybody on this panel really, really excited. So it's not too late. And if you're confused, no better time than the present to really start bridging that educational gap.\n\nCOREY GOLDMAN: Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale's CEO, thank you for joining us today. Andy, likewise, thank you. Matt, appreciate your time. And, of course, Jacquelyn, thank you for joining us."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Pushes Above $3k. What\u2019s Next? - Blockhead",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) hit a key price mark over the past 24 hours, climbing solidly above the $3k level. This came after significant whale movement on Ethereum, as shown by on-chain metrics from Lookonchain.\n\nThis whale accumulation hinted at strong bullish sentiment on ETH with market participants responding with an 68% uptick in Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume. This resulted in a 4.4% increase in ETH\u2019s marketcap.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s prospects for further gains look good, especially with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $56k.\n\nEthereum Still Leads the Way\n\nDespite the rise of several other altcoins, Ethereum has retained its place as the leading altcoin. This has established the blockchain\u2019s dominance in the altcoin space with Ethereum providing the base for several other blockchains.\n\nEthereum launched in 2015 with a core feature for smart contracts which has become an essential tool behind decentralized applications (dApps). This has made Ethereum the preferred blockchain of choice for developers and enterprises creating technology with real-world use cases.\n\nETH serves as the native token of Ethereum and despite the challenges with gas fees, its price action continues to serve as a reminder of the surging demand for ETH.\n\nCan ETH Reach $3.6k before February is Over?\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily price chart showed the second largest cryptocurrency has been on a bullish run since the start of February. It rose by over 43%, as the price moved from $2.2k to its current price of $3.2k.\n\nETH/USDT on Trading View (Daily Timeframe)\n\nThis swift increase in price over a 25 day period was powered by increased capital inflows to Ethereum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained above the neutral zero mark throughout February, hitting a February high of +0.33. This signified that investors and traders alike were super bullish on Ethereum.\n\nConsequently, this translated to a strong bullish trend, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index\u2019s (RSI) reading of 81.\n\nParticipants in the futures market reacted to the break of the $3k price level with a rise in ETH's Open Interest and Funding Rate. The Open Interest rose by 8% in the past day while the Funding Rate rose significantly which showed more short positions were getting liquidated than long positions.\n\nETH/USDT Open Interest - Funding Rate | Source: Coinalyze\n\nWith a clearly established trend and the break of the $3k resistance, buyers can look to ride ETH\u2019s bullish trend up to the $3.6k price zone. However, this is where buyers will need to be wary due to ETH\u2019s previous price action.\n\nThe weekly timeframe showed that the last time ETH reached the $3.6k price zone in March 2022, it led to an aggressive sell-off over a three month period that saw ETH fall from $3.6k to $900.\n\nAs such, buyers should anticipate profit taking at the $3.6k level and the possibility that selling pressure could still exist at that price zone.\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin Are Trending Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin's incredible rally to near-all-time highs is providing a rising tide lifting all boats.\n\nIt's been a wild and wacky few days in the cryptocurrency world. Megacap tokens are seeing continued volatility, with Bitcoin (BTC 0.23%), Ethereum (ETH -0.22%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 2.68%) still up materially from yesterday's close (4 p.m. ET). These three tokens rose 2.8%, 3.8%, and 12.9%, respectively, over this time frame, as of 1:45 p.m. ET.\n\nNow, these increases are markedly lower than the previous increases these tokens saw during yesterday's session. Bitcoin, largely viewed as the benchmark for the entire sector, surged to a multiyear high of more than $63,000 per token yesterday, before giving up a good chunk of these gains. Currently, Bitcoin continues to hover around the $60,500 level, still substantially higher than the $45,000 level the token started the year at and the sub-$20,000 level investors saw late last year.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving this positive price momentum among these three megacap tokens today.\n\nCapital inflows are the story to watch with these cryptos\n\nBitcoin's run toward its record price (nearly $69,000 per token in late 2021) has been remarkable. Initial interest around the world's largest cryptocurrency following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission gave way to selling pressure, due to a range of factors, including FTX's liquidation of assets in a bid to make investors whole. However, a turn of events has materialized, with capital flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs surging more than $7 billion over the past two months, as institutional investors jump on digital assets in a manner reminiscent of the previous bull market rally.\n\nInvestors banking on a supply/demand dislocation in terms of Bitcoin have been proven right, with momentum driving additional interest in leveraged products such as perpetual contracts, which traders and speculators can use to bet on short-term spikes in a token's price. Notably, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures hit the highest level since the last bull market peak in 2021. This signals there's plenty of speculative capital being put to work, in addition to the billions of dollars of institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin alone.\n\nFor even more speculative assets such as Dogecoin, these sorts of trends are very bullish, and are a key reason why we're seeing even greater moves in meme tokens. Dogecoin's price action has largely depended on broader sentiment in this sector. And with Bitcoin remaining the benchmark asset others are valued against, a rising tide appears to be lifting all boats.\n\nAdditionally, speculation around when spot Ethereum ETFs could be introduced is building. If the wave of capital hitting Bitcoin flows into Ethereum as well, investors could be due for big upside. Accordingly, the market is doing what it does best, and discounting these potential catalysts ahead of time, with Ethereum getting to multiyear highs on this sector-wide momentum as well.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nIf many investors were asked yesterday if Bitcoin were to hit an all-time high this year, the answer would likely have been a resounding yes. And given the fact that the world's largest crypto is now within 15% of its all-time high, there's certainly something to this thesis. I wouldn't be surprised if this period of consolidation we're seeing today gives way to another rally in the coming days or weeks that takes Bitcoin and its megacap counterparts near, or above, all-time highs.\n\nLong-term investors who have stuck with megacap tokens through the 2022 and 2023 bear market period have been rewarded. Now, the question is how much profit-taking will take place at current levels, and whether institutional capital flows and speculative activity can be enough to push these tokens over the top. Certainly, these are three tokens every investor needs to watch closely right now."

        "title": "Top Dogs: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Bonk Outpace Bitcoin, Ethereum Gains - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe crypto markets are sizzling, but it's the dog-themed meme coins like BONK, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu that are stealing the show, with massive gains in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experience a bullish surge, the meme coin phenomenon has grabbed some of the spotlight.\n\nIn an industry known for its volatility and unpredictability, memecoins have emerged as a unique and intriguing segment of the crypto landscape. And they can be the subject of some of the most intense volatility since their prices can be so dependent on market sentiment.\n\nInitially created as a joke or for fun, these digital assets have gained significant traction, becoming an integral part of the crypto culture alongside DeFi degens, NFT holders, Bitcoin maxis, and other subcultures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBonk (BONK): The hot thing on Solana\n\nLeading the meme coin pack is Bonk (BONK), the first dog-themed token on the Solana blockchain. In the past 24 hours, BONK has skyrocketed by 54%, climbing from $0.00001573 to its current price of $0.000024. The coin reached a daily high of $0.000025 just a few hours ago, and its meteoric rise shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nBONK's impressive performance extends beyond the short term, with a staggering 105% gain in the last seven days and a mind-boggling 3,240% increase over the past 12 months. This remarkable growth has propelled BONK to the top of the crypto charts in terms of price performance today, outperforming all of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): The original meme coin isn\u2019t done\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHot on the heels of Bonk is Dogecoin (DOGE), the OG meme coin that started it all. Over the last 24 hours, Dogecoin has surged by 33%, jumping from $0.098 to its current price of $0.13. The coin's weekly performance is equally impressive, with a 55% gain. It\u2019s up 62.7% compared to where it was a year ago according to Coingecko.\n\nDogecoin's popularity has been fueled by high-profile endorsements from celebrities and influential figures such as Elon Musk, who has frequently expressed his support for the meme coin on social media. But it should be noted that Musk is currently facing allegations of insider trading, market manipulation, and fraud over the timing of messages he sent about DOGE on X and when a wallet supposedly belonging to him bought or sold the meme coin.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): The Late Bloomer\n\nRounding out the top three meme coin performers is Shiba Inu (SHIB). In the last 24 hours, SHIB has soared by 28%, rising from $0.00001094 to its current price of $0.000014. The coin reached a daily high of $0.0000146, demonstrating the incredible volatility that has become synonymous with meme coins.\n\nSHIB's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, with a 45% gain in the last seven days. However, its 12-month performance has been relatively modest, with a 13% increase. This is largely due to the coin's underperformance in 2023, only beginning to gain traction in early 2024.\n\nThe current bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, driven by institutional appetite for Bitcoin and Ethereum, has undoubtedly contributed to the rise of meme coins. As altcoins tend to be more volatile than Bitcoin, the gains and losses experienced by memecoins are often amplified. That\u2019s why they\u2019re cherished (and sometimes hated) by risk seekers like degens.\n\nIt's important to note that meme coins are among the most volatile tokens in the crypto ecosystem. That means a coin that surges one moment can crash in mere minutes, wiping out whatever unrealized gains a trader might have. Many meme coins enjoy short-lived success, mainly because they are created as rug pulls, or because, just like memes, people lose interest shortly after they go viral.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Currently, the price hovers around the $56,000 mark. A critical observation is the lack of volatility preceding this surge, which appears to have contributed to a short squeeze, catching bearish traders off guard and propelling the price upward as they rush to cover their positions.\n\nSupport levels for Bitcoin are now pegged at $53,000 and $49,645, which align with the recent consolidation range and the 50-day moving average, respectively. These levels are crucial for Bitcoin to maintain its bullish momentum. On the resistance side, the immediate hurdle lies at $58,000, followed by the psychological and substantial barrier of $60,000.\n\nBTC/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nBitcoin's trend is bullish, with the asset trading well above its moving averages, a sign that could indicate sustained bullish pressure. The trading volume has seen a significant uptick during the rally, suggesting strong buyer interest and the possibility of continued upward movement.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin can breach the $58,000 resistance, it may well be on its way to testing the $60,000 threshold. Such a move would likely require continued institutional interest, positive developments in the cryptocurrency space and the maintenance of a favorable macroeconomic environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's lead\n\nEthereum has seen a robust upward trend, with the price currently floating around $3,225. The bullish momentum has pushed ETH well above its moving averages, and it seems that the next target will be the long-awaited $3,500 price mark. The 50-day moving average, currently near $2,650, followed by the 100-day moving average at $2,414, are key supports that have historically propelled prices higher upon retesting.\n\nAs for resistance, Ethereum is looking to challenge the $3,300 level, having recently broken past it. A sustained move above this level could open the door to $3,500, a psychological and technical barrier that may see some selling pressure. However, the strength of the current trend suggests that this resistance could be tested soon.\n\nEthereum's trend is decisively bullish, with a steep and consistent climb in price. However, the asset appears to be in overheated territory, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index, which is hovering near overbought conditions. There might also be a divergence forming, as the RSI is not confirming the new highs that the price is reaching, which could be an early sign of a potential pullback.\n\nIf the buying pressure maintains its course, Ethereum could comfortably reach and potentially surpass $3,500. This would likely be fueled by continued positive sentiment on the market, advancements in the Ethereum network and increasing adoption of its blockchain.\n\nDogecoin aims at breakthrough\n\nDogecoin is currently at a crucial point that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Currently trading at around $0.09152, DOGE has been experiencing an uptick in buying pressure, pushing it toward a key resistance level at $0.092. This level is significant not only because of the psychological round number effect but also because it has served as a strong resistance point in the past. A break above this level could signal strong bullish momentum, potentially leading to yet unseen performance highs for the token.\n\nSupport for DOGE is currently established at $0.08451, which aligns with the 50-day moving average. This moving average has historically provided support during uptrends, offering a bounce back point for prices following retracements. Further support is found at $0.08216, marked by recent lows that have been tested and held firm.\n\nThe trend for DOGE is currently bullish, with the price above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating positive sentiment among traders. The moving averages are sloping upward, suggesting that the trend has strength and may continue."

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) enjoys a period of significant growth, many investors are taking notice. Over the past year, its value has doubled, reaching a noteworthy milestone of over $3,000 on February 20, 2024. Now, experts are predicting that Ethereum could potentially reach $5,000 by the end of this year, 2024. With the market buzzing and investors eager to seize opportunities, you might be wondering: What will happen to your investment if you buy Ethereum now, and what kind of returns can you expect if it reaches $5,000? Let\u2019s delve into this exciting scenario.,\n\nEthereum (ETH) Market Performance\n\nAs of February 28, 2024, Ethereum holds a value of $3,256.38, alongside a robust 24-hour trading volume of $21.6 billion, representing a slight decrease of $21.67 within the past 24 hours. Despite this minor setback, Ethereum has seen a 1% price increase over the same period. Retaining its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum boasts a live market capitalization of $390.93 billion, with a circulating supply of 120.15 million ETH according to CoinMarketCap. This demonstrates its significant presence in the digital asset landscape.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlthough Ethereum reached its peak of $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021, it has since experienced a decline of 33.41% compared to its current price. However, recent trends offer promise, with Ethereum witnessing a notable increase of 9.25% over the last 7 days and an impressive surge of 100% over the past year.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Market Performance chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price surge is driven by various factors. The anticipation of a spot Ether ETF approval by the SEC, with a 45% likelihood by May 31, has fueled market optimism. The upcoming Dencun upgrade on March 13, introducing EIP-4844 for improved efficiency and scalability, is also a contributing factor. Open Interest in Ethereum futures has reached a record-breaking $11.32 billion, reflecting increased market activity and investor interest. Whale activity, particularly large ETH purchases, suggests confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAdditionally, the surge in Ethereum restaking protocols, highlighted by EigenLayer\u2019s $100 million funding and TVL increase, signals bullish momentum. Successful airdrops like Starknet (STRK) and Blast\u2019s upcoming token launch further boost investor confidence in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nWhat Will Be My Portfolio if Ethereum (ETH) Price Touches $5,000?\n\nImagine you\u2019ve set aside $300, ready to dip your toes into the world of cryptocurrency. Ethereum gets your attention, priced at $3,256.38 per coin. Now, let\u2019s fast forward to a scenario where Ethereum\u2019s value climbs to $5000. What could this journey look like for your investment?\n\nStarting with your initial $300, you\u2019d acquire approximately 0.092 ETH at Ethereum\u2019s current price. If Ethereum reaches $5000, your investment would appreciate to $460. That\u2019s a respectable profit of $160, translating to a solid Return on Investment (ROI) of around 53.33%.\n\nNow, what if you decide to scale up your investment? Doubling your initial stake to $1000, you\u2019d secure roughly 0.307 ETH. If Ethereum hits $5000, your investment would grow to $1,535, resulting in a profit of $535 and an ROI of approximately 53.50%.\n\nAnd for those willing to commit $2000, you\u2019d acquire about 0.614 ETH. Should Ethereum reach $5000, your investment would soar to $3,070, netting a profit of $1070, again with an ROI of 53.50%.\n\nWhether you\u2019re starting small with $300 or venturing into larger sums, Ethereum presents an intriguing investment opportunity. So, as you weigh your options, remember: that Ethereum\u2019s potential could offer a compelling path forward in the world of digital assets.\n\nEthereum Forecast : Will Ethereum (ETH) Hit $5,000?\n\nEthereum price is showing strong performance, currently hovering around $3,256. The steady price rise has surpassed its usual levels, with analysts suggesting a potential climb to $3,500 soon. Ethereum is now eyeing the $3,300 resistance level, recently breaking through it. If the price manages to surpass $3,500, it could face some selling pressure as this marks a significant psychological and technical barrier. The current bullish trend in Ethereum\u2019s price is evident, with a consistent rise of around 1% in the past day.\n\nLooking ahead, some analysts predict that by the end of 2024, Ethereum could touch $5,000. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes recently divested his Solana holdings in favor of Ethereum, foreseeing a surge that could propel the cryptocurrency to $5,000.\n\nThis optimism is further fueled by upcoming events such as the Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the SEC, both of which are expected to bolster ETH\u2019s value. Additionally, the Bitcoin Halving scheduled for April 2024 could also contribute to Ethereum\u2019s growth trajectory. If Ethereum maintains its current momentum, it has the potential to surpass its previous all-time high."

The recent trading sessions have witnessed a commendable performance by XRP, which has successfully breached several local resistances, positioning itself for a potential upward trajectory.\n\nAnalyzing the price dynamics, we observe a robust volume spike, which is indicative of strong buyer interest and may signal the start of a sustained bullish trend. This is a vital factor as volume often validates price movement, giving credence to the breakthrough and setting the stage for the next leg up.\n\nXRP's current trend shows it maneuvering above the crucial moving averages, a bullish indicator that suggests the asset has ample support for its ascent.

A decisive close above this level could pave the way for an extended rally toward higher resistance zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, if XRP faces rejection at this level, it might retreat to test the fortitude of its newfound support levels, potentially around the $0.55 to $0.53 range, where the confluence of moving averages may offer a buffer against a deeper pullback.\n\nCardano on verge of bull market\n\nCardano's native token, ADA, is showing signs of a strong bullish trend as it approaches a significant resistance level at $0.68. This move is particularly noteworthy as it positions ADA to potentially surpass the highest price point it has achieved in 2024. The trading community is attentively monitoring ADA's performance for a decisive break that could establish new benchmarks for the year.\n\nA detailed price analysis reveals that ADA has been consistently forming higher lows, which is indicative of accumulating strength and buying pressure. The recent uptrend has been supported by increasing volume, suggesting that the bullish sentiment is backed by active market participation. The $0.68 level is critical; a convincing move above this price could trigger further buying as it would confirm a breakout from the recent consolidation pattern.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ADA has sustained itself above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which traditionally act as dynamic support levels. The convergence of these averages provides a strong base for the token, making the path toward the $0.68 resistance more attainable. A successful break above this threshold could open the door to testing previous yearly highs and, potentially, the all-time high (ATH).\n\nLooking at the current trend, the next major resistance after $0.68 is anticipated to be in the region of $0.75 to $0.80, where ADA may encounter a tougher barrier due to historical price actions. On the support side, the key levels to watch are $0.61 and $0.55, which have previously acted as both support and resistance.\n\nSolana's failed battle\n\nSolana has been a strong contender with its high-speed and low-cost transactions. However, recent market developments have seen Ethereum reclaiming its dominance, overshadowing the advancements of its competitors.\n\nA comparative price analysis shows that while Ethereum has been gaining in both market cap and price, Solana has been lagging behind. The SOL token is struggling to keep up, as evidenced by its performance on the price charts. After a period of consolidation, Solana is now grappling with resistance levels that were once strong supports, particularly around the $108 mark.\n\nAs of the latest trends, SOL is trading in a channel, with its immediate resistance near $120. The key support to watch is at $100, a psychological level that may dictate Solana's short-term price direction. Should this level fail, the next support is at the $89 zone, marked by previous price interactions."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGaming token and cross-chain platform Portal made its long-awaited debut early Thursday, rewarding airdrop farmers and Binance token stakers ahead of launching staking rewards and rolling out other features.\n\nPORTAL, minted on Ethereum, is currently priced at $2.54 per token according to data from CoinGecko, with just over 167 million tokens currently on the market\u2014nearly 17% of the total supply of 1 billion tokens. That puts the market cap at about $425 million as of this writing.\n\nNewly launched tokens are famously volatile, and PORTAL is down significantly from the initial price of $3.36 upon listing with crypto exchange Binance. That 24% dip in less than 10 hours is sizable but also typical for new, heavily traded crypto tokens. Nearly $500 million worth of PORTAL has already been traded.\n\nNot only is the Portal token now available to trade, but crypto users who participated in the project\u2019s airdrop farming campaign on Twitter late last year can also claim their share of the initial airdrop. While some users on social media have griped about claiming issues and regional restrictions, others have shared that they received thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of the gaming token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther users sharing in the launch day buzz include Binance customers who staked tokens in reward pools to earn a share of 50 million PORTAL tokens allotted for the crypto exchange\u2019s Launchpool campaign. More than $9 billion worth of crypto was staked at Wednesday\u2019s peak, setting a new record for Binance\u2019s launch platform.\n\nWhat is Portal? It\u2019s billed as a cross-chain platform that serves as a central hub for crypto and NFT games across multiple networks, giving gamers one place to access games, transact funds, interact with their owned assets, and more. It\u2019s set to support games on Solana and Ethereum scaling network Polygon, among others.\n\nThe team behind Portal includes employees from the crypto startup SuperDuper\u2014which is behind the Creepz NFT project on Ethereum\u2014as well as video game industry veterans from Rockstar Games and Electronic Arts. Prominent Hollywood agency WME is representing the project.\n\n$PORTAL staking coming soon! Stake for access to the Portal Launchpad.

It will also launch nodes that users can presumably purchase to help support the network in exchange for incentives, akin to what the Xai gaming network on Ethereum scaler Arbitrum has done.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The Ethereum network underwent a dramatic transition from the proof-of-work mining model to the proof-of-stake model on September 15, 2022. With an astounding 99.95% decrease in energy use, this much-anticipated change has ushered in a new era of sustainability and environmental friendliness in the blockchain sector.\n\nHowever, the second-largest cryptocurrency plummeted in 2022 following the FTX collapse, reaching a low of around $1,142 on Nov. 22, 2022. Nonetheless, ETH\u2019s price has made significant gains in 2024.\n\nIf you had invested $1000 in Ethereum every month since November 2022, you would have purchased $16,000 worth of ETH till now. However, the portfolio\u2019s value would have surged to $31,024.33, a spike of 93.90%. In other words, your initial investment would have almost doubled in 15 months.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Surges 31%: Can DOGE Reach $1 in 2024?\n\nCan Ethereum hit $4,000?\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price is able to surge and sustain support around the $3,800 area in the coming weeks, some analysts estimate the next likely upside target could be around $6,835 based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. This would represent the next key price milestone if the current bullish momentum is maintained. However, prices could also consolidate or correct before any potential further upside.\n\nOf course, if existing market conditions deteriorate again, Ethereum may see a downside. However, indicators presently favor the ongoing bullish structure persisting through February.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: 3 Coins To Watch As Bitcoin Eyes $60,000\n\nEthereum is up by 15% in the last seven days and 51% in the last 30 days. In the last 24 hours, ETH has spiked by almost 5%.\n\nSo, with ETH firmly back in recovery mode, early technical clues support the growing narrative of history repeating itself this cycle. With a major upgrade coming and the anticipation of the ETH ETF, Ethereum is poised for further growth."

        "title": "What Is EigenLayer? A Guide to the Decentralized ETH Restaking Protocol - Unchained",
        "content": "EigenLayer is an Ethereum-based protocol that uses a restaking mechanism to allow ETH stakers to reallocate their staked tokens to bolster security for other protocols built on the network.\n\nAn important part of the growth of Web3 is the development of innovative solutions that drive down the cost of building dApps without compromising security. EigenLayer is a marketplace that offers developers on the Ethereum network access to a marketplace of Ethereum stakers ready to provide validation services at significantly low costs.\n\nRead on to learn about EigenLayer, how it works, and its benefits and risks.\n\nWhat Is EigenLayer?\n\nEigenLayer is an Ethereum-based protocol that uses a restaking mechanism to allow ETH stakers to reallocate their staked ETH and Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to bolster security for other protocols.\n\nStakers on EigenLayer earn extra restaking rewards for their efforts, while the protocols enjoy access to an already-built validator set.\n\nEigenLayer commoditizes decentralized trust by allowing protocols to leverage Ethereum\u2019s highly secure trust network, driving down the cost of kickstarting protocols since they don\u2019t have to spend on reward incentives to create a validator set.\n\nHow Does EigenLayer Work?\n\nEigenLayer enables users to repurpose their staked ETH to extend Ethereum\u2019s security to other dApps built on the network.\n\nUsers can opt into EigenLayer and agree to grant additional enforcement rights on their staked ETH. The opt-in feature creates additional slashing conditions to meet the conditions of projects, such as data availability layers and bridges. The slashing conditions enforce honesty among the participants and ensure the security of the dApps utilizing EigenLayer is upheld.\n\nEigenLayer operates as a marketplace where developers get to incentivize validators to allocate their restaked ETH to secure their protocols. Alternatively, dApp would have to create a native token for the validators\u2019 reward incentives and bootstrap their own trust network from scratch.\n\nWith Eigenlayer, developers can make it attractive for validators to choose their projects through attractive yields. The financial and time resources involved here are significantly lower than those involved in creating an entirely new trust network.\n\nTypes of Staking on EigenLayer\n\nUsers can choose between two staking options on EigenLayer: native staking and liquid restaking. Let\u2019s take a look below.\n\nNative Restaking\n\nNative restaking involves having the Ethereum validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to the EigenPod, which is the protocol\u2019s smart contract. Users must operate an Ethereum Validator node to participate in native staking.\n\nLiquid Restaking\n\nUsers can also choose to restake by locking their liquid staking tokens, LSTs, into EigenLayer smart contracts. The validator takes their LSTs already staked on protocols, such as Rocket Pool and Lido, and restake them on EigenLayer.\n\nBenefits & Risks of EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer presents both benefits and risks.\n\nBenefits\n\nAdditional rewards for stakers: Restaking allows stakers to earn rewards from multiple protocols.\n\nTrust aggregation: The large capital pool improves the trust model by reducing the chances of and increasing the protocol\u2019s corruption cost should a 51% attack occur.\n\nReduced capital costs: On the validators\u2019 side, reusing capital across multiple services amortizes its cost. On the developers\u2019 side, EigenLayer solves the bootstrapping problem by offering a large validator set at a comparatively lower cost (both financially and in terms of time) than building the set from scratch.\n\nSimplified network security: Restaking on EigenLayer presents flexibility to the Ethereum ecosystem, where projects can easily access and utilize the network\u2019s security. Small projects no longer need large capital outlays to develop security systems as they can rely on Ethereum\u2019s. An increase in the number of projects on Ethereum due to the lower entry barrier increases adoption and leads to further decentralization.\n\nRisks\n\nYield risk: The open marketplace may lead stakers to opt for the protocols offering the highest yields. This may lead to competition between projects to adjust their yields to attract stakers, leading to limited or no demand for projects that offer lower yields.\n\nCentralization: EigenLayer\u2019s promise of increased yields may lead to ETH stakers redirecting their withdrawal credentials to the protocol. This risks the Ethereum network if bad actors identify and exploit EigenLayer\u2019s potential vulnerabilities.\n\nSlashing: A staker agrees to the potential slashing of up to 50% of their staked ETH. Additionally, they have to comply with the protocol\u2019s conditions. If the rules determine they exhibited malicious behavior, they stand to lose the remaining 50%.\n\nThe (S)Takeaway\n\nEigenLayer holds significant promise in benefiting multiple parties, especially developers looking to focus on their dApp\u2019s features and trusting EigenLayer to provide validator sets. This can potentially lower the entry barrier and see more decentralized protocols built on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, EigenLayer also comes with a set of risks, including yield risk, centralization, and the potential for stake slashing. How the protocol will address those challenges will significantly impact its future."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is laying out the potential upside for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nIn a new YouTube video, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers notes to his 478,000 subscribers that Solana hit 20% of Ethereum\u2019s market cap in December but has been outperformed by the second-largest crypto asset in the months since then.\n\nThe InvestAnswers host says that if Solana returns to that 20% level, that would mean a SOL price of around $171, based on what ETH\u2019s currently trading for.\n\n\u201cIf we go to one-third of the market cap of Ethereum, that\u2019s $277. If we go to half of Ethereum, that\u2019s $421, and if we go to 70% of Ethereum \u2013 $585. A lot of people talk about it becoming parity, but I\u2019m not going to go there, because ETH is still a big machine, a big monster. And remember, we\u2019ve been at some of these levels before in the past, and we can probably go to them again.\n\nBut the other good news is, as the value of Ethereum rises, technically Solana will rise too. But there\u2019s a lag in between \u2014 so the future\u2019s very bright.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $108.62 at time of writing.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum Tag New 2024 Highs But These 3 Altcoin Gems Could Hit $1000 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bitcoin price continued with its bullish streak closing February with a 45% increase from the monthly open. The largest crypto ascended to $64,000 before high volatility caused a sharp but brief sell-off to $60,000. Ethereum also doubled down on its bullish efforts, rising above $3,500. As the largest cryptos breakout, investors may want to consider 3 altcoin gems could hit $1000 in 2024, including Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bittensor (TAO).\n\nAs the Bitcoin halving approaches, a pivotal moment anticipated to kickstart a new bull market in April 2024, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are looking for lucrative alternatives. BNB, BCH, and TAO are three such altcoins expected to soar to $1,000 before the halving, presenting themselves as attractive investment avenues in the lead-up to this crucial event.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin (BNB), the proprietary token of the Binance ecosystem, operates on both the Binance Chain (BEP-2) and the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), serving as the cornerstone of these platforms. Its dominance stems from the substantial trading volumes seen on Binance, coupled with its crucial role across the exchange\u2019s dual blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNotably, the BNB Chain stands out as the primary blockchain, facilitating a wide array of decentralized applications that rank among the top in the market.\n\nRecently, Coinbase made headlines by broadening the scope of its asset recovery tool to encompass the BNB Chain and Polygon networks. This development has notably contributed to a bullish Bitcoin market value trend.\n\nAs of the latest updates, BNB has successfully breached the $400 resistance barrier, showcasing a commendable performance. Currently, the token is priced at $414, reflecting an impressive increase exceeding 4% in its market value.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH), designed to function as a peer-to-peer digital currency, envisions itself as a robust global currency facilitating swift transactions, nominal fees, enhanced privacy, and expanded block sizes. Born as an alternative to Bitcoin, the original and most esteemed cryptocurrency, BCH has climbed its way into the top 20 digital currencies, solidifying its position as a leading Bitcoin fork.\n\nThe value of BCH has recently broken through the $300 resistance mark, signaling a strong bullish trend. Presently, BNB stands at $303, exhibiting a growth of 1.29% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 16.88% over the last week, cumulating a monthly increase of 24%. Predictions suggest BCH could soar to the $1000 milestone as the Bitcoin halving event approaches.\n\nBittensor (TAO)\n\nBittensor (TAO), an innovative open-source protocol, underpins a decentralized network for machine learning on the blockchain. This network enables collaborative training of machine learning models, rewarding them with TAO tokens based on their contribution\u2019s informational value.\n\nThe overarching aim of Bittensor is to establish a genuine marketplace for artificial intelligence, where both creators and consumers of AI can engage freely, supported by a trustless, transparent, and open framework.\n\nRecent trends on the price chart indicate a consistent upward trajectory, marked by successive higher highs and lows. Bittensor has broken through the upper edge of its ascending channel, hinting at a potential resistance challenge. At the time of writing, the price of Bittensor surged past the $600 mark, now trading at $616, signaling robust bullish momentum.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the impending Bitcoin halving catalyzes market movements, historically marking the onset of a bull market. Investors are diversifying their portfolios with promising altcoins like BNB, BCH, and TAO, all poised for significant gains, potentially reaching $1,000 before the halving event in April 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Bull Run Price Predictions: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Nugget Rush (NUGX) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum breaks $3,100, driven by ETF hype.\n\nSolana and Nugget Rush show bullish momentum.\n\nNUGX\u2019s play-to-earn model and NFT integration attract investors, while SOL may hit $195.\n\nFor the first time since April 2022, one of the top-ranking altcoins, Ethereum (ETH), has pushed above the $3,100 level. This rally represents a monthly growth of over 38% for the token. There are speculations that the hype surrounding a potential approval of Ethereum spot ETF in the US triggered Ethereum\u2019s rally, especially as giant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) didn\u2019t pick up on any bullish run. With ETH targeting ATH, investors are excited about the highs it\u2019ll hit soon.\n\nThis excitement has triggered bullish expectations for other cryptos like Solana (SOL) and Nugget Rush (NUGX). SOL and NUGX have been bullish since last year, earning them the potential to deliver explosive prices with time. While Solana maintains its innovation, investors have been so excited about Nugget Rush\u2019s upcoming launch after it finished its trending presale. These stellar performances of both altcoins have sparked predictions of a bullish price run for the year.\n\nLet\u2019s explore price predictions for Ethereum, Solana, and Nugget Rush.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNugget Rush\u2019s (NUGX) Early Stage Performance Foreshadows Incoming Long-term Uptrend\n\nThe play-to-earn gaming masterpiece Nugget Rush recently announced that its NUGX meme token will debut on top-tier exchanges after its ongoing presale event ends. The announcement has triggered positive sentiment for NUGX\u2019s price potential, which will be revealed during the upcoming exchange listings. But investors are already wondering if Nugget Rush could be the best crypto to invest in compared to giants like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNUGX\u2019s price performance shows a lot of bullish momentum that isn\u2019t showing signs of slowing down soon. When the token was listed for its presale, investors bought in at $0.010 in preparation for its launch. With subsequent presale stages, NUGX is sold at $0.018. During this surge, early investors could pocket considerable gains regardless of the stage they got in at. Although investors who bought at $0.010 are up 80%, holders who got in before the fifth presale round have pocketed over 20% of profits.\n\nInvestors are excited for the token to rally to $0.020 before listing on exchanges. The excitement has led to an impressive presale of over 200 million tokens, showcasing high demand for NUGX. The presence of large investors has also helped Nugget Rush raise a milestone sum of over $2.5 million, which will quicken its rise to rank among the top DeFi projects.\n\nNugget Rush\u2019s mix of play-to-earn gaming, NFTs, and staking benefits positions the platform for quick adoption. Players can mine in-game assets to be exchanged for real value. Nugget Rush\u2019s character-based NFTs can be traded for tangible value, while its rare RUSHGEM collection can fetch holders real gold, showcasing their high-value potential. By having these NFTs baked into the gaming experience, Nugget Rush is set to experience an explosive bull run, making it the best crypto to invest in for 2024.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Push To Peak Prices Set Stage For Meteoric Surge\n\nThe price of ETH went through the roof lately, hitting a two-year high of $3,100. This surge shocked investors when top DeFi projects like Cardano (ADA) delivered little to no bullish momentum. Being the second-largest market cap cryptocurrency, Ethereum has achieved an impressive reputation as the best DeFi ecosystem. With the token\u2019s price targeting new highs, analysts are confident that Ethereum could revisit its all-time highs.\n\nUpcoming impact events like the Dencun upgrade and the Bitcoin halving could push ETH higher. This surge above $3,100 shows that the hype surrounding agitations for an Ethereum ETF is already affecting the ETH. If approval for an Ethereum-based ETF falls through, ETH is expected to deliver new all-time highs as adoption skyrockets. Ethereum is already raking in the dividends of its transition from proof-of-stake to proof-of-work. If ETH continues on this path, it could hit $5,000 by the end of the year.\n\nSolana\u2019s (SOL) Impressive 2024 Start Signals Potential Bullish Run\n\nThis year has been one of Solana\u2018s most expansive years. The platform\u2019s popularity has heightened compared to last year, when it delivered over 1,000% growth. Since this year started, Solana has been on the front page of every positive crypto news, thanks to its affiliations with trending meme coins and airdrops from top exchanges. Solana\u2019s reach has helped it stabilize despite its bearish correction at the beginning of February.\n\nAlthough the token surge has slowed compared to last year, investors are confident that SOL could rally higher, following the momentum that the Bitcoin halving will introduce into the market. In addition to an already bullish path, Solana-based memecoins have been gaining pace for a while. Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) have been hinting at an incoming bull run that would reflect on SOL. According to experts, SOL might hit $195 by the end of the first half of this year.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nNow that events surrounding ETH are pointing towards bullish prices, Solana and Nugget Rush are following suit. Solana is set to skyrocket, according to her recent performance. Despite being in its early stages of development, NUGX has been pumping for months courtesy of its mouthwatering offerings. Not only has the coin set record impressive growth, but its momentum has stayed solid. NUGX\u2019s exchange listing could deliver life-changing returns to investors, as they\u2019re known to pump the prices of tokens to new ATH. These benefits are what make Nugget Rush the best memecoin to buy now.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\n*This article was paid for. Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position, Solana has likewise been a major player in crypto. Its surging price and rising profile since March 2020 has been instrumental in the popularity and acceptance of DeFi.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s utility and acceptance have also increased outside crypto circles, with institutions creating partnerships with the cryptocurrency market. These institutions hope to tap into the financial potentials of the crypto market in other spheres, and thus coins like BTC and SOL are often at the forefront of institutional collaborations and adoptions.\n\nIn a recent turn of events, however, market statistics have revealed that ETH is now the largest single asset owned by institutions. This is, however, not the same for retail investors who seem to favor memecoins like Galaxy Fox over popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin/Solana institutional tussle\n\nSolana has, since its launch in March 2020, created a niche for itself as a firm competitor of the popular Ethereum network. The token was built on the decentralized nature of the crypto market to create DeFi.\n\nSeeing its increasing utility, investors have pushed SOL from $0.9511 in 2020 to over $110 in 2024. The token\u2019s growth over the years can be attributed to its role as a blockchain network for DeFi projects.\n\nIn January 2024, SOL was in the news for the announcement of the launch of Jupiter\u2019s JUP token.\n\nThe token\u2019s price surged because investors were confident that the new product was going to be on par with other DeFi projects.\n\nYou might also like: ARK Invest, 21Shares partner with Chainlink on Bitcoin ETF transparency\n\nSince February, however, it appears that investor confidence in SOL has stalled, as the price has been going sideways. Market statistics have revealed that the token\u2019s single-digit institutional ownership may be linked to the network\u2019s major price dips over the years.\n\nCrypto investors have shown more confidence in BTC. Despite market sentiments that Bitcoin will experience major sell-offs after an all-time high of $70,000, more investors continue to flock to BTC.\n\nMarket data has shown that institutional interest in Bitcoin is beyond speculation as the cryptocurrency is a tangible asset in 2024.\n\nApart from institutional interest in the pursuit of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutions are actively entering the cryptocurrency space to partake of its innovative benefits.\n\n\n\nExploring Ethereum\n\nMarket reports have hinted at a shift in institutional sentiment towards ETH.\n\nMany analysts have linked this turn of events to the upcoming Dencun upgrade scheduled to take place in March, 2024.\n\nSome other analysts have suggested that the recent institutional hype around ETH may be due to its switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis has reduced ETH\u2019s supply, increased staking activity, and is predicted to increase demand and subsequent price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nYou might also like: Lido Staked Ether takes over XRP in market cap as Ethereum reached $3.2k\n\nWhile Solana has done pretty well in the DeFi ecosystem, the layer-2 networks built on Ethereum give the coin an edge.\n\nSome analysts have reported that institutional interest in ETH is not a general market sentiment. According to these analysts, retail investors are more diverse in their holdings and have a preference for meme coins like GFOX.\n\nLooking at alternatives: GFOX\n\nGalaxy Fox has raised over $3.6 million in the ongoing presale.\n\nThe project is a blend of meme culture and play-to-earn (P2E) features. Its performance can be attributed to its utility and community support across various social platforms.\n\nYou might also like: Ronin rallies by over 50%, Galaxy Fox presale approaching $4m\n\nGalaxy Fox has shown great potential to change P2E gaming as we know it, with token rewards for skilled players.\n\nThe token is currently used across the Galaxy Fox platform as a legal tender for transactions.\n\nAside from its utility, GFOX affords gamers the opportunity to acquire boosters and NFTs as passive income for staking the tokens.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nMarket statistics have revealed that institutions that joined the crypto market because of its utility in the first place are now shifting their focus from Bitcoin and Solana to Ethereum.\n\nThis can be attributed to the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, its recent deflationary supply, and its growing influence in the DeFi space.\n\nWhile ETH is attracting institutions, retail investors are leaning toward memecoins like GFOX.\n\nWith Galaxy Fox\u2019s P2E features, strong community, and growing utility, the token is emerging as a contender in the crypto space. GFOX is available for 0.0028."

        "content": "In a post on X, one analyst observes that the altcoin market capitalization has broken from the Wyckoff accumulation phase. With this upswing, the trader expects altcoin prices to move higher.\n\nThis refreshing breakout coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) stellar performance when writing on February 28. At spot rates, the coin is trading above $60,000, a psychological round number- now supported- and is closely approaching $70,000.\n\nThe Altcoin Breakout From Accumulation\n\nThe \u201cWyckoff accumulation pattern\u201d is a concept developed by technical analysts to pick out potential buying opportunities, in this case, altcoins. Whenever prices are in this phase, it is widely believed that the so-called \u201csmart money\u201d or large institutional players are accumulating at low prices.\n\nCurrently, prices consolidate at tight ranges and with low trading volumes. A signal marking the end of this accumulation is a sharp breakout, lifting prices above the defined range. Often, this upswing is with rising trading volume.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Price Primed To Hit $3.5K After Bitcoin Rallies Past $60K 7 months ago\n\nLooking at the chart, the altcoin market cap has broken above the accumulation phase. With previous resistance and support, the altcoin market cap will likely continue floating higher. As such, top altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, will follow suit, posting fresh 2024 highs.\n\nWhy Spot Bitcoin ETFs Give BTC Edge In This Bull Run\n\nSo far, Bitcoin is leading the way, posting over $10,000 in less than a week. However, with the coin trading above $60,000, its demand-side drivers differ entirely from what\u2019s influencing altcoins. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen billions of dollars flow to the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nTherefore, while altcoins have historically outperformed BTC when crypto prices rally, there is an edge with spot Bitcoin ETFs. As such, this bull run will likely differ from 2017 and 2021. This forecast is because institutions will likely favor a regulated asset over altcoins whose status remains undefined.\n\nAs of late February 2024, the United States SEC has not approved spot ETFs of any altcoin, including that of Ethereum. Additionally, the agency has labeled several top altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), unregistered securities. The agency even filed lawsuits against major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of facilitating the trading of what the commission described as \u201cunregistered securities.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCEO Of German VC Firm Predicts XRP To Become \u2018World Reserve Bridge Currency\u2019 7 months ago\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether the United States SEC will change their preview of leading altcoins, especially Ethereum (ETH), which has a market of over $400 billion. Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity remain interested in launching spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nFeature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView"
