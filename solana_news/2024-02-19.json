        "title": "Selling Ethereum in 2024: is now the right time? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts and far-reaching dApps. If you wish to trade in ETH, you need to analyze the project\u2019s performance, trends, upgrades and updates, and basically any other aspect that could impact its price. This will help you determine the right time to sell or buy ETH. Depending on these factors, you may then decide to hold onto your ETH or convert ETH to USD.\n\nHere, we examine Ethereum in more detail to help you determine whether now is the perfect time to sell your ETH.\n\nWhat Is Unique about Ethereum\u2019s Technology?\n\nThe Ethereum network is an open-source protocol that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It supports an immense ecosystem of decentralized apps as a pioneer of blockchain smart contracts. Since its inception, Ethereum has been a pacesetter in digital trends such as NFTs, GameFi, Web3, Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThanks to the network\u2019s vast applications, serious concerns have emerged regarding its massive energy consumption, high transaction costs, and scalability. Some investors are already considering selling ETH in preference to its competitors \u2014 Solana, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano. You can read more about some of these crypto projects on the Paybis blog.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Updates and Upgrades\n\nEthereum 2.0 reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed from 30 TPS to 100,000 TPS. The goal is to ensure ETH is more usable with increased adoption to grow and stabilize its price.\n\nThe upgrade also saw Ethereum move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This migration helped the network to reduce its carbon footprint by over 90%.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been long in the pipeline. It started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, and ever since, we\u2019ve witnessed the Berlin and London upgrades.\n\nOther notable upgrades that followed included Arrow Glacier, Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris. The last three were collectively referred to as \u2018The Merge.\u2019\n\nIn 2023, the Uniswap V4, a new smart contract protocol, was launched. However, Ethereum\u2019s developers also recently rolled out the Shanghai upgrade that would allow ETH validators to unlock staked ETH, making rewards accessible.\n\nHow Has Ethereum Performed in Previous Years?\n\nLooking back at Ethereum\u2019s ICO, we see how affordable the coin was at just $0.31. Up until 2016, the price averaged less than $1. ETH skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1,270 in 2018 but the real bull run came in 2021 when it hit an unprecedented $4,891.\n\nSince then, the crypto market has experienced a bearish market, which saw most crypto projects shed a lot of their value. The crypto asset plunged to $890 on June 18, 2022, but has recovered well to register a 130% price gain from its current price. However, it\u2019s important to note that it still grapples with a 58% decrease from its ATH.\n\nNavigating through the highs and lows, Ethereum faced heightened volatility throughout 2023. Towards the end of October, the entire crypto market received a significant boost fueled by the anticipation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. This optimism propelled the price of ETH upward, breaching the $2,000 mark on November 9th for the first time since July.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum?\n\nLooking at expertly derived technical charts for Ethereum, there\u2019s a strong indication that the price will pull through the $2,300 resistance point.\n\nOnce Ethereum 2.0 updates and upgrades start fully rolling out, experts have forecast ETH to hit $2,700 in 2024 and $3,000 by 2025.\n\nSeasoned analysts and market veterans exhibit a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum, maintaining an optimistic outlook on its future price trajectory. Some even project that Ethereum could reach an impressive $40,000 by 2030. These forward-looking expectations underscore the confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for substantial growth and sustained value over the coming decade.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransformative Ethereum 2.0 updates are poised to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and sustainability. With the current ETH price at $2,500 and a market cap of more than $300 billion, the crypto market continues to showcase Ethereum\u2019s resilience.\n\nAs the crypto landscape evolves, staying informed and adaptable is crucial when considering selling ETH. Consider diversifying your portfolio away from Ethereum, you can exchange ETH for up-and-coming competitors such as Solana, Polkadot, Binance, or the more established Bitcoin."

        "title": "Commodity or Security? No One Knows When it Comes to Ethereum (ETH) - Securities.io",
        "content": "If Bitcoin is the most representative asset of the crypto world, Ethereum has helped the principle of decentralization find its footing in the blockchain world and beyond. Ethereum-powered smart contracts have helped build applications that have eventually led on-chain transactions and communication to become intermediary-free in a trustless and secure fashion.\n\nFrom encouraging a fairer financial system to tokenizing real-life assets and empowering us with an open internet \u2013 free from monopolizing entities controlling user data \u2013 Ethereum has been at the forefront of making the blockchain-powered world a more democratic, equitable, and innovative space. It is no wonder that Ethereum occupies close to one-fifth of the crypto world's market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite being one of the most catalyzing assets, Ethereum has been finding itself in regulatory limbo for quite some time now.\n\nClick here to learn what Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) means.\n\nGary Gensler's Interview and the Uncertainty around ETH's status\n\nThe current US President, Joseph R. Biden, nominated Gary Gensler as Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2021.\n\nIn an interview given on Monday, June 27, 2022, Gensler characterized Bitcoin as a commodity but \u201crefused to lump Ethereum's Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, under the same label.\u201d This reluctance to characterize Ethereum led to confusion regarding whether Ethereum was a commodity or security.\n\nIf it were a security, any sale and purchase with its use would count as capital gain, requiring it to be reported to the IRS, essentially making it unusable for small purchases.\n\nMore importantly, Ethereum's security status would put it under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission and all the restrictions that SEC regulations bring.\n\nWhile this mist of uncertainty and confusion surrounding Ethereum could be far-reaching in its impact since many crypto and blockchain projects are dependent upon it, we shall discuss some of the most crucial concerns that have arisen of late.\n\nETF applications: Will SEC Approve?\n\nWith as many as 11 Bitcoin ETFs recently getting approval, speculations are rife about whether Ether ETFs experience the same outcome. When asked about this, the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, did not disclose anything decisive. According to press reports that came out after Gensler's Squawk Box interview with CNBC on February 14, \u201cGensler simply indicated that the process would be handled in precisely the same way as Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA list of Ether ETF applications has been delayed and postponed by the SEC so far, including that of:\n\nInvesco\n\nGrayscale\n\nFidelity\n\nBlackRock\n\nVanEck\n\nHashdex\n\nFranklin Templeton also filed for spot Ether ETF on February 12. The SEC will come out with its decision on these applications in the days to come. For instance, it would decide on:\n\n\n\nVanEck \u2013 May 23rd\n\nARK 21 \u2013 May 24th\n\nHashdex \u2013 May 30th\n\nFollowing these, by June 18, it would decide on Grayscale's application, leading up to decisions on Invesco's by July 5. Concluding this sequence, by August 3rd and 7th, it would address Fidelity's and Blackrock's applications, respectively.\n\nWhile many ETH ETFs are in the pipeline for approval, experts are of the opinion that introducing the feature of staking can add more value. While advocating for staking as a future add-on, market experts believe that the initial Ethereum ETFs will be of a \u2018plain vanilla' structure, where ETFs will track the spot price of Ethereum as a first iteration.\n\nHowever, incorporating staking rewards into these instruments would mean rewarding any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators. These validators would subsequently propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain to receive freshly minted ETH and a portion of the block transaction fees. According to an estimate, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH could earn an extra 32 ETH on a monthly basis.\n\nThere are several advantages of introducing staking to ETH ETFs. It would enhance the fund's revenue and ensure Ethereum's network security, fostering the active participation of validators to make the network more robust and resilient.\n\nIntegral to Ethereum, the presence of staking rewards to ETH ETFs signifies full ownership of the asset, allowing fund managers to innovate with these staking rewards in compensating their investors. They can opt to provide dividends or increase the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, offering win-win propositions for all stakeholders involved. However, for now, it would be too early to make credible forecasts on the shape Ether ETFs are to take in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, we may discuss the next agenda on our list, which we have termed the curious case of the Prometheum listing.\n\nThe Curious Case of Prometheum's Listing ETH as a Security\n\nPrometheum claims itself as an entity that has been building the Future of Markets. It claims to be providing solutions for \u2018digital asset securities investing \u2014 bringing together a blockchain-powered platform with the benefits of a securities-regulated marketplace.' It also positions itself as an SEC and FINRA-registered entity that is into building the necessary connection between trad-fi systems and crypto investing. In short, it wants to do crypto differently by offering a platform where one can buy and sell digital asset securities in a securities setting.\n\nWithin this service environment, Prometheum has hit the headlines by announcing, to begin with, custody of ETH as its first digital asset. The move has baffled several crypto industry experts for multiple reasons. Let us look at a few of them.\n\nPrometheum enlisting ETH as a security could prove the claim of the pro-Ethereum lobby that it could be handled in the United States in a way that satisfies the regulatory authorities. Its ETH security service offering would also alter the way the United States authorities have asked businesses so far to come and do crypto business in the US.\n\nSpeculations are already doing the rounds that Prometheum's entry may force the Security and Exchange Commission to declare Ethereum as a security. And if the SEC does so, it could mean Prometheum holds a monopoly over the ETH security trading market.\n\nWhile Prometheum's approach towards ETH may seem innovative and aspirational in a market that is fast-evolving and burgeoning, industry analysts are apprehensive. And they've their reasons for their anxiety.\n\nFounded by Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum had its first regulatory approval in 2021. The Prometheum Ember ATS Inc. received approval to operate its ATS and provide accredited and non-accredited investors with the choice to buy, sell, and manage digital asset securities.\n\nIt hit the news when it went on to have a second and unusual regulatory approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA. The approval was to operate as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. Created as a category by the SEC in 2021, no one had managed to attain such approval before Prometheum.\n\nHowever, this dual approval from the SEC and FINRA did not make things more credible for legal experts in the field. While Prometheum claimed that it had found a viable route for crypto trading, the legal experts argued that the platform did not have any assets available for trading.\n\nSome also argued that SEC's approval and Prometheum's trading under its regulatory scheme compelled everyone to see ETH as a security, while it could be a commodity like gold or oil. It is essentially the dilemma that we have been discussing here. However, the Kaplan brothers appeared quite sure of their assessment of cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nThey also put forth the argument that it is possible for their platform to list cryptocurrencies, like ETH, as securities under the exemption known as Rule 144. Rule 144 is put into use when one decides to facilitate trades in restricted stocks.\n\nNot only legal and regulatory experts but also the entry and manipulation of Prometheum have caused a stir in the US political world, as several Republican lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers at Gary Gensler. According to their allegations, Prometheum is nothing but Gensler's stooge that he has been using to drive his regulatory agenda.\n\nThe claim of the Republicans gained enough steam when Prometheum received an invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto when it had very little experience in the space compared to many of its peers.\n\nAll these claims and counter-claims have added to the confusion and regulatory limbo that Ethereum had already found itself in more than a year ago and counting.\n\nThe third and final stream of confusion flowing around Ethereum is mostly because of its own evolutionary nature, and it has to do with the launch of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe Launch of a New Ethereum: What's in Store for the New Projects?\n\nEthereum's transition from a Proof of Work mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism was radical in many aspects. Ethereum 1.0, or Ethereum mainnet, which helped many innovative projects develop and flourish, operated on the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, allowing for the mining of ETH tokens.\n\nFrom September 15, 2022 onwards, Ethereum shifted to Proof of Stake, which involved the verification of transactions by staking. Of course, the transition was meant to achieve better results in the areas of network efficiency, security, and scalability.\n\nHowever, the differences between Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 covered more ground than mere performance improvement. It had its impact on the areas of a consensus protocol, blockchain conception, security, speed, energy, scalability, and gas fees.\n\nMany experts believe that the advent of Ethereum 2.0 has been like scoring a self-goal against one's own team. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 made it possible for regular users to leverage the rewards that were earlier meant for miners. Now, everyday users can avail the same benefits by holding any ETH liquid-staking derivative.\n\nMany big players in the industry, like Coinbase and Frax, were quick to hop on this bandwagon. They promptly released ETH liquid staking derivatives. These derivatives were as beneficial as a regular ETH and were also a yield-generating asset. Like other derivatives, these ones offered exposure to the price movement of the underlying asset, ETH in this case, while maintaining liquidity and keeping staking benefits available.\n\nIn the long run, these ETH liquid staking tokens proved to be more capital-efficient than regular ETH, thereby offering very little incentive for the average user to hold onto ETH, especially considering that the primary benefit of holding ETH was the potential for price appreciation. However, with the advent of this shift, individuals now had the opportunity to invest in a liquid staking derivative, which not only retained the value proposition of ETH but also enhanced user profits through staking yields.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum prompted many projects to integrate liquid staking Ether into protocols. Many who could not keep up with the shift had to face the risk of going into oblivion.\n\nEthereum: Dabbling in Status, Unfazed in Value\n\nWith all this confusion and doubt surrounding its status, one thing remains steady, and that is the value that Ethereum brings to the table in the world of decentralization. It continues to be a technology that helps digital money and global payment applications flourish, helping create a sustainable, wholesome economy.\n\nIn this economy, creators can earn online, and the unbanked population can access finance, significantly altering the traditional dynamics of lending and borrowing, making them more people-centric by freeing them from the clutches of intermediaries.\n\nMany real-world assets that were considered to be less liquid could be tokenized and moved across the board more freely. The tokenization of these assets made the system of selling and buying more transparent and traceable. Funds could easily reach where they belonged without requiring cost-bearing, complicated intermediaries to facilitate their movement and take a cut.\n\nWhile Ethereum's value as a tool geared towards development, growth, and prosperity in the Web3 world remains unmatched, its market and investment status need more clarity. While it is necessary to keep an eye on how the Prometheum story unfolds, we must also wait for the SEC's decisions on Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStarting from the end of May to August, one after another, these decisions will become public. Perhaps that will be the time for ETH to come out of the regulatory limbo and emerge as the game-changing asset that it had promised to be!\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum (ETH)."

        "content": "Digital assets in the artificial intelligence sector continued their recent surge, increasing by 10%, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that the technology could help the blockchain network mitigate its \u201cbiggest technical risk.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data show that several tokens in the sector, including SingularityNET\u2019s AGIX, 0x0.ai, Ocean Protocol\u2019s OCEAN, The Graph\u2019s GRT, Fetch.AI\u2019s FET, and others, rose more than 10%, respectively, during the past day, pushing the sector\u2019s market capitalization to $18.06 billion and its trading volume to approximately $2.5 billion.\n\nHow AI can aid Ethereum\n\nAccording to Buterin, AI technology could help blockchain network developers identify bugs and assist with the verification of codes.\n\n\u201cRight now ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d he added.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of his recent exploration of the synergy between AI and crypto, detailed in a blog post on Jan. 30. Buterin outlined various potential applications of AI within the crypto sphere.\n\nHe pointed out that integrating AI could revolutionize crypto-systems, particularly in scenarios where individual participants are replaced by AI entities, enabling more efficient operation on a micro-scale.\n\nWhile recognizing AI integration\u2019s functionality and safety enhancements, Buterin also urged caution, especially in high-value and high-risk settings.\n\nBeyond Ethereum, other protocols and exchanges like Solana, Polkadot, Binance, and stake.link also explore AI-driven solutions.\n\nHowever, despite the enthusiasm for AI, concerns linger regarding its efficacy in bug detection. Daniel \u201cHaxx\u201d Stenberg of cURL highlighted potential challenges, including the risk of AI-generated false positives complicating bug identification efforts.\n\n\u201cAn (AI-generated) security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature,\u201d Stenberg argued.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Filecoin, and Hedera Are on Fire Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculation about cryptocurrency ETFs continues, but a lot is going on under the crypto hood.\n\nThe crypto market's hot streak is continuing, and since the market closed on Friday, there have been some big movers. And in some of these cases, the moves have been driven by real developments, not just hype.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.88%) has risen as much as 8.1% since the stock market closed on Friday, Filecoin (FIL -0.78%) jumped by 40.7%, and Hedera (HBAR -2.34%) was up 38.7%. As of noon ET Tuesday, the tokens were up 5.4%, 30%, and 22.1% since Friday.\n\nBig crypto moves all around\n\nEthereum is rising in part because traders are still speculating that regulators will approve more crypto ETFs beyond the Bitcoin (BTC -0.45%) ETFs launched in the last few months. The next coin that is likely to get approval for one is Ethereum because of its size and recognition in the market.\n\nIf an ETF were approved, the purchasing activity around the coin could push Ethereum higher, in a similar fashion to the way Bitcoin has responded. Just last week, $2.4 billion flowed into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFilecoin's rise was prompted by more fundamental news: It announced it will store Solana's (SOL -0.46%) block history, allowing Solana to move to more decentralized storage. This should be a win for both cryptocurrencies; Solana can now focus more attention on expanding the high-throughput network while Filecoin gets a significant partner.\n\nLesser-known token Hedera is benefiting from the growth in its SaucerSwap decentralized exchange, which now has over $127 million in total locked value, a gauge of how much investors are putting into the exchanges on the ecosystem.\n\nBuilding the foundation of crypto's future\n\nIndividually, these moves may seem small. But together, they tell a story about where crypto is headed in the near future.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been approved, which suggests that eventually, ETFs for Ethereum and other tokens could arrive too, bringing more money into the ecosystem and driving values higher. If an Ethereum ETF gets approved, there may soon be dozens of crypto ETFs.\n\nThe Filecoin and Hedera news is more useful for the industry long term. As more tokens and exchanges are launched, it's necessary for market makers to put value into the ecosystem, and that's part of what we're seeing with the SaucerSwap exchange. Filecoin helping Solana store its blockchain history moves that token toward the decentralized vision that so many advocates would like to see.\n\nIf Solana and Filecoin can work together to create an extremely fast, high-throughput blockchain with accessible storage, it would be a win for all blockchain users. This is where I think we will see more utility and financial products built in the near future.\n\nCrypto is maturing before our eyes\n\nTwo years ago, crypto was still in the speculative trading days, and speculation in that market still exists, but major tokens like this are now focused on building real utility on blockchains. If that utility is combined with more investors putting money into the crypto ecosystem, it could create a reinforcing loop of value creation."

ETH price upswing comes after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest post regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and its use cases in crypto.\n\nVitalik Buterin Hints At AI Integration in Ethereum?\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has been actively looking at artificial intelligence (AI) recently, talking about its pros and cons. He recently talked about how crypto and AI overlap, pointing out potential use cases and risks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his excitement about artificial intelligence in a blog post on February 19.

        "title": "Ethereum Explodes Toward $3K: Two Things to Watch This Week (ETH Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently surged with notable momentum, signaling a bullish uptrend.\n\nThis increase has seen the price reclaim a critical resistance level, reflecting strong buyer confidence and market participant optimism.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals a significant shift in market sentiment, characterized by an impulsive uptrend and heightened bullish momentum.\n\nAccordingly, the price has approached a crucial multi-year resistance zone \u2013 the psychological barrier at $2.9K and successfully surpassed it.\n\nThis indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment among market participants, with buyers dominating the market. The trend appears sustainable, with eyes set on surpassing the major yearly swing high at $3.6K. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the only concern is the emergence of an expanded bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, signaling a possible short to mid-term correction or consolidation phase before the next surge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, a significant price reversal can be observed near the multi-month ascending trendline, supported by substantial buying pressure. This upward momentum led to a breakthrough above a crucial prior major swing high, establishing a new higher high. The above underscores the presence of active buyers targeting higher resistance levels.\n\nWith the price reclaiming a significant resistance zone and completing a pullback to the broken level, the trajectory is expected to remain bullish with intermittent downward corrections. However, given prevailing market conditions, periods of heightened volatility may lead to notable price fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and reclaiming of crucial resistance levels signify strong buyer confidence and a sustainable bullish trend. While short to mid-term corrections are possible, the overall outlook remains positive, with buyers likely to continue driving the market toward higher price targets.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed from the significant support level of $1.5K to surpass $2.8K in recent months, investors are keen to gain insights from futures market sentiment analysis.\n\nThe chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, representing the total number of open futures contracts, regardless of the trade direction. Higher values signify increased confidence among futures traders in the prevailing trend, while lower values indicate uncertainty. Moreover, heightened open interest often correlates with heightened price volatility, as it amplifies the probability of cascading liquidations.\n\nNotably, the chart reveals a significant surge in open interest, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s upward price trend, reaching its peak levels since July 2022. This surge indicates sustained confidence among futures traders in Ethereum\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nHowever, given the impulsive nature of the recent ascent, traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for sudden liquidation events, which could trigger notable short to mid-term price declines."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's recent price trajectory has been met with a stark rejection, as it encountered a near-impenetrable resistance level that has halted its upward momentum. This resistance confluence is particularly formidable as it aligns with the 100, 50 and 200 EMAs, key technical indicators closely monitored by traders for significant price movements.\n\nThe current price level has proven to be a substantial barrier for XRP, as the EMAs have converged to form a tight band of resistance. This band has effectively capped the price, acting as a ceiling that XRP has struggled to breach. The close proximity of these EMAs indicates a critical decision point for the asset; a break above could signal a strong bullish turn, while continued rejection may cement the current level as a robust ceiling.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the noticeable lack of trading volume. Volume acts as fuel for price movements, with higher volumes often associated with strong price action. The tepid volume accompanying XRP's approach to this resistance suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, which can often precede a price retreat.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the resistance zone around $0.58 to $0.60 is the area of interest. XRP's recent approach to this level was met with swift denial, indicating that overcoming this barrier will require a significant influx of buyer interest and volume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $0.50 level is one to watch. It has served as a historical psychological and technical support level, providing a foundation for price rebounds in the past. Should XRP retreat, the response of buyers at this level could determine the asset's short-term fate.\n\nEthereum almost there\n\nEthereum is on the cusp of breaching the pivotal $3,000 mark, showcasing formidable strength in an otherwise tepid market. Its resilience and upward momentum may well act as a catalyst for broader market optimism.\n\nThe ascent toward $3,000 has been marked by consistent higher lows and higher highs, a bullish pattern that suggests strong buying interest at every dip. Technical indicators have turned favorable, with Ethereum recently pushing past the 50-day and 100-day EMAs \u2014 a sign that the momentum could sustain.\n\nSupport levels for ETH have been notably robust. The primary support at the $2,750 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, has been defended well by the bulls. This level is critical as it has been tested multiple times, proving to be a springboard for subsequent rallies. On the upside, the psychological and technical barrier of $3,000 stands as the next significant challenge. A decisive close above this level could open the gates for further exploration into uncharted price territories, with potential intermediate resistance at $3,200.\n\nETH's exceptional performance can be partly attributed to the ongoing development within its ecosystem. The introduction of ERC-404, a new token standard that combines the versatility of NFTs with the fungibility of standard tokens, is an innovation that could further solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBitcoin faces opposition\n\nExamination of the BTC chart reveals that the asset is experiencing a consolidation phase, which is often a precursor to a trend continuation rather than a sign of stagnation.\n\nCurrently trading above the $50,000 mark, Bitcoin has maintained a steady position near this psychological threshold. The consolidation phase is characterized by a narrowing price range, with Bitcoin oscillating between support and resistance levels that converge over time. This tightening of price movement is often associated with the accumulation of assets by traders and investors, setting the stage for a potential breakout.\n\nThe key support level for Bitcoin lies around the $48,000 area, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has been tested and held firm on several occasions, indicating strong buying interest. On the flip side, the immediate resistance is located near the $53,000 mark. A convincing break above this level could signal a bullish continuation, potentially targeting previous highs or setting new records."

        "content": "Ethereum price has tested the $3,000 psychological level, a threshold last hit in 2022.\n\nETH could drop 10%, giving sidelined investors another entry before next leg up.\n\nThe bearish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS token records a higher high above the $3,004 peak.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has managed to test a crucial milestone for the first time in months, which is a remarkable show of strength considering Bitcoin (BTC) price has hinted at a fall. This means that Ether has managed to sidestep the BTC cue, causing markets to speculate on whether another alt season is underway.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nEthereum tests $3,000 after almost two years\n\nEthereum (ETH) price scrapped the $3,000 psychological level on Tuesday, a level last tested on April 26, 2022, almost two years ago. It comes a day after the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token outperformed BTC with double-digit weekly gains and a spike in Open Interest.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Ethereum price has slumped 0.78%, causing up to $15.47 million in short positions to be liquidated against $20 million of long positions. The disparity shows that most traders anticipated the surge in Ethereum price and took long positions, only that their take profits were higher such that their margin accounts could no longer support the open positions.\n\nETH liquidations\n\nAs it stands, Ethereum price is suffering the aftermath of an overbought asset, seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Traders looking to take new long positions should probably wait as the ETH market is at high risk of a pullback to the south.\n\nSuch a directional bias could provide sidelined or late investors a buying opportunity around the $2,689 support level before the next leg up. This would denote a 10% fall below current levels.\n\nIn a dire case, Ethereum price could slip below the aforementioned level to test the $2,500 level. Or ETH could find support at the $2,388 critical support.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bulls show strength, Ethereum price could reclaim the $3,000 milestone, potentially going as high as to reclaim the $3,004 range high. A decisive candlestick close above this local top on the daily timeframe would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIs an alt season coming?\n\nMeanwhile, speculation has it that the bold move by Ethereum price against BTC\u2019s price consolidation could be the beginning of an alt season.\n\nAlt season is a colloquial term that is used to describe a phase where investing in altcoins provides better returns compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Consequently, the dominance that Bitcoin holds in the market declines, and that of altcoins increases. The alt season indicator from BlockchainCenter is also leaning in favor of a potential altcoin season taking place as opposed to a Bitcoin season.\n\nAlt season index\n\nQuick summary of an alt season in play\n\nFresh capital enters the cryptocurrency ecosystem, effectively flowing into stablecoins, Bitcoin or Ethereum on preference that they are relatively safe: check! Markets rally as a consequence of this capital influx: check! The profit from these ecosystems, along with the new capital, moves into altcoins: in progress This rotation of capital triggers an alt season: possible result!\n\nThe chart above provides a visual representation."

        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has made a bullish prediction for Ethereum, suggesting that it could soar to $4,500.\n\nVan de Poppe believes Ethereum is soaking up Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum as investment capital shifts to ETH. According to the analyst, this is a \u201cmassive period to be rotating from Bitcoin towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\n#Ethereum is on its way towards $3,800-4,500. pic.twitter.com/TfoBGloBsH \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 19, 2024\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast comes amidst Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in price, which saw a 9% increase in seven days and 17.5% in one month. Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies have experienced notable gains as well, with MATIC and OP surging by 5% and 6%, respectively.\n\nOn Monday, ETH tapped $3K, its highest in nearly two years, signaling a bullish trend. The recent price surge could be attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC, following the footsteps of Bitcoin.\n\nSome experts, such as Tom Crown (CEO of Crown Analysis), believe the upswing could continue in the following days, predicting ETH\u2019s surge to $3,300 before the end of February.\n\nAnother person who outlined an optimistic scenario is Raoul Pal (co-founder and CEO of Real Vision). Earlier this month, he forecasted that ETH could rise to as high as $20,000 during the next bull cycle, while BTC could hit the astonishing $250,000.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user Altcoin Gordon was also quite bullish, setting a price tag of $11,250 to be reached by the end of the ongoing year.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s current market strength could be further bolstered by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, or a short-term peak of BTC, according to the analyst.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Could Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nThe Dencun upgrade aims to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations in transaction speed and cost. By implementing sharding \u2014a concept involving breaking network data into smaller \u201cshards\u201d\u2014 the upgrade aims to increase the overall computation throughput on the Ethereum network, making it more competitive with faster networks like Solana.\n\nVitalik Buterin underscored the Dencun upgrade as a significant development for Ethereum and its accompanying Layer-2s.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Dencun is a big step towards making Ethereum more \u201crollup-friendly\u201d while enhancing scalability and reducing costs on transactions.\n\nBesides the Dencun upgrade, the integration of Verkle trees on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to streamline Ethereum nodes\u2019 storage needs while maintaining their block validation capabilities, enhancing efficiency and decentralization within the network\n\nMeanwhile, another factor that could increase Ethereum\u2019s price is the approval of a spot in the ETH ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dejected and moving horizontally, coupled with its position at 79, BTC is overbought, a status that often precipitates a correction.\n\nLikely targets in a southbound directional bias would be the 78.6% and 61.8% Fibonacci levels, at $49,786 and $47,445, respectively.

In a dire case, ETH could roll over to the confluence between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,689. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a reentry by the bulls could send Ethereum price further north, clearing the $2,944 range high and potentially extend the gains to the $3,000 psychological target, almost 3% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains bullish despite the broader market showing weakness, an optimism inspired by hopes of a conclusion in the legal saga against the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith RSI at 58 and leaning north, Ripple price could increase amid rising momentum and the fact that there is still more room north before ETH is overbought.\n\nEnhanced activity among the bulls could see XRP price shatter the resistance due to the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus. A tag of this milestone would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary could send Ripple price south, first losing support due to the $0.5368 buyer congestion level. An extended fall could see Ripple price test the midline of the channel at $0.5145, or in a dire case, slip to the support floor at $0.4734, 15% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price steadies above $0.56 ahead of deadline in SEC v.

Skrice Studios\u2019 game will implement the MAVIA token for certain benefits, along with NFT land plots sold long before the game\u2019s January debut.\n\nMAVIA\u2019s latest spike came amid a broader surge for gaming tokens, with those tied to the Xai (XAI) and Beam (BEAM) gaming networks also setting all-time high prices, along with NFT trading card game Parallel (PRIME)\u2014GG\u2019s pick for the 2023 game of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upswing came just after Skrice revealed a detailed roadmap for the game, which includes implementing some of those aforementioned crypto elements in the game, adding other gameplay features, and rolling out an additional period of MAVIA staking rewards for NFT land owners. Heroes of Mavia will soon announce an as-yet-unrevealed Ethereum scaling network for implementing such crypto components.\n\nThe recent dip on MAVIA may reflect investors and airdrop recipients cashing in on the massive surge in token price. Even at the current subdued price, MAVIA has jumped 338% in value since debuting at $1.83 just two weeks ago. The token has seen just shy of $99 million in trading volume over the past day\u20148th most among gaming tokens, per CoinGecko.\n\nHeroes of Mavia targeted a sizable audience with its airdrop, offering a token claim to 100,000 early players alongside NFT land owners who had participated in previous staking campaigns. According to Skrice, the game has thus far racked up more than 2 million total downloads, with 278,000 daily active users as of Saturday.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange BuyUcoin, told AMBCrypto,\n\n\u201cAn important level for Ethereum to breach is $3,000, after which we can see a potential rally in the prices of altcoins.\u201d\n\nWhales are making the right moves!\n\nAmidst the surge, the behavior of a particular whale investor caught the attention of the market.\n\nThe wealthy holder grabbed a whopping 21,353 ETH worth $60 million just before prices rose, data from Lookonchain revealed. They did so by swapping Tether [USDT] tokens for ETH on Binance [BNB].\n\nAfter some time, the whale withdrew 10,649 ETH, amounting to a little over $30 million, in a separate transaction.\n\nIn fact, the whale has been on an accumulation spree since the 8th of February, having amassed around 52,759 ETH coins as of this writing. The ensuing rally helped the investor make $100 million in profits.\n\nThis was not an isolated case. Ethereum whales in general have shown urgency in accumulating coins at every given opportunity, evidenced by a jump in transactions worth more than $1 million.\n\nMoreover, the supply held by top non-exchange addresses has increased by 2 million since the start of February.\n\nThe lure of higher returns\n\nA big reason behind the accumulation frenzy could be because of the rapidly rising 30-day MVRV Ratio.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data, ETH\u2019s prevailing price was 16.43% higher than the average acquisition price.\n\nConsidering that ETH was still a good distance away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, the buying spree might continue."

        "content": "Tue 20 Feb 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRecently, Ether (ETH), the native crypto of Ethereum, has seen notable momentum. The asset is currently flirting with the $3,000 mark. This has sparked hope among crypto enthusiasts about the continuation of this trend with a positive effect on altcoins. A question that clearly divides analysts and experts.\n\nThe Hope of an Altcoin Season Driven by Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH)\n\nThe recent surge in the price of Ether (ETH), which has flirted with the $3,000 mark, has sparked hope for an impending \u201caltseason\u201d within the crypto community. However, analysts remain divided on the issue. On February 19, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto reached an intraday high of $2,980. That\u2019s its highest level in 22 months. Many enthusiasts believe this could herald the start of an ETH bull market and, consequently, an altcoin rally.\n\nHenrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, highlighted several fundamental factors underpinning this sentiment. Among these are the upcoming updates to Ethereum and the mainnet launches for scaling solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin over the past year suggests a potential catch-up. Especially given its deflationary nature following the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\nYuga Cohler, Senior Director of Engineering at Coinbase, echoed similar sentiments. He notably highlights the correlation between an ETH bull market and positive outcomes for altcoins. Meanwhile, voices like that of Mikybull Crypto forecast a bullish March for the native asset of Ethereum blockchain, with $3,000 as a plausible target. He anticipates a significant increase in altcoin activity.\n\nHopefuls call for \u2018#altseason\u2019 led by #Ethererum rally, analysts not so sure https://t.co/LUxw2uzJVz \u2014 MrMr4Nk \ud83d\udc99 De.Fi Army (@MrCr4nk) February 20, 2024 While enthusiasts anticipate an altcoin season driven by Ether, some analysts remain skeptical\n\nDissenting Voices Regarding This Outlook\n\nHowever, Markus Thielen, Head of 10x Research, holds an opposing view. According to him, there is a lack of substantial evidence for the eventuality of an impending altcoin season. He points out that sustainable reductions in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance below 45% are required to foster a viable altcoin rally.\n\nThe crypto expert also notes that unlike previous increases observed during the ICO and DeFi summer bull markets, the current rise lacks a clear explanation. Save for the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, the recent altcoin rallies have quickly dissipated, suggesting a higher risk-adjusted potential in favor of investments in BTC.\n\nMarkus Thielen\u2019s analysis also questions the sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s momentum. He believes it could be more motivated by the anticipation of the ETF approvals in May than by an increase in on-chain activity within decentralized applications (dApps). For the analyst, the current bull market will persist until 2025, a period during which altcoins may experience sporadic recoveries.\n\nSupporting Markus Thielen\u2019s cautious outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment cautions against overbought signals on the market. As indicated by the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, it suggests above-average risk associated with buying or opening new positions during the current surge. This is while most crypto projects have generated medium and long-term profits since October 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has expressed anticipation for the upcoming Verkle Trees, highlighting their potential to be a game-changer for staking nodes. Vitalik said that he wants to see the full implementation of Verkle trees.\n\n\u201cThey will enable stateless validator clients, which can allow staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync nearly instantly \u2013 far better solo staking UX,\u201d he noted in a tweet. He added that it will make it easier for user-facing light clients.\n\nVerkle Trees are a type of data structure that can be used to efficiently and securely prove the inclusion of a particular value in a set of data.\n\nThey are similar to Merkle Trees, another popular data structure used in blockchain, but with some important differences.\n\nThis allows clients to verify state changes in each block with minimal data. Verkle Trees is a critical step on the path to stateless Ethereum clients, who do not have to store the entire state data to validate incoming blocks.\n\nInstead of using their own local copy of Ethereum\u2019s state to verify blocks, stateless clients use a \u201cwitness\u201d to the state data that arrives with the block. A witness is a collection of individual pieces of the state data required to execute a particular set of transactions.\n\nVerkle Trees enable significantly reduced proof sizes for a large amount of data compared to Merkle Trees, making them an important tool for smart contract developers and other blockchain professionals.\n\nVerkle Trees bring several other advantages to Ethereum, including smaller proof sizes for efficient network communication, reduced hardware requirements enhancing decentralization, faster node synchronization for quicker onboarding, potential scalability benefits with higher gas limits, and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s evolution towards a zk-EVM future, ensuring adaptability.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum validators need fully synced nodes containing all state data for chain validation.\n\nVerkle Trees, part of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), introduces self-contained execution units within blocks.\n\nThis innovation allows blocks to be verified without additional information, such as the complete state of the chain.\n\nWhile Verkle Trees are currently in the testnet phase, their anticipated launch on the mainnet is set for 2024."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the rising DeFi market, newcomers are finding themselves in the spotlight. KangaMoon (KANG) is one of those newcomers. Some analysts have even hinted that this meme coin, which will soon enter its presale, could surge by 35x in 2024. But how does this rookie compare to already-established cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG): A Potential Star in the Memecoin Sector\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is a community-driven meme coin that everyone has been talking about. It is making a splash with its unique approach of combining memes and cryptocurrency. By focusing on building a solid community and introducing play-to-earn elements, KangaMoon is looking to be one of the top meme coin out there.\n\nKangaMoon could accomplish this as it will introduce a P2E game in which KANG is the main currency used for everything. With KANG, players can purchase in-game items, upgrade their characters, and more.\n\nKangaMoon will also incorporate a marketplace where you can sell or trade any in-game collectibles you have gained. Therefore, any player can make money from their time in the game.\n\nCurrently, the DeFi project is preparing to enter its presale. During this time, you can buy the KANG token for a discounted price of only $0.0075.\n\nHowever, since it will enter the $176B gaming market, experts are bullish about this meme coin. They forecast a potential 350% price pump once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in 2024.\n\nAnalyst Elja With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nRecently, crypto analyst Elja made a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction. According to his new tweet, Ethereum may hit $15,000 by 2025. He states that this explosive move will come as whales accumulate this altcoin.\n\nOver the last week, the Ethereum price has been bouncing between $2,402 and $2,272. In that same time period, its market cap moved between $288B and $272B. However, 20 technical indicators are in the green for this altcoin. Due to all these reasons, market analysts predict that Ethereum will hit $2,400 before the end of February 2024.\n\nRekt Capital\u2019s New Bitcoin Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been making headlines. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that a new Candle 4 has formed for Bitcoin at the $39,357 level. He predicts that this Candle will be broken after the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has jumped from $40,790 to $42,261 over the past week alone.

        "content": "In the digital age, where innovation and determination intersect, Jaynti Kanani's journey emerges as a beacon of inspiration. From the outskirts of Ahmedabad, where he grew up in modest circumstances, to scaling the heights of the cryptocurrency world, Kanani's story is a testament to the transformative power of technology and vision.\n\nEarly Life and Education: The Foundation of a Visionary\n\nBorn to a family with a modest income, where his father worked in a diamond factory, Kanani was instilled with the value of education early on. Pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, he laid the groundwork for his future in the tech realm, navigating through various roles that eventually led him to the discovery of blockchain technology. This fascination was the seed for Polygon, a groundbreaking solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.\n\nPolygon: Revolutionising Blockchain\n\nIn 2017, Kanani, alongside Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, founded Polygon (initially known as Matic). Their mission was clear: to address the high fees and slow transactions plaguing Ethereum. By creating a scalability platform that supported faster, cost-effective applications while remaining on the Ethereum network, Polygon became a pivotal player in the blockchain ecosystem. The platform's native token, Matic, saw its valuation surge, propelling Kanani and his co-founders into the ranks of billionaires.\n\nA Financial Odyssey: From 6000INR to Billions\n\nKanani's net worth, primarily built through Polygon, underscores the vast potential within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. His transition from earning a modest salary to becoming a crypto-billionaire exemplifies the lucrative opportunities available in the space. Strategic investments, including a significant stake in Polysynth, have further solidified his position as a leading figure in the crypto revolution.\n\nBeyond Blockchain: The Personal Side of a Tech Innovator\n\nDespite his monumental professional achievements, Kanani maintains a low profile regarding his personal life. Known as a family man, his story reflects not only his technical prowess but also his values and commitment to his loved ones.\n\nThe Future and Legacy\n\nIn late 2023. After six years of relentless dedication and achieving remarkable milestones, Kanani decided to step back from the day-to-day operations, seeking to explore new adventures while still supporting Polygon from the sidelines. His decision was met with emotional responses from his co-founders, reflecting the deep bond and shared vision that drove Polygon's success. His focus on strategic investments and innovation promises a bright future for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nA Tale of Innovation, Resilience, and Transformation\n\nJaynti Kanani's ascent from a young man in Gujarat to India's first crypto-billionaire is more than a success story; it's a narrative of innovation, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of dreams. As Polygon scales new heights, Kanani's journey remains a source of inspiration, encouraging future generations to dream big and innovate without bounds."

        "content": "The Bitcoin halving is a programmed event in the Bitcoin blockchain that cuts the mining reward in half. Historically, this event has often led to upward price movements due to the reduced pace at which new bitcoins are generated, leading to a possible supply crunch. However, it is impossible to predict the exact impact the upcoming Bitcoin halving will have and Bitcoin's price remains uncertain."
