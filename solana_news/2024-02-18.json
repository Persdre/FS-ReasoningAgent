        "title": "Selling Ethereum in 2024: is now the right time? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts and far-reaching dApps. If you wish to trade in ETH, you need to analyze the project\u2019s performance, trends, upgrades and updates, and basically any other aspect that could impact its price. This will help you determine the right time to sell or buy ETH. Depending on these factors, you may then decide to hold onto your ETH or convert ETH to USD.\n\nHere, we examine Ethereum in more detail to help you determine whether now is the perfect time to sell your ETH.\n\nWhat Is Unique about Ethereum\u2019s Technology?\n\nThe Ethereum network is an open-source protocol that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It supports an immense ecosystem of decentralized apps as a pioneer of blockchain smart contracts. Since its inception, Ethereum has been a pacesetter in digital trends such as NFTs, GameFi, Web3, Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThanks to the network\u2019s vast applications, serious concerns have emerged regarding its massive energy consumption, high transaction costs, and scalability. Some investors are already considering selling ETH in preference to its competitors \u2014 Solana, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano. You can read more about some of these crypto projects on the Paybis blog.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Updates and Upgrades\n\nEthereum 2.0 reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed from 30 TPS to 100,000 TPS. The goal is to ensure ETH is more usable with increased adoption to grow and stabilize its price.\n\nThe upgrade also saw Ethereum move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This migration helped the network to reduce its carbon footprint by over 90%.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been long in the pipeline. It started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, and ever since, we\u2019ve witnessed the Berlin and London upgrades.\n\nOther notable upgrades that followed included Arrow Glacier, Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris. The last three were collectively referred to as \u2018The Merge.\u2019\n\nIn 2023, the Uniswap V4, a new smart contract protocol, was launched. However, Ethereum\u2019s developers also recently rolled out the Shanghai upgrade that would allow ETH validators to unlock staked ETH, making rewards accessible.\n\nHow Has Ethereum Performed in Previous Years?\n\nLooking back at Ethereum\u2019s ICO, we see how affordable the coin was at just $0.31. Up until 2016, the price averaged less than $1. ETH skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1,270 in 2018 but the real bull run came in 2021 when it hit an unprecedented $4,891.\n\nSince then, the crypto market has experienced a bearish market, which saw most crypto projects shed a lot of their value. The crypto asset plunged to $890 on June 18, 2022, but has recovered well to register a 130% price gain from its current price. However, it\u2019s important to note that it still grapples with a 58% decrease from its ATH.\n\nNavigating through the highs and lows, Ethereum faced heightened volatility throughout 2023. Towards the end of October, the entire crypto market received a significant boost fueled by the anticipation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. This optimism propelled the price of ETH upward, breaching the $2,000 mark on November 9th for the first time since July.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum?\n\nLooking at expertly derived technical charts for Ethereum, there\u2019s a strong indication that the price will pull through the $2,300 resistance point.\n\nOnce Ethereum 2.0 updates and upgrades start fully rolling out, experts have forecast ETH to hit $2,700 in 2024 and $3,000 by 2025.\n\nSeasoned analysts and market veterans exhibit a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum, maintaining an optimistic outlook on its future price trajectory. Some even project that Ethereum could reach an impressive $40,000 by 2030. These forward-looking expectations underscore the confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for substantial growth and sustained value over the coming decade.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransformative Ethereum 2.0 updates are poised to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and sustainability. With the current ETH price at $2,500 and a market cap of more than $300 billion, the crypto market continues to showcase Ethereum\u2019s resilience.\n\nAs the crypto landscape evolves, staying informed and adaptable is crucial when considering selling ETH. Consider diversifying your portfolio away from Ethereum, you can exchange ETH for up-and-coming competitors such as Solana, Polkadot, Binance, or the more established Bitcoin."

        "title": "Commodity or Security? No One Knows When it Comes to Ethereum (ETH) - Securities.io",
        "content": "If Bitcoin is the most representative asset of the crypto world, Ethereum has helped the principle of decentralization find its footing in the blockchain world and beyond. Ethereum-powered smart contracts have helped build applications that have eventually led on-chain transactions and communication to become intermediary-free in a trustless and secure fashion.\n\nFrom encouraging a fairer financial system to tokenizing real-life assets and empowering us with an open internet \u2013 free from monopolizing entities controlling user data \u2013 Ethereum has been at the forefront of making the blockchain-powered world a more democratic, equitable, and innovative space. It is no wonder that Ethereum occupies close to one-fifth of the crypto world's market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite being one of the most catalyzing assets, Ethereum has been finding itself in regulatory limbo for quite some time now.\n\nClick here to learn what Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) means.\n\nGary Gensler's Interview and the Uncertainty around ETH's status\n\nThe current US President, Joseph R. Biden, nominated Gary Gensler as Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2021.\n\nIn an interview given on Monday, June 27, 2022, Gensler characterized Bitcoin as a commodity but \u201crefused to lump Ethereum's Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, under the same label.\u201d This reluctance to characterize Ethereum led to confusion regarding whether Ethereum was a commodity or security.\n\nIf it were a security, any sale and purchase with its use would count as capital gain, requiring it to be reported to the IRS, essentially making it unusable for small purchases.\n\nMore importantly, Ethereum's security status would put it under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission and all the restrictions that SEC regulations bring.\n\nWhile this mist of uncertainty and confusion surrounding Ethereum could be far-reaching in its impact since many crypto and blockchain projects are dependent upon it, we shall discuss some of the most crucial concerns that have arisen of late.\n\nETF applications: Will SEC Approve?\n\nWith as many as 11 Bitcoin ETFs recently getting approval, speculations are rife about whether Ether ETFs experience the same outcome. When asked about this, the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, did not disclose anything decisive. According to press reports that came out after Gensler's Squawk Box interview with CNBC on February 14, \u201cGensler simply indicated that the process would be handled in precisely the same way as Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA list of Ether ETF applications has been delayed and postponed by the SEC so far, including that of:\n\nInvesco\n\nGrayscale\n\nFidelity\n\nBlackRock\n\nVanEck\n\nHashdex\n\nFranklin Templeton also filed for spot Ether ETF on February 12. The SEC will come out with its decision on these applications in the days to come. For instance, it would decide on:\n\n\n\nVanEck \u2013 May 23rd\n\nARK 21 \u2013 May 24th\n\nHashdex \u2013 May 30th\n\nFollowing these, by June 18, it would decide on Grayscale's application, leading up to decisions on Invesco's by July 5. Concluding this sequence, by August 3rd and 7th, it would address Fidelity's and Blackrock's applications, respectively.\n\nWhile many ETH ETFs are in the pipeline for approval, experts are of the opinion that introducing the feature of staking can add more value. While advocating for staking as a future add-on, market experts believe that the initial Ethereum ETFs will be of a \u2018plain vanilla' structure, where ETFs will track the spot price of Ethereum as a first iteration.\n\nHowever, incorporating staking rewards into these instruments would mean rewarding any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators. These validators would subsequently propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain to receive freshly minted ETH and a portion of the block transaction fees. According to an estimate, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH could earn an extra 32 ETH on a monthly basis.\n\nThere are several advantages of introducing staking to ETH ETFs. It would enhance the fund's revenue and ensure Ethereum's network security, fostering the active participation of validators to make the network more robust and resilient.\n\nIntegral to Ethereum, the presence of staking rewards to ETH ETFs signifies full ownership of the asset, allowing fund managers to innovate with these staking rewards in compensating their investors. They can opt to provide dividends or increase the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, offering win-win propositions for all stakeholders involved. However, for now, it would be too early to make credible forecasts on the shape Ether ETFs are to take in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, we may discuss the next agenda on our list, which we have termed the curious case of the Prometheum listing.\n\nThe Curious Case of Prometheum's Listing ETH as a Security\n\nPrometheum claims itself as an entity that has been building the Future of Markets. It claims to be providing solutions for \u2018digital asset securities investing \u2014 bringing together a blockchain-powered platform with the benefits of a securities-regulated marketplace.' It also positions itself as an SEC and FINRA-registered entity that is into building the necessary connection between trad-fi systems and crypto investing. In short, it wants to do crypto differently by offering a platform where one can buy and sell digital asset securities in a securities setting.\n\nWithin this service environment, Prometheum has hit the headlines by announcing, to begin with, custody of ETH as its first digital asset. The move has baffled several crypto industry experts for multiple reasons. Let us look at a few of them.\n\nPrometheum enlisting ETH as a security could prove the claim of the pro-Ethereum lobby that it could be handled in the United States in a way that satisfies the regulatory authorities. Its ETH security service offering would also alter the way the United States authorities have asked businesses so far to come and do crypto business in the US.\n\nSpeculations are already doing the rounds that Prometheum's entry may force the Security and Exchange Commission to declare Ethereum as a security. And if the SEC does so, it could mean Prometheum holds a monopoly over the ETH security trading market.\n\nWhile Prometheum's approach towards ETH may seem innovative and aspirational in a market that is fast-evolving and burgeoning, industry analysts are apprehensive. And they've their reasons for their anxiety.\n\nFounded by Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum had its first regulatory approval in 2021. The Prometheum Ember ATS Inc. received approval to operate its ATS and provide accredited and non-accredited investors with the choice to buy, sell, and manage digital asset securities.\n\nIt hit the news when it went on to have a second and unusual regulatory approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA. The approval was to operate as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. Created as a category by the SEC in 2021, no one had managed to attain such approval before Prometheum.\n\nHowever, this dual approval from the SEC and FINRA did not make things more credible for legal experts in the field. While Prometheum claimed that it had found a viable route for crypto trading, the legal experts argued that the platform did not have any assets available for trading.\n\nSome also argued that SEC's approval and Prometheum's trading under its regulatory scheme compelled everyone to see ETH as a security, while it could be a commodity like gold or oil. It is essentially the dilemma that we have been discussing here. However, the Kaplan brothers appeared quite sure of their assessment of cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nThey also put forth the argument that it is possible for their platform to list cryptocurrencies, like ETH, as securities under the exemption known as Rule 144. Rule 144 is put into use when one decides to facilitate trades in restricted stocks.\n\nNot only legal and regulatory experts but also the entry and manipulation of Prometheum have caused a stir in the US political world, as several Republican lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers at Gary Gensler. According to their allegations, Prometheum is nothing but Gensler's stooge that he has been using to drive his regulatory agenda.\n\nThe claim of the Republicans gained enough steam when Prometheum received an invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto when it had very little experience in the space compared to many of its peers.\n\nAll these claims and counter-claims have added to the confusion and regulatory limbo that Ethereum had already found itself in more than a year ago and counting.\n\nThe third and final stream of confusion flowing around Ethereum is mostly because of its own evolutionary nature, and it has to do with the launch of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe Launch of a New Ethereum: What's in Store for the New Projects?\n\nEthereum's transition from a Proof of Work mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism was radical in many aspects. Ethereum 1.0, or Ethereum mainnet, which helped many innovative projects develop and flourish, operated on the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, allowing for the mining of ETH tokens.\n\nFrom September 15, 2022 onwards, Ethereum shifted to Proof of Stake, which involved the verification of transactions by staking. Of course, the transition was meant to achieve better results in the areas of network efficiency, security, and scalability.\n\nHowever, the differences between Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 covered more ground than mere performance improvement. It had its impact on the areas of a consensus protocol, blockchain conception, security, speed, energy, scalability, and gas fees.\n\nMany experts believe that the advent of Ethereum 2.0 has been like scoring a self-goal against one's own team. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 made it possible for regular users to leverage the rewards that were earlier meant for miners. Now, everyday users can avail the same benefits by holding any ETH liquid-staking derivative.\n\nMany big players in the industry, like Coinbase and Frax, were quick to hop on this bandwagon. They promptly released ETH liquid staking derivatives. These derivatives were as beneficial as a regular ETH and were also a yield-generating asset. Like other derivatives, these ones offered exposure to the price movement of the underlying asset, ETH in this case, while maintaining liquidity and keeping staking benefits available.\n\nIn the long run, these ETH liquid staking tokens proved to be more capital-efficient than regular ETH, thereby offering very little incentive for the average user to hold onto ETH, especially considering that the primary benefit of holding ETH was the potential for price appreciation. However, with the advent of this shift, individuals now had the opportunity to invest in a liquid staking derivative, which not only retained the value proposition of ETH but also enhanced user profits through staking yields.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum prompted many projects to integrate liquid staking Ether into protocols. Many who could not keep up with the shift had to face the risk of going into oblivion.\n\nEthereum: Dabbling in Status, Unfazed in Value\n\nWith all this confusion and doubt surrounding its status, one thing remains steady, and that is the value that Ethereum brings to the table in the world of decentralization. It continues to be a technology that helps digital money and global payment applications flourish, helping create a sustainable, wholesome economy.\n\nIn this economy, creators can earn online, and the unbanked population can access finance, significantly altering the traditional dynamics of lending and borrowing, making them more people-centric by freeing them from the clutches of intermediaries.\n\nMany real-world assets that were considered to be less liquid could be tokenized and moved across the board more freely. The tokenization of these assets made the system of selling and buying more transparent and traceable. Funds could easily reach where they belonged without requiring cost-bearing, complicated intermediaries to facilitate their movement and take a cut.\n\nWhile Ethereum's value as a tool geared towards development, growth, and prosperity in the Web3 world remains unmatched, its market and investment status need more clarity. While it is necessary to keep an eye on how the Prometheum story unfolds, we must also wait for the SEC's decisions on Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStarting from the end of May to August, one after another, these decisions will become public. Perhaps that will be the time for ETH to come out of the regulatory limbo and emerge as the game-changing asset that it had promised to be!\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum (ETH)."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price briefly surges over $2,900 on Monday, sparking renewed interest in the community ahead of the upcoming Dencun upgrade. ETH price upswing comes after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest post regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and its use cases in crypto.\n\nVitalik Buterin Hints At AI Integration in Ethereum?\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has been actively looking at artificial intelligence (AI) recently, talking about its pros and cons. He recently talked about how crypto and AI overlap, pointing out potential use cases and risks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his excitement about artificial intelligence in a blog post on February 19. The use of AI in formal code verification and bug detection is one application about which he is quite enthusiastic. According to him, code problems represent \u201cEthereum\u2019s biggest technical risk pro\u201d at the moment, and AI will revolutionize bug remediation.\n\n\u201cOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding. Right now Ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nAptos Labs\u2019 Wolfgang Grieskamp commented that the design of the EVM, unfortunately, makes verification very hard, with difficulty in discovering simple control flow because of indirect branching. \u201cNot sure whether AI will help here. Formal verification of Move is easier and works today, AI can further boost it.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF is \u201ca Giant Mistake\u201d \u2013 Market Expert Jim Bianco Says\n\nEthereum Verkle Trees\n\nAs Ethereum goes for the Dencun (Deneb and Cancun) upgrade is scheduled to go live on March 13, Vitalik Buterin really looking to Verkle trees. Citing a website maintained by Ethereum Foundation developers, Buterin said it will enable stateless validator clients, allowing staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync almost instantly. This will offer a better solo staking user experience.\n\nETH price hit $2,904.71, up 3% in the past 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $2,780 and $2,902, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by over 30% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.

        "title": "Ethereum Explodes Toward $3K: Two Things to Watch This Week (ETH Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently surged with notable momentum, signaling a bullish uptrend.\n\nThis increase has seen the price reclaim a critical resistance level, reflecting strong buyer confidence and market participant optimism.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals a significant shift in market sentiment, characterized by an impulsive uptrend and heightened bullish momentum.\n\nAccordingly, the price has approached a crucial multi-year resistance zone \u2013 the psychological barrier at $2.9K and successfully surpassed it.\n\nThis indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment among market participants, with buyers dominating the market. The trend appears sustainable, with eyes set on surpassing the major yearly swing high at $3.6K. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the only concern is the emergence of an expanded bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, signaling a possible short to mid-term correction or consolidation phase before the next surge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, a significant price reversal can be observed near the multi-month ascending trendline, supported by substantial buying pressure. This upward momentum led to a breakthrough above a crucial prior major swing high, establishing a new higher high. The above underscores the presence of active buyers targeting higher resistance levels.\n\nWith the price reclaiming a significant resistance zone and completing a pullback to the broken level, the trajectory is expected to remain bullish with intermittent downward corrections. However, given prevailing market conditions, periods of heightened volatility may lead to notable price fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and reclaiming of crucial resistance levels signify strong buyer confidence and a sustainable bullish trend. While short to mid-term corrections are possible, the overall outlook remains positive, with buyers likely to continue driving the market toward higher price targets.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed from the significant support level of $1.5K to surpass $2.8K in recent months, investors are keen to gain insights from futures market sentiment analysis.\n\nThe chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, representing the total number of open futures contracts, regardless of the trade direction. Higher values signify increased confidence among futures traders in the prevailing trend, while lower values indicate uncertainty. Moreover, heightened open interest often correlates with heightened price volatility, as it amplifies the probability of cascading liquidations.\n\nNotably, the chart reveals a significant surge in open interest, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s upward price trend, reaching its peak levels since July 2022. This surge indicates sustained confidence among futures traders in Ethereum\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nHowever, given the impulsive nature of the recent ascent, traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for sudden liquidation events, which could trigger notable short to mid-term price declines."

Daniel \u201cHaxx\u201d Stenberg of cURL highlighted potential challenges, including the risk of AI-generated false positives complicating bug identification efforts.\n\n\u201cAn (AI-generated) security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature,\u201d Stenberg argued.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC shows weakness, likely to provoke a cascade of chops - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop 10% after a weeklong consolidation with BTC bulls showing exhaustion.\n\nEthereum price is likely to revisit $2,800, a 5% fall that could trigger a cascade of losses.\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000 as XRP bulls show strength on the heels of SEC lawsuit conclusion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price\u2019s bullish breakout appears to be losing steam, with the sentiment spreading across the market and leaving Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins in general susceptible to a crash. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is an outlier, pushing north on the heels of developments in the legal front.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to drop 10% as US markets commemorate Presidents\u2019 Day\n\nBitcoin likely to correct before next leg up\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting resistance at $52,768 blockade, a roadblock that has stood for the past week. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dejected and moving horizontally, coupled with its position at 79, BTC is overbought, a status that often precipitates a correction.\n\nLikely targets in a southbound directional bias would be the 78.6% and 61.8% Fibonacci levels, at $49,786 and $47,445, respectively. In a dire case, Bitcoin price could roll over to the 50% Fibonacci level at $45,801, 12% below current levels.\n\nThe Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator also suggests a possible correction, having increased above 1 as a 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is bolstered by fading histogram bars on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNotably, however, the bulls still have a presence in the BTC market, seen with the status of the MACD in positive territory. If these traders act, Bitcoin price could push north, clearing the $52,768 blockade and potentially record a new range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price bullish outlook inspires IntoTheBlock\u2019s 85% forecast of BTC at a new ATH by August\n\nEthereum price likely to revisit $2,800\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has outperformed BTC. However, it appears to be delaying the inevitable as altcoins await the Bitcoin cue. The RSI shows ETH is already overbought, worsened by the SOPR above 1, hinting at possible correction.\n\nA move south could see Ethereum price lose the immediate support at $2,874, potentially extending the fall to the $2,800 base, 5% below current levels. In a dire case, ETH could roll over to the confluence between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,689. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a reentry by the bulls could send Ethereum price further north, clearing the $2,944 range high and potentially extend the gains to the $3,000 psychological target, almost 3% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains bullish despite the broader market showing weakness, an optimism inspired by hopes of a conclusion in the legal saga against the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith RSI at 58 and leaning north, Ripple price could increase amid rising momentum and the fact that there is still more room north before ETH is overbought.\n\nEnhanced activity among the bulls could see XRP price shatter the resistance due to the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus. A tag of this milestone would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary could send Ripple price south, first losing support due to the $0.5368 buyer congestion level. An extended fall could see Ripple price test the midline of the channel at $0.5145, or in a dire case, slip to the support floor at $0.4734, 15% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price steadies above $0.56 ahead of deadline in SEC v.

        "content": "Ethereum showed strong bullish sentiment on the price charts.\n\nA retest of the range highs would provide an ideal buying opportunity.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a minor pullback from $2867 to $2719 from the 15th to the 17th of February.\n\nThis came after the strong breakout past the range highs at $2.6k, a level that the bulls struggled to breach over the past six weeks.\n\nThe steady rise in active addresses in recent weeks suggested that a long-term uptrend was beginning, but that does not rule out retracements.\n\nTwo demand zones were identified- but the data also suggested that a move toward $2900 was imminent.\n\nGauging the state of the market\n\nThe H12 chart of Ethereum showed a clear uptrend in progress. The market structure was firmly bullish. A drop below $2472 would be required to flip the structure bearishly.\n\nThe RSI was at 73 at press time and has been within the overbought territory over the past six days.\n\nThis does not necessitate a deep pullback, but it does show that the prices were likely overextended and might need time to cool down.\n\nMeanwhile, the OBV continued to rally higher as buying volume spurred it northward.\n\nThe steady demand and momentum indicated that it was only a matter of time before Ethereum prices climbed to $3000 and higher. Beyond $3k, the $3250 and $3580 levels were significant resistances.\n\nShort sellers could face liquidations soon\n\nAMBCrypto also analyzed the liquidation levels data from Hyblock.\n\nNotably, the Cumulative Liq Levels Delta remained positive despite the minor pullback over the past couple of days. This showed there were more long liquidation levels.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nHowever, their liquidation clusters were at $2550 and just below the $2700 mark. Meanwhile, a $179 million short liquidation level was present at $2858 (blue).\n\nHence, a move to the $2850-$2900 region was likely. It could be followed by another move higher, as the long liquidations, while more numerous, were more spread out.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally to $4,000 Imminent Amid Massive Whale Accumulation - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has given a strong run-up above $2,900 gaining 4% in the last 24 hours. Since the beginning of 2024, the Ethereum price is up by 24% so far, as the altcoin gears up for a further rally to $4,000.\n\nEthereum Whale Accumulation\n\nThe major reason behind today\u2019s Ethereum price rally is the strong whale accumulation. According to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale initiated a series of transactions, beginning with the withdrawal of 100 million USDT from the popular exchange Binance. Subsequently, the investor allocated 60 million USDT to purchase 21,353 ETH at an average price of $2,810 per token. Following this purchase, an additional 10,649 ETH, equivalent to $30.68 million, was withdrawn from Binance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis recent transaction marks a continuation of the whale\u2019s buying spree in the Ethereum market since February 8th. Over this period, the investor has amassed a total of 52,759 ETH, amounting to approximately $145.4 million, from both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX).\n\nThe substantial Ethereum acquisitions by the whale investor underscore growing confidence in the digital asset\u2019s potential amidst a period of market volatility.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Major Resistance At $3,000\n\nThe optimism among Ether bulls is palpable, with many seeing the $3,000 mark as an attainable target. However, historical data suggests that maintaining such a price level is no easy feat.\n\nA notable example is seen three weeks prior to April 3, 2022, when ETH surged by 42%, soaring from $2,520 to $3,580. Yet, this rally was short-lived, as its price plummeted by 46% over the next 40 days.\n\nGiven this precedent, traders are now wary of whether Ether could experience a comparable outcome in the current scenario. Also, everyone is bullish about the possibility of the spot Ethereum ETF approval by May 23 this year. Players like VanEck and Kraken are the recent ones to join the race for these investment products.\n\nThe SEC currently has multiple applications queued up for spot Ethereum ETFs. With the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and their subsequent positive reception, traditional investment firms have begun showing a keen interest in Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAmerican multinational asset manager BlackRock has also submitted an application for an Ethereum ETF to the SEC. However, the regulator postponed its decision on the offering, stating the need for additional time to carefully consider the application and make an informed decision. As a result, the SEC announced that it would delay its decision on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust until March 10, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, market analysts have been also calling for a rally to $4,000 in the wake of the Dencun upgrade next month. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe said that Ethereum might catch up to the Bitcoin gains in its rally to $4,000. As Bitcoin enters the consolidation phase, the momentum will shift to Ethereum.\n\n#Ethereum is strengthening its momentum. How do I know? It's flat against BTC, while Bitcoin ran from $45,000 to $52,000. The momentum will shift toward Ethereum when Bitcoin consolidates and calms down. Onwards to $3,500-4,000. pic.twitter.com/541qbeRKdk \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 15, 2024\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has expressed anticipation for the upcoming Verkle Trees, highlighting their potential to be a game-changer for staking nodes. Vitalik said that he wants to see the full implementation of Verkle trees.\n\n\u201cThey will enable stateless validator clients, which can allow staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync nearly instantly \u2013 far better solo staking UX,\u201d he noted in a tweet. He added that it will make it easier for user-facing light clients.\n\nVerkle Trees are a type of data structure that can be used to efficiently and securely prove the inclusion of a particular value in a set of data.\n\nThey are similar to Merkle Trees, another popular data structure used in blockchain, but with some important differences.\n\nThis allows clients to verify state changes in each block with minimal data. Verkle Trees is a critical step on the path to stateless Ethereum clients, who do not have to store the entire state data to validate incoming blocks.\n\nInstead of using their own local copy of Ethereum\u2019s state to verify blocks, stateless clients use a \u201cwitness\u201d to the state data that arrives with the block. A witness is a collection of individual pieces of the state data required to execute a particular set of transactions.\n\nVerkle Trees enable significantly reduced proof sizes for a large amount of data compared to Merkle Trees, making them an important tool for smart contract developers and other blockchain professionals.\n\nVerkle Trees bring several other advantages to Ethereum, including smaller proof sizes for efficient network communication, reduced hardware requirements enhancing decentralization, faster node synchronization for quicker onboarding, potential scalability benefits with higher gas limits, and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s evolution towards a zk-EVM future, ensuring adaptability.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum validators need fully synced nodes containing all state data for chain validation.\n\nVerkle Trees, part of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), introduces self-contained execution units within blocks.\n\nThis innovation allows blocks to be verified without additional information, such as the complete state of the chain.\n\nWhile Verkle Trees are currently in the testnet phase, their anticipated launch on the mainnet is set for 2024."

        "content": "The Bitcoin halving is a programmed event in the Bitcoin blockchain that cuts the mining reward in half. Historically, this event has often led to upward price movements due to the reduced pace at which new bitcoins are generated, leading to a possible supply crunch. However, it is impossible to predict the exact impact the upcoming Bitcoin halving will have and Bitcoin's price remains uncertain."
