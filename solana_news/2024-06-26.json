        "title": "Investing in Ethereum ETFs: What to Know - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -5.71%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in a manner similar to buying stocks. Much like the early days of Bitcoin ETFs, the landscape for Ethereum ETFs currently features futures-based options, while spot ETFs are still pending regulatory approval.\n\nDefinition Icon Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency is decentralized and secure digital money, based on blockchain technology, that offers new investment opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the available Ethereum ETFs, examining both the futures-based products currently accessible and the potential future of spot Ethereum ETFs. We'll also provide guidance on how to invest in these ETFs, offering insights into their structure, the benefits they offer, and considerations for investors looking to add Ethereum exposure to their investment portfolios.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is it? What is an Ethereum ETF? The easiest way to understand Ethereum ETFs is to break them down into two main components. Ethereum itself is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). It's widely used for its smart contract functionality, which enables automatic, decentralized agreements that execute when their conditions are met.\n\nDefinition Icon Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is a blockchain created in 2015 that is supported by a decentralized network of computers all over the world.\n\nAn ETF is an open-ended investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities, bonds, or even cryptocurrencies. ETFs are unique because they trade on stock exchanges much like individual stocks, offering the liquidity and accessibility that typical mutual funds do not. Combining these, an Ethereum ETF is a type of investment fund that either holds Ethereum directly or invests in related derivatives like Ethereum futures contracts. This setup allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum's market movements without buying and holding the actual cryptocurrency through a crypto exchange or dealing with the complexities of digital wallet security. Essentially, when you buy shares of an Ethereum-based ETF, you're indirectly investing in Ethereum's performance with all the trading ease of traditional stocks. Holdings What do Ethereum ETFs hold? Due to regulatory constraints, U.S. Ethereum ETFs are currently unable to hold Ethereum directly. Instead, these ETFs gain exposure to Ethereum through Ethereum futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). These futures allow investors to speculate on the future price of Ethereum without the challenges -- such as security and custody -- of managing actual cryptocurrencies.\n\nSince these futures are based on Ethereum's anticipated future price, they provide a method for investors to gain indirect exposure to Ethereum's price dynamics. Due to the nature of futures trading, which requires a margin, it is common for Ethereum ETFs to maintain significant holdings in cash or cash equivalents. Low-risk assets, like money market funds, commercial paper, or Treasury bills, are often used as collateral for these trades. This setup ensures that the ETF can meet potential margin calls during periods of high volatility, thereby securing the leveraged positions taken on futures contracts. What is Ethereum? What is Ethereum? Ethereum, launched in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, is a comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts that run autonomously without a central authority. Ether is Ethereum's native cryptocurrency and is essential for operating dApps and executing smart contracts. It serves as \"gas,\" paying for the computational resources needed to execute operations and giving Ethereum its value. Ether trades on various cryptocurrency exchanges and is used both as an investment and a utility token. In September 2022, Ethereum underwent a major update, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. This shift significantly reduced the platform's energy consumption by changing how transactions are verified and blocks are added to the blockchain. Instead of miners solving puzzles, validators now stake Ether to earn the right to validate transactions and yield, enhancing Ethereum's sustainability and scalability. Spot ETFs Spot Ethereum ETF approval While Canadian securities regulators have allowed spot Ethereum and other cryptocurrency ETFs to trade since April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been slower to adopt similar measures. This landscape shifted significantly on May 23, 2024, when the SEC finally greenlit spot Ethereum ETFs. However, these ETFs have not yet started trading in the market since the SEC still needs to approve the individual prospectuses submitted by ETF issuers aiming to launch these products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has suggested that the process should be completed by the end of summer, although no specific timeline has been confirmed. Once these approvals are in place, though, spot Ethereum ETFs will be allowed to begin trading on exchanges.\n\nHow to buy How to invest in Ethereum ETFs Investing in Ethereum ETFs is straightforward and follows the same procedure as trading any other ETF or stock. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started: Figure out your position size: Decide how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to Ethereum ETFs in terms of dollar value. Consider whether this investment fits with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy versus regular stocks. Pick the right ETF: In the next section, we've provided a table of the major Ethereum ETFs currently available. Choose the one that best meets your needs based on factors like fees, liquidity, and past performance. Search the ETF on your brokerage: Locate the ETF by typing its full name or ticker symbol into your brokerage's search function. Make sure you select the option for \"shares\" or \"equity\" to ensure you are purchasing the ETF itself and not options based on it. Enter an order: Specify the number of shares you wish to buy. You can place a market order, which executes the trade at the next available price, or a limit order, which sets a maximum price you are willing to pay and executes only if the share price meets or falls below this threshold. Finishing up: If your order is successful, your brokerage account will reflect the purchase, with the ETF shares added and the corresponding amount of cash deducted. Top three Top three Ethereum ETFs Here's an overview of the largest Ethereum ETFs on the market in terms of assets under management (AUM):\n\nLargest Ethereum ETFs by assets under management, June 2024. Fund Name Ticker Symbol Net Expense Ratio ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT:EETH) 0.95% VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT:EFUT) 0.66% Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT:BTOP) 0.85%\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nOutlook An outlook for Ethereum ETFs Currently, investors can trade Ethereum futures ETFs, and with the recent SEC approval, spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to hit the market soon. The ETFs offer the convenience of trading through a regular brokerage account, eliminating the need for a crypto exchange or self-custody of digital assets. However, it's important to note that these ETFs incur expense ratios and do not offer the 24/7 trading capability that direct investments in the cryptocurrency sector provide. Looking ahead, much like Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted significant investor interest and led to new price highs for Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs may similarly benefit from substantial inflows and expanded interest from retail investors.\n\nFAQ\n\nInvesting in Ethereum ETFs FAQ Which Ethereum ETF is best? angle-down angle-up There's no universal answer, but the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT:EFUT) is a great candidate with a lower 0.66% expense ratio.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs are coming. Can they revive tepid crypto markets? - Fortune",
        "content": "Not one to show his hand, SEC Chair Gary Gensler still gave as optimistic a prognosis on Ethereum ETFs as could be expected yesterday, speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference. In between his usual frosty statements on the crypto sector, including accusing his interviewer of going after \u201cclicks,\u201d Gensler said the process of working with issuers was \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d\n\nThe rare acquiescence from Gensler seems to confirm predictions from the Bloomberg soothsayers that the ETFs could launch as soon as July 2. With crypto assets from Coinbase to Bitcoin cratering in recent days, could the arrival of an Ethereum ETF reinvigorate the bull market? After all, the approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs back in January served as a catalyst for the current rally.\n\nThe short answer is: probably not. Ethereum has always been the less-loved younger sibling to Bitcoin, even with its newfangled capacity for smart contracts, improved transactions, staking, and a slew of other advantages. It\u2019s been years since anyone predicted the \u201cflippening\u201d\u2014that fabled day when Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin\u2014with a straight face.\n\nI caught up with Christopher Perkins, the president of the VC firm CoinFund, who told me that one of the main challenges for Ethereum will be branding. Bitcoin is easy. The proto-cryptocurrency laid claim to the moniker \u201cdigital gold,\u201d which any investor can understand. A baby boomer looking where to allocate the millions of dollars scored from selling a house they bought in 1970 for $10,000, however, might have a harder time understanding the value proposition of Ethereum. What exactly is a smart contract, and why should we care? \u201cThose boomers, with the money\u2014they don\u2019t ape into things,\u201d Perkins told me.\n\nEven with the hype around the Bitcoin ETF, we\u2019re seeing slow adoption as investors grow more comfortable with the new asset class. As Perkins said, ETFs offer two main advantages: regulatory certainty coupled with operational scalability, or improved user experience. Bitcoin, thanks to its early commodity designation, was never really in a regulatory gray zone, though ETFs made it easier for people to buy them directly into their brokerage accounts, rather than setting up a Coinbase or Robinhood account. With Ethereum, however, the approval and launch of ETFs does genuinely create a safety moat that didn\u2019t exist before, especially after months of speculation that the SEC would reject the applications.\n\nFurthermore, an Ethereum ETF that offers yield could be a game-changer, if the SEC ever approves them. Last year, Perkins spearheaded a project to provide a benchmark rate for the staking yield on Ethereum, which he pointed out is often higher than Treasury rates, when adjusted for inflation. \u201cThe ETF is going to be very important, but it\u2019s also imperfect because it\u2019s going to deprive investors of that yield out of the gate,\u201d he said.\n\nSo if Ethereum ETFs do finally come next week, or soon after, don\u2019t expect a spike in adoption. But Perkins said to take a long-term view: \u201cThis is just another step in mainstreaming and regulatory de-risking.\u201d\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase shares are down as crypto markets face a downturn amid macro uncertainty.

        "content": "The TDR Three Key Takeaways regarding Ethereum and Its Challenges:\n\nEthereum price movement, dipping to $3,250 before a slight recovery to $3,400, has raised concerns among investors. Economic factors such as inflation and rising interest rates still pose significant challenges for Ethereum. The futures market\u2019s sentiment indicates that a rally to $3,700 is highly unlikely in the near term for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum faced significant price struggles, dropping to its lowest level in over a month. This price movement, dipping to $3,250 before a slight recovery to $3,400, has raised concerns among investors and analysts alike.\n\nThe primary focus remains on the upcoming launch of a spot Ethereum ETF. Despite initial excitement, analysts have tempered their expectations. Stephen Richardson, managing director of financial markets at Fireblocks, expressed skepticism and reported on Cointelegraph, stating he expects significantly lower inflows at the Ethereum ETF launch. This cautious outlook stems from broader economic challenges, including inflation and high-interest rates, which continue to affect the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny around Ethereum has eased, creating a more favorable environment for investors. However, economic factors such as inflation and rising interest rates still pose significant challenges. These macroeconomic trends impact consumer confidence and investment behavior, affecting the overall attractiveness of Ethereum.\n\nOne of the critical issues Ethereum faces is its high network fees. The blockchain\u2019s gas fees can deter users, pushing them towards other networks like BNB Chain and Solana, which offer lower fees. This competition is evident as these alternative blockchains capture more volume and generate significant daily revenue, despite having fewer deposits. ETH\u2019s weekly revenue is relatively low compared to its market capitalization, raising questions about its valuation and growth potential. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, reported on Cointelegraph pointed out that the revenue it generates is minuscule compared to its market capitalization, indicating that the asset does not currently represent a viable, sufficiently cash-flow-producing investment.\n\nSentiment in the Ethereum futures market has shifted to a neutral range. This change reflects a lack of strong bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the futures premium falling below 10%. The cautious stance of professional traders highlights the uncertain outlook for ETH. The futures market\u2019s sentiment indicates that a rally to $3,700 is highly unlikely in the near term.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum faces stiff competition from other blockchains like Tron and Solana. These platforms, despite having fewer deposits, manage to generate significant daily revenue, underlining the competitive challenges ETH must overcome.\n\nEconomic conditions, consumer confidence, and interest rates impact Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. High network fees, competition, and economic factors present challenges, and analysts are skeptical about significant gains from the upcoming spot Ethereum ETF launch. A rally to $3,700 seems unlikely in the near term.\n\nWant to be updated on Cannabis, AI, Small Cap, and Crypto? Subscribe to our Daily Baked in Newsletter!"

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF to attract $15 billion by 2025's end: Bitwise CIO - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum ETPs to potentially reach $35 billion, aiming for market parity.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) exchange-traded products (ETPs) are set to draw $15 billion in net inflows within the first 18 months of their launch, according to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise. In a recent report, Hougan underscored that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs should capture net inflows comparable to their market cap, where ETH gets 26% of the combined market.\n\nCurrently, US investors hold approximately $56 billion in Bitcoin ETPs, and the Bitwise CIO expects this to rise above $100 billion by 2025. Ethereum\u2019s market cap, which stands at $432 billion, suggests a substantial potential for asset inflow, aiming for parity with Bitcoin ETPs at around $35 billion.\n\n\u201cFor starters, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (NYSE: ETHE) is expected to convert to an ETP on launch day, bringing $10 billion in assets with it. Net that out and we\u2019re left with $25 billion in inflows to reach parity,\u201d he highlighted in the report.\n\nHowever, Hougan points out the fact that Ethereum ETPs are slightly underperforming their absolute market cap weight, as they are currently gathering 22-23% of total assets under management versus a 26% market cap weighting.\n\n\u201cI can imagine various reasons, including that Bitcoin ETPs arrived first in many of these markets (as they did in the U.S.). Some investors may have bought a Bitcoin ETP and stopped there, thinking their crypto exposure was covered. I suspect this dynamic will be true in the U.S. as well,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, Hougan lowered his expectations from $25 billion to $18 billion, excluding the assets from Grayscale\u2019s trust.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s another factor taken into consideration by Bitwise\u2019s CIO, which is the \u201ccarry trade.\u201d Carry trade involves buying spot Bitcoin ETPs and selling Bitcoin futures contracts against that position, and traders profit from the premium between futures and spot prices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect Ethereum will have the same dynamic\u2014the Ethereum ETP carry trade isn\u2019t profitable right now for institutions (in part because U.S. Ethereum ETPs won\u2019t engage in staking their assets). For that reason\u2014and to keep my estimate of Ethereum ETP flows on the conservative side\u2014we need to remove the $10 billion in carry-trade-related AUM when sizing the Bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s initial denominator of $100 billion falls to $90 billion, and the adjusted estimate for Ethereum ETPs\u2019 net inflows becomes $15 billion."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s status as an ultrasound money system becomes increasingly questionable as the days go by, especially as its supply keeps increasing at a high rate.\n\nSince mid-April 2024, about a month after the Ethereum network underwent the Dencun upgrade, more than 112,000 ether (ETH) has been added to the market at the fastest daily rate after the Merge.\n\nThe Effects of Dencun\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has witnessed several developments that have led to the network are we know it today The Merge in September 2022 marked its transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism network to that of proof-of-stake.\n\nIn mid-March, Ethereum underwent another upgrade that reduced the transaction fees of its layer-2 networks by roughly 4x and enhanced the blockchain\u2019s scalability by expanding its capacity. Dencun introduced nine Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which implemented proto-danksharding, a mechanism that allowed for data blobs.\n\nWith blobs, layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon became able to submit transaction data to Ethereum for collective settlement within a dedicated blobspace without additional expenses.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum implemented some upgrades to ensure it remained deflationary before Dencun came. One such was the London upgrade that took place in August 2021. London introduced a mechanism that removed ETH from circulation with every transaction by burning a portion of the network\u2019s gas fees. The Merge further cemented this approach to deflation and lowered ETH\u2019s inflation rate by 90%.\n\nETH Now Inflationary\n\nSince Dencun, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees have been low, meaning less ETH has been burned. On-chain analysts believe Ethereum is no longer deflationary, as the new ETH supply has turned positive. The amount of fees burned on Ethereum is no longer positively correlated with higher network activity; fewer fees are burned regardless of how many users are transacting on the network.\n\nNevertheless, the total supply of ETH since the Merge has plunged significantly, with an overall reduction of 345,000 ETH. Around 1.36 billion ETH has been issued, but more than that has been burned.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s inflationary rate increasing post-Dencun, the purchasing power of ETH is reducing, which may have a negative impact on investors.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH was worth $3,374 at the time of writing, down 4.8% in the past week in correlation with the drawdown in the crypto market."

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Could Skyrocket to $22,000 by 2030 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum continues to be a tech disruptor. But will it really be worth over $2 trillion by 2030?\n\nThrough the first six months of the year, Ethereum (ETH -5.65%) is up 50%. That's right in line with the performance of Bitcoin (BTC -3.04%), which is also up 50%. At its current price of $3,500, Ethereum is within striking distance of its all-time high of $4,891.\n\nBut the best may be yet to come. Investment firm VanEck recently predicted that Ethereum could hit a price of $22,000 by 2030. That might sound overly aggressive, but VanEck has some solid data to back up its prediction. So will it be right or not?\n\nEthereum's disruptive ability\n\nFor the better part of the past decade, we've seen Ethereum disrupt the tech sector. Ethereum was the first smart contract blockchain platform. It pioneered entire sectors of the crypto world -- such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that had never existed before. VanEck is counting on Ethereum's ability to remain a tech disruptor over the next five years to warrant such a hefty valuation.\n\nMost importantly, VanEck sees Ethereum making further inroads into the finance, banking, and payments sectors. And VanEck also sees Ethereum building value in sectors ranging from blockchain gaming to artificial intelligence (AI). The key to disruption will be Ethereum's ability to provide solutions that are cheaper, faster, and better than those currently available from market leaders.\n\nThe $15 trillion opportunity\n\nThat's where things get interesting, because VanEck digs into the numbers to estimate the total potential market opportunity (which it refers to as total addressable market, or TAM). That number could be as high as $15 trillion. The lion's share of this value ($10.9 trillion) will come from finance, banking, and payments. And there is a growing market opportunity ($1.4 trillion) that could result from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe logic here is simple but powerful: Ethereum will continue to roll out disruptive solutions that make it possible to win market share from entrenched incumbents. And the big push will be in DeFi, where a rich, vibrant ecosystem already exists. Just think of how upstart decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are winning market share from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.39%).\n\nWhen you consider key future trends such as asset tokenization (which involves moving real-world financial assets onto the blockchain), it's possible to understand just how big the DeFi opportunity might be. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has suggested that smart contract networks such as Ethereum could be generating fees of $450 billion by 2030.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nAnd, finally, there's the matter of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. These recently won approval from regulators and are expected to start trading soon. Once they do, they could lead to a huge influx of new money into Ethereum. VanEck now predicts that the impact of these new ETFs could be greater than that of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThat's highly debatable, though. As one of the firms that will be launching a spot Ethereum ETF, VanEck may be overestimating the potential impact of these ETFs. In comparison, JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.81%) predicts these new ETFs might only attract $3 billion in new investor money. That's about one-tenth of what the new spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted.\n\nA $2 trillion asset?\n\nVanEck provides three different scenarios for the future value of Ethereum. In the base case scenario, VanEck predicts a price of $22,000. In the bull case scenario, VanEck predicts a price of $154,000. And, in a bear case scenario, VanEck predicts that the price of Ethereum could collapse to just $360. Yikes!\n\nThat's a wide range of outcomes to work with, and that's what makes investing in Ethereum potentially so risky. Yes, Ethereum could soar to a price of $22,000, giving it a massive $2 trillion market cap. But it could also lose nearly 90% of its value and be banished to the dustbin of history.\n\nKeep in mind that Ethereum is not the only blockchain going after that $15 trillion market opportunity. There are plenty of other blockchain competitors, each one promising solutions that are cheaper, faster, and better. So if you're thinking about investing in Ethereum, make sure you do your due diligence and have a good grasp of the assumptions being used to predict a price of $22,000."

        "content": "The Cardano Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the popular proof-of-stake blockchain, has boosted the level of interoperability by integrating the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe integration now makes it easier for developers to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based applications on Cardano sidechain.\n\nThe standardized protocol, which was originally introduced back in 2019 by Cosmos Network, makes it possible to bridge several heterogeneous blockchains by sending information via special channels. Data can be easily transferred by blockchain with different consensus mechanisms. No direct communication between them is required in order to ensure the validity of certain information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Cardano, for instance, enterprises that rely on the ICB protocol can still take advantage of the network's deterministic fees and other advantages while working with other chains. \"With the implementation of IBC on Cardano, businesses benefit from a framework for developing and deploying scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solutions,\" the foundation said.\n\nA governance controversy\n\nIn other news, the foundation recently stirred some controversy with its voting decision earlier this week.\n\nDuring a bootstrapping phase, which will take place between the two stages of the hard fork's implementation, the foundation will become a member of an Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC).\n\nIt has already taken part in the ICC election, placing The Cardano Atlantic Council at the top of its ratings. When voting for candidates, it takes into account such factors as the level of engagement, technical expertise, transparency, and so on.\n\nHowever, the foundation faced some pushback from some members of the community who believe that it had to rule itself out from the entire ICC voting process. \"I think it is wrong that Cardano Foundation should put their thumb on the scales,\" one user commented."

A lawyer associated with one of the issuers stated that approval is likely just a week or two away.\n\nEight asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, and Grayscale Investments which had previously launched spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs such as iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, are seeking SEC approval for the funds.\n\nSee Also: Here\u2019s How Much Profit Donald Trump Would Make If He Sold His TRUMP Memecoin Today\n\nWhy It Matters: The launch of funds tracking the spot price of Bitcoin BTC/USD in January was a massive success, attracting about $8 billion in assets. As of late June, these nine new products have nearly $38 billion in assets. However, some ETF and cryptocurrency analysts believe the launch of the new spot ether ETFs will be less impressive due to ether\u2019s smaller market cap and trading volumes.\n\nThe latest speculation comes a week after Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas moved up the launch date for the ETFs to July 2. Balchunas had said that there was a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the SEC would declare them effective and get it off their plate before the holiday weekend.\n\nIn a recent interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler highlighted the smooth progress of ETF filings He indicated that the final decision lies with asset managers to make full disclosures for the registration statements to go into effect.\n\nWhile the enthusiasm was palpable, a few analysts predicted that the launch could potentially lead to a 30% drop in Ether's price.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Ether was exchanging hands at $3,377.13, following a 1.06% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Shutterstock.com\n\nRead Next: Congressman Matt Gaetz Introduces Bill To Allow Federal Tax Payments In Bitcoin\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors."

        "content": "VanEck has recently announced the launch of a new ETF on Ethereum (ETH) with zero fees until 2025. With this move, VanEck demonstrates its intention to keep up with the times and offer its clients an investment opportunity without additional costs.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details about it and other news.\n\nVanEck files Form 8A for the new spot ETF on Ethereum (ETH): no fees\n\nAs anticipated, recently VanEck submitted the 8A form for its spot ETF on Ethereum. Market analysts still hypothesize July 2 as a possible launch date for these new funds.\n\nVanEck just filed 8-A form for spot Eth, which is just part of process, but.. should be noted that they filed their 8-A for spot bitcoin exactly 7 days before launch. Good sign for our July 2nd over/under (7 days from now). But again, anything poss. Sure we'll hear more soon.. https://t.co/2BlkDnWhrz \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 25, 2024\n\nFurthermore, VanEck has decided to adopt an innovative approach by completely waiving the fees for its ETF.\n\nMatthew Sigel, head of digital assets at VanEck, communicated via email that the company will not apply any fees for its ETF on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the duration of this promotional offer has not been specified, it is likely that it will last until 2025.\n\nHowever, if the fund\u2019s assets were to reach 1.5 billion dollars before that date, the zero-cost structure will be revoked and a 0.20% fee will be applied.\n\nEric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that it is rare for issuers to reveal their fee structure so early, even before the official launch. VanEck is not the only company taking this direction.\n\nFranklin Templeton, for example, has already declared that it will charge a fee of 0.19% for its spot ETF on Ethereum. Commenting on the situation, Balchunas stated the following:\n\n\u201cWhat BlackRock intends to charge is probably the most uncertain variable outside of the exact launch date. Their fee will be the benchmark for all the others. It must be competitive.\u201d\n\nVanEck is aware of the initial losses resulting from the adoption of a zero-commission policy. In an email sent to ETF.com, Sigel stated:\n\n\u201cVanEck aims to be a leader in cryptocurrency ETF fees, even at the cost of losing money initially. The goal is to recover through volume; in this case, the volume of decentralized finance.\u201d\n\nSpot ETF on Ethereum: expected demand lower compared to Bitcoin, according to Bernstein\n\nThe Spot ETF on Ethereum, recently approved, is expected to attract significantly less interest from investors compared to the ETF on Bitcoin, according to a report published on Monday by Bernstein.\n\nThe management company has predicted that this second ETF based on cryptocurrencies will attract demand on a very small scale.\n\nAlthough the ETF on Ethereum has not yet been launched, the market is eagerly awaiting its arrival. However, experts point out that the lack of staking functionality in the ETF on Ethereum could reduce spot conversions.\n\nFurthermore, the current market conditions could further dampen interest in this product once it becomes available. Despite the approval of the product, a timeline for the start of trading has not yet been established.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States approved a crucial regulatory filing last month, fueling speculation that the ETF could be launched in July.\n\nBernstein has stated the following:\n\n\u201cEthereum as the main platform for tokenization is building a solid use case, both for stablecoin payments and for the tokenization of traditional assets and funds.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, they stated that an \u201cimproved regulatory regime\u201d would be beneficial for Ethereum. However, it is unlikely that such a change will occur before the next presidential elections in the United States in November.\n\nThe supply of Ether increases: inflation after the Dencun update\n\nThe supply of Ether (ETH) has reached its longest inflationary period since the Merge that occurred in 2022. It seems that the Dencun update of the blockchain, implemented in March, is the main cause of this increase.\n\nAccording to the data from the Ethereum ultrasound.money dashboard, the supply of Ether has gradually increased, with over 112,000 ETH added to the total supply since April 14.\n\nMuch of this inflationary growth is attributable to the Dencun update, introduced on March 13.\n\nThis update has implemented nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), including the EIP-4844, which seems to be the main cause of the increase in supply.\n\nThe EIP-4844 has introduced \u201cblob\u201d, a mechanism that allows for temporarily and separately storing transaction data, thus reducing the fees paid for block data on Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks.\n\nThe Dencun update also introduced proto-danksharding, which improved efficiency in data availability for block space on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis development has led to a significant reduction in transaction execution costs on Ethereum layer-2 networks, such as Arbitrum and Optimism. However, it has also resulted in a notable decrease in the total amount of ETH burned on the mainnet.\n\nDespite the supply of ETH increasing in an inflationary manner in recent months, the overall supply of ETH has still decreased significantly after the Merge.\n\nSince September 2022, more than 1.5 billion ETH have been burned, while 1.36 billion ETH have been added to the supply, leading to a net reduction in the supply of 345,000 ETH.\n\nThis decrease corresponds to just over 1.1 billion dollars at current market prices, since Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism."

        "title": "Why Ethereum is Not a Commodity \u2013 Opinion - Securities.io",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been at the heart of regulatory debates for several years. The key question remains: Is Ethereum a commodity, a security, or something else entirely? In this opinion piece, I will argue why Ethereum does not meet the criteria to be considered a commodity. Instead, I believe Ethereum is best understood as a utility token.\n\nTo classify Ethereum as a commodity, it would need to meet specific criteria, which it does not. Firstly, Ethereum was launched with pre-mined tokens. During its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014, 60 million Ether (ETH) were sold to the public, while 12 million were allocated to the development fund. This pre-mining activity is more characteristic of securities, as it involves an initial distribution controlled by the developers.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap is highly structured and transparent. The Ethereum Foundation and core development teams, such as those within ConsenSys, outline detailed plans for future upgrades, including the significant transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0. Commodities typically do not have such centralized and planned development trajectories.\n\nCore developers in the Ethereum ecosystem play a crucial role in leading protocol changes. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, and other prominent developers consistently propose and implement updates. This centralization of decision-making contrasts with the decentralized nature of commodities, which do not rely on a core team for their evolution.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum ecosystem has substantial backing from venture capitalists (VCs) and institutional investors. These stakeholders often influence the direction and development of the network, similar to how shareholders might influence a corporation. Such dynamics are more aligned with securities, where investor interests are paramount, rather than commodities, which are typically free of such concentrated influence.\n\nEthereum\u2019s tokens were also sold both publicly and privately, with the ICO being a primary example. This method of distribution is characteristic of securities offerings, where tokens are sold to raise capital for development and operations. Commodities do not usually undergo such sale processes before their availability on the market.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 raises questions about whether this mechanism affects its classification. PoS operates on a system where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. While PoS changes the consensus mechanism, it does not fundamentally alter the nature of Ethereum's distribution or governance.\n\nTo determine whether Ethereum is a security, we can apply the Howey Test, a legal standard that assesses whether a transaction qualifies as an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d The Howey Test consists of four criteria:\n\nAn investment of money, In a common enterprise, With an expectation of profits, Derived from the efforts of others.\n\nEther was purchased with the expectation that it would increase in value. The funds raised from the ICO were pooled to develop the Ethereum network, indicating a common enterprise. Many investors bought Ether with the expectation of profiting from its appreciation. The success and value of Ethereum are heavily dependent on the efforts of the core developers and the broader Ethereum community. Based on these criteria, one could argue that Ethereum resembles a security more than a commodity. However, the decentralized nature and utility of the Ethereum network differentiate it from traditional securities.\n\nThe classification of Ethereum as a security or commodity has significant implications, particularly in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been scrutinizing cryptocurrencies. In 2018, former SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman suggested that Ethereum might not be a security due to its decentralized structure. However, more recent statements from SEC officials imply that this view could change as the regulatory landscape evolves. Outside the United States, regulatory approaches vary. For instance, in Switzerland, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) categorizes tokens based on their function and transferability, often distinguishing between payment tokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens. Ethereum's broad utility within decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts aligns it more closely with a utility token under FINMA's framework.\n\nA utility token is designed to provide access to a product or service within a blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum's primary function is to facilitate operations within its decentralized platform. It powers dApps, executes smart contracts, and serves as \u201cgas\u201d to pay for transactions on the network. These functionalities underscore its utility rather than its investment potential. Utility tokens are not typically classified as securities because they are not primarily bought for investment purposes but rather for their inherent utility within a blockchain ecosystem. This distinction is crucial in understanding Ethereum's role and value.\n\nThe classification of Ethereum as a security, commodity, or utility token has profound implications for its regulatory treatment and adoption. In the United States, securities are subject to stringent regulations, including registration requirements and investor protections. If Ethereum were classified as a security, it could face significant legal and operational hurdles, potentially stifling innovation and growth. Conversely, if Ethereum is recognized as a utility token, it may benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment, fostering broader adoption and development. This distinction also matters globally, as different jurisdictions have varying regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum does not meet the criteria to be classified as a commodity. Its pre-mined tokens, structured development roadmap, centralized leadership, venture capital backing, and method of token distribution align it more closely with characteristics of securities. However, its extensive utility within the blockchain ecosystem and the decentralized nature of its operations suggest it should be classified as a utility token. The debate over Ethereum's classification is not merely academic; it has real-world implications for developers, investors, and regulators. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize Ethereum's unique position in the cryptocurrency space and advocate for a regulatory framework that acknowledges its utility and fosters innovation. Ultimately, the classification of Ethereum as a utility token offers the best understanding of its role and value, balancing regulatory oversight with the need to support the growth and development of decentralized technologies. I am still looking forward to Ethereum Spot ETFs in the US soon."

A rebound from the $3,260 level can help the buyers regain some momentum.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,362, up by nearly 3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nCan ETH bulls reverse the bearish trend?\n\nETH sellers have consistently held the resistance level near the $4,000 mark as the altcoins for over three months. The $3,900 ceiling blocked ETH\u2019s 35% rally last month and pulled the price below the 20-day and 50-day EMAs.\n\nThe resulting price action chalked out a classic descending channel pattern on ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nShould the upper trendline of this descending channel continue to resist bull runs, ETH could continue its downtrend in the short term. In this case, the $2,800 region could help provoke a bullish rebound.\n\nOn the other hand, a potential close above the current pattern can set the stage for bulls to trigger a rally. In such a case, The first significant resistance level for the buyers would be in the $3,900 region.\n\nThe Stochastic RSI showed extremely oversold readings at the time of writing. Buyers should wait for a potential bullish crossover to gauge ETH\u2019s near-term bullish potential.\n\nPrice action rising above the 20/50 EMA and a bullish crossover on stochastic RSI together could create a strong buy signal for traders.\n\nEthereum: Bearish edge emerges\n\nAccording to data from Hyperblockcapital, ETH\u2019s Open Interest indicator marked an uptrend (higher highs) over the past month.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, the price action saw lower highs during this time. This reading typically suggests a bearish divergence\u2013 where more traders are entering short positions rather than long positions.\n\nAlso, the total net exchange flows over the past day increased by nearly 140% to reaffirm the overall bearish sentiment. ETH\u2019s rebound from the $3.2K\u2013$3.3K support range would be crucial to break the bearish narrative."

        "content": "Exploring Blast (BLAST): A Yield-Bearing Ethereum Layer 2 Solution Darius Baruo Discover Blast (BLAST), an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol offering yield on ETH and stablecoins. Learn about its features, tokenomics, and how to buy BLAST.\n\nBlast, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is making waves in the crypto community with its unique integration of native yield for ETH and stablecoins. According to blog.bitfinex.com, this protocol distributes yield from decentralized sources like ETH staking and on-chain T-Bill protocols directly to users, offering a 4% yield on ETH and a 5% yield on stablecoins.\n\nKey Features of Blast\n\nBlast operates as an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup, making it easier for users and developers to benefit from higher baseline yields without altering the familiar Ethereum experience. A standout feature is its auto-rebasing mechanism, which adjusts balances in user accounts to reflect accrued yield. This mechanism is applied natively for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and can be optionally enabled for smart contracts, allowing seamless integration with existing Decentralised Applications (DApps).\n\nThe yield generation is facilitated by Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 staking rewards, particularly through protocols like Lido, which automatically transfer yield to Blast users via the rebasing mechanism. Additionally, users who bridge stablecoins to Blast receive USDB, a stablecoin whose yield is derived from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. This ensures users benefit continuously from competitive yield rates, whether they hold ETH or stablecoins.\n\nGas Revenue Sharing Model\n\nAnother notable feature of Blast is its unique gas revenue sharing model. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions that retain gas fee revenue, Blast redistributes this revenue back to DApps programmatically. This allows DApp developers to either keep the revenue or use it to subsidize gas fees for their users, promoting a more cost-effective and attractive environment for DApp usage.\n\nWhat is the BLAST Token?\n\nThe BLAST token serves multiple pivotal roles within the Blast ecosystem. It is essential for governance, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes regarding protocol upgrades and yield strategies. This decentralized governance model ensures the community has a significant say in shaping the platform\u2019s future.\n\nBLAST tokens are also crucial for staking within the ecosystem. Users can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards in return. This staking mechanism incentivizes users to contribute to the network\u2019s security and helps maintain the ecosystem's overall health and stability.\n\nAdditionally, BLAST tokens facilitate various transactional activities within the ecosystem, such as paying for transaction fees on the Blast Layer 2 network. This ensures operations are cost-effective and efficient, given the high gas fees often associated with transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. The transaction fees collected in BLAST tokens are redistributed within the ecosystem, supporting further development and incentivization.\n\nBLAST Tokenomics\n\nThe Blast airdrop initiative rewards early adopters and participants within the ecosystem. Users can earn Blast Points and Blast Gold through activities like maintaining balances in ETH, WETH, and USDB, or participating in DApps on the platform. Points are distributed automatically based on the balance held in users\u2019 wallets or smart contracts, and users can earn multipliers by engaging with highlighted DApps.\n\nDespite the active engagement through the airdrop, detailed information about the tokenomics of BLAST is still pending. Users are encouraged to join the Blast community to stay informed about the latest developments, including updates on the airdrop and detailed tokenomics.\n\nHow to Buy BLAST\n\nTo buy BLAST with cryptocurrency, log in to your Bitfinex account, go to the Deposit page, choose the crypto you plan to buy BLAST with, generate a deposit address on the Exchange wallet, and send the crypto to the generated address. Once the funds arrive, you can trade them for BLAST.\n\nTo buy BLAST with fiat, log in to your Bitfinex account, get full verification, go to the Deposit page under the Bank Wire menu, choose the fiat currency for your deposit, check your email for wire details, send the funds, and once they arrive, you can use them to buy BLAST.\n\nBlast also offers mobile options for on-the-go purchases.\n\nBLAST Community Channels\n\nFor more information and updates, visit the Blast website, follow them on X (Twitter), or join their Discord community."

        "content": "The recently approved Spot Ethereum ETF is expected to see far lower demand from investors than its Bitcoin counterpart, Bernstein says. Indeed, the management firm released a research report Monday forecasting the second crypto-based exchange-traded product to see demand on a much lower scale.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF has yet to go live, with the market anxiously awaiting its arrival. Yet, the lack of staking features in the ETH option means less spot conversion, experts have stated. Additionally, the state of the market could further lessen interest in the product when it goes live.\n\nSource: Wealth Management\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Applicants File Updated S-1 Documents With SEC\n\nEther ETF Demand to be Notable Lesser Than BTC\n\nIn January, Bitcoin\u2019s Spot ETF approval changed the game for cryptocurrencies. It was a massive catalyst for the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s surge to an all-time high of $73,000 just three months later. Yet, analysts are not expecting the same to take place for the second digital asset to get the investment product.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, the incoming Ethereum ETF will not garner the same demand as Bitcoin when it launches. \u201cETH should not see as much spot ETH conversion due to the lack of an ETH staking feature in the ETF,\u201d the firm\u2019s Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: After Ethereum ETF, Dogecoin; Solana; And XRP Next In Line?\n\nAlthough the product has been approved, there is no timetable for it to begin trading. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a critical regulatory filing from issues last month, leading to rumors it could launch in July.\n\n\u201cETH as a primary tokenization platform is building up a strong use-case, both for stablecoin payments, as well as tokenization of traditional assets and funds,\u201d Bernstein added.\u201d They also said that an \u201cimproved regulatory regime,\u201d would be a benefit to ETH. Such a shift isn\u2019t likely to come to fruition until the impending US presidential election in November."

        "title": "Dogecoin, Solana, And Cardano ETFs Could Follow Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 How The Crypto Market Will React - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Could Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs follow on the heels of Spot Ethereum ETFs? Industry experts believe so. Meanwhile, ETFSwap provides the most secure platform for trading Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNotable figures in the crypto space predict that the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs will launch an avalanche of proposals for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) is garnering increasing attention from traders for its unique offering of diverse ETFs on a user-friendly platform equipped with industry-leading AI trading tools.\n\nWhy Traders Say They Have \u201cThe Best Trading Experience\u201d Trading Spot Ethereum ETFs On ETFSwap (ETFS)\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) is a platform for trading and investing in tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on the blockchain. It enables investors to diversify their portfolios with secure, legitimate tokenized assets backed by real-world securities purchased from traditional financial markets. This is possible because ETFSwap (ETFS) works with MiCa-compliant regulated investment banks to deal in securities and crypto trading.\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) offers traders the potential to earn heightened profits with up to 10x leverage on all trades, 50-60x leverage on perpetual futures and options trading, as well as optimal liquidity. The platform also provides the tools and support to manage leveraged trades effectively so traders can take advantage of opportunities while mitigating risks.\n\nUsing advanced AI-powered tools like the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, ETFSwap (ETFS) investors are empowered to make better-informed trading decisions. With artificial intelligence, these tools analyze large amounts of market data to identify trends and provide insights into the best assets to invest in for maximum profits.\n\nETFSwap\u2019s (ETFS) responsive, easy-to-use interface has drawn praise from traders using the platform. They say they always easily access the features and screens they need, whether they are executing trades, checking their portfolios, staking ETFS, or trading perps.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Approval Could Pave The Way For Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, And Cardano ETFs\n\nFollowing its declaration of Ethereum (ETH) as a commodity, the SEC announced it should fully support the Spot Ethereum ETFs by the Summer of 2024. Industry experts say this could open the doors for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs to enter the crypto market.\n\nCanadian firm 3Qi has filed a proposal with securities regulatory authorities in Canada to approve what could be North America\u2019s first Solana ETFs. If granted, US Solana firms could start filing proposals for Solana ETF approval with the SEC, and Dogecoin ETFs and Cardano ETFs may follow.\n\nCardano ETFs may also enter the crypto market before long. Cardano (ADA) is the 10th largest cryptocurrency on the planet by market capitalization and boasts a more secure and scalable blockchain than most others. With its oft-intense competition with bigger blockchains, Cardano ETFs could receive approval soon after Solana ETFs.\n\nDespite Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) status as a meme coin without much utility, gaining approval for Dogecoin ETFs is not impossible. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently ranked 9th among the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, one place above Cardano (ADA). So, it is well-positioned to lead meme coins to an age of institutional usage with a Dogecoin ETF. When the proposals start pouring in, Dogecoin ETFs could be among the first to receive approval.\n\nHow Dogecoin, Solana, And Cardano ETFs Will Impact The Crypto Market\n\nFollowing the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a price rally of up to 75% as Whales poured 2,212 BTC into US Bitcoin ETFs. A similar trend is expected for Dogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs once they gain approval.\n\nAlthough bearish market conditions have since sunk Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, tokenized assets are receiving favorable attention. According to Rajagopal Menon Vice President, WazirX, about $2 billion was invested into Bitcoin ETFs over the last week. Ethereum (ETH) also saw a 22% price surge following the SEC\u2019s approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nConclusion\n\nDogecoin ETFs, Solana ETFs, and Cardano ETFs will inevitably follow the SEC\u2019s approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Till then, investors can trade Spot Ethereum ETFs on ETFSwap (ETFS) and earn heightened profits by investing in ETFSwap\u2019s native cryptocurrency ETFS, which analysts believe will make over 200000x.\n\nThe token is currently on presale at $0.01831 and more than twenty-six million tokens have been sold. Investors can accumulate more tokens with the ongoing 20% promo to maximize their returns.\n\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\n\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\n\nJoin The ETFSwap Community"

        "title": "7 Cryptos to Watch This Week: Bitcoin, Ethereum and More - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "If you can\u2019t handle the extreme ebb and flow of high-risk asset classes, the cryptocurrency market probably isn\u2019t right for you. We\u2019re getting a taste of the wildness of the blockchain ecosystem, with the total market capitalization of all cryptos slipping conspicuously on Monday. At the moment, the value of global virtual currencies comes in at $2.26 trillion.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s disappointing for those who recently got into the space. Previously, the sector had done a good job of holding onto the $2.5 trillion market cap support line. Unfortunately, with the benchmark digital assets slipping badly in recent sessions, investors need to prepare for possibly extended rough waters.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing the choppiness in the high seas? Some experts point to the German government standing poised to liquidate a significant amount of cryptos \u201cearned\u201d through illicit means. Further, some evidence exists that the whales \u2014 or the big dogs in the market \u2014 have slowed their trading activity. With the fading momentum, people aren\u2019t as eager to participate in cryptos.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFrankly, the erosion of major tech players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) probably doesn\u2019t help either in terms of ginning up sentiment. Still, that could also spell discounts for the opportunist. Below are several cryptos to watch this week.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nCrypto prices collapse downturn. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) cryptocurrency value drop bear market concept. Doomed Cryptos to Dump. cryptos to sell\n\nSource: Quality Stock Arts / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not time to hit the panic button. However, crypto investors need to pay close attention to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) this week. In the past 24 hours since the clock officially turned to Tuesday morning, the benchmark virtual currency lost more than 2% of market value. Over the past seven days, it sank more than 6%.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not so much the red ink in the basis points that hurt. Rather, it\u2019s that Bitcoin is threatening to slip below \u2014 and perhaps well below \u2014 the critical $60,000 level. Yeah, you can say it\u2019s just a number. But let\u2019s keep in mind that not too long ago, BTC received praise for jumping back up above the 70K milestone. Going backwards is not what the bulls had in mind.\n\nIs it time to buy the volatility, though? I think it might be the right idea but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more downside materializes. So far, the candlestick of the June 25 session is very small compared to the red blotch represented by the Monday session.\n\nMaybe take a nibble but keep the powder keg dry. That would be my idea.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs with the benchmark digital asset, it\u2019s not time to panic on Ethereum (ETH-USD). It is time to put your crosshairs on this bad boy because circumstances are getting volatile. In the past 24 hours, ETH slipped about a half percent. During the trailing one-week period, the number two crypto by market cap dipped around 2%. These stats aren\u2019t what\u2019s important.\n\nStory continues\n\nRather, as with other cryptos, the technical profile for Ethereum appears to be weak. Conspicuously, the popular virtual currency is trading hands at $3,374. That\u2019s below its 50-day moving average, a key barometer for near-term market health. Also, it goes without saying that ETH is off its 20-day exponential moving average.\n\nIf more volatility materializes, which wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, the $3,100 support line must hold. Otherwise, it could be a quick drop to $2,900. That\u2019s the type of activity that the bulls will not want to see.\n\nAs for playing this market, I\u2019m not liking how the response to the June 24 fallout has been so pensive. Again, nibble at Ethereum if you must but keep the powder keg dry.\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nA concept token for the Tether cryptocurrency.\n\nSource: DIAMOND VISUALS / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the mainline stablecoin or cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency (typically the dollar), Tether (USDT-USD) provides a critical look into broader blockchain sentiment. Basically, USDT represents the oil that keeps the digital asset ecosystem\u2019s chains moving smoothly. That\u2019s because crypto investors will convert their wealth into Tether. When opportunities arise, they can respond immediately.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how the theory plays out. If more market participants are comfortable storing their wealth in crypto terms, Tether should rise in value relative to dollars. In other words, USDT should be traded at a higher peg relative to USD. On the other hand, if people are not comfortable with cryptos overall, they\u2019re less likely to hold Tether units. In this case, dollars will be worth more than USDTs.\n\nRight now, one dollar is worth about 0.9996 Tethers. Under a perfect peg, one dollar should be worth one USDT unit. So, the fact that the stablecoin is worth less than a single greenback suggests broader pessimism. That\u2019s not surprising given the evidence that we\u2019ve seen.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t meant to panic investors. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning so that you don\u2019t go too aggressive on cryptos this week. Like I said earlier, you may want to keep the powder keg dry.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nConcept art of the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s move to some potential opportunities in cryptos, beginning with Solana (SOL-USD). What\u2019s interesting about SOL is that unlike many other major digital assets, SOL gained 8% of market value in the past 24 hours. That said, it didn\u2019t move anywhere in the past week, losing about half-a-percent. So, what\u2019s going on with this popular altcoin or alternative crypto?\n\nTechnically, Solana finds itself at an interesting crossroads. Generally, circumstances don\u2019t look particularly pleasant. First, SOL failed to secure its top-level support line around the $178 mark. It then failed to hold the $156 line, represented by its 50-day moving average (DMA). At one point, Solana briefly slipped below its 200 DMA, which sits at $133.\n\nMoving forward, the next few sessions will be critical in establishing the near-term trajectory. Presently, Solana trades hands at approximately $135.50. It really has to move higher from here, perhaps jumping to its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), roughly $145.\n\nIf SOL is unable to make progress, it risks falling to the $100 level. As with the other cryptos, a small position now may be warranted. However, keep the powder keg dry for a bigger discount.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano (ADA) token with blue and orange digital background.\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock\n\nA fan favorite within the altcoin community, Cardano (ADA-USD) enjoys no shortage of supporters. However, it might be put-up-or-shut-up time for the blockchain asset, at least from an immediate perspective. In the past 24 hours, ADA gained about 2.5% of market value. That\u2019s good. In the trailing week, it gained over 2%. That\u2019s even better.\n\nHowever, the problem is that Cardano\u2019s technical profile is very suspect. Presently, the coin trades at just under 39 cents. That\u2019s noticeably below the 20-day EMA, which comes in at 40.6 cents. Also, it\u2019s significantly under its 50 DMA, which stands at 43.9 cents. The 200 DMA? Forget about it \u2014 that\u2019s up at 54.2 cents. Honestly, the bulls need to think about small steps first.\n\nA horizontal support line is evident around the 45.5-cent level. For Cardano to regain credibility immediately, it must move to this mark, full stop. I\u2019m hoping that the legion of supporters will see the discount and bid ADA higher.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that with the whales being pensive, ADA could struggle. For speculators, nibble at the currently cheapened price. Just know that there\u2019s a possibility that Cardano could fall quickly below the 35-cent line.\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\na digital representation of the chainlink (LINK) cryptocurrency\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose seeking a speculative upside wager in cryptos may want to turn their attention to Chainlink (LINK-USD). Let\u2019s look at some interesting stats. During the past 24 hours, LINK gained nearly 7% of market value. Over the course of the last seven days, the cryptocurrency gained more than 2%. Amid the blockchain fallout, those are pretty encouraging numbers.\n\nIt just might get better. LINK has a tendency of see-sawing violently. Throughout much of April and May, the price of the digital asset baselined at approximately $13. However, during the recovery rally late last month, LINK briefly shot up beyond $19 on an intraday basis. That provided temporary hope that sentiment can carry Chainlink back to the $20 level.\n\nUnfortunately, earlier this month, the crypto encountered a series of volatile sessions. The bad news is that the blockchain asset finds itself trading below its 50 and 200 DMAs. However, the good news is that the bears attempted to drive LINK below $13 but failed. Just to repeat, that price represented a prior support line.\n\nMoving forward, it\u2019s possible that LINK could start marching higher. I\u2019ll start getting excited should the price breach its 50 DMA, which stands at $15.71.\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nA concept image for the Uniswap (UNI) token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most popular altcoins for its underlying utility, Uniswap (UNI-USD) dipped about 1% in the trailing 24 hours. During the past one-week period, the digital asset dropped almost 4%. At the moment, the crypto features a market cap of $5.67 billion. That\u2019s good enough for number 18 in terms of the most valuable virtual currencies.\n\nLooking at the technical profile, Uniswap finds itself in an interesting position. Presently, at a price per unit of $9.47, it sits below its 20-day EMA ($9.98). Further, it\u2019s trading right at its 50 DMA. During the June 24 session, the bears managed to drive the price below this key barometer briefly before rebounding. To establish credibility, Uniswap needs to build from here.\n\nOne positive news item is that the price action has held strong above the 200 DMA ($8.79). If a correction materializes, a drop below this point could send the digital asset down to $7.\n\nWhat may work in favor of Uniswap is strong support for the underlying ecosystem. If enough investors jump in, UNI could start moving higher. Still, I would probably keep the powder keg dry just in case for unexpected headwinds.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in BTC, ETH and USDT.

        "content": "With Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recently hinting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be fully approved by September, the FOMO psychology in the crypto market gets even stronger. Hence, major crypto experts say that ETFSwap (ETFS), WienerAI (WAI), and CYBRO are the best bets for anyone looking to leverage the prevailing spot Ethereum ETFs FOMO.\n\nETFSwap (ETFS): The Crypto Investor\u2019s Perfect Bet\n\nETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to pull in massive liquidity from new ether assets upon the full approval of spot Ethereum ETFs as this ecosystem is the only ERC20 provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) assets.

        "title": "Crypto Expert Predicts ETH at $6K by September - Top Presales to Pump with it - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Crypto market charts largely don't look good at the moment.\n\nAll major projects are trading in red, with Bitcoin leading the charge. The main currency plummeted from $73K level to the $61K where it currently stands in just two weeks.\n\nThis is a 7% drop in the last week alone.\n\nRest of the big names aren\u2019t doing much better\u2026 XRP is down by 5%, BNB 3%, Avalanche by 4%.\n\nEthereum on the other hand is sustaining the dip with a small green candle, but green nonetheless.\n\nIn fact, one analyst, degenttrading (@degentradingLSD) gave a very bullish prediction for ETH.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what he had to say, and check out some smaller crypto presales that crypto influencers believe can ride the ETH\u2019s bullish wave.\n\nCan We See ETH at $6,000 By September? Degen Trading Seems to Think So\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been at the centre of many bullish predictions, with some analysts projecting its price could hit $6,000 by September.\n\nOne prominent voice, Degen Trading, outlines several compelling reasons for this optimistic outlook.\n\nDegen Trading highlights the significant increase in CME open interest (OI) from pre-ETF days to now, noting a rise of around $5 billion. This surge suggests that the introduction of Ethereum ETFs could ease trading constraints and unlock a substantial influx of capital into the market.\n\nHowever, Degen Trading also points out the challenges posed by the lack of prime brokers like Genesis, which complicates spot borrowing as a hedge against CME futures longs.\n\nContrasting Ethereum with Bitcoin, Degen Trading argues that Ethereum\u2019s ceiling is higher due to its position as a decentralized global settlement layer or \"world computer,\" compared to Bitcoin's branding as digital gold.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by traditional finance professionals who show more enthusiasm for Ethereum and Solana over Bitcoin.\n\nThe expected conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF is also seen as a positive development, likely facing less selling pressure than its Bitcoin counterpart due to a smaller lender overhang.\n\nA critical aspect of Degen Trading's analysis is Ethereum's relative illiquidity compared to Bitcoin.\n\nWith Ethereum's liquidity being only about 10% of Bitcoin\u2019s, an influx of $3-4 billion could significantly impact ETH\u2019s price, potentially pushing it towards the $6,000 mark.\n\nAdditionally, the current bearish sentiment on Crypto Twitter is viewed as an ideal technical setup for a bullish reversal as the Ethereum ETF launch approaches.\n\nThese factors combined present a strong case for Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach $6,000 by September.\n\nHowever, this growth would only amount to a bit less than 2X from ETH\u2019s current price point, so we wanted to highlight some project that can provide much bigger profits, in the 10X to 100X range.\n\nCrypto Presales That Can Provide Bigger Gains than ETH \u2013 Quick Overview\n\nBefore we make a detailed analysis, let\u2019s check out the basics of these presales that can provide bigger profits than Ethereum in 2024:\n\nCrypto Presales That Can Provide Bigger Gains than ETH \u2013 Detailed Analysis\n\nNow we can take a look at these presales in more detail:\n\nPepe Unchained ($PEPU) \u2013 A Next-Level Meme Coin with Layer 2 Tech\n\nPepe Unchained ($PEPU), a recent entrant in the presale market, has quickly garnered over $600,000 in funding since its launch late last week.\n\nUnlike many copycat tokens that follow the success of popular coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE), Pepe Unchained aims to elevate the concept to new heights.\n\nOne of the standout features of Pepe Unchained is its upcoming launch of a proprietary layer-2 network.\n\nThis development promises enhanced speed, security, and lower transaction fees, making it a robust platform for both transactions and meme culture.\n\nThe introduction of double staking rewards further enhances its appeal, offering investors an opportunity for substantial returns once the token lists on exchanges.\n\nPepe Unchained is positioned not just as another meme coin but as an improved version of its predecessor, integrating advanced technology and rewarding mechanisms that could drive significant growth and investor interest.\n\nDOUBLE YOUR REWARDS WITH PEPE UNCHAINED STAKING!\n\nPlayDoge ($PLAY) \u2013 Combining Nostalgia and Blockchain in a Unique Play-to-Earn Experience\n\nPlayDoge ($PLAY) brings a fresh twist to mobile play-to-earn (P2E) gaming by merging the charm of Tamagotchi with cutting-edge blockchain technology.

        "title": "Who Knew The SEC Closing The Ethereum Investigation Would Be Bearish For ETH and Altcoins; Here Is A Crypto Gem To Make It All Back With - The Portugal News",
        "content": "The recent closure of the investigation initiated by the SEC had a major unexpected drawback on Ethereum (ETH) and several other altcoins including Solana (SOL), Cardano, and Polygon.\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 27 Jun 2024, 09:31 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nMany analysts and traders expecting a bullish outcome based on the data results were shocked as these altcoins trended downwards, with investors leaving to find more stable investments. Despite these negative trends, a top DeFi token, Rollblock (RBLK), has emerged to help investors regain their losses in the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of The SEC Investigation On Ethereum (ETH)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 20, 2024, after the SEC closed its investigations, Ethereum (ETH) saw a brief uptick in price to $3,608.25. However, to the dismay of investors, this wasn\u2019t a lasting growth as the price immediately fell to $3,502 and has since trended downwards, now sitting at $3,403.\n\nThis Ethereum price drop led to greater market instability, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) also trending downward. Investors looking for the best altcoins to invest in are now more cautious about their investment and seek promising investments that don\u2019t display heightened volatility.\n\nThis market reaction to the SEC update underscores the importance of having stable cryptocurrencies with high growth potential in every investor\u2019s portfolio. It also shows how major assets like Ethereum can upset the balance of the entire market. With innovative tokens connected to high-growth industries, investors can experience stable portfolio growth unaffected by changes in major coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRollblock ($RBLK) Stands Out As a Potential Henge Against Crypto Volatility\n\n\n\n\n\nRollblock (RBLK) is a new protocol that aims to disrupt both the GambleFi and casino industry. This project, built on Ethereum, has a live casino and allows $RBLK token holders to receive a percentage of revenues generated by its casino, which will result in a steady increase in investor profits as the platform grows. To guarantee a growing crypto platform, Rollblock has designed several initiatives capitalizing on the $540.3 billion gambling industry.\n\nThe traditional online gaming industry has struggled with transparency and trust when placing bets. With no desire to risk their funds on rigged games, many players now refuse to place bets, negatively impacting the industry's growth. Rollblock provides a solution to this by using blockchain technology to secure all transactions. All users are guaranteed a secure bet, and bets can\u2019t be changed once placed.\n\nWhile playing games, Rollblock will reward users with the $RBLK tokens which they can then use to play more games, win, and grow their funds. The platform has seen a huge influx of users, 100s daily, in just two months due to its easy-to-access system, requiring no KYC from gamers before accessing hundreds of games on the platform. Users only need to open an account with an email or crypto wallet, deposit from a selection of over 20 cryptocurrencies, and start playing different games with instant wins and payouts. This has accounted to Rollblock currently having 3000+ registered users already.\n\nAs the platform grows, Rollblocks price is expected to soar a massive 720%. This is huge for investors, who can not only profit from price increases, but also Rollblocks revenue share model.\n\nUp to 30% of the casino revenue will be used to buy back the RBLK tokens from the open market. 50% of purchased tokens will be allocated for rewards, and 50% will be burned to increase token value.\n\nIn addition to the Rollblock revenue share model, players on the platform can also stake their $RBLK to earn more rewards and bonuses. Any $RBLK earned can be converted into other cryptocurrencies or fiat at low transaction fees and fast processing times.\n\nInvestors struggling to find the best token to invest in and those looking to regain the money they\u2019ve lost from Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins have a huge opportunity with the Rollblock ($RBLK) presale. Currently in stage 3 of the presale with a price of $0.014, analysts have already predicted that Rollblock could see an 800% rise in the next few weeks before the presale is over. Investors who get in early enough could not only enjoy these profits, but could see an additional 100x rally once RBLK is listed on major exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\n\n\n\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to recover above the $3,420 resistance zone. ETH is consolidating and might decline again if there is a move below $3,320.\n\nEthereum is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $3,420 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair must clear the $3,400 and $3,425 resistance levels to continue higher.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Hurdles\n\nEthereum price started a decent recovery wave above the $3,320 level. ETH even cleared the $3,350 level but the bears were active near $3,420. A high was formed at $3,426 and the price corrected gains like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $3,380 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,230 swing low to the $3,426 high. The bulls are now trying to protect more downsides below the $3,320 level.\n\nEthereum is still trading below $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near the trend line and $3,400. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,420 level. The main resistance is near the $3,450 level. A close above the $3,450 level might send Ether toward the $3,550 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,620. An upside break above the $3,620 resistance might send the price higher. The next hurdle sits at $3,680, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,720 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Drop In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,350. The first major support sits near the $3,320 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,230 swing low to the $3,426 high.\n\nA clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward $3,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,200 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,320\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,400"

        "title": "Smart Money Moves In: Ethereum, Cosmos, and Angry Pepe Fork Lead Crypto Rally As Others Stall - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Under a dynamic turn of events in the altcoin market, Ethereum, Cosmos, and a new entrant, Angry Pepe Fork, are leading a notable rally attracting large interest and money from astute investors. These altcoins have exploded ahead, showing strong performance and fresh investor confidence while other altcoins battle to keep momentum. Let us find out more.\n\nAngry Pepe Fork: One Of The Promising Alt Coins To Watch\n\nAngry Pepe Fork is a glimmer of hope for rebels and outlaws determined to overturn the current meme-themed coin situation. The Angry Pepe Fork army has a great opportunity to earn and grow thanks to APORK\u2019s unique \u201cConquer To Earn\u201d system. Additionally, as the community stakes its tokens and rewards both individual and group efforts with each zombie coin defeated, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) increases.\n\nMoreover, whether you are staking for the long term or the short term, there are advantages at every turn. Depending on their desired level of commitment, participants can modify their earnings during the 30, 60, and 90-day tier-based lock-in periods. This novel approach makes a lot more sense because during the presale phase, participants can begin staking and earning money. Furthermore, the current market decline presents a chance to purchase a large quantity of APORK tokens in advance of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s anticipated bull run.\n\nFurthermore, analysts project that the price of Angry Pepe Fork will have risen by 500% by the end of the presale. Meanwhile, SOLIDProof has thoroughly reviewed the platform\u2019s smart contract, ensuring a reliable and secure investment. It is strongly advised that you become a part of this movement because each token is now only being sold for $0.014 during the initial presale stage.\n\nThe APORK project will also pique your interest if you liked Angry Pepe Frog or missed the initial phases of the native Pepe coin. Notably, presale revenue for this project has already exceeded $169,000, and by the end of the following month, it is anticipated to reach $1 million. Additionally, by only issuing 1.9 billion tokens, APORK intends to maintain scarcity. This could result in a sharp increase in the value of APORK tokens due to strong demand and limited supply.\n\nEthereum Price Consolidates\n\nGensler emphasized that asset managers are currently the center of attention. Moreover, Spot Ethereum ETFs, according to Gensler\u2019s initial suggestion, would launch in the summer. The 19b-4 forms were approved by the SEC last month, opening the door for this investment class. S-1 filings are currently being worked on by the SEC and issuers; approval is required before the products can start trading.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch on July 2, according to some knowledgeable analysts. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price has been consolidating between the $3,620 and $3,250 levels over the past week. However, analysts expect a bullish breakout in the coming days.\n\nCosmos Price Prediction\n\nAs of July 26, 2024, the Cosmos price is expected to increase by 2.01% to $7.05 based on a current Cosmos price prediction. Moreover, technical indicators indicate that the current mood is bearish, and over the previous 30 days, Cosmos had 13/30 (43%) green days and 9.47% price volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, the projected yearly low Cosmos price for 2025 is $6.19, based on the token\u2019s past price fluctuations and BTC halving cycles. It is anticipated that Cosmos will cost as much as $30.37 in the upcoming year. As of right now, the Cosmos price prediction for 2025 ranges from a low of $6.19 to a high of $30.37. If Cosmos hits the higher price target, Cosmos could see a 343.87% increase in value by 2025 compared to its current price.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, Cosmos, and Angry Pepe Fork are rising as notable performers as the altcoin market undergoes a dynamic change that attracts much attention from smart investors. These altcoins are not only keeping great momentum but also show great promise for large returns.\n\nMeanwhile, with its creative \u201cConquer To Earn\u201d approach, which provides special staking chances and expected great yields, Angry Pepe Fork is creating waves. APORK is positioned for amazing expansion, maybe rising by 500% by the end of its presale with a well-reviewed smart contract and a strategic approach to token shortage. Its appealing presale price and great community support make it one of the promising alt coins to watch.\n\nVisit Angry Pepe Fork Presale"
