        "title": "Ethereum spot ETFs are next - Blockworks",
        "content": "The new bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds mark the brink of an era that will see trillions pour into tokenization.\n\nThe moment BlackRock filed its iShares Bitcoin Trust application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it was obvious it would get approved. The evidence was on page 36 of the 111-page filing, which references the \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between NASDAQ and a US BTC Spot Market Platform (read: Coinbase). Add to that BlackRock\u2019s 575-1 ETF application approval record, and the writing was on the wall.\n\nBut the SEC was also explicit about its real concerns with crypto market manipulation. Manipulation related to bitcoin prices was cited in most, if not all, previous ETF rejections. The SEC isn\u2019t convinced Coinbase and other crypto exchanges can be trusted to \u201cprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\nAfter the ETF approval, we may not be experiencing the record flows of billions of dollars in its aftermath that reporters predicted. But, we are experiencing \u201ccrypto\u2019s top enemy\u201d and arguably the largest opponent to blockchain adoption in the US finally acquiescing to its place in the market.\n\nIncoming will be an imminent approval of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund with parallels to the legal precedents set by the bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the tokenization space since 2017. And I\u2019ve been saying since then that every financial asset will one day be on a blockchain. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, finally agrees. ETFs, he says, are just a mere stepping stone to \u201cthe technological revolution in financial markets\u201d that includes \u201cthe tokenization of every financial asset.\u201d Fink\u2019s future vision looks something like this: \u201cEvery bond will have its own CUSIP, it will be on one general ledger\u201d and \u201cthis eliminates all corruption, by having a tokenized system.\u201d\n\nHistorically, markets have been plagued with integrity issues. Transactions require trust that the other party will uphold their end of the bargain. Financial institutions, both commercial and regulatory, have blossomed as a way to mediate this. Yet, all this does is require participants to place their trust in centralized third-parties whose operations are opaque and, quite frankly, not immune to corruption.\n\nBlockchain technology reduces this reliance on third parties and the risks it brings. It\u2019s optimistic for Fink to say blockchain can eliminate all illicit behavior \u2014 criminals will always find a way to be criminals. But blockchain can offer more transparent, traceable transactions in real-time that prevents fraud and lets regulators track illicit behavior much more easily and effectively.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Bitcoin ETFs are not crypto\u2019s finish line\n\nMore industry players like Fink, and even more regulators, are now starting to see the real, tangible benefits of blockchains. That\u2019s why I predict that it will be hard for the SEC to justify not approving many other products once it approves the Ethereum spot ETF. We\u2019ll have NFT ETFs, DeFi ETFs and even ETFs for the top tokenized real-world assets.\n\nInstitutions with trillions in capital will finally be able to access tokens via regulated vehicles on venues with approved counterparties. They\u2019ll push for blockchain in use cases of greater institutional benefit, like the tokenized bonds we\u2019ve seen issued in Europe or the tokenized securities now legal throughout nations in APAC. Legacy finance in the US will finally open to tokenization.\n\nBut this tokenization won\u2019t be on one public ledger as Fink hopes. While it would be great for BlackRock if everything happened on Ethereum \u2014 this would drive value to its future Ethereum spot ETF \u2014 it\u2019s just not what regulators or markets want.\n\nRegulators and institutions have repeatedly indicated a preference for public permissioned networks or private permissioned networks.\n\nIn a report by EY Parthenon, 60% of institutions said they preferred a public permissioned network for asset tokenization. Likewise, public permissioned networks were of interest to regulators interviewed for a report by the Global Financial Markets Association and Boston Consulting Group.\n\nPermissioned networks will be the networks of choice for many. They\u2019re either comparable to existing infrastructure in capital markets (private permissioned), or come with frameworks for regulatory and institutional risk-management and tools to enable know-your-customer/AML compliance (public permissioned).\n\nIs the SEC\u2019s approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs exciting?\n\nYes.\n\nIs it giving the greenlight for institutional capital to pour into crypto and tokenization?\n\nYes.\n\nBut, we\u2019re only in the first inning of this revolution. We haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\n\nGraeme Moore is the Head of Tokenization at the Polymesh Association, a not-for-profit dedicated to the growth of the Polymesh blockchain ecosystem.

        "content": "Coinbase will be one of the fund\u2019s custodians.\n\nShare this article\n\nFranklin Templeton, the company that manages $1.5 trillion in assets, has become the latest Wall Street giant to file for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to an S-1 form registration dated February 12, 2024. The firm now joins BlackRock, ARK Invest, and five other asset managers in the spot Ethereum product race.\n\nFranklin Templeton has selected Coinbase Custody Trust Company and the Bank of New York Mellon as the fund\u2019s custodians. As an ETF custodian, Coinbase is responsible for the safekeeping and management of the cryptographic keys that control the underlying assets of an ETF.\n\nLike BlackRock and ARK Invest, Franklin Templeton has also adopted a cash-only policy for the creation and redemption of shares. The proposed ETF is slated for listing and trading on the CBOE BZX Exchange, offering investors an accessible avenue to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities and operational challenges typically associated with direct crypto investments.\n\nFranklin Templeton previously shared a bullish outlook for the future of Ethereum, Solana, and other layer 1 chains. The firm also generated headlines when it embraced the \u201claser eyes\u201d meme, a social media trend in the crypto community where individuals, especially crypto enthusiasts, edit their profile pictures to include red laser beams coming out of their eyes.\n\nThe new filing comes on the heels of a recent move by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which sought public feedback on a proposed rule change to list and trade an Ethereum spot ETF from Galaxy Digital and Invesco."

        "title": "Ethereum in 2024: PoS, Scalability, and Market Predictions - The News Leader",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nStory by Binance\n\nEthereum is set to be one of the names to watch out for in crypto in 2024. Transitioning from an old way of operating (Proof of Work) to a new method called Proof of Stake, or PoS for short, Ethereum is getting a notable update. This makes it more energy-efficient and fair for everyone involved. Investopedia explains that this could be a game-changer for Ethereum's market worth.\n\nWhy is PoS Important?\n\nThe transition of Ethereum to Proof of Stake (PoS) marks a big change. Previously, Ethereum relied on a system known as Proof of Work (PoW) which involved computer competition to solve puzzles for transaction processing and Ether creation. This process consumed large amounts of energy.\n\nHowever, with the implementation of PoS, efficiency has improved. PoS allows users who hold and 'stake' their Ether to process their transactions, instead of heavily relying on mining. This approach significantly reduces energy usage, thereby making Ethereum more environmentally friendly.\n\nIt's not just about being environmentally friendly. The implementation of PoS in Ethereum aims to enhance the network's security. In the PoW system, an individual attempting to manipulate the Ethereum network would need to control over 50% of its computing power, which is an extremely difficult and costly task. However, with PoS they would have to possess than half of all staked Ether making it more complex due to the substantial investment required. Consequently, this makes the network more resilient against attacks.\n\nMoreover, PoS has the potential to bring fairness to Ethereum. Unlike in the PoW system where individuals with expensive computers have a significant advantage over others, PoS levels the playing field as it does not necessitate super powerful hardware; instead it depends on how much Ether one is willing to stake.\n\nCan Ethereum Handle More Traffic?\n\nScalability has been one of the big headaches for Ethereum for ages now. When too many people use it at the same time, it gets slow and expensive to use. Imagine a highway jam-packed with cars \u2014 that's been Ethereum on a busy day. But now, they're working on splitting this traffic more efficiently (something called 'sharding') and even creating express lanes (these are the Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum). A recent Forbes issue highlighted how these upgrades could make Ethereum faster and cheaper.\n\nWhat's the Word on Ethereum's Money Value in 2024?\n\nTalking about money, especially in crypto, is like predicting the weather \u2014 you know the general trend but can't be sure if it will rain or shine. However, the general feeling among experts, like those analyzing the market on Binance, is pretty optimistic for Ethereum. They think its value could go up with all these updates and that Ethereum is becoming rarer to own (thanks to the PoS model). But remember, crypto can be unpredictable, and government regulations can shake things up.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nEthereum is transforming itself in a big way, becoming more attractive to everyday users and big investors as it looks to be faster and greener. However, there are challenges, especially with all the rules and regulations still being figured out in the crypto world. For those considering Ethereum, it is certainly a space to watch.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "What Is ERC-404? A Guide to the New Semi-Fungible Token Standard - Unchained",
        "content": "The new, experimental ERC-404 standard combines the elements of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens to create semi-fungible digital assets.\n\nEthereum is home to a wide range of token standards that enable specific functionalities for crypto tokens. ERC-20 and ERC-721 are the two most popular token standards on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 is the token standard for fungible tokens, while ERC-721 is the standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAnd now, a new experimental token standard has emerged called ERC-404. The token standard combines the elements of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens into one semi-fungible digital asset.\n\nRead on to learn what the ERC-404 token standard is, how it works, and how it differs from ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nWhat Is ERC-404?\n\nThe ERC-404 is an experimental token standard that merges the features of the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards to create a \u2018semi-fungible\u2019 token with the characteristics of both fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\nPseudonymous creators \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cAcme\u201d on the Ethereum network created the unofficial token standard.\n\nThe ERC-404 standard allows developers to develop fractionalized NFT collections that can be freely used and openly traded in NFT marketplaces. Currently, unlike with fungible tokens, NFT holders cannot purchase fractions of a digital asset.\n\nAlthough fractionalized NFTs exist, they primarily rely on an institution specializing in NFT fractionalization to lock the fractionalized NFTs in a crypto wallet and issue tokens depicting that non-fungible token. While these fractionalized NFTs are freely traded in the market, they may not precisely match the value of the locked NFTs.\n\nAnd this is what the ERC-404 token standard aims to solve.\n\nHow Does ERC-404 Work?\n\nThe ERC-404 token standard enables the creation of semi-fungible tokens by utilizing token burning and token minting mechanics to allow for fractional NFT transfers.\n\nThe token standard links issued tokens to a non-fungible token. The associated NFT is minted to your wallet if you purchase a full token. If you opt to sell a fraction of the token, the linked NFT representing that fraction is burned.\n\nThus, the token standard makes it possible for multiple wallets to hold fractions of one NFT.\n\nA new NFT is automatically minted if a wallet holding multiple fractions of a token buys enough to hold an entire token.\n\nIn short, if ERC-404 goes through the official Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is added to the Ethereum ecosystem, it will provide room for the native fractionalization of non-fungible tokens, which will make it possible to experiment with NFT use cases.\n\nHow Does ERC-404 Differ from ERC-20 and ERC-721\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how the ERC-404 token standard differs from the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards in the table below.\n\nERC-404 ERC-20 ERC-721 EIP Lacks a formal EIP Proposed and introduced through EIP-20 Proposed and introduced through EIP-721 Token standard Semi-fungible token standard Fungible token standard Non-fungible token standard Asset class represented Represents fractionalized digital assets Represents a specific type of fungible digital asset Represents a class of unqiue digital assets Tokens standard creators \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cAcme\u201d Fabian Vogelsteller William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs Token IDs Not known Lacks a token ID Features a unique token ID for each asset Status Under development Developed Developed\n\nWho\u2019s Already Using ERC-404?\n\nThe ERC-404 token standard is experimental and hasn\u2019t undergone the official EIP process. Still, developers are already using it when building their projects.\n\nBelow is a list of the three projects created using the ERC-404 token standard.\n\nPandora : Pandora is a newly launched token. It\u2019s the first project employing the ERC-404 token standard to launch. Pandora is made up of 10,000 PANDORA ERC-20 tokens and 10,000 linked \u2018Replicant\u2019 non-fungible tokens. A correlated Replicant NFT is minted to your wallet if you purchase a full PANDORA token.\n\nDeFrogs : DeFrogs offers 10,000 Pepe the Frog-based NFTs and is considered the first ERC-404 picture-for-profile (PFP) NFT collection.\n\nMonkees : Monkees is also a PFP collection utilizing the ERC-404 token standard. It comprises 100 NFTs that have six traits and ten attributes.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile the ERC-404 token standard continues to show the adaptability of the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s important to remember that the standard is only experimental and not official. It has yet to be submitted for review as an EIP and hasn\u2019t undergone the required external audit.\n\nAs such, although already being utilized, the token standard could have some unknown flaws, which introduces a risk to token holders. Additionally, as an unofficial token standard, major NFT marketplaces and platforms currently don\u2019t support it.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no denying that the ERC-404 token standard opens up new use cases for NFTs on Ethereum, it remains to be seen whether its developers will successfully propose and get the approval needed for it to become part of the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a tear lately, with the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency recently surpassing $49,000 per token at the time of writing. However, while Bitcoin is set up for more potential gains in 2024 due to major catalysts like the upcoming halving in April, savvy crypto investors know that smaller altcoins can often outperform Bitcoin, especially during bull market cycles.\n\nI will look at seven cryptos that I believe have the potential to outperform Bitcoin\u2019s returns in 2024. A smaller market capitalization leaves a lot of room for upside. That said, some of these picks are still established names that should deliver steady returns, with the majority of these picks centered around more speculative \u201cmoonshot\u201d bets that could exponentially increase in value if certain catalysts play out. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nA stylized version of the Ethereum logo. Ethereum Price predictions.\n\nSource: shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) has outperformed Bitcoin in every cycle since its inception, and I believe this cycle will be no different. As the primary driver behind Web 3.0 innovation, Ethereum seems poised for tremendous growth in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe top decentralized applications and NFT projects continue to be built on Ethereum, cementing its status as the leading smart contract platform.\n\nImportantly, Ethereum recently transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model. This greatly reduced the issuance rate of new Ethereum tokens, making the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency deflationary for the first time. With Ethereum\u2019s burn rate now exceeding that of its mint rate, a supply shock could strongly benefit prices. Additionally, as more developers build Web 3.0 apps on Ethereum, demand for Ethereum via transactions on its network should continue climbing.\n\nI\u2019m especially bullish on Ethereum due to this network\u2019s ties to some of the most promising metaverse, DeFi, and NFT projects that rely on the Ethereum network. These applications relay on Ethereum to power transactions and run smart contracts. As these nascent sectors grow, Ethereum adoption should surge as well. With strong network effects firmly in place, I expect Ethereum to continue to outpace Bitcoin\u2019s gains.\n\nEthereum also boasts top-notch security with its large community of validators. Attacks are virtually impossible at this scale. Thus, with no serious \u201cEthereum killer\u201d in sight yet, Ethereum enjoys a dominant position in the world of Web 3.0 infrastructure. Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, I believe the runway is clear for Ethereum to exponentially increase in value in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nKaspa (KAS-USD)\n\nHand pointing upward next to upward trend stock chart in purple and blackish blue lighting, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nScalability remains one of the biggest challenges in the crypto realm. However, Kaspa (KAS-USD) offers an elegant solution with its cutting-edge blockDAG protocol called GHOSTDAG.\n\nUnlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG leverages a directed acyclic graph structure. This allows parallel blocks to coexist, while allowing the network to maintain quick consensus ordering. As a result, Kaspa can handle extremely high throughput with miniscule transaction confirmation times.\n\nInnovative architectures like GHOSTDAG will become highly valued as scalability pressures increase across decentralized networks. By avoiding the inefficiency of wasted orphaned blocks, Kaspa unlocks a lean and effective scaling approach that is not bogged down by excessive hardware requirements.\n\nFrom my first recommendation of Kaspa back at 2 cents back in July 2023, this token has already climbed 600% to 14 cents at the time of this writing. Yet, its current $3-billion market cap still seems small compared to its potential. As developers recognize the scalability promise of GHOSTDAG, Kaspa could achieve a market cap of $10 billion or more.\n\nIn an era where high Ethereum fees occasionally throttle applications, blockchain projects would do well to evaluate alternatives like Kaspa. Its novel hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and ability to run public and private networks make Kaspa surprisingly versatile. For these reasons, I believe this project has plenty of upside ahead, despite already generous gains for early investors.\n\nLibra Incentix (LIXX-USD)\n\nAn image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nLibra Incentix (LIXX-USD) seems positioned for a major breakout in 2024 driven by high-profile partnerships at the intersection of sports and commerce. Libra\u2019s loyalty platform has teamed up with ComAve, an online shopping portal which has surged in popularity due to its partnerships with major football clubs like AC Milan and Crystal Palace.\n\nAdditionally, Libra Incentix is collaborating with Tamias POS, which also continues to secure deals with prominent sports teams and brands. As the exclusive loyalty token provider for these platforms, Libra offers fans a tokenized incentive program.\n\nThis focus on mainstream sports partnerships marks just the initial phase in Libra becoming the most widely adopted crypto loyalty solution. By catering to the massive global sports fan demographic, Libra Incentix can drive significant organic user growth and transaction volume for its network.\n\nThe opportunities appear tremendous still. The sports industry is on pace to reach a staggering $681 billion valuation by 2031, and I think this number could be higher as it benefits from crypto adoption.\n\nWith LIXX serving as the backbone loyalty mechanism across multiple major players in this booming niche, this project\u2019s real-world usage is set to accelerate exponentially. As the LIXX token becomes deeply integrated into mainstream fan experiences and shopping through influential partners, Libra may emerge as one of the most promising crypto projects in terms of user reach.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, \u201cEthereum killers\u201d like Solana (SOL-USD) have managed to carve out solid market share in areas like NFTs. With transaction fees under 1 cent, Solana provides a fast and ultra-affordable blockchain environment for developers. This has fueled tremendous adoption, despite Solana\u2019s previous struggles with stability (given a number of big outages).\n\nHowever, the Solana team continues refining the network, and outages are becoming less frequent. As demand for scalable Layer 1 solutions grows exponentially in 2024 and beyond, Solana\u2019s upside remains enormous at these levels.\n\nUnless catastrophic failures occur, significant market share gains from Ethereum seem likely as congestion and high gas fees push developers to seek alternative platforms to build on. I think Solana\u2019s unique infrastructure could solve Ethereum\u2019s speed and cost problem, making this a top token to consider for long-term growth.\n\nAleph Zero (AZERO-USD)\n\nAn image of a speedometer with the words \"exponential technology\" at the maximum\n\nSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock\n\nAleph Zero (AZERO-USD) represents another emerging Ethereum competitor that aims to resolve lingering issues like congestion and uptime struggles. Leveraging a novel consensus protocol, Aleph Zero has achieved exceptional transaction finality in under one second, while being able to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nHowever, Aleph Zero\u2019s design compromises raw decentralization for that speed. With just 162 validators securing the network, it utilizes a model similar to Tron (TRX-USD). Still, Aleph Zero directly tackles recurring network capacity and stability problems developers face. With robust functionality catering to builders through EVM support, NFT/token capabilities, and multi-language SDKs, Aleph Zero remains well-positioned to capture dissatisfied talent if ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana stall in providing reliable infrastructure.\n\nConsidering its relatively tiny $188 million market cap, Aleph Zero offers tremendous upside potential if it attracts an influx of builders and users over the coming years as part of the next generation of blockchain ecosystems.\n\nRender Token (RNDR-USD)\n\nThe Render (RNDR) crypto logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nRender (RNDR-USD) is a decentralized GPU render farm and 3D visualization platform. It is primed to capture tremendous growth as demand for computer graphics and GPU compute resources scales exponentially with trends like the metaverse, AR/VR, 3D modeling, and video gaming.\n\nThe Render network has already rendered 2.36 million frames in Q3 2023, using GPU capacity provided by regular computer owners looking to passively earn crypto. As more digital assets get created for emergent digital worlds and immersive experiences, Render\u2019s spare capacity becomes extremely valuable.\n\nWhile RNDR currently trades 47% below its 2021 high, I expect surging adoption once crypto markets turn bullish again. Relative price resilience shows institutional interest in this low-key project. With a fixed token supply and staking incentives, Render has major upside as its network usage expands.\n\nInjective (INJ-USD)\n\nLogo for Injective Protocol (INJ-USD)\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ) cryptocurrency coin symbol. Blockchain technology. INJ in bubble\n\nDecentralized finance has seen tremendous growth recently. However, I would argue that DeFi remains an under-appreciated crypto sector. That\u2019s because DeFi provides a central value proposition for the entire cryptocurrency sector, enabling private, decentralized financial access.\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ-USD) is one DeFi project uniquely-positioned for massive upside. In recent weeks, Injective has gained traction by offering robust decentralized trading infrastructure for next-generation DeFi innovation. This infrastructure includes a fully on-chain order book resistant to exploitation.\n\nAdditionally, Injective fully supports all major financial instrument types on-chain, including spot contracts, futures, perpetual contracts, and options. Its Cosmos-based blockchain leverages the Tendermint consensus for instant trade finality and lightning-fast 10,000+ transactions per second throughput.\n\nAdvanced interoperability and bridging across Ethereum, alternative networks like Solana, and non-EVM chains also gives Injective a key advantage. It basically provides the flexible core \u201cLego pieces\u201d for developers to build multi-chain DeFi products.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency sector gets further integrated into mainstream finance over time, critical backbone infrastructure projects like Injective seem primed to benefit.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "$3,000 Is Next for Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) Shows Massive Breakthrough, Solana's (SOL) Suspicious Rally - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve with its recent ERC-404 token standard being massively implemented, its native asset is finally gaining some traction on the market. It is showcasing promising growth, and its price trajectory suggests that the coveted $3,000 mark may be on the horizon.\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum's price chart reveals a steady upward trend, with the asset recently crossing the $2,500 threshold. The next significant resistance level appears to be at $2,600, a point that has previously seen sellers stepping in. A break and hold above this level could pave the way for Ethereum's ascent toward the $3,000 psychological and technical barrier.\n\nSupporting this potential growth scenario is the continued development of the Ethereum network, including the anticipated benefits of the ERC-404 update. This new standard is expected to enhance the utility and interoperability of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, potentially increasing demand for ETH as the required \"fuel\" for deploying tokens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there remains a cautionary scenario to consider. Ethereum's rival, Solana, has recently experienced a slowdown due to network outages, which could potentially cause a ripple effect across the broader crypto market. If such events lead to a loss of confidence in blockchain networks or a shift in investor sentiment, Ethereum could face a setback.\n\nA potential price drop scenario could be triggered by technical rejections at the $2,600 resistance level, coupled with negative market sentiment stemming from issues in competing blockchains like Solana. Should Ethereum fail to sustain its momentum, a pullback toward the local support level at $2,300 may occur, where buyers have previously shown interest.\n\nCardano remains strong\n\nCardano (ADA) has recently demonstrated a significant breakthrough in price action, suggesting a bullish trend could be forming. Cardano's price has been tracing an upward trajectory, recently punctuating this ascent by breaching a key resistance level.\n\nA technical analysis of ADA's chart indicates that the cryptocurrency has managed to surpass the resistance near $0.515, which had previously capped several attempts at an upward move. Closing above this level could signal newfound confidence among investors and pave the way for further gains.\n\nOn the growth front, if ADA sustains its momentum above this resistance turned support level, the next target for the asset could be the $0.580 mark. Such a move would represent a significant uptick in market valuation and could attract more attention to Cardano as a viable investment in the blockchain space.\n\nHowever, every market scenario has its counterpart. Should ADA face rejection at higher levels, there is potential for a pullback toward the local support at $0.485. A drop below this point might compel traders to reassess the short-term outlook for Cardano, potentially leading to a consolidation phase or even a deeper correction if broader market sentiment turns negative.\n\nSolana slows down\n\nThe recent price movements of Solana have caught the eye of many in the cryptocurrency community, with its ascent on the charts prompting discussions around the sustainability of its rally. Despite the uptick, there is a pervading sentiment of caution as the momentum behind the rise appears to lack conviction.\n\nAn analysis of Solana's trading patterns reveals that while SOL has made strides to overcome resistance, achieving a local high of approximately $112, the rally's foundation seems tenuous. The support level to watch is around $98.89, where SOL has previously found a degree of stability. Should the asset maintain above this level, it might dispel some of the skepticism surrounding its recent performance.\n\nHowever, the growth scenario for Solana is shadowed by concerns of a potential breakdown. The momentum indicator on the charts suggests that the energy behind the rally is not as robust as investors might desire. If Solana fails to sustain the buying pressure needed to push higher, it could see a retreat back to the support level or even lower, which might trigger a more pronounced sell-off."

        "title": "In free fall the ERC-404 tokens, while the Ethereum blockchain awaits the Dencun update - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago, the trend of ERC-404 tokens exploded within the Ethereum blockchain, leading to an increase in interest in this new digital innovation and at the same time an increase in network gas fees.\n\nNow the prices of these new coins are plummeting, and they are recording double-digit daily losses.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum eagerly awaits the Dencun update, which will be completed on March 13th: ETH, in anticipation of these improvements, could soon see new yearly highs.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nEthereum blockchain: the hype for ERC-404 tokens ends immediately\n\nJust 10 days ago, a new token standard was launched within the Ethereum blockchain, namely ERC-404, which immediately caught the attention of enthusiasts with a crazy increase in the prices of these new experimental resources.\n\nThe most well-known, as well as the first to have made its debut in this new market niche, is PANDORA, which has grown by 400% in just 3 days of trading.\n\nBy itself, the ERC-404 standard represents a mere experiment by the Pandora team, which combines the characteristics of the ERC-721 and ERC-20 standards typical of the Ethereum blockchain, creating a hybrid token between an NFT and a fungible token (a semi-fungible).\n\nThe central idea behind this new standard is that when someone owns less than a whole NFT, the NFT disappears and the user only owns a fraction of a token. If they combine enough tokens to obtain a whole one, the NFT is returned to them, only it might be a different NFT.\n\nOver the weekend, after traders flocked to new ERC-404 tokens like PANDORA, DEFROGS, and MONKEES, causing frightening price increases, the first capital outflows were observed.\n\nSince February 9th, PANDORA, the crypto leader of this new trend, has lost over 50% of its value, seeing more than 100 million dollars evaporate.\n\nEven DEFROGS and MONKEES have dropped significantly compared to weekend prices.\n\nCoinMarketCap: PANDORA-USD chart\n\nThe enthusiasm for this novelty was immediately dampened after the news spread of a team of Ethereum blockchain developers who are working on an alternative implementation of ERC-404.\n\nThis alternative will be called \u201cDivisible NFT\u201c, abbreviated as DN-404, more performant and definitely much cheaper than the previous one.\n\nIts main developer, known as cygaar, said that the new standard could arrive soon, potentially shifting the focus of the degens.\n\nThere are also rumors that the developers of Pandora and those of Divisible NFT have entered into conflict with each other because they are working on similar technology.\n\nFor now, it seems that the market has priced in a greater interest in the upcoming novelty, which will significantly lower the fees of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to The Block data, during the past week the 7-day moving average of transaction fees on the network reached $11, after increasing from $4 at the end of January.\n\nParsec Finance has pointed out on X that this rapid increase in fees is mainly due to ERC-404.\n\nAnalysis of ETH price awaiting Dencun: new highs coming\n\nWhile the prices of ERC-404 tokens suffer from competition from new competitors, ETH consolidates its bullish structure waiting for the long-awaited Dencun update of the Ethereum blockchain, scheduled for March 13th.\n\nThis will introduce new functionalities within the network, such as the so-called proto-danksharding, which is a basic version of the scaling solution \u201csharding\u201d, aimed at compressing the weight of a block by separating data storage, thus managing to lower validation fees.\n\nDencun is mainly focused on making Ethereum\u2019s layer-2, which represent the most solid trend of the past year for the smart contract blockchain, significantly more scalable and cost-effective.\n\nThe ETH crypto at the time of writing the article has a price of $2483, well above the 50 EMA on a weekly time frame.\n\nThe currency quotes, after going through a terrible 2022 and a less encouraging first half of 2023 compared to bitcoin, start 2024 with a bang.\n\nEther aims for $3000 after being rejected at $2700 in conjunction with the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF on US exchanges.\n\nThe bulls need to break the psychological barrier of $2500 as soon as possible, and subsequently the one of $2700 (with a weekly close above) to fuel the hopes of buyers, while the bears try to crack the chart by bringing prices below $2150.\n\nThe break of one of the two extremes will determine the price action of the coming weeks, which however tends to rise and register new annual highs.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USDT)\n\nIt is also very important to consider the ETH-BTC chart, for a 360\u00b0 view of what is happening in the crypto market.\n\nThe currency belonging to the Ethereum blockchain is in fact subordinate to Bitcoin, which always and in any case remains the king of this sector.\n\nThe moments in which ETH records its best price performances are in fact those in which it outperforms the trend of BTC.\n\nFor this reason, identifying possible levels on which the ETH-BTC chart can find new bullish strength is essential to predict an increase in value against the dollar.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we could finally see a recovery of ETH on the digital gold, with the threshold of 0.05 sat potentially acting as a shield against further bearish incursions.\n\nIf it were to maintain its level by forming a double bottom, ETH-BTC could easily reach 0.06 sat, reversing the short-term trend and pushing for an appreciation of the asset.\n\nIn an optimistic context like the one described, in addition to ETH and altcoins, even ERC-404 tokens could benefit from it, with the Ethereum blockchain shining among the many decentralized networks in the crypto landscape."

        "content": "Sun 11 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nGeth, short for Go Ethereum, is an open-source software client for the Ethereum network. It is a crucial tool for Ethereum developers, miners, validators, and users. Its popularity is due to the numerous crypto benefits it offers. However, over-reliance on this tool can be harmful, according to warnings from several analysts.\n\nA Challenge Involving Ethereum that Endangers Crypto Exchanges\n\nCoinbase, Kraken, and several other major players in the crypto sphere are facing a critical issue within the Ethereum network. It\u2019s their over-reliance on a single software client named Geth.\n\nThis dependency poses significant risks. Experts warn against the potential catastrophic consequences if a bug were discovered in Geth. As a reminder, this client is used by nearly 80% of Ethereum validators!\n\nRecent incidents, such as a bug in the less frequently used software Nethermind, have already highlighted the vulnerability of the Ethereum ecosystem. With Geth dominating the crypto activities involving validators, any bug in this software could disrupt the processing of transactions.\n\nAnalysts are apprehensive of this prospect. According to them, such a scenario would have severe consequences for the crypto industry players. Moreover, such an incident could result in losses for investors and even lead to a fragmentation of the network.\n\nMany Ethereum validators use the same software, fueling worries about what happens if there's a bug https://t.co/Efrroa4iSs \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 8, 2024 Coinbase and Kraken are looking for alternatives to Geth to diversify and secure operations on Ethereum\n\nPalliative Initiatives Are Taking Shape\n\nIt must be said that some crypto industry players seem to grasp the magnitude of the situation. Criticisms about the lack of diversity among client software used by validators have spurred some crypto providers to explore alternative solutions.\n\nConsequently, Coinbase and Kraken are actively considering the integration of smaller software clients into their platforms to mitigate risks associated with Geth\u2019s dominance. This already marks the beginning of a response to these growing concerns.\n\nBut the urgency to meet these diversification challenges in a sustainable way is evident. Especially when considering the significant financial stakes involved and the broader implications for the stability and growth of Ethereum.\n\nUltimately, the realization of these diversification efforts and increased vigilance are essential to ensure the stability and long-term success of crypto platforms.

        "content": "Arbitrum accounted for over 50% of ETH\u2019s total transaction volume across top optimistic rollups.\n\nArbitrum had the highest TVL among all ETH scaling solutions.\n\nDespite the emergence of several Ethereum [ETH] scaling solutions in the past year, Arbitrum\u2019s [ARB] dominance in the landscape has remained largely intact.\n\nArbitrum scales Ethereum and how!\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the layer-2 (L2) blockchain accounted for over 50% of ETH\u2019s total transaction volume across top optimistic rollups, including Optimism [OP] and Base.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that in the broader L2 market, Arbitrum lost out its transaction dominance to zk rollup, zkSync Era.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of L2Beat data, Arbitrum clocked a little over 24 million cumulative transactions in the past month. This paled in comparison to zkSync Era\u2019s 30-day tally of 41.3 million.\n\nThe significant disparity in transaction numbers was due to the difference between the fees on the two scaling solutions. AMBCrypto noticed through L2 Fees that a user had to pay $0.14 on Arbitrum to send ETH while the same task could be performed on zkSync Era at a 64% discount.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum proponents in particular, and those of L2 in general, have pinned their hopes on the upcoming Dencun upgrade. The watershed technical transformation was expected to bring about a 10x drop in L2 transaction fees.\n\nL2 transaction fees are expected to drop by 10x from a current average of $0.23 thanks to the upcoming Ethereum Dancun upgrade. pic.twitter.com/9GuLgxky08 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 10, 2024\n\nArbitrum outshines competition in DeFi\n\nWhile Arbitrum trailed zkSync Era in network traffic, the former was still the decentralized finance (DeFi) leader in the L2 ecosystem.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Artemis data, Arbitrum had over $2.7 billion in total value locked as of this writing. This was head and shoulders above the competition.\n\nFathom this \u2013 the combined TVL of the next three scaling solutions in the list was still less than Arbitrum\u2019s tally.\n\nAnother dominant aspect of Arbitrum\u2019s DeFi game was the performance of its decentralized exchanges (DEXes). As seen from the graph above, Arbitrum has solidified its position as the top L2 in DEX volume.\n\nIn fact, Arbitrum DEXes facilitated trades worth over $1.7 billion over last week. In contrast, DEXs on Base and zkSync Era couldn\u2019t even cross $300 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ARB\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nARB lifts 8.5% over the week\n\nAs of this writing, the native token ARB was trading in the green, with weekly gains of 8.5%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe jump in ARB value could be just sentiment-driven. As is well-known, ARB doesn\u2019t accrue any value from Arbitrum\u2019s on-chain activity and functions just as a governance token."
