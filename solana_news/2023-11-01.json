        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machines: Your Guide to create, create2 and create3 - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Creating contracts on blockchains that work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) involves the use of special instructions called opcodes. Among these instructions:\n\n\u201cCREATE\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE2\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE3\u201d\n\nWhile the first two are actual opcodes, \u201ccreate3\u201d is a useful library that acts similarly. This guide will give you a quick overview of what each one does and why they matter.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate\u201d Opcode\n\nThe create opcode is the most commonly used contract creation opcode. When contracts are deployed from scripts or other development environments, the create opcode is the low-level instruction executed by the EVM to deploy and generate a contract address.\n\nUse-case:\n\nCreating new contracts within a contract dynamically. More cost-effective for deploying multiple contracts. When the address predictability is not a requirement.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate2\u201d Opcode\n\nA fixed prefix, which is always 0xFF . The sender\u2019s address ensures the contract is tied to a specific creator. A chosen salt value adds uniqueness to the contract address. The bytecode contains the code of the new contract to be deployed.\n\n\n\nBy combining these parameters, CREATE2 computes a deterministic address for the new contract, which remains the same even as the blockchain evolves.\n\nUse-case:\n\nEnsuring a deterministic and predictable address for a new contract. Useful in state channels, contract wallets, and off-chain interactions. Offers an added layer of security by checking for existing contracts before deployment.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate3\u201d Opcode\n\nCREATE3 is similar to CREATE2 but without including the contract initCode on the address derivation formula. It can be used to generate deterministic contract addresses that aren\u2019t tied to a specific contract code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE3 is a way to use CREATE and CREATE2 in combination such that bytecode no longer affects the deployment address. CREATE3 is more expensive than CREATE or CREATE2 (Fixed extra cost of ~55k gas).\n\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense pragma solidity ^0.8.0; /** @title A library for deploying contracts EIP-3171 style. @author Agustin Aguilar <[email protected]> */ library Create3 { error ErrorCreatingProxy(); error ErrorCreatingContract(); error TargetAlreadyExists(); /** @notice The bytecode for a contract that proxies the creation of another contract @dev If this code is deployed using CREATE2 it can be used to decouple `creationCode` from the child contract address 0x67363d3d37363d34f03d5260086018f3: 0x00 0x67 0x67XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX PUSH8 bytecode 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x02 0x52 0x52 MSTORE 0x03 0x60 0x6008 PUSH1 08 8 0x04 0x60 0x6018 PUSH1 18 24 8 0x05 0xf3 0xf3 RETURN 0x363d3d37363d34f0: 0x00 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x02 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0 cds 0x03 0x37 0x37 CALLDATACOPY 0x04 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x05 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x06 0x34 0x34 CALLVALUE val 0 cds 0x07 0xf0 0xf0 CREATE addr */ bytes internal constant PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = hex\"67_36_3d_3d_37_36_3d_34_f0_3d_52_60_08_60_18_f3\"; // KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = keccak256(PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE); bytes32 internal constant KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = 0x21c35dbe1b344a2488cf3321d6ce542f8e9f305544ff09e4993a62319a497c1f; /** @notice Returns the size of the code on a given address @param _addr Address that may or may not contain code @return size of the code on the given `_addr` */ function codeSize(address _addr) internal view returns (uint256 size) { assembly { size := extcodesize(_addr) } } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode) internal returns (address addr) { return create3(_salt, _creationCode, 0); } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @param _value In WEI of ETH to be forwarded to child contract @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode, uint256 _value) internal returns (address addr) { // Creation code bytes memory creationCode = PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE; // Get target final address addr = addressOf(_salt); if (codeSize(addr) != 0) revert TargetAlreadyExists(); // Create CREATE2 proxy address proxy; assembly { proxy := create2(0, add(creationCode, 32), mload(creationCode), _salt)} if (proxy == address(0)) revert ErrorCreatingProxy(); // Call proxy with final init code (bool success,) = proxy.call{ value: _value }(_creationCode); if (!success || codeSize(addr) == 0) revert ErrorCreatingContract(); } /** @notice Computes the resulting address of a contract deployed using address(this) and the given `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error @dev The address creation formula is: keccak256(rlp([keccak256(0xff ++ address(this) ++ _salt ++ keccak256(childBytecode))[12:], 0x01])) */ function addressOf(bytes32 _salt) internal view returns (address) { address proxy = address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex'ff', address(this), _salt, KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE ) ) ) ) ); return address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex\"d6_94\", proxy, hex\"01\" ) ) ) ) ); } } contract Child { function hola() external view returns (string memory) { return \"mundo\"; } } contract Deployer { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3(keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), type(Child).creationCode); } } contract Child2 { uint256 meaningOfLife; address owner; constructor(uint256 _meaning, address _owner) { meaningOfLife = _meaning; owner = _owner; } } contract Deployer2 { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3( keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), abi.encodePacked( type(Child).creationCode, abi.encode( 42, msg.sender ) ) ); } }\n\nFeatures:\n\nDeterministic contract address based on msg.sender + salt.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum layer-2 solutions will become more diverse and specialized - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem continues to expand and diversify, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a recent blog post. As new scaling solutions emerge, Buterin predicts increasing heterogeneity in layer 2 designs based on specific security and cost tradeoffs.\n\nRollups, validiums, sidechains, and other layer-2 constructions offer different balances between decentralization, security, and scalability. Financial applications demand the highest security guarantees, while social media and gaming can accept some downtime in exchange for lower fees.\n\nButerin notes that projects transitioning from independent layer-1s to Ethereum layer-2s will likely take a gradual, multi-stage approach. Moving all activity to a rollup at once would hurt usability, but waiting too long risks missing the opportunity. Centralized projects and niche layer 1s also want enough decentralization for added security assurances without sacrificing high throughput.\n\nHow differing layer-2s interact with Ethereum\n\nValidiums rely on zero-knowledge proofs to ensure correct computation without storing all data directly on Ethereum. This saves costs compared to rollups, but validiums face data availability risks if operators fail to make data available. Rollups guarantee users can always withdraw funds to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDisconnected systems like sidechains offer even lower costs but require trust in a small set of validators. Hybrid approaches are also emerging, such as validiums that allow users to pay for periodic Ethereum data availability.\n\nButerin emphasizes the importance of external chains maintaining tight links to Ethereum. This reduces security risks when bridging Ethereum-native assets and enables shared account abstractions across chains.\n\nValidating bridges can provide validium-level security, proving correct state transitions. However, handling edge cases like 51% of attacks requires a social commitment to coordinate upgrades. Reading Ethereum data and reverting when Ethereum reverts is also critical. Chains that only read Ethereum\u2019s finalized blocks avoid some complexity but give up functionality during periods of low finality.\n\nOverall, Buterin sees merit across a spectrum of layer-2 designs. Applications will continue tailoring solutions to their specific security, scalability, and decentralization needs. However, maintaining connections to Ethereum provides benefits regardless of the architecture. He believes that, as technology progresses, projects can strengthen their ties to Ethereum in stages over time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum core developers have included EIP-7514 in the upcoming Dencun upgrade. This proposal slows the growing ETH staking while allowing developers to explore long-term solutions for unchecked staking.\n\nEIP-7514 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal co-authored by Tim Beiko and Dapplion that is meant to slow down the rate of Ether (ETH) staking.\n\nThe proposal is part of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade slated for activation in October 2023, and it is essentially an attempt to buy the community time to come up with a more practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nNext up, we continued a conversation from last week's ACDC call, about whether to add a constant cap to the validator activation queue. The proposal had since then been formalized as EIP-7514: https://t.co/sd4D4GlMRY \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 14, 2023\n\nAccording to some Ethereum developers, if the pace of staking remains unchecked, it will be possible to witness half of all ETH staked by May 2024, which could escalate to three-quarters by September 2024 and potentially hit 100% by December 2024.\n\nThe Beacon chain is growing exponentially\n\n\n\nWe all like up-only, but not when the safety of Ethereum is at stake. By doing nothing, next year we will enter unknown economic territory with >50% of total ETH stake\n\n\n\nToday ACD will vote to bound max growth to buy research time pic.twitter.com/iA7T6BHjak \u2014 Lion \u27e0 dapplion .eth (@dapplion) September 14, 2023\n\nWhile at first glance, this might appear positive, it could apply undue pressure on the network and render the rewards for staking less attractive.\n\nEIP-7514 is meant to bring changes to the way new validators, those responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks, can join the network.\n\nIt is a temporary fix to manage the increasing number of validators while also allowing developers to look for more permanent solutions. These future solutions could lead to big changes in Ethereum\u2019s economic rulebook, potentially sparking a new age of staking in the system.\n\nSo, how did it get to the point where a squeeze on ETH staking became necessary? And more importantly, what are the possible future ramifications of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH? Read on to find out more.\n\nThe Merge and the staking surge\n\nIn 2022, the Ethereum network successfully executed a large-scale software upgrade, commonly referred to as the \u201cMerge,\u201d that moved it from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nFor those not in the know, a consensus mechanism is a protocol used in a blockchain network to ensure all computers or nodes making up the network agree on a single data set. It serves as the standard for verifying and approving each transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum upgrade involved merging the original Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called the Beacon Chain, allowing the network to transition from a mining-based PoW blockchain to a staking-based PoS model.\n\nStaking is when users lock up their ETH tokens as a way of validating transactions on the network. In return, these validators are rewarded with more ETH tokens.\n\nThis feature is central to Ethereum because it provides the mechanism for achieving consensus in the network. It encourages security by ensuring validators have a vested interest in the network, particularly since they risk losing their staked ETH if they try to cheat the system.\n\nTo become a validator requires staking a minimum of 32 ETH, which is worth approximately $52,000 at current rates.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nStaked ETH withdrawal and the rise of liquid staking\n\nThe introduction of staking was met with soaring demand, sparking concerns regarding the potential for the Ethereum network to become overly congested.\n\nDriving this fervor for staking was EIP-4895, introduced as part of the April 2023 Shanghai upgrade, which allowed validators to withdraw staked ETH and staking rewards.\n\nAccording to Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, while the implementation of EIP-4895 was anticipated to grow Ethereum\u2019s validator network, the widespread impact of liquid staking was not fully realized at the time.\n\nLiquid staking is a solution that allows users to stake their ETH directly on Ethereum in exchange for an ERC-20 liquid staking token (LST) that represents their staked ETH. It enables the staked ETH to remain liquid or movable rather than locked on the blockchain.\n\nThe three biggest liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) on the Ethereum mainnet are stETH by Lido, rETH by RocketPool, and SETH2 by Stakewise. They allow users to stake and unstake any amount of ETH without waiting for a specific unlock period.\n\nIn Feist\u2019s opinion, the unwillingness of staking pools to self-regulate, especially those holding a dominant position in the liquid staking arena, could potentially jeopardize Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\nThe researcher suggested a governance attack on a major staking protocol might pose significant challenges for Ethereum.\n\nMy reasoning on why I'm for EIP-7514. It is currently unclear if (especially liquid) staking will keep growing indefinitely. In the case that the withdrawal queue does not empty over the next few months, the lower churn limit will give the Ethereum community the time needed to\u2026 \u2014 Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) September 14, 2023\n\nETH developers foresee exponential growth in validator sets\n\nIn the PoS version of Ethereum, validators are randomly chosen to confirm transactions and create a set of consecutive blocks called an epoch.\n\nAn epoch is important as it helps in the management of the blockchain, ensuring not all validators are active at the same time, which would be inefficient and unnecessary. Each epoch lasts about 6.4 minutes and is made up of 32 slots, with each slot allocated 12 seconds.\n\nAt each slot, the system allows a validator to propose a block, even though not all slots may contain a block.\n\nAs mentioned previously, validators earn their status by staking ETH, and the potential for profit has seen more and more users joining as validators and increasingly staking higher amounts of ETH.\n\nHowever, this rapid growth in validators has raised a couple of issues. First, it could burden Ethereum\u2019s peer-to-peer (P2P) networking infrastructure, increasing the chances that nodes making up the network may fail due to higher computational and bandwidth demands caused by increased \u201cgossip messages\u201d among validators.\n\nSecondly, the expanding number of validators could complicate Ethereum\u2019s attempts to achieve single-slot finality, the quest to make a transaction final and irreversible in just one slot.\n\nThere are currently more than 795,000 active validators. With the next upgrade following Dencun not anticipated until May 2024 at the earliest, Dankrad Feist fears there may be more than 2 million validators by then.\n\nMoreover, he believes that the Ethereum community will find itself in uncharted waters if the combined LST market cap surpasses that of unstaked ETH.\n\n\u201cThis technical problem is exacerbated by an economical one: liquid staking tokens exceeding the remaining (unstaked) Ether market cap brings us in an untested economic regime. A point of no return might be reached when incentives lead to them having similar liquidity and utility in DeFi \u2013 even a staking yield close to 0% (but still positive) might be enough to keep the LST attractive\u201d Dankrad Feist, Ethereum Foundation researcher\n\nAt present, approximately 25.8 million ETH, representing 21% of all ETH in circulation and equivalent to a staggering $41.8 billion, has been staked, per data from beaconcha.in.\n\nAccording to projections by Ethereum developers Tim Beiko and Dapplion, should the current momentum persist, the percentage of staked ETH in relation to total ETH supply could mushroom to 50% by May 2024 and escalate to 100% by the end of that year.\n\nProjected validator set | Source: ethereum.org\n\nIf Beiko and Dapplion\u2019s projections were to hold true, the Ethereum network might find itself devoid of ETH, meaning that users will have no way to pay for transactions on the network.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called \u2018Hole\u0161ky\u2019\n\nThe EIP-7514 solution\n\nEIP-7514 doesn\u2019t directly address the potential technical and economic problems emanating from the unprecedented growth of ETH staking. Instead, it seeks to buy the Ethereum community a bit of time to find lasting solutions for them.\n\nIt essentially puts the brakes on the growth of staked ETH by restricting the churn limit, which is the number of validators that can enter or exit the network during an epoch.\n\nUsually, Ethereum\u2019s churn limit is dynamic, determined by calculations based on the total number of active validators divided by 65,536. As of Sept. 11, 2023, the upper churn limit was 12 per epoch, with the next determination set for Oct. 4.\n\nYesterday, the churn limit increased from 11 to 12. Next churn limit increase projected to occur around October 4!\n\n\n\nH/t: @dapplion pic.twitter.com/ftwhRxbGFE \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) September 11, 2023\n\nBeiko and Dapplion\u2019s proposal seeks to do away with the dynamic calculations and instead establish a fixed maximum churn limit of 8 per epoch.\n\nIn so doing, EIP-7514 could theoretically extend the time it would take for staked ETH to reach 50% of total ETH supply by at least one year and as many as four years for it to get to 100%, therefore giving the community enough time to find lasting solutions for the imperfections in the validator reward system.\n\nThis proposed cap will not interfere with the churn limit that controls validator exits. That limit will keep adjusting dynamically, maintaining a balance with the expansion of the validator set.\n\nThe goal is to prevent a scenario where the staking withdrawal queue is constantly full, therefore complicating the efficient administration of validator rewards.\n\nWhile the proposal has largely been positively received, some sections of the Ethereum community have been critical of its rushed nature and have suggested it could compromise Ethereum\u2019s neutrality.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1702336972700942366\n\nPotential EIP-7514 impact on ETH price\n\nThe immediate impact of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH is unclear at this point, but some market watchers think it could have a noteworthy long-term effect.\n\nThe proposal is intended to slow down the rate of ETH staking, which, in turn, could potentially influence the coin\u2019s supply-demand dynamics.\n\nIf successfully executed, EIP-7514 could significantly reduce the amount of ETH being staked, therefore alleviating the potential pressure on the Ethereum network and making staking rewards more attractive.\n\nSome analysts believe the enhanced attractiveness of staking rewards and the reduced supply of ETH in the market could potentially increase its price.\n\nHowever, the proposal is only a temporary fix for managing an increased number of validators, and the Ethereum community will still have to find a more permanent solution. As such, the long-term effects of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH may be speculative at best, depending on what these future solutions could be.\n\nIf they result in a more efficient and secure network, it can potentially boost Ethereum\u2019s overall value, resulting in a price increase for ETH. Conversely, if these changes are not well-received or cause network instability, it could put downward pressure on the ETH price."

        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran trader with over 40 years of experience, has set a target of $1,993 for Ethereum (ETH) following the asset\u2019s breakout of a recently formed right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nBrandt made this projection yesterday during his latest analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements. The trader shared a daily ETH chart on X, identifying the formation of a right-angled expanding triangle pattern, which was completed on Oct. 23.\n\nA right-angled expanding triangle, or a right-angled broadening wedge, features an upper trendline and a lower trendline, with both lines expanding apart. The pattern can either signal a potential continuation of the previous trend or a reversal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nData from Brandt\u2019s chart suggests that the beginning of this pattern dates back to Aug. 17. Notably, ETH collapsed 6.76% on the day, dropping to a low of $1,683.5. However, this massive red candlestick formed the base of the right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s swings and lows since Aug. 17, the asset formed the broadening triangle, as it continued to trade within its confines until Oct. 23. Brandt\u2019s analysis emphasizes that ETH completed the formation of the triangle on Oct. 23 amid a 6.17% increase that day.\n\nETH Forms Flag Pattern, Poised to Rally 8.6%\n\nInterestingly, ETH broke above the upper trendline of the triangle, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend that began on Oct. 12. However, after the breakout, Ethereum formed a flag pattern that lasted for nine days, from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1.\n\nBrandt identified this flag pattern in his analysis. According to him, ETH recently completed the flag pattern, which is a further re-confirmation of the right-angled expanding triangle, which the asset completed on Oct. 23.\n\nNotably, flags are typically consolidation patterns that suggest a brief pause in the prevailing trend before a potential resumption of that trend. Since breaking above $1,800, ETH has consolidated between $1,744 and $1,865, but with an upward trajectory.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe asset has now completed the nine-day flag, and a bullish continuation of the uptrend is expected. Brandt\u2019s chart suggests a target of $1,993 for when Ethereum engineers another massive run. ETH would need to appreciate 8.5% from its current price to hit $1,993.\n\nEthereum trades for $1,836 as of press time, per CoinMarketCap data. The asset is up 1.76% over the past 24 hours, with its eyes set on conquering the $1,874 resistance. Impressively, ETH\u2019s trade volume has increased 71.30% to a current value of $11.6 billion, ranking it third in volume."

        "title": "Tron Surpasses Ethereum In Stablecoin Transactions - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, a rising player is grabbing the spotlight for stablecoin transactions: Tron (TRX). The blockchain, which might not be the largest or the most famous, has been stealthily catching up to, and at times surpassing, the likes of Ethereum in the stablecoin arena, particularly when it comes to USDT transfers.\n\nA revealing insight comes from none other than global search trends. Data from Google Trends highlights a surging interest in Tron\u2019s USDT, matching the traction of Ethereum\u2019s USDT over the last year. This wave of interest in Tron is echoed in a recent paper by the asset management giant Brevan Howard, which dubs the stablecoin market\u2019s growth as \u201crelentless.\u201d Tron\u2019s share of the action? A solid 35% of the volume, 37% of transactions, and an impressive 49% of active stablecoin addresses between January and August 2023.\n\nThe shift is not merely a fluke but a part of a broader trend seeing Ethereum\u2019s grip on stablecoin activity loosen, with blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon picking up the slack.\n\nSo, what\u2019s fueling Tron\u2019s ascent in the stablecoin universe?\n\nEmerging markets are where Tron\u2019s growth is most explosive. Google Trends points to high levels of interest in countries like Iran, Russia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and Australia, whereas Ethereum still holds the fort in the United States. Particularly in Latin America, Tron\u2019s allure seems irresistible. Conversations with sources in Argentina suggest a staggering 95% of stablecoin transactions are carried out on Tron, attributed to the blockchain\u2019s low fees and swift transaction speeds.\n\nIn regions battered by inflation, such as Argentina where rates soared past 120% in 2023, the appeal of affordable and fast stablecoin transactions is undeniable. They\u2019re not just a financial strategy; they\u2019re a lifeline for those trying to shield their assets from the voracious jaws of inflation.\n\nTron\u2019s growth spurt is also backed by tactical moves by the Tron Foundation. Its partnership with Curve Finance in August 2023 to introduce the latter\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) to Tron\u2019s network, and the integration with Google Cloud in early October to pump up on-chain activity, are bold strides toward expansion.\n\nDespite Tron\u2019s upbeat performance in 2023, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The Tron Foundation and its founder, Justin Sun, have navigated choppy waters within the crypto community. Sun, a polarizing figure, has been in the crosshairs of an SEC lawsuit over allegations of selling unregistered securities in March 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Tron\u2019s strategic positioning in the stablecoin market is a narrative of tactical growth and market adaptation. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies continue to evolve, Tron\u2019s journey offers a captivating glimpse into the forces shaping the future of digital finance. It stands as a testament that in the crypto arena, being the biggest doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being the most utilized, and that a focus on practical benefits like cost and speed can pay dividends."

        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, Anatoly Yakovenko, the cofounder of Solana, took to X to express his appreciation for Ethereum's visionary founder, Vitalik Buterin. The post comes in the wake of a pivotal moment in SOL's history that shook the crypto world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe focal point of Yakovenko's tweet can be traced back to a message Buterin shared on Dec. 30 last year, where he acknowledged the earnest and smart developer community at Solana. At that time, Solana was grappling with the consequences of the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which was closely intertwined with the blockchain.\n\nSOL to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThis unfortunate incident resulted in a significant drop in the price of SOL, hitting a three-year low of $7.78 per token.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat added to the challenge was the dwindling number of developers within the Solana ecosystem, with only approximately 70 left. This raised concerns about the platform's future viability.\n\nCrypto unity\n\nYakovenko's appreciation for Buterin's message extends beyond the competition and rivalry between the Ethereum and Solana communities. He emphasizes that even though the two blockchain ecosystems may have their differences, they are united by the common goal of advancing the industry.\n\nWith all fairness @chainyoda, my read is that Mert isn\u2019t attacking ethereum folks or the community.\n\n\n\nWe are supposed to argue about tech and vision in the search of truth. Maybe it\u2019s not possible to build the best world computer and best stateless money in one design.\n\n\n\nThere\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) November 1, 2023\n\nThe Solana cofounder asserts that these disputes should revolve around technological advancement and vision, ultimately contributing to the betterment of the entire crypto industry.\n\nIn essence, the message highlights the significance of collaboration and unity within the crypto space, reminding us that even in times of competition, the industry thrives on collective efforts to push the boundaries of what's possible."

Coinbase, a prominent US crypto exchange, acknowledges Solana as a formidable contender to Ethereum in the layer-1 blockchain space.\n\nLet\u2019s uncover the elements fueling Solana\u2019s growth, understand what it is, dissect its technological advancements, and take a closer look at its expanding community and ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Solana, and how does it work?\n\nSolana, often abbreviated as SOL, is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects at large scales.\n\nFor instance, a real-world application on Solana might be a decentralized exchange (DEX) where thousands of trades happen every second. The architecture of Solana facilitates the processing of these trades, aiming for efficiency, security, and accuracy.\n\nSolana introduces a mechanism known as proof of history (PoH), setting it apart from some traditional consensus methods. PoH is designed to generate a historical record to verify the occurrence of an event at a specific time.\n\nThis is achieved by encoding the passage of time in the data before it becomes a part of the ledger. The intention is to streamline the consensus-reaching process across nodes, as they have a shared, trusted notion of time.\n\nThis emphasis on time-saving is further realized in Solana\u2019s Tower BFT, a byzantine fault-tolerant derivative of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus.\n\nTower BFT utilizes the synchronized clock provided by PoH to reduce messaging overhead and latency. This allows for faster confirmations of transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana also features the Gulf Stream protocol, which attempts to optimize transaction handling by pre-processing and sending them to validators prior to the completion of the previous transaction set. This approach is intended to reduce confirmation times and improve network efficiency.\n\nWhen considering all these mechanisms together, Solana aims to support a high volume of transactions per second, positioning itself as a competitive entity in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana\u2019s tokenomics: understanding SOL\u2019s role and distribution\n\nSolana\u2019s financial structure is centered around its native token, SOL. This token has multiple functions within the network. The primary use of SOL is for transactions and for users to interact with dApps on the Solana platform.\n\nSimply put, if a user wants to carry out an operation or use a dApp on Solana, they need SOL.\n\nYou might also like: Solana close to 1-year high amid declining open interest\n\nStaking is another important function of SOL. Users can help secure the network by staking their SOL tokens. They can do this by either becoming validators themselves or by assigning their tokens to existing validators.\n\nThose who stake their tokens are rewarded, and the annual percentage yield (APY) for this is typically between 7-8%. However, it\u2019s important to mention that this rate can change based on several factors.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the network\u2019s security. They receive new SOL tokens as rewards, as well as a share of transaction fees. This approach encourages active participation in the network and aims to ensure its stability.\n\nRegarding the distribution of SOL, recent data shows that out of a total supply of 561 million tokens, about 420 million are in circulation. This implies that approximately 141 million SOL tokens have been burned over time.\n\nSolana use cases\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology has nurtured a variety of use cases due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Here are some notable use cases:\n\nDecentralized finance (defi)\n\nSolana\u2019s high throughput and low transaction fees make it a fertile ground for defi applications like DEXs, lending protocols, and digital wallets. Examples include Solana-based DEXs like Orca and Serum, and lending platforms like Apricot Finance and Solend\u200b.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nSolana facilitates the creation of NFT platforms and marketplaces where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Notable platforms include Metaplex and Solanart, which allow users to interact with digital artwork and other unique assets\u200b.\n\nGaming\n\nSolana hosts games with play-to-earn (P2E) systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs through gameplay. Examples include online metaverses like Chainers and Aurory, and survival-puzzle games like Naga Kingdom\u200b.\n\nWeb3 applications\n\nSolana supports the development of web3 apps that leverage modern internet technologies. Examples include Audius, a decentralized audio streaming app, Squads, a treasury fund management application, and Alchemy, a platform for building dApps quickly\u200b.\n\nCross-chain functionality\n\nSolana has also been leveraged for cross-chain transactions, as seen with the integration of USDC-SPL in Trust Wallet, enabling users to send and receive USDC with minimal fees and swift transaction times.\n\nSolana\u2019s hurdles in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Solana navigated a rough path marked by several network outages, casting a shadow on its robustness.\n\nThe most notable was a slowdown in block production on Feb. 25, following an upgrade attempt from validator software version 1.13 to 1.14, which led to considerable disruptions. Efforts to revert to version 1.13 were insufficient, ultimately necessitating a network restart.\n\nThe Solana network is currently restarting after an issue during the upgrade from 1.13 to 1.14 that slowed block finalization\n\n\n\nOnce validators with 80% of stake have restarted the network will resume\n\n\n\nYou can track the progress of the restart here:https://t.co/HclrUqWQ2y \u2014 Solana \ud83e\udded Compass \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc83 (@SolanaCompass) February 25, 2023\n\nThe February incident wasn\u2019t singular; Solana contended with multiple outages in the past, spotlighting stability as a critical area for improvement. These technical difficulties attracted criticism from the broader blockchain community and competitors, stirring a debate about Solana\u2019s reliability as a Layer 1 solution.\n\nComplicating matters, the root causes of certain outages remained elusive, even to Solana\u2019s developers, leaving some issues unresolved over extended periods. This ambiguity and the recurring downtimes prompted concerns regarding Solana\u2019s reliability, particularly given the fierce competition in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana long-term trend and price prediction\n\nThe Solana price has attracted attention recently, with many keeping a close eye on insights into its potential trajectory amid bullish market sentiment.\n\nAccording to DigitalCoinPrice, the Solana crypto price is set to reach around $83.44 by the end of 2023. The Solana price prediction for 2024 is approximately $94.60. By 2025, it\u2019s anticipated to climb to $141.53 and $389.83 by 2030.\n\nDespite the potential shown by Solana in various domains, it\u2019s essential to consider the rocky patches it navigated through in 2023, which have led some crypto analysts to project a lower price trajectory for SOL.\n\nReflecting on the slowdown in block production and recurring outages this year, some analysts have exercised caution in their forecasts, predicting an average SOL rate of around $23.89 in January 2024, which could potentially dip to a minimum of $23.34, with a maximum cap at $24.43.\n\nYou might also like: Solana gaining momentum according to Nansen report\n\nYet, those interested in the Solana crypto price should be wary of banking solely on forecasts. The volatile nature of the crypto market, combined with ever-evolving Solana news, suggests that price predictions shouldn\u2019t be the sole basis for investment decisions.\n\nInvestors must exercise caution and adhere to the cardinal rule of investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. It\u2019s advisable to conduct thorough research, understand the inherent risks, and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before making any investment decisions."

Therefore, it\u2019s essential to choose a Tether wallet that aligns with your specific requirements. Certain crypto wallets are well-suited for multi-use scenarios, supporting multiple cryptocurrencies on diverse blockchain networks.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the type of USDT wallet you prefer, such as a software wallet or hardware Tether wallet. Investors will need to choose from a non-custodial or custodial Tether wallet.\n\nSoftware wallet companies offer options like mobile apps and desktop software, while hardware wallets are tangible devices. Each type of Tether wallet comes with its unique set of advantages and disadvantages, which we delve into further in the upcoming section.\n\nSecurity is a paramount concern when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets. It\u2019s crucial to choose a reputable wallet provider, enable two-factor authentication, and safeguard your private keys or recovery phrases.\n\nBest Cold Wallet for Crypto\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most secure Tether wallet available, a cold wallet might be the right choice for you. A \u201ccold\u201d or hardware wallet is a physical device which holds your keys. As a result, it is much more difficult for anyone to access your wallet remotely. They give you an added layer of protection from malware or phishing attacks.\n\nTo use a hardware wallet, you\u2019ll need to plug it into a computer or supported device. You can unlock your wallet and access your keys with a PIN and a recovery seed phrase. A seed phrase is a list of words you\u2019ll use to re-generate your keys. Then you can create a transaction and confirm it on your wallet\u2019s display.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of cold Tether wallets for you to choose from. The best cold wallet will be the one that suits your needs and budget. Cold wallets are the most expensive option, however, they offer the highest level of protection.\n\nSome traders will store the bulk of their funds in a hardware wallet and then use an insured software wallet like CryptoWallet.com for day-to-day trading online.\n\nLedger lets you store over 1,1000 different cryptocurrencies including Tether.

Hardware wallets can cost over $100 which can be a hefty initial investment. Many crypto traders prefer to use a secure free wallet.\n\nFree software wallets are by far the most convenient option. They can be set up in minutes and integrated with your mobile phone or browser. They usually don\u2019t require KYC to trade solely in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, free software wallets are often more susceptible to hacking or malware. Being constantly online means that your funds could be at higher risk in an online wallet. Here at CryptoWallet.com, we don\u2019t believe you should have to choose between security and cost.\n\nCryptoWallet.com supports the five highest-cap currencies including Tether in our free cryptocurrency wallet.

        "content": "Andrew Tate, a prominent social media figure, recently surprised the crypto community by promoting his cryptocurrency university. This comes as a departure from his earlier disdain for the crypto space. While the crypto X community continues to discuss the subject, experts have had their say on what his endorsement means for top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and VC Spectra (SPCT). Let\u2019s find out.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nAndrew Tate: From Crypto skeptic to believer\n\nOn October 26, Andrew Tate joined a long list of notable individuals who endorsed crypto and made a U-turn from their hardline stances against the sector. On his X (formerly Twitter) account, Tate promoted his cryptocurrency university, which aims to teach students how to make money in the crypto space. His latest stance marks a significant departure from a statement he made back in April.\n\nEveryone on my team made money on $BTC It was as easy as listening to the professionals who have worked every day for YEARS to make sure they get it right. You could have won too You could win on future dumps and future pumps But you won\u2019t do it alone. https://t.co/BoAS3LFM8V pic.twitter.com/8V06ye4D5e \u2014 Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) October 26, 2023\n\nIn April, Tate criticized the crypto space and crypto influencers, saying that \u201cthe easy money isn\u2019t in crypto anymore.\u201d However, his university now aims to teach crypto enthusiasts how to accurately predict crypto pumps, stating that \u201cin Hustler\u2019s University, we actually tell you when to buy and when to sell crypto.\u201d\n\nAndrew Tate has remained a polarizing figure for his views, both within and outside the crypto space. Specifically, he has been criticized by many for his indirect promotion of meme coins and rugpulls.\n\nHow does Andrew Tate\u2019s endorsement affect the futures of Ethereum (ETH) and VC Spectra (SPCT)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWhat does Andrew Tate\u2019s endorsement of Crypto mean for Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nBeing a top ten cryptocurrency, many believe that only the endorsements of institutions, leading businessmen, or industry experts could drive a surge in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price. Accordingly, Ethereum (ETH) dropped from $1,804.04 on October 26 to $1,795.55 on October 29, a nominal 0.47% decrease in price.\n\nWhen asked how high Ethereum can go, the ETH price prediction from bulls is very optimistic. According to these experts, with the SEC likely to approve the Bitcoin ETF applications before it, the Ethereum (ETH) price could reach $2,500.00 by 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, bearish analysts\u2019 ETH price prediction for Q4 remains pessimistic. This ETH price prediction is based on Ethereum technical analysis backed by indicators such as the Cumulative Delta and RSI. Based on their analysis, they think Ethereum (ETH) could decline further to $1,350.00 by the end of Q4 2023.\n\nVC Spectra: The expert-vetted top ICO of 2023\n\nGiven that Andrew Tate has become a crypto crusader, he will be well-poised to further explore the dynamic cryptocurrency space. One of the top DeFi projects he might consider is VC Spectra (SPCT), a groundbreaking decentralized hedge fund and trading platform.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund at the forefront of the blockchain and fintech revolution, positioning it as a leading blockchain ICO within the burgeoning DeFi landscape. It offers investors access to new ICOs and exclusive voting privileges.\n\nAt the heart of VC Spectra\u2019s governance is SPCT, a deflationary Bitcoin BRC-20 token, which features a burn mechanism that could drive future increases in SPCT value. Currently, in Stage 4 of its public presale, SPCT is priced at $0.055, providing early investors with an impressive ROI of 587.5%. This rapid ascent in SPCT\u2019s value is primarily due to mounting interest from institutional investors.\n\nMarket experts have stated that VC Spectra\u2019s token, SPCT, is poised to surpass its end-of-presale price target of $0.080. Moreover, VC Spectra offers a momentous bonus on all deposits, further solidifying SPCT\u2019s status as one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Photo: File\n\nIn today's cryptocurrency market, optimism abounds, with a sea of green dominating on Thursday, November 2.\n\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, which could either fuel the ongoing crypto rally or potentially dampen market sentiment.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's recent announcement was met with applause from the market.\n\nDuring Wednesday's FOMC meeting, the central bank decided unanimously to maintain its benchmark interest rates at their current levels, keeping the key federal funds rate within the 5.25%-5.5% target range, where it has remained since July.\n\nNotably, this decision followed a series of 11 rate hikes, including four in 2023.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts have much to celebrate as Bitcoin's price experienced a 2.77% increase, reaching $35,363.40, and its trading volume surged by 60.64% to $25.03 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe market cap also received a boost of 2.80%, reaching $690.77 billion. Over the past week, Bitcoin's price has appreciated by over 2%.\n\nEthereum's price didn't lag behind, with a 2.29% increase, now trading at $1,846.22, accompanied by a 66.85% rise in one-day volume, reaching $11.38 billion.\n\nSimultaneously, XRP's price also saw a 3.24% rise, landing at $0.606, while its 24-hour volume decreased by 14.42% to $1.87 billion.\n\nAmong other prominent cryptocurrencies, Solana's price surged by 9.94% to $41.82, while Cardano's price witnessed a 6.42% jump, with trading volumes rising by 151.41% and 13.46% to $3.74 billion and $357.96 million, respectively.\n\nEven meme coins joined in on the optimism, with Dogecoin's price increasing by 2.62% to $0.06889, although with a 0.23% decrease in trading volume to $483.85 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu's price surged by 3.53% to $0.000007959, with trading volume up 5.58% from the previous day, reaching $169.30 million.\n\nThese gains across major cryptocurrencies contributed to a notable upswing in the overall crypto market.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap rose by 2.85% from the previous day, reaching $1.31 trillion, with a market fear and greed index reading of 74, indicating a \"greed\" sentiment.\n\nThe total market cap increased by 43.49% in the last 24 hours, now standing at $57.9 billion.\n\nThe crypto market's surge underscores the growing interest in digital assets, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming stance, set to have a significant impact on the market's future trajectory."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Path to $2,500 in November: What\u2019s Driving the Surge? - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset, has been making headlines with its recent price movements. Over the past week, Ethereum\u2019s value has held steady within the $1,750 to $1,850 range. As we step into November 2023, many are curious about the factors that could potentially push ETH\u2019s price to reach the coveted $2,500 mark.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance in Comparison to Bitcoin\n\nThe past week has seen Ethereum losing some ground to Bitcoin as the entire crypto market witnessed a surge in activity. However, before diving into the details of what could drive Ethereum\u2019s price upward in November, let\u2019s take a step back and understand how these digital currencies work.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, each with its unique features and use cases. Ethereum is often seen as more than just a digital currency; it\u2019s a platform that enables developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts, adding layers of complexity beyond Bitcoin\u2019s primary use as a store of value.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are keeping a close eye on Ethereum as November 2023 unfolds. Over the past week, Ethereum\u2019s price has exhibited a relatively stable range, oscillating between $1,750 and $1,850. However, the burning question on everyone\u2019s mind is: What will it take for Ethereum to achieve the coveted $2,500 mark in the coming weeks? To answer this, we need to explore the dynamics of the crypto market, Ethereum\u2019s unique features, and potential catalysts driving its price upwards.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: A Tale of Two Cryptos\n\nBefore delving into the factors affecting Ethereum\u2019s price, it\u2019s essential to grasp the distinctions between Ethereum and Bitcoin. These two cryptocurrencies, while both part of the digital asset landscape, serve distinct purposes and possess unique features that influence their market dynamics.\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d is primarily utilized as a store of value and a medium of exchange. It was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most recognized and valuable one. Bitcoin\u2019s primary role in the crypto market is as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. While it has faced competition from various altcoins, Bitcoin\u2019s position as a digital gold standard has remained unwavering.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is often viewed as a versatile platform, transcending the confines of being solely a digital currency. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain serves as a foundation for the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, enabling developers to build a wide range of applications that go beyond traditional financial transactions. This multifaceted utility has made Ethereum a hub for innovation, with its blockchain acting as a playground for developers, leading to a diverse ecosystem of projects.\n\nPrice Dynamics and Catalysts for Ethereum in November\n\nAs we move further into November 2023, understanding Ethereum\u2019s potential for reaching the $2,500 price mark involves considering a variety of factors that have historically influenced the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMarket Sentiment: Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously sensitive to market sentiment. News, events, and social media chatter can drive both buying and selling behavior. Positive news and a bullish market sentiment can push Ethereum\u2019s price upwards. Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade: Ethereum has been working on a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 for some time. This upgrade aims to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security. Once fully implemented, it may attract more users and developers to the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially increasing demand for Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. DeFi and NFTs: The explosive growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and the non-fungible token (NFT) market has been closely tied to Ethereum. As these sectors continue to expand, Ethereum\u2019s utility and value proposition as the go-to blockchain for DeFi and NFT projects will likely keep driving demand for ETH. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory decisions and clarity play a substantial role in the cryptocurrency market. Positive regulatory news can boost investor confidence and attract institutional players, potentially increasing demand for Ethereum. Economic Conditions: Cryptocurrencies have often been seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. As traditional financial markets face uncertainty, some investors turn to cryptocurrencies as a store of value, which can influence Ethereum\u2019s price. Adoption and Usage: The utilization of Ethereum\u2019s network for various applications and use cases is a significant driver of its price. The more DApps and projects that run on Ethereum, the more demand there is for Ether, further supporting its price. Bitcoin\u2019s Performance: Ethereum is closely tied to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. While it has its unique dynamics, the general sentiment in the crypto market often mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s performance. As Bitcoin gains or loses value, Ethereum tends to follow suit. Global Events: Geopolitical and macroeconomic events can also affect the cryptocurrency market. These events can impact investor behavior and capital flow, indirectly influencing Ethereum\u2019s price. Technological Advancements: Ethereum\u2019s continuous development and the introduction of new features can increase its utility and, in turn, its price. Updates and improvements to the Ethereum network can enhance its appeal to developers and users.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and predictions are challenging. Achieving the $2,500 mark for Ethereum in November 2023 is certainly feasible, but it depends on a combination of the factors mentioned above, as well as unforeseen events that can quickly change the market\u2019s direction.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey to $2,500 in November 2023 is a subject of great interest and speculation in the crypto community. The cryptocurrency\u2019s unique capabilities, coupled with various market factors and catalysts, make this ambitious price target attainable. However, it\u2019s crucial for investors and enthusiasts to stay informed about the ever-evolving crypto landscape and exercise caution in a market known for its volatility. As November progresses, Ethereum\u2019s price movements will continue to be closely watched, and the factors discussed here will play a significant role in shaping its trajectory."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Investing The Dawn of the Next Crypto Bull Run: When and Why? InvestingJournal The Dawn of the Next Crypto Bull Run: When and Why? Torsten Hartmann\n\nThe cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, is a realm of digital assets that has seen periods of exponential growth, often referred to as \u2018bull runs\u2019.\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a potential surge, it\u2019s crucial to understand the factors that could trigger this event, the key players that might lead the charge, and the strategies to navigate this dynamic market.\n\nQuick summary: crypto bull run prediction Topic Description \ud83d\udcca Driving Factors Several factors could potentially drive the next crypto bull run: demand and supply, market news sentiment, institutional adoption, economic and political factors, and scarcity of alternative investment. \ud83c\udf10 Ethereum\u2019s Role and Layer 2 Solutions Ethereum is a major player in the crypto market and is preparing for significant changes, including layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs. \ud83d\udd2e Looking to the Future The upcoming development of zkevm in the Ethereum ecosystem could further improve scalability, making Ethereum an even more attractive platform for developers and users. \u23f0 Challenge of Timing the Crypto Market Timing the cryptocurrency market can be challenging, but traders and investors use strategies like technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and market economy analysis to time the market more effectively. \u2744\ufe0f Crypto Winter and Anticipation of a New Bull Run The recent crypto winter saw a significant drop in cryptocurrency prices, but there are signs of recovery with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices recently surging. \ud83d\udcc5 What Year is the Next Bull Run in Crypto Historical price trends and market cycles suggest that the next crypto bull market may commence in the first half of 2024, following the subsequent Bitcoin halving, and reach its zenith in 2025.\n\nThe Driving Factors\n\nSeveral factors could potentially drive the next crypto bull run:\n\nDemand and Supply: The interest of investors and traders can influence the demand for crypto assets, leading to an increase or decrease in prices. Market News Sentiment: Partnerships, optimistic bulletins, new projects, or technology roll-outs that draw investors\u2019 interest will usually increase the asset\u2019s price. Institutional Adoption: This signifies the utility of cryptocurrency, which could cause a ripple effect on retail users to hop on mainstream adoption. Economic and Political Factors: Economy development and political stability help advance cryptocurrency adoption and increase financial inclusion. Scarcity of Alternative Investment: Slow-moving or low-return assets are less popular during uncertainty, resulting in a surge for higher-volatility, high-return assets like crypto. As the demand increases, the price of crypto will naturally increase too. Inflation and Interest Rate: Higher interest rates typically mean it is easier for an investor with spare cash to invest in speculative and riskier assets like a high-liquidity cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role and the Impact of Layer 2 Solutions\n\nEthereum, a major player in the crypto market, is gearing up for significant changes. Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, has emphasized the need to solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues before the next bull run. He warns that if these issues are not addressed, a spike in on-chain activity could result in Ethereum users being hit with sky-high transaction fees.\n\nTo address these scaling issues, Ethereum and its community have been developing and implementing Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism. These solutions are designed to increase the blockchain\u2019s capacity, thereby improving the scalability of Ethereum and reducing transaction costs. This improvement in scalability and reduction in costs could lead to increased adoption of Ethereum, potentially driving the next bull run.\n\nLooking to the future, zkEVM is an upcoming development in the Ethereum ecosystem. This technology could further improve the scalability of Ethereum, making it an even more attractive platform for developers and users.\n\nThe majority of crypto development and innovations happen on Ethereum, and these improvements in scalability could lead to even more development and innovation on the platform. This could create a positive feedback loop, with increased development and innovation leading to increased adoption, which in turn could drive the next bull run.\n\nThe Challenge of Timing the Crypto Market\n\nTiming the cryptocurrency market can be challenging as prices fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably. However, there are several strategies that traders and investors deploy to time the market more effectively. These include technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and market economy analysis. While these strategies can provide some insights, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no 100% accuracy for market prediction.\n\nRead also:\n\nThe Crypto Winter and the Anticipation of a New Bull Run\n\nThe recent crypto winter, which saw a significant drop in cryptocurrency prices, has led to speculation about the start of a new bull run. However, predictions vary, with some experts suggesting that the crypto winter may extend into 2023 or even 2026. Despite this, there are signs of recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices recently surging in Q3 and Q4 of 2023.\n\nWhat year is the next bull run in crypto?\n\nForecasting the precise moment of the upcoming cryptocurrency bull market is a complex task due to the market\u2019s inherent volatility. Nevertheless, historical price trends and market cycles suggest that the next crypto bull market may commence in the first half of 2024, following the subsequent Bitcoin halving, and reach its zenith in 2025, as per coincheckup.com.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event, which transpires approximately every four years, slashes the block reward for miners by 50%. Historically, this event has resulted in a heightened scarcity of Bitcoin, potentially driving up prices as demand surpasses supply, according to coincheckup.com.\n\nAdditional factors that could precipitate a new crypto bull market include:\n\nMarket sentiment and hype: Positive news, endorsements from prominent figures, and increased media exposure can generate a hype cycle, thereby instigating a bull market, as noted by coincheckup.com. Adoption and acceptance: The widespread embrace of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions, businesses, and governments can set off a bullish trend, as highlighted by coincheckup.com. Technological advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can pique investor interest, as stated by coincheckup.com.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market is subject to a myriad of influences, and accurately predicting the onset of the next bull market is virtually impossible. Consequently, it is vital to diligently monitor market trends and indicators, and base investment decisions on these insights.\n\nFor those gearing up for the next crypto bull market, a long-term investment strategy is recommended, coupled with a diversified investment portfolio and thorough fundamental analysis to gauge the growth potential of cryptocurrencies, as advised by coincheckup.com.\n\nIt is important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor prior to making investment decisions.\n\nWhile the timing of the next crypto bull market remains uncertain, with varying opinions among experts, some posit that the bull market has already commenced in 2023. Others forecast that the next Bitcoin bull run will kick off post the Bitcoin halving in 2024, reaching its peak in late 2025. Some traders even speculate that the bull run could materialize as early as 2024. Regardless of the differing viewpoints, it is imperative to recognize the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility and unpredictability. Hence, investors should always conduct their own research and make informed decisions that align with their risk tolerance and investment objectives.\n\nStrategies for the Next Bull Run\n\nIdentify Underrated Projects: One approach to anticipating the next bull run is to identify underrated projects that have the potential to gain significant traction. This strategy implies that the next bull run may occur when enthusiasm for the overall market is at a low point, creating opportunities for undervalued projects to shine. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of focusing solely on meme coins and gambling for quick gains, investors should consider targeting projects with strong fundamentals. By analyzing the underlying technology, use cases, and potential growth prospects, individuals can identify cryptocurrencies that have a higher likelihood of achieving substantial returns. NFTs and the Growth Sector: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may play a significant role in the next bull run, potentially emerging as the largest growth sector. NFTs have gained considerable attention and adoption in recent years, attracting both artists and investors. If the trend continues, the growing interest in NFTs could contribute to the overall market momentum and trigger the next significant upswing in the crypto market. On-Chain Trading and Edge Development: On-chain trading allows individuals to gain insights from blockchain data, enabling a deeper understanding of market dynamics. Although new traders may initially experience losses, gaining experience and knowledge can prove highly rewarding when new money flows into the market during the next bullish phase. Web2 to Web3 Transition: The integration of blockchain technology into traditional internet applications could attract a wider user base, generating increased interest and investment in the crypto market. Therefore, the emergence of innovative Web3 applications might serve as a catalyst for the next market upswing.\n\nIn conclusion, the anticipation for the next crypto bull run is high, with various factors expected to drive this surge. However, it\u2019s important for investors to do their own research and understand the risks involved in the volatile crypto market. The dawn of the next crypto bull run could be just around the corner, and those who are prepared stand to reap the most benefits."
