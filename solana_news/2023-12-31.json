        "title": "Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "The latest Ethereum All Core Developers meeting finally put some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nWith the caveat that it\u2019s only \u201cif no major issues arise,\u201d Ethereum devs are eyeing the following dates for forking Ethereum\u2019s public testnets:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation.\n\nThey also discussed what comes next \u2014 the as-yet-un-nicknamed Prague/Electra upgrade. The Ethereum community is considering whether to focus on a large core feature \u2014 which could take a year of work \u2014 or structure the upgrade around multiple smaller improvements, which could be feasible for late 2024.\n\nA decision will come in the new year, but for now, here are some of the improvements to watch in 2024 in the wake of Dencun:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)\n\nThis is the big kahuna among Dencun EIPs, which were the focus of many news stories in 2023.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nThe upgrade \u201cwill reduce the cost of data availability across all layer-2s,\u201d StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson told Blockworks. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that Starknet is very much anticipating so that users can have lower costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at the \u201cforefront\u201d of what Lucas Henning, chief technology officer of Web3 wallet developer Suku, calls \u201ca year of groundbreaking improvements for Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201c[EIP-4844 is] a transformational enhancement\u201d that will slash rollups gas fees \u201cby up to 100x,\u201d Henning told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nAccount abstraction comes into its own\n\nAlso at the top of Henning\u2019s mind are improvements taking advantage of account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900.\n\nERCs are a subset of EIPs focusing specifically on token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem. They define rules for token implementations to ensure interoperability. Unlike some EIPs that modify the core protocol, ERCs typically don\u2019t require a hard fork.\n\nERC-4337 went live in March and the concept of account abstraction \u201cwill play a pivotal role as the most significant changes for the end-user,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is set to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with wallets, making gasless transactions the standard and secure social logins the new norm, fundamentally reshaping the Ethereum user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and contract accounts controlled by their code. Account abstraction blurs this distinction, allowing users to create accounts that behave more like smart contracts.\n\nIt can enhance both user experience and security, and allows for more complex account logic, such as multisig wallets or social recovery of lost keys.\n\nERC-6900, introduced the concept of \u201cdelegated transactions.\u201d This standard, which also did not require changes to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet consensus, allows users to delegate the ability to send transactions on their behalf, for instance, to make one approval for a batch of actions to save time and hassle.\n\nEIP-1153 (transient storage opcodes)\n\nThis proposal, part of Dencun, aims to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during smart contract execution.\n\nTraditional storage operations on Ethereum are permanent and consume gas. This can be inefficient for temporary data that doesn\u2019t need to persist for longer than one transaction.\n\nEIP-1153 is an opcode (operational code) that would allow smart contracts to use transient storage \u2014 storage that would be wiped clean at the end of transaction execution.\n\nThe Uniswap team lobbied for 1153 to be included, and wanted it already in Shapella, but they couldn\u2019t rally enough support to reach consensus among the core developers. The upgrade is expected to play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Uniswap\u2019s upcoming v4 protocol.\n\nRead more: What has Uniswap Labs cooked up for v4?\n\nBy enabling temporary storage, EIP-1153 can reduce the gas costs associated with storing data during contract execution and provide developers more flexibility in designing smart contracts.\n\nAnd by reducing the burden on permanent storage and minimizing state bloat, EIP-1153 can contribute to the overall scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-4788 (Beacon block root commits)\n\nImagine Ethereum as a vast library with two main sections: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) section, which is like the reading room where people come to read books (execute smart contracts), and the Beacon Chain section, which is like the library\u2019s catalog system, keeping track of all the books and their locations (consensus and coordination of the Ethereum network).\n\nBefore EIP-4788, these two sections functioned somewhat independently. The EVM section doesn\u2019t have direct access to the up-to-date catalog; it has to rely on indirect methods to understand what\u2019s happening in the Beacon Chain section.\n\nEIP-4788 proposes to put a \u201cBeacon Block Root\u201d (a summary or hash tree root of the parent block) into each EVM block.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving from an outdated card filing system in a library \u2014 inefficient and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 to a system with a real-time, accurate and direct link to the main library database.\n\nIn this modern library, every time a new book is added, moved or removed (the Beacon Chain updates), the readers (EVM) have immediate and accurate information. Readers can trust they\u2019re getting the most current information and the library operations (like executing smart contracts) are more aligned with the overall catalog system (the state of the consensus layer).\n\nAll this happens in a trust-minimized manner, eliminating the need for external oracles to provide this data, and thereby reducing potential points of failure or manipulation.\n\nThis change is particularly beneficial for liquid staking protocols such as Lido, smart contract-based bridges and restaking solutions, as it allows these protocols to access crucial data like validator balances and states directly from the consensus layer, enhancing their security and operational efficiency.\n\nEIP-4788 essentially introduces a protocol-level oracle, relaying Ethereum\u2019s consensus state throughout the mainnet.\n\nMisha Komarov, founder of Nil Foundation, which is deploying a zkOracle for Lido, called it \u201cdefinitely helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need the consensus layer state root within their application logic (right now it is being proven by Casper FFG proof done via zkLLVM to the execution layer within the zkOracle design,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: New Ethereum rollup takes a zero-knowledge approach to sharding\n\nEIP-5656 (MCOPY opcode)\n\nThe EVM operates using a set of opcodes that dictate various operations.\n\nEIP-5656 introduces a new opcode called MCOPY, which is proposed to optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts.\n\nIn the current EVM architecture, copying large data segments can be inefficient and costly when using existing opcodes. MCOPY offers a more efficient way, one which is expected to reduce the gas fees associated with these operations, while improving performance.\n\nFaster memory operations mean quicker execution of contracts, and developers would have more tools at their disposal to optimize their smart contracts \u2014 particularly when dealing with large data structures or complex operations that involve memory manipulation.\n\nEIP-6780 (restrict SELFDESTRUCT)\n\nIn Ethereum, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode allows a smart contract to delete itself from the blockchain.\n\nWhen executed, it removes the contract\u2019s code and storage from the state and sends the contract\u2019s remaining ether to a specified address.\n\nHowever, this feature has led to several issues, including complexity in state management and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy restricting SELFDESTRUCT, Ethereum can better manage its state size, leading to a more stable and predictable blockchain.\n\nThis is crucial for the network\u2019s long-term scalability and maintenance, as it will simplify future Ethereum upgrades.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Shares Ethereum Roadmap For 2024, Focuses on Six Key Components\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, outlining the project's continued focus on six main components.\n\nButerin posted on X (formerly Twitter) an updated roadmap with annotations and diagrams, elaborating on each of the six elements: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nButerin noted that as Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to the 2023 roadmap. The Merge, which integrated the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain the Beacon Chain in September 2022, remains a key focus area. Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining a simple and resilient PoS consensus.\n\nFollowing the Merge, the most significant observation on Ethereum was the transition from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, leading to a major reduction in the network's overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin also highlighted the developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF), which aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH).\n\nButerin stated:\n\n\"The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It's becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design's current weaknesses.\"\n\nButerin's roadmap also emphasizes the importance of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, which align with the original cypherpunk principles of Ethereum.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "How to Mine Ethereum: A Step-by-Step Guide - Blockchain Council",
        "content": "Running and Managing Your Ethereum Mining Rig\n\nEffectively running and managing an Ethereum mining rig is crucial for maximizing profitability and ensuring the longevity of your mining operation. This section of the guide will provide essential tips on starting the mining process, monitoring performance, maintaining your setup, troubleshooting common issues, and optimizing mining efficiency.\n\nStarting the Mining Process\n\nInitial Setup: After assembling and configuring your hardware and software, ensure all connections are secure and the mining software is properly set up with your wallet address and mining pool details.\n\nPowering On: Switch on your mining rig. The initial boot-up might take some time as the system checks all components.\n\nLaunching Mining Software: Once the system is up, launch your chosen mining software. It should automatically connect to the mining pool (if you\u2019re pool mining) and start the mining process.\n\nMonitoring Initial Performance: Monitor the initial performance for a few hours to ensure everything is running smoothly. Pay attention to hash rates, temperature readings, and any error messages.\n\nMonitoring and Maintenance\n\nContinual monitoring of your mining rig is not just about checking its performance but also about preempting potential issues. Regularly tracking metrics such as hash rate and system temperature helps in maintaining the health of your mining rig. Efficient temperature management is paramount. High temperatures can be detrimental to your hardware, so it\u2019s essential to have effective cooling solutions in place and ensure your mining environment is well-ventilated.\n\nKeeping your software updated is another critical aspect of maintenance. Regular updates to your mining software and GPU drivers can lead to improvements in efficiency, security enhancements, and sometimes, increased mining capabilities.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nNo mining operation is immune to issues, but timely troubleshooting can save you from prolonged downtimes and potential losses. Overheating is a common problem, often addressed by enhancing cooling solutions or cleaning existing fans and heat sinks.

Finding an efficient balance is key to maximizing profitability.\n\nOff-Peak Mining: If your local area offers variable electricity pricing, consider mining during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower.\n\nUsing Mining Calculators to Estimate Profitability\n\nMining calculators are invaluable tools for miners to estimate profitability. These calculators consider various factors, including your rig\u2019s hash rate, power consumption, electricity cost, and the current Ethereum price.\n\nInputting Data: Accurately input data such as your hardware\u2019s hash rate, power consumption, and your electricity cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) into the calculator.\n\nAdjusting for Mining Pool Fees: If you\u2019re using a mining pool, include the pool fee in your calculations as it affects your net earnings.\n\nRegularly Update Parameters: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and factors like Ethereum\u2019s price and mining difficulty can fluctuate significantly. Regularly update these parameters in your calculator for the most accurate profitability estimates.\n\nComparative Analysis: Use mining calculators to compare different mining setups and strategies. This can help in making informed decisions about hardware upgrades or changes in your mining approach.\n\nRisks and Considerations in Ethereum Mining\n\nEthereum mining, like any investment venture, comes with its set of risks and considerations. Understanding these factors is essential not only for informed decision-making but also for ensuring compliance with various legal and ethical standards. This section of our guide on \u2018How to Mine Ethereum\u2019 delves into the volatility of cryptocurrency, legal and regulatory considerations, as well as the environmental and ethical impacts of mining. Adhering to Google\u2019s CRAFT and EEAT guidelines, this comprehensive discussion aims to provide accurate and latest information for potential miners.\n\nThe Volatility of Cryptocurrency and Its Impact on Mining\n\nMarket Fluctuations: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. The value of Ethereum can fluctuate wildly, which directly impacts the profitability of mining. High volatility can mean rapid changes in the ROI of your mining operation.\n\nImpact on Mining Decisions: The fluctuating price of Ethereum can influence decisions such as when to sell the mined Ethereum, whether to invest in more mining equipment, or even when to cease operations.\n\nLong-term vs Short-term: The volatility also plays a significant role in determining whether Ethereum mining is a viable long-term strategy or a short-term opportunity. Miners need to regularly assess market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Considerations\n\nVarying Regulations: Cryptocurrency regulations vary significantly across different regions. It is crucial for miners to be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations in their respective regions.\n\nTaxation: Many countries consider earnings from cryptocurrency mining as taxable income. Understanding your tax obligations and maintaining accurate financial records is essential to remain compliant with tax laws.\n\nChanging Legal Landscape: The legal landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Miners should stay informed about potential regulatory changes that could impact their mining activities.\n\nEnvironmental Impact and Ethical Considerations\n\nEnergy Consumption: Ethereum mining is energy-intensive, and the environmental impact of this energy use is a growing concern. The source of the energy (renewable vs non-renewable) used for mining operations plays a significant role in its environmental footprint.\n\nCarbon Footprint: The carbon footprint of mining operations is an important ethical consideration. Miners are increasingly looking towards renewable energy sources to power their operations in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nElectronic Waste: Mining equipment can have a limited lifespan, especially in a rapidly advancing technological field. The disposal of outdated or broken mining hardware contributes to electronic waste, posing another environmental challenge.\n\nCommunity Impact: Large mining operations can have a significant impact on local communities, particularly in terms of energy consumption. In some instances, mining operations can lead to increased electricity costs for local residents.\n\nFuture of Ethereum Mining\n\nThe future of Ethereum mining is poised for a transformative change with the network\u2019s transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This move, part of Ethereum\u2019s ambitious 2.0 upgrade, signifies a fundamental shift in the network\u2019s mechanism for validating transactions and securing its Blockchain. In this in-depth analysis, we\u2019ll explore the nuances of this transition, its implications for miners, and the evolving landscape of Ethereum mining, ensuring alignment with Google\u2019s CRAFT and EEAT guidelines for comprehensive and authoritative content.\n\nThe Essence of Ethereum\u2019s Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nThe switch to Proof of Stake is a response to the increasing environmental concerns and scalability issues associated with Proof of Work. Unlike PoW, where miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the Blockchain, PoS involves validators who commit or \u2018stake\u2019 their Ethereum to participate in the process.\n\nEnergy Consumption: A key driver behind Ethereum\u2019s move to PoS is the significant reduction in energy consumption. PoS eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining operations, making the Ethereum network more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nNetwork Security and Efficiency: PoS is designed to bolster the network\u2019s security and efficiency. Validators staking their Ethereum have a vested interest in maintaining the network\u2019s integrity, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.\n\nImpact on the Mining Community\n\nThis paradigm shift brings about substantial changes for the Ethereum mining community, particularly those who have invested heavily in mining infrastructures.\n\nObsolescence of Mining Hardware: The transition effectively renders traditional Ethereum mining hardware, like GPUs and ASIC miners, obsolete for Ethereum. This development could lead to significant financial implications for miners, as the resale value and utility of their hardware diminish.\n\nReduced Role of Traditional Mining: As Ethereum fully transitions to PoS, the role of traditional mining, as we know it, will cease. This means that the extensive hardware setups currently used for Ethereum mining will no longer be required for network validation.\n\nEmergence of Staking Opportunities: For miners and investors looking to maintain their engagement with Ethereum, staking emerges as a viable alternative. It allows participants to become validators in the network, requiring a significantly lower power and hardware investment compared to traditional mining.\n\nFinancial Considerations for Existing Miners: The shift to PoS may necessitate a reevaluation of financial strategies for existing miners. The depreciation of dedicated mining hardware and the capital required for staking (32 ETH to become a full validator) are crucial factors to consider.\n\nStrategies for Transitioning\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem evolves, miners and investors must adapt to stay relevant and profitable.\n\nDiversifying Crypto Activities: Miners might need to diversify their operations, including mining other PoW cryptocurrencies or exploring other roles in the broader crypto ecosystem, like liquidity provision in DeFi platforms, running nodes for other Blockchains, or participating in staking pools.\n\nAdaptability is Key: The ability to adapt to the changing landscape will be critical. Keeping abreast of developments in Ethereum 2.0 and adjusting investment strategies accordingly will be essential for those looking to continue participating in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring Staking Options: Interested parties should explore the ins and outs of Ethereum staking. This includes understanding the staking process, the risks involved, and the potential rewards. Joining staking pools could be an option for those unable to meet the full 32 ETH requirement for becoming a validator.\n\nResale and Repurposing of Hardware: For those with significant investments in mining hardware, exploring avenues for selling or repurposing their equipment is advisable. This might involve shifting to mine other PoW cryptocurrencies or selling the equipment to others in the mining community.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum mining is a critical process that ensures the Ethereum network functions correctly and securely. The role of miners cannot be overstated; they are indispensable in validating transactions, securing the network, creating new blocks, and maintaining the decentralization that makes Ethereum robust and trustworthy.\n\nFor prospective Ethereum miners, it\u2019s essential to understand the significance of their role. Mining requires a combination of technical knowledge, initial capital investment in hardware, and ongoing operational costs, primarily electricity. However, with the impending shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in Ethereum 2.0, the traditional mining landscape is evolving. Future miners should stay informed about these changes and adapt their strategies accordingly.\n\nEthereum mining offers not just the potential for financial reward but also the opportunity to be part of a revolutionary technology that is reshaping how we think about digital transactions and decentralization. As with any investment, prospective miners should conduct thorough research, consider the risks, and proceed with a clear understanding of both the challenges and opportunities that lie in the world of Ethereum mining.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "title": "Solana Co-Founder Denies That He Is a Hater, Says Calling Ethereum a Cockroach Is a Compliment - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency community recently observed a notable moment where Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko responded to Ethereum Foundation co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision for Ethereum. While Buterin did not directly engage with Yakovenko\u2019s comments, the situation highlighted their differing perspectives on the future of blockchain technology.\n\nVitalik Cypherpunk Vision for Etheruem\u2019s Future\n\nIn a blog post published on 28 Dec 2023, Vitalik presented a vision for Ethereum\u2019s future, deeply rooted in the cypherpunk ethos, which advocates for cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to drive social and political change. This vision aligns with the original principles of Ethereum, emphasizing decentralized tools and privacy technologies to create a more secure and versatile ecosystem.\n\nVitalik revisited Ethereum\u2019s early days, recalling its introduction alongside decentralized messaging and storage tools. While Ethereum\u2019s financial aspects have been prominent, other components like decentralized messaging (used by projects like Status) and storage (with ongoing development in Swarm and newer technologies like IPFS) have received less attention.\n\nThe rise of decentralized social media platforms has opened opportunities to integrate these earlier tools. Vitalik particularly highlighted the potential of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), not just for scalability as ZK rollups but also for enhancing privacy. He cited Zupass, a ZKP-based system by Zuzalu, as an example of how users can authenticate identities without revealing personal details, maintaining privacy and security.\n\nVitalik envisions a cypherpunk world where Ethereum drives a scenario with assets held in ETH, ERC20 tokens, and NFTs, with privacy ensured through stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology. He foresees zero-knowledge voting systems revolutionizing governance within DAOs and the Ethereum protocol, allowing authenticated yet anonymous voting.\n\nThe blog post also discusses the integration of payments, social media, and identity on Ethereum, with Layer 2 solutions facilitating transactions and decentralized platforms storing social media activities. Vitalik advocates for tools like quadratic voting and prediction markets for community governance, emphasizing the importance of Ethereum\u2019s social layer in fostering a cooperative ethos.\n\nVitalik\u2019s vision challenges the Ethereum community to maintain decentralization and support crucial components of the decentralized stack, suggesting iterative development and public goods funding as potential solutions.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s Response and Solana\u2019s Priorities\n\nYakovenko responded to Buterin\u2019s vision by highlighting his own goals for Solana. He emphasized the importance of performance and speed for Solana, envisioning it as a high-performance execution engine.\n\nMake solana even faster. A world where ethereum succeeds as a cockroach settlement layer needs a high performance execution engine that is best in class at synchronizing state at the speed of light. https://t.co/JABjrtNC1k \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 29, 2023\n\nThe \u2018Cockroach\u2019 Comment and Community Reactions\n\nYakovenko\u2019s reference to Ethereum as a \u2018cockroach\u2019 in a separate post sparked discussions within the crypto community. He later clarified that this term was meant as a compliment, symbolizing Ethereum\u2019s resilience and robustness. This clarification came after some community members criticized Yakovenko for seemingly derogatory language, to which he responded by emphasizing the positive connotations of resilience associated with a cockroach.\n\nHuh? Cockroach is a compliment. Means super resilient, like the bug. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 29, 2023\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a newer, faster, high-performance execution engine emerging, Yakovenko asserted Solana\u2019s commitment to performance optimization. He stated that any design improvements would be swiftly adopted to maintain Solana\u2019s speed advantage.\n\nWhat would be faster about it? The whole purpose of solana is to optimize for performance, so if there is any design change to make it faster it will get adopted asap. The only difference would be the hardware \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 29, 2023\n\nFeatured Image via YouTube (Solana Lab\u2019s Channel)"

        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Talks about Ethereum's 2024 Roadmap - Blockchain News",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Talks about Ethereum's 2024 Roadmap Zach Anderson Ethereum's 2024 roadmap, shared by Vitalik Buterin, prioritizes minor adjustments and continuity with core priorities like merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge, and splurge.\n\nWith a strategy that places an emphasis on continuity from the previous year, Ethereum is making steady growth throughout the year 2024, with co-founder Vitalik Buterin serving as the driving force behind this success. A recent sequence of tweets by Buterin reveals that the emphasis for the year 2024 is mainly aligned with the components that have been formed since the beginning of the year: merge, surge, plague, verge, purge, and splurge. This indicates that the strategy for the year is more evolutionary than revolutionary.\n\nThe merging continues to be an essential component in the evolution of Ethereum. Putting an emphasis on the significance of single-slot finality (SSF), Buterin highlights the function that it plays in strengthening the Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture that was created after the merger. He makes the observation that SSF is gradually being seen as the most easy solution to the present limits of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake architecture, which improves the network's security and efficiency at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, steady effort will be made on the surge in 2024, with the primary emphasis being on improving cross-rollup standards and interoperability with the objective of achieving a considerable increase in scalability over the long run. In the meanwhile, the plague is being rethought in order to fight the economic concentration that occurs in PoS. In accordance with Ethereum's philosophy of decentralisation, it entails addressing significant problems such as Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and general stake pooling concerns.\n\nThe verge is going to undergo significant revisions, the most important of which is going to be the incorporation of Verkle trees. Through this new development, the Layer 2 (L2) networks of Ethereum are going to be optimised, which will further improve the scalability and efficiency of the blockchain. However, Buterin's approach to the issue demonstrates a proactive posture on network improvements. This suggests that the gas limit for Ethereum may be raised at any moment, without requiring waiting for complete SNARKs. This is particularly true for modest enhancements.\n\nIn the year 2024, the purge will concentrate on simplifying the Ethereum protocol by decreasing the amount of space on hard drives that validators need to have and getting rid of data that is no longer relevant. This will result in storage being streamlined and network congestion being reduced. The phase includes a number of modest modifications that are designed to guarantee that the process will go smoothly after the preceding stages. This encompasses anything else that does not cleanly fall into the categories that came before it, but is necessary for the general health and effectiveness of the network.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum, a major blockchain network, is gearing up for an epic year. Its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has revealed plans for 2024, with a focus on enhancing its proof-of-stake (PoS) system. This signifies continuous innovation, building upon the major milestone achieved in Sept 2022 with the Merge.\n\nThe Merge marked Ethereum's transition from an energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to a more eco-friendly PoS system, reducing its energy consumption. In his recent posts on X (formerly Twitter), Buterin talks about 6 key areas for Ethereum: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. These components will help refine the platform's functionality and efficiency.\n\nWith that, a big part of the 2024 plan is the concept of single-slot finality (SSF). This technical advancement seeks to bolster the PoS design, addressing some of its limitations. SSF is poised to ensure irreversible changes to blockchain blocks, adding a layer of security.\n\nButerin also reflects on Ethereum's origins, highlighting a shift back towards the 'cypherpunk' ethos. Cypherpunk, a movement calling for the use of cryptography to secure privacy, was an essential concept for Ethereum. Buterin laments the platform's drift towards financialization in 2017, steering away from its initial goal of a \"public decentralized shared hard drive.\" He now sees a resurgence of these original values, thanks to advancements like ZK proofs, rollups, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions.\n\nThe roadmap for 2024 represents a mix of technical refinement and a return to foundational values. As Ethereum continues to evolve, it promises a blend of innovation, efficiency, and a renewed commitment to privacy and decentralization."

        "title": "Ethereum: The New Roadmap Revealed by Vitalik Buterin - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 01 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the roadmap and vision for the network in 2024. In a series of posts, he detailed the 6 main components that will shape Ethereum this year. Here\u2019s an overview of the strategic directions for the network\u2019s development in 2024.\n\nSingle-slot finality at the heart of technical improvements\n\nOne of the key points of the roadmap is the development of single-slot finality (SSF). This mechanism aims to reinforce the irreversibility of blocks on Ethereum. The SSF allows for locking in changes in a block, except in the case of a major attack.\n\nFor Buterin, the SSF seems to be the ideal solution to address the current weaknesses of proof of stake. By consolidating irreversibility, it would greatly improve the resilience and security of the consensus. Therefore, the SSF appears as the cornerstone of the upcoming technical efforts.\n\nBack to the cypherpunk roots of the initial vision\n\nButerin also recalled his original vision for Ethereum, rooted in the cypherpunk legacy. He wanted it to be a kind of \u201cdecentralized hard drive\u201d using cryptography. But this aspect has faded since 2017 with the rise of financial features.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, recent innovations like rollups or ZK-Snarks could help reconnect with the cypherpunk values. Thus, returning Ethereum\u2019s technological and liberating dimension is part of the goals for 2024.\n\nOther pillars of Ethereum\u2019s development in 2024\n\nAside from single-slot finality and a return to a more cypherpunk vision, Buterin has outlined several other key directions for the ongoing development of Ethereum in 2024 in his roadmap:\n\nImproving scalability through rollups and sharding\n\nStrengthening the decentralization of validation nodes\n\nOptimizing user experience to attract more developers\n\nContinuing with security updates and protocol upgrades\n\nIncorporating innovations from recent academic research\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make Ethereum a reference blockchain, combining security, decentralization, high processing capacity, privacy, and innovation capacity. An extremely ambitious program that will require cutting-edge technical advancements in the years to come.\n\nThrough this roadmap, Vitalik Buterin sketches the contours of a more technically proficient Ethereum that remains true to its cypherpunk roots. Realizing this ambitious vision will involve innovations like single-slot finality. The plan for 2024 offers a fascinating glimpse into the developments to come for Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Cryptos in 2023: A year of rebound - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies witnessed a significant recovery in 2023 following the challenging 'crypto winter' of 2022, which was marked by widespread sell-offs, layoffs, contagion concerns, and frauds globally. 2023 also saw India implementing a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on all transactionsIn 2023, Bitcoin - the most popular and expensive crypto rebounded from a low of almost $16,000 hitting a high of $44,500, although it failed to reach its all-time high of $68,990. Ethereum , the second most traded crypto, also made a strong comeback to $2,400 from a low of $1,151.The biggest surge was seen in Solana that jumped to nearly $80 from a low of $8. Solana also is way off its all-time high of $259.Cardano, Polygon, Dogecoin , Avalanche were among other popular cryptos that made a strong comeback in 2023.The UK Financial Conduct Authority estimated that there were nearly 20,000 different cryptocurrencies by the start of 2023, although many of them were no longer traded and would never grow to a significant size.By November 2023, it was estimated that around 8,800 cryptocurrencies were in existence. The top few gainers saw 80% to 500% return during the year.Even as 2023 had its fair share of negative developments such as the fall of FTX and Binance, the global markets held and grew their presence.As per an analysis in September 2023, India despite its regulatory and tax environment, has emerged as one of the top crypto markets by volume.Total India trade volumes in the last year until October 2023 was around $34 billion. Of this, India's offshore trading volume is $32 billion. So nearly 93% of total India volume is from offshore exchanges, which do not have registered offices in India or comply with local regulations from July 2022 to October 2023.An estimated 5.2 million Indian users have moved to offshore platforms since the introduction of TDS.Now, as 2024 approaches, investors are wondering if these cryptos can build on the gains from the previous year.So the things to watch out for are if the spot Bitcoin ETF gets approval in this coming year. Also, the Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in April 2024. Ethereum updates are also keenly awaited and so are the rate cuts from global central banks.But the volatility and uncertainty persists with Wall Street banks and brokerages projecting Bitcoin prices in 2024 at anywhere between $30,000 and $1,25,000."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst has predicted a massive increase for Solana and XRP, foreseeing both cryptocurrencies reaching new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nXRP and Solana 2024 Price Prediction\n\nProminent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong has recently published a new crypto price prediction for XRP, the native token of the Ripple network and Solana (SOL). Armstrong made his predictions live on his YouTube channel on December 31.\n\nAccording to the crypto influencer, the price of Solana is expected to skyrocket to $1,000 and XRP to reach $7 within the year. \u201cI believe that XRP will hit $7 and Solana will hit $1000 in 2024. That is not the top, that is not their peak,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nNotably, the current market value of Solana stands around $108.75 while XRP which is still below the $1 peg is trading at $0.63, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This would mean an around 1,000% increase for Solana and a 1,100% increase for XRP.\n\nArmstrong outlined a roadmap for his predictions, involving factors such as Ripple\u2019s Initial Public Offering (IPO) and the Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) becoming catalysts for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price surge.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the difference between XRP and Solana\u2019s bull run. Solana has had its run up into the bull. It will continue to do well but it already has massively overinflated numbers. XRP is going to slowly wind up and at the end when the Ripple IPO launches that\u2019s when XRP will go through the freaking roof. Because not only will it have the IPO, it will also have the Ethereum ETF going,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nXRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nXRP To Outperform Solana\n\nIn his YouTube video, Armstrong predicted the future trajectory of XRP up to 2025. His projections revolve around the aftermath of the Ethereum Spot ETF potential launch and the possible introduction of an XRP ETF.\n\nThe crypto influencer expressed confidence in XRP outperforming Solana in the future. This prediction could be attributed to the recent positive developments occurring within the XRP ecosystem including the improved regulatory clarity and the widespread acceptance of XRP in major crypto exchanges and countries globally.\n\n\u201cWhen the ETF gets launched, Ethereum is going to go sky high but what\u2019s gonna happen is people are gonna start thinking about the next coin. What\u2019s the next one that\u2019s gonna get the ETF? This will be in 2025 when this happens. That\u2019s when the XRP gets to long tail at the end of the blow-off top. I think XRP ends the bull run, and Solana starts it,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nFeatured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com"
