        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that the leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) is close to carving a mid-cycle bottom.\n\nIn a new video update, pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 264,400 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is about to conclude its ABC corrective wave.\n\nBluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a consolidating asset tends to witness an ABC correction before igniting a fresh five-wave surge.\n\n\u201cLooking at ETH/USD, we\u2019re basically down here at the lows again, but I think it would be very odd if we just moved up from here\u2026\n\nI think ultimately ETH needs to sweep $2,800, take out the low and reclaim it and then finally we would have what looks like a proper ABC down on Ethereum\u2026 [I think] we go sideways here on ETH for a little bit and take the lows and then look to bounce.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, Ethereum\u2019s ABC correction will eventually resolve to the upside, sending ETH initially to a new all-time high of $6,000 before pulling back and rallying to a cycle top of $8,000.\n\n\u201cI still firmly believe ETH has not had its big run yet and I do think it will definitely be coming this cycle. It\u2019s just late.\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to be induced by the ETH ETF narrative, which is supposedly coming out any day now. Everyone\u2019s talking about it, everyone\u2019s expecting it to be this giga-bullish ETH news. So I think what will most likely happen in my opinion is ETH will sell off first, take the lows, f**k everyone over and then start to get bid up heavily.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,048.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Per the latest tweet from Whale Alert, 11,215 ETH were transferred from an unknown wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis latest ETH transaction is estimated to be worth around $34.35 million. It is a major move as it appears that the whale has shifted ETH in order to trigger a sell-off. Moreover, the timing of this sell-off is crucial as it comes amid the recent market crash.\n\nThe broader crypto market has been consolidating after last week\u2019s crash. The price of Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has crashed 16.68% over the last 30 days. This shows the intensity of this market dump, impacting major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) .\n\nWhile many are still expecting a price recovery from ETH, it appears that some traders are dumping their holdings. In the case of this Ethereum whale, they have almost $34.35 million in ETH. Since this is a major amount, it can further impact the market and push the ETH price to lower levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhales always play a crucial role on the digital asset market. The buying and selling from these traders leave short-term impacts on the price movements of a particular coin. In this case, the Ethereum price can absorb the toll of this sell-off.

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has once again sparked speculations among crypto market participants. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the crypto amid soaring anticipation over a potential Ether ETF launch soon.\n\nHowever, ETH has recently reclaimed the $3K level, but on-chain data indicates that it faces significant resistance at $3,200. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at why the $3.2K level poses a significant threat to Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Holders Ready To Sell ETH\n\nA recent Into The Block data revealed that approximately 2 million addresses that previously traded Ethereum at around the $3,200 price level are currently holding ETH at a loss. This paves the path for potential selloffs as these addresses break even with price gains ahead, adding selling pressure to the asset.\n\nHowever, a bullish catalyst in the pipeline might prevent this from happening. For context, the approaching launch of an ETH ETF (exchange-traded-product) could serve as a catalyst for a remarkable rising price action in the future. Aligning with this, the commencement of ETF trading could counteract the selling pressure, in turn generating positive momentum in the asset due to money inflow.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum has continued to struggle to reach its resistance level of $3,200.\n\nAlso Read: Institutional FOMO On Spot Bitcoin ETF As German Govt Continues BTC Sell-off\n\nETH Price Faces Turbulency\n\nAt press time, the ETH price showed a 0.20% dip in value, trading at $3,100.56.

        "title": "The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The co-founder and intellectual leader of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, recently shared his thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of the blockchain during the EthCC (Ethereum Community Conference) held in Bruxelles.\n\nAddressing a packed room, Buterin offered an honest assessment of the current state of the platform, outlining both the challenges and opportunities that await Ethereum.\n\nThe strengths of Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin\n\nButerin began his speech by highlighting the numerous strengths that have contributed to the success of Ethereum. One of the key aspects he pointed out is Ethereum\u2019s ability to support complex smart contracts, which have enabled the creation of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApp). These applications range from decentralized financial services (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFT), demonstrating the versatility and breadth of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin spoke about the robust development of the Ethereum community. The platform is supported by a global community of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who constantly contribute to the improvement and security of the network. This community not only develops new technologies and applications, but is also engaged in the governance of the network, ensuring that Ethereum remains a decentralized and democratic platform.\n\nAnother strength cited by Buterin is the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which represents a crucial shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This change will not only significantly reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption but also increase the scalability and security of the platform, making Ethereum more sustainable and capable of handling a larger number of transactions.\n\nThe weaknesses of Ethereum and the solutions\n\nDespite the numerous successes, Buterin has openly acknowledged the current weaknesses of Ethereum. One of the main problems is scalability. The Ethereum network has struggled to handle a high volume of transactions, resulting in high fees and long confirmation times. This problem has become particularly evident during periods of high demand, such as the bull of DeFi and NFTs.\n\nButerin also spoke about the challenges related to security. Despite the ongoing efforts to improve the security of the network, Ethereum remains vulnerable to various types of attacks, including smart contract exploits and network-level attacks. The complexity of the platform and the wide attack surface require constant vigilance and continuous innovations to maintain the security of the network.\n\nAnother area of weakness concerns usability. Buterin emphasized that, despite significant progress, the user experience on Ethereum remains complicated for non-experts. The setup of wallet, the management of private keys, and the interaction with dApps can be discouraging for new users, limiting the mainstream adoption of the technology.\n\nButerin concluded his speech by outlining strategies to \u201cstrengthen\u201d Ethereum and overcome its weaknesses. The solution to scalability, he explained, lies in technologies such as shards and rollups. Shards will allow Ethereum to divide the workload among different parallel chains, significantly increasing the network\u2019s capacity. Rollups, on the other hand, aggregate many transactions into a single one, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by the main network.\n\nRegarding security, Buterin emphasized the importance of continuous research and collaboration with security experts to develop new protection mechanisms. He also highlighted the importance of bug bounty programs and security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.\n\nTo improve usability, Buterin has proposed a series of initiatives aimed at simplifying the user experience. These include the development of more intuitive interfaces, user education, and the implementation of safer and easier-to-use custody solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe intervention of Vitalik Buterin at EthCC provided a clear and honest view of the current state of Ethereum, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. His reflection was a call to action for the Ethereum community, encouraging developers and users to collaborate to overcome challenges and continue to innovate. With the right strategies and a collective commitment, Ethereum is well positioned to strengthen its position as a leader in the world of blockchains and smart contracts."

        "content": "News regarding the approval of Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, which could trigger a new bull run in the cryptocurrency market, with the United States SEC playing a crucial role.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe SEC at the center of the wait for spot ETFs on Ethereum (ETH): latest news\n\nAs anticipated, Ethereum ETFs are considered a possible spark for a new bull run, but the approval of the US SEC is crucial.\n\nThe regulatory authorities, traders, and investors are eagerly awaiting the presentations of the form S-1 for the spot Ethereum ETFs, which are expected to be available by the weekend.\n\nToday, the entities that have applied for ETH ETFs, including BlackRock, 21Shares, Fidelity and Grayscale, will submit the S-1 forms to the SEC after making the requested changes.\n\nThe first half of 2024 was dominated by the issue of Spot ETFs on Bitcoin. Now, the attention has shifted to ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nNate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, tweeted:\n\n\u201cthe amendments to the ETF S-1 of the spot ETF should be made tomorrow\u2026 How quickly will the SEC be able to reverse course?\u201d\n\nGeraci emphasizes the importance of commissions, adding that the issuers might be ready to launch the products in the coming weeks.\n\nBitwise, an asset management company, has recently updated its S-1 registration with the SEC to list and trade shares of ETH ETFs.\n\nThe CIO of Bitwise, Matt Hougan, predicts that ETH ETFs will attract at least 15 billion dollars in net flows by 2025. Hougan, in particular, states the following:\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to know how much the exchange-traded product (ETP) of ether spot will attract in terms of net flows. My answer: 15 billion dollars in the first 18 months. It is not a random guess. It is what the data suggests.\u201d\n\nFocus on the price of Ethereum\n\nAt the moment, Ether has slightly recovered from last week\u2019s drop, trading at around $3,042. The price has increased by 0.7% in the last 24 hours, but remains 12.2% lower compared to seven days ago.\n\nThe recent history of Bitcoin shows how the approval of the Spot BTC ETF led to a 58% surge in just a few months. On January 10, the day of the approval of the Spot ETF on BTC, the price of Bitcoin was $46,105, rising to $73,097 in March.\n\nThe approval of the Spot ETF on Ethereum could bring the markets back into the green. Based on historical data, the approval of a Spot ETF on ETH could push the price of Ethereum above $4500, assuming a 50% increase.\n\nIn any case, the 1-hour chart of ETH/USD showed a recent bullish trend that started at $2,803, highlighted by a significant bull candle that reached $3,096 before a slight retracement.\n\nA bullish engulfing pattern indicates a possible continuation of this trend, although the recent declines suggest a consolidation phase. The volume analysis reveals a peak during the bullish movement.\n\nHowever, the decreasing volume during the consolidation suggests that, if the volume were to increase again, the bull trend could resume.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart of ETH/USD, Ethereum has confirmed a downward trend recently bouncing from the low of $2,803. A strong increase on July 8 indicates a significant bull movement, potentially suggesting a short-term reversal.\n\nHowever, the recent candles with small bodies and reduced shadows also highlight a certain degree of uncertainty in the market. The volume analysis supports this bullish movement with higher volume, indicating a genuine buying interest.\n\nThe daily chart shows a clear downward trend in the last month, with ETH falling from around $3,889 to a low of $2,803.\n\nContradictory forecasts: analysts divided on the future of Ethereum ETFs\n\nWith the imminent launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Ethereum, the financial community is divided on the possible consequences of this debut.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs have led to a significant increase in the price of BTC, analysts are not sure that Ethereum will follow the same path.\n\nRyan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, expressed skepticism regarding the impact of ETFs on Ethereum compared to those on Bitcoin, stating:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and Ethereum are two assets with different fundamentals and a distinct market appeal. When ETFs on Ethereum start trading, ETH will capture about 2.5% of its market capitalization. If this bull scenario were to materialize, the spot ETF on Ethereum could see $11.55 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Galaxy Research predicts that inflows into Ethereum ETFs will be slower compared to those into Bitcoin.\n\nCharles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy, has estimated that \u201cEthereum spot ETPs will see about 5 billion dollars in net inflows in the first five months of trading.\u201d\n\nDespite the moderate expectations of some, other observers are very optimistic about the future of Ethereum post-launch of the ETFs. Steno Research predicts that ETH could reach at least $6,500 by the end of the year, thus surpassing the previous all-time high of ETH by 33%.\n\nStandard Chartered offers an even more bullish forecast. Specifically suggesting that the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum could lead to up to 45 billion dollars of inflows within the first 12 months. Potentially pushing the price of ETH to $8,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares this optimism. Jupiter Zheng, partner of the Liquid Fund of HashKey Capital, predicts a short and modest initial rally followed by a strong \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nEvent in which investors might sell their positions after the launch of the ETFs, leading to a price correction."

        "title": "Key dynamics to watch ahead of launch of Ethereum ETFs - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs close to finish line, says Bitwise executive.\n\nEthereum investors are buying the dip despite FUD from potential Golem selling spree.\n\nEthereum bearish pressure has slowed, but key resistance could prove critical ahead of ETH ETF launch.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is up 2.3% on Wednesday as investors continue buying the dip in hopes of a rally following the launch of spot ETH ETFs. However, other key metrics like break-even prices and Golem sales provide a deeper understanding of what to expect as the launch draws nearer.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum accumulation, Golem sales\n\nWith the potential launch of spot ETH ETFs drawing closer amid the wider market stagnancy, investors are readjusting their portfolios. Bitwise chief compliance officer Katherine Dowling confirmed that the launch is \"close to the finish line.\"\n\n\"We're seeing in the S-1 amendments that there are fewer and fewer issues that are being vetted back and forth between issuers and the SEC,\" said Dowling in a Bloomberg interview.\n\n\"So that points all signs in the direction that we are close. We're close to the finish line on the launch,\" she added.\n\nThe Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETH ETF issuers' 19b-4 filings in May, but the agency needs to greenlight their S-1s before the products can begin trading.\n\nEthereum's recent descent saw more investors accumulating the altcoin, as revealed in CryptoQuant's data. These investors are considering the dip as an opportunity to purchase ETH at a discount before ETH ETFs launch in tandem. The lower ETH goes, the more investors buy.\n\nETH New Accumulating Adresses Balance\n\nSantiment data shows that some of these purchases have been flowing into staking platforms. The Ethereum 2.0 staking contract now holds 47.36 million ETH or about 34% of ETH's entire supply. Notably, the contract's holdings have more than tripled from just under 11% of ETH's supply it held in 2022.\n\nETH2 Beacon Deposit Contract\n\nMeanwhile, Golem, which raised 820,000 ETH through an ICO in 2016, has been on a potential selling spree. After transferring 40,000 ETH to address \"0x159a\", the address deposited 3,000 ETH worth $9.3 million to Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase in the past few hours, according to Lookonchain. Golem has deposited about 32,000 ETH to exchanges in the past six days.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum faces a key resistance at $3,200\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,130 on Wednesday, up 2.3% on the day. ETH's total liquidations in the past 24 hours are at $33.58 million, with long and short liquidations accounting for $23.18 million and $10.40 million, respectively, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nETH's long and short ratio shows traders are slowly reducing their bearish sentiment as the ratio has increased to 0.989. However, Ethereum's Fear and Greed Index is at number 30, indicating fear persists in the market despite increasing accumulation from whale addresses.\n\nInto The Block's data shows that more than 5.6 million addresses broke even after ETH reached $3,000, a potential sell sign for these addresses.\n\nIt could be that whales bullish on the ETH ETF approval accumulated selling pressure from retail traders who potentially sold off their tokens after ETH reclaimed the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nAs ETH's price slowly tilts toward the upside, it may face a resistance at the $3,200 level. According to IntoTheBlock, approximately 2 million addresses that purchased ETH around this level could sell if they break even. However, a price catalyst like the ETH ETF going live can prevent such a move.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the downside, the $2,800 to $2,852 level remains a key support if the bearish pressure increases.In the short term, ETH could bounce off the $3,064 level, where $3.32 million ETH longs risk liquidation."

        "content": "Rome Protocol has secured $9 million in a funding round to integrate modular services from the Solana network into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol stated that its funding round included several notable investors like Hack VC, Polygon Ventures, HashKey, Portal Ventures, Bankless Ventures, Robot VC, LBank, Anagram, TRGC and Perridon Ventures.\n\nThe round also included notable angel investors, such as Solana\u2019s Anatoly Yakovenko and Austin Federa. Other investors included Nick White, Santiago Santos, Comfy Capital, and Jason Yanowitz.\n\nRome protocol\n\nAccording to the protocol, the platform would be designed to integrate Solana\u2019s capabilities into services on Ethereum.\n\nThis approach will allow Ethereum-based rollups to use Solana as a shared sequencer, thereby confirming transactions faster, enhancing privacy and scalability, and reducing blockchain costs.\n\nRome Protocol pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s isolated sequencer feature raises concerns about liquidity fragmentation, weakest link security, and interoperability on the network\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap. Due to this, many rollups rely on centralized sequencers, which risk censorship, limited visibility, and critical downtime.\n\nTo solve these challenges, Rome Protocol will enable rollups to use Solana\u2019s existing validators as shared sequencers for transactions, state maintenance, and transaction publication. This approach aims to turn Solana\u2019s 50,000+ transactions-per-second (TPS) capacity into infrastructure for Ethereum rollups. It also ensures atomic composability with transactions confirmed on Solana before submission to Ethereum.\n\nRome Protocol will allow developers to focus on their applications rather than building new cross-chain interoperability infrastructure. Ethereum developers canuseg familiar technologies like OP Stack for execution and state maintenance.\n\nShared sequencer architecture\n\nThe proposed shared sequencer architecture includes the Rhea, Remus, Romulus, and Hercules features.\n\nRhea will ensure fair sequencing and submission to Solana, while Remus will enhance atomic transactions across rollups.\n\nAccording to the protocol:\n\n\u201cRhea enables fair and blind sequencing of rollup transactions. All transactions are treated equally and processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Remus enables atomic execution of cross-rollup transactions as a premium service.\u201d\n\nRomulus will facilitate atomic transactions across Solana and various rollups, while Hercules will accept ordered transaction blocks from Solana.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Interest in staking Ethereum surged significantly over the past few days.\n\nNetwork growth for ETH fell materially despite the surge in price.\n\nOver the last few days, Ethereum [ETH] has seen massive volatility in terms of price movement, which has impacted sentiment around the token significantly.\n\nInterest in Ethereum staking surged\n\nThe ETH2 Beacon Deposit Contract, the backbone for staking deposits in Ethereum 2.0, has reached a new peak, locking in a whopping 47.36 million ETH. This represents a significant chunk of the total supply, amounting to 33.9%.\n\nThe value is more than triple the amount staked just two years ago, which was only 10.9%. The surge in deposits indicates growing confidence in Ethereum 2.0 and its potential to revolutionize the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith a significant portion of ETH locked up in staking deposits, the circulating supply of ETH effectively decreases. This can lead to upward pressure on the price due to basic principles of supply and demand.\n\nMoreover, since staked ETH is locked up for a period of time, it\u2019s less likely to be sold on the open market in the short term. This can help reduce downward pressure on the price, especially during periods of market volatility.\n\nDaily activity on the network fell\n\nHowever, despite the surge in ETH staking, the overall interest in the Ethereum ecosystem waned.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the overall active addresses on the Ethereum network declined significantly over the past month.\n\nMoreover, this decline in activity coincided with the number of NFT trades occurring on the Ethereum network falling.\n\nThis suggests that despite the potential benefits of staking, fewer people are actively using the Ethereum network for other purposes.\n\nThis could be due to a number of factors, such as high gas fees, a lack of new applications, or a general bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,087.00 and its price had grown by 10.91% since the 10th of July. Despite the surge in price, the overall trend for ETH remained bearish.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, the network growth for ETH fell materially, indicating that new addresses were losing interest in ETH.\n\nCoupled with that, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen,, implying that the frequency at which ETH was being exchanged had declined."

Instead of appreciating, the prices continued to drop.\n\nBearish sentiment was prevalent in the market, as seen by the price drop below $3k. This psychological level is likely to be contested hard, but the selling pressure behind ETH has been unforgiving.\n\nWhale accumulation did little to halt bearish trend\n\nIn June, the 7-day simple moving average of the exchange netflow dropped deep into the negative territory. It stayed negative till the 28th of June.\n\nIn the past ten days, it has crept into the positive territory, accompanying the sharp price drop seen in July.\n\nThe negative netflow indicated Ethereum tokens moving outside of exchanges and signaled accumulation. Despite this, the prices continued to slump.\n\nInvestors would be hoping that this is the final jolt of pain before the trend turns bullish.\n\nThe supply distribution analysis showed that the 10k-1M ETH holders have increased since mid-May. The 1k-10k ETH wallets moved higher toward the end of June but have fallen lower again over the past week.\n\nTogether it indicated the large whales with 10k+ ETH accumulated, but most other wallets have reduced their holdings.\n\nWhere can traders expect prices to find relief?\n\nAMBCrypto noted from the in/out of the money data that the $2850-$3000 zone was a strong support zone due to the number of holders.\n\nOver the past three days, the price decline to $2.8k saw a bounce to $3k but it is unclear if the buyers can withstand the sellers\u2019 onslaught any longer.\n\nAround the current market price, 60.25% of the addresses were out of the money, which meant that price bounces would likely be sold as holders look to exit at break-even. This can add to the downward pressure.\n\nThe MobChart data outlined large limit orders on the order books for Ethereum. The $3100 and $3170 levels have $3.7 million worth of limit orders. Above them, the $3220-$3250 region and $3500 have just over $5 million, marking these as strong short-term resistances.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe $2800 level has just under $10 million worth of buy orders and might be tested once again. Overall, the metrics show that in the short term, bears were in control.\n\nThe exchange outflow in June did little to halt the price decline, and the best bulls can hope for now is a period of consolidation around the psychological $3k support."

        "content": "For some time now, there have been three cryptos dominating the markets, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB: today we will analyze some predictions of their prices.\n\nBitcoin is the first ever to be created and the one that alone capitalizes more than half of the entire crypto market.\n\nThe second is Ethereum, which is the main altcoin that is often followed by all the others.\n\nThe third is BNB, the cryptocurrency of the main crypto exchange in the world (Binance).\n\nPerformance of BTC: which crypto is performing better among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB?\n\nThe trend of the price of Bitcoin underwent a significant change a few days ago.\n\nFrom February 28 to July 3, 2024, for more than four consecutive months, it had effectively moved sideways within a wide range between $57,000 and $72,000, with small and brief excursions a bit above and a bit below.\n\nInstead, starting from July 2, it began a descent that on July 4 led it to break down the bottom of that range.\n\nTo tell the truth, already on July 7th it had returned above $57,000, but on July 4th the medium-term trend seems to have changed.\n\nIt is not yet clear if the new trend is descending, or if it is just a lowering of the bottom of the lateralization range.\n\nThe latest predictions on the price of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe analysts do not agree with the forecasts, but what happened between yesterday and today seems to have definitively ended the decline that began on July 2.\n\nFrom $63,000 back then to $53,500 on July 5th, the drop was 15%, but it has already been partially absorbed. The current situation seems to have returned to perfect normality, so that drop seems to have completely run its course.\n\nHaving said that, there are no certainties that another one cannot be triggered.\n\nThere are several analysts who expect further similar declines in the coming weeks, so much so that some are hypothesizing a bottom at $52,000, $51,000, or even below $50,000. There are also many other even more pessimistic forecasts circulating, but they generally do not come from expert analysts.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that there are also many analysts who instead hypothesize only the beginning of a new phase of lateralization, simply within a lower range, whose bottom would be between $51,000 and $53,000, while the top is not yet clear (it could also be above $60,000).\n\nMany, however, expect a change in trend in the autumn, perhaps already anticipated at the beginning of September or the end of August. Among those who expect this change in trend, optimism seems to prevail.\n\nPerformance of Ethereum: the crypto between Bitcoin and BNB\n\nThe trend of the price of Ethereum has been following that of Bitcoin quite closely since the end of May.\n\nThis thing, however, appears anomalous, given that precisely between this week, or at the latest next week, the spot Ethereum ETFs should land on the US stock exchanges for the first time.\n\nThe upward movement of ETH\u2019s price at the end of May was due precisely to the news of the approval of these ETFs, but since then it has simply started to follow those of BTC.\n\nComparing the price of Ethereum with that of Bitcoin, one realizes that in May ETH had risen from 0.046 BTC to 0.057 BTC, but then it stabilized.\n\nIndeed, in mid-June it had also fallen below 0.052 BTC, and now it is around 0.053 BTC.\n\nAt this moment, despite the imminent arrival of ETFs, the price of Ethereum does not seem to have the strength to move independently compared to that of Bitcoin, at least in the short term.\n\nPredictions on the price of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAfter the actual launch on the stock exchange of spot ETH ETFs, many believe that the price of Ethereum could fall.\n\nObserving the chart of the last few weeks, it indeed seems that the markets do not believe that these new financial derivatives can achieve a great result, at least in the immediate future.\n\nFurthermore, there is always the risk that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, once transformed into an ETF, may start liquidating large amounts of ETH, just as happened with BTC in January.\n\nBut if in the medium-short term many are not optimistic about the price of Ethereum, in the medium-long term the expectations change.\n\nIn fact, should Bitcoin wake up in the autumn, the presence of ETF on ETH spot on the US exchanges could benefit the price of Ethereum quite a bit.\n\nJust think that after the arrival of the spot Bitcoin ETFs the price of BTC rose from about $45,000 to over $70,000, after initially dropping below $40,000.\n\nThe trend of BNB\n\nThe trend of the price of BNB follows that of Bitcoin, and of Ethereum, but it also follows the alternating fortunes of Binance.\n\nTo tell the truth, for years now Binance has been the largest crypto exchange in the world, and its dominance seems to be unchallenged, but last year it had several problems with the authorities, especially in the USA.\n\nTaking Ethereum as a reference, the price of BNB last year fell below 0.1 ETH, after being above 0.26 ETH at the end of 2022.\n\nIn March of this year, however, it started to recover, first climbing to 0.17 ETH and then even above 0.20 ETH. Now it has returned to 0.17 ETH.\n\nTaking instead as a reference the US dollar, a month ago it recorded its all-time high, at around 717$. It should be noted that Bitcoin also recorded its new all-time high this year, in March, while Ethereum did not.\n\nSo during the course of 2024 BNB has performed better than ETH, so much so that it is now at +64% since the beginning of the year. However, it should be remembered that in 2023 it had not performed well, while both ETH and BTC had already recorded really interesting gains.\n\nPredictions on BNB and the Binance ecosystem\n\nMaking predictions about the price of BNB is more difficult, because much depends on the alternating fortunes of Binance.\n\nAlthough today it is possible to state that in the event of a new bull run Binance seems destined to perform well, and consequently BNB, last year, for example, it was very difficult to predict that Binance would solve all its problems, as it eventually did, allowing the price of BNB to take off again.\n\nIn this case, in fact, in addition to the simple movements of the market, and the law of supply and demand, the economic results of Binance also matter, which are not easily predictable."

She maintained that he could get in the way. Specifically, Downing noted Gensler\u2019s involvement creates a \u201clong haul\u201d to get products to market. Especially given his history with the industry.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Mirroring 2021 Bull Run Pattern: New All-Time High Soon?\n\nStill, Downign described the agency\u2019s response to talk regarding more products as \u201cquite welcoming.\u201d That certainly increases the odds of a Solana-based ETF. Applications for such an investment product have already been filed by asset managers like VanEck.\n\nEarlier this month, GSR Markets released a report on the potential product. There, they noted SOL has \u201ccemented itself as part of Crypto\u2019s Big Three.\u201d Therefore, it is only natural it follows ETH and BTC with the next crypto-based ETF. Yet, the question now is when. With two approvals in 2024 already, many expect a Solana ETF to not be viable until 2025."

        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum initiated July\u2019s second week on a bullish note. Following the recent market sell-off, the ETH price found suitable support at $2815\u2014 a multi-month horizontal level intact in February 2024. This support coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement creating a pivotal point for Ether to rebound or lead further correction.

The aforementioned level aligned closely with 50W EMA and 23.6% FIB creating a high area of interest for buyers.\n\nIn the last 48 hours, the Ether price jumped 8.76% to trade at $3071, while the market cap jumped to $370.2 Billion. Amid the broader market consolidation, the upswing can be attributed to the development of ETH ETF approval.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Prices Today July 9: BTC Bounces Near $57K Propelling Crypto Market Rally\n\nFirst S-1 just rolled in today from VanEck.. they already had their fee so nothing to see here really, they just putting ball back in SEC\u2019s court.

The filing occurred early on Monday, positioning.\n\nNotably, firms like 21Shares, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale also submitted their filings later that same day. This collective movement among investment heavyweights suggests a growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\n\nMarket participants anticipate that trading for these Ethereum ETFs might commence in the second half of July.\n\nIf approved, the ETH price could sustain its recent reversal and rise 25% to downsloping resistance trendline around $3800.\n\nA bullish breakout from the overhead is crucial for ETH buyers to signal uptrend continuation.\n\nOn a contrary note, the Ethereum price shows a double top formation in the daily chart. This reversal pattern keeps the possibility for extended correction intact. A potential breakdown from the $2815 will intensify the pressure and could plunge $2000.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nEMAs: The crypto buyers could get a better confirmation of a bullish reversal if the price reclaimed immediate resistance of 200D Exponential Moving Average at $3080. The ETH coin current below indicates a net bearish sentiment.\n\nRSI: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reverted from the oversold region indicating the overextended selling has brought some cool-off in price for selling to regain strength.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

        "content": "Ethereum price increased by 5.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $3,070 during European business hours. The increase comes against the backdrop of Germany\u2019s continued Bitcoin sell-off. BTC also saw an increase of 3.4% over the last 24 hours, and is trading at $57,189.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price To Rebound If This Happens\n\nETH price broke below a falling channel on Thursday last week, a non-bullish move on its part. Ethereum price plummeted to a low of $2,811 as Bitcoin continued to bleed. However, ETH price found another support below around $2,815, using it as a cushion against the fall. The price of ETH consolidated around this local bottom over the weekend before showing some renewed strength on Monday going into Tuesday.\n\nThe Ethereum price action has revisited the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is currently acting as a resistance. If Ethereum breaks above this key indicator, market sentiment may turn to bullish.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the asset may likely break above the 200-day SMA but succumb to the overhead 50-day SMA, falling into a consolidation zone between $3,371 and $2,811. This will also put it back into the falling channel.\n\nIf ETH bulls can exert more power, they can break above the falling channel and the potential consolidation zone to hit the previous yearly high of $3,967. On the flip side, if the bears prevail, ETH price may break below the $2,815 support and drop lower to $2,200, with temporary cushioning around $2,490.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price hit a low of $53,550 in the recent sell-off (which may still be in play) before bouncing back, as data from CoinGecko shows. The asset seems to have found support around the $55,000 level, though history suggests this may not hold for long. If BTC continues to fall, the next major support is around $50,000, and below that, $46,000.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price Rising?\n\nThe markets today have spots of green, with Ethereum among the biggest gainers. VanEck was the last to file an S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF yesterday, indicating a high likelihood of ETF approval soon. As of July 9, 2024, all spot Ethereum ETF applicants have filed their updated S-1s.\n\nMeanwhile, while Germany continues to sell Bitcoin indiscriminately, ETFs saw $384 million in inflows last week, showing that investors are using the fear in the market to get exposed to BTC at discounted prices.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement shows signs of a potential reversal, but uncertainty lingers as market participants debate whether this uptick represents a genuine trend change or a deceptive bull trap. Close monitoring of key indicators may provide clarity on whether ETH can sustain its momentum relative to BTC in the coming days.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Which firms have filed for Spot Ethereum ETF? Grayscale, VanEck Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Bitwise have all submitted filings for a spot Ethereum ETF. 2. When will Spot Ethereum ETF launch? Speculations say that Ethereum ETF will launch mid-July. 3. Can Ethereum reach $5000? According to analysis, after the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, ETH could rally to $6,600.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs were gaining much popularity in the United States.\n\nETH was down by 12% last week, but a few market indicators hinted at a trend reversal.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been facing multiple price corrections over the past month. This happened at a time when its much-awaited ETH ETFs launch was drawing in.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s going on with ETH to find out whether its launch would benefit the king of altcoins and allow it to outshine Bitcoin [BTC] in the coming days.\n\nEthereum ETF hype isn\u2019t enough?\n\nInvestors and the crypto market as a whole have been waiting patiently for the launch of ETH ETFs. As per the latest data, the possible launch of Ethereum ETFs can be expected on the 15th of July.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Google Trends\u2019 data showed that the popularity of Ethereum ETFs has been consistent throughout the last 30 days in the United States, reflecting the hype around them.\n\nAlthough the launch date was getting closer and the market seemed excited, Ethereum continued to struggle to raise its price.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 125 in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $3,045.32 with a market capitalization of over $366 million.\n\nA possible reason behind this bearish price movement could be the lack of confidence in ETH among investors.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Weighted Sentiment moved southward substantially last week. This clearly meant that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF\n\nSince ETH remained bearish despite the launch getting closer, AMBCrypto planned to compare both Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s states ahead of their ETF launches.\n\nOur analysis revealed that BTC\u2019s price started to gain bullish momentum way before its ETF launch date.\n\nTo be precise, BTC\u2019s price started to move in November 2023 and peaked during the BTC ETF launch on January 10, 2024. However, soon after the launch, BTC\u2019s price started to decline.\n\nOn this front, Bitcoin was clearly dominating Ethereum. However, to see whether ETH was planning something bullish a week ahead of the ETF launch, we then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nWe found that Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick after touching the oversold zone.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAdditionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar increasing trend. This indicated that ETH might turn bullish in the coming days.\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved southward. The MACD also displayed a bearish advantage in the market."

        "content": "Wed 10 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAs Ethereum is not far from the critical zone of $3,200, sell signals are multiplying among investors. This resistance, combined with expectations regarding the launch of an ETF on Ether, creates a tense and uncertain market climate. The current volatility could have major consequences for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum facing resistance at $3,200\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, recently crossed the $3,000 mark, but it encounters major resistance at $3,200. This price barrier is critical, on-chain data shows that about 2 million addresses that bought Ethereum around this level are currently at a loss. These investors might choose to sell their cryptos to recover their initial investments, increasing the selling pressure on the market.\n\nHowever, the imminent launch of an ETF (Exchange-Traded Product) on Ether could change the game. This event is likely to inject new capital into the market, counterbalancing the selling pressure and generating a positive momentum for prices. Despite everything, Ethereum struggles to break through the $3,200 resistance, illustrating the current fragility of its position.\n\nMarket sentiments and projections\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the launch of the ETF on Ether, the price of Ethereum remains unstable. Currently, ETH is oscillating around $3,100, with recent fluctuations indicating uncertainty among investors. Data from Coinglass shows a slight increase in Open Interest in ETH futures, reaching $12.67 billion, while the derivatives volume has dropped significantly. This combination highlights a sense of caution and expectation in the market.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ethereum, currently at 40, indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, marking a neutral position that could shift either way. The situation is worsened by large purchases, such as the recent acquisition of 16,000 ETH by a whale, showing that some investors are anticipating a rise due to the ETF.\n\nThe short-term outlook for Ethereum is thus marked by high volatility and persistent uncertainty. The selling pressure at $3,200 remains a major obstacle, but the launch of the ETF will undoubtedly bring a capital influx that will change the game.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Additionally, it is just one candle away from bullishness as it is lagging slightly behind 200 EMA.\n\nEthereum bullish double bottom breakout\n\nAccording to expert technical analysis, ETH was looking bullish as it formed a double-bottom price action pattern in a 4-hour time frame and at a neckline near the $3,085 level.\n\nIf it gives a breakout and 4-hour candle closing above the neckline, there is a high possibility for ETH to hit the $3,250 and $3,300 levels.\n\nFurthermore, this bullishness in the Ether chart is also getting support from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is in the oversold area and signals a potential recovery.\n\nDespite this bullish double-bottom pattern, ETH has been consolidating within a tight range between the $2,850 and $3,080 levels for the last five days.\n\nHowever, this consolidation is taking place at an important support level, and a breakout or breakdown from this consolidation zone may cause a significant price momentum in either direction.\n\nEther\u2019s strong support level and liquidation area\n\nHowever, ETH has reached this level more than four times since April 2024. Regardless of market conditions, ETH prices have consistently bounced back to either the $3,250 level or the $3,670 level, as shown by historical data on a daily chart.\n\nThis time traders expect a similar price surge from this level.\n\nFollowing the ETF update, ETH\u2019s Open Interest (OI) surged by more than 5.5%, indicating that investor and trader interest and confidence have returned, according to data from an on-chain analytic firm CoinGlass.\n\nMeanwhile, traders liquidated a notable $59.94 million of their positions, out of which bulls have liquidated $23.75 million of long positions and short sellers liquidated a notable $36.16 million of short positions, as per CoinGlass data.\n\nIf ETH hits the $3,250 level in the coming days, nearly $165 billion of short position will liquidate. Over the last seven days, short sellers have been expecting that ETH won\u2019t reach the $3,250 level, as per the latest liquidation data from CoinGlass.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAt press time, ETH was moving near the $3,075 level and it experienced a 5.5% price surge in the last 24 hours.\n\nIf we look at the performance of ETH over a longer period, it has lost nearly 10% of its value.

        "content": "What is Ethereum Code?\n\nEthereum Code is an online trading and educational platform that offers a wide range of trading and learning perks. It has been created to assist users with various needs and delivers reliable information and trading sources to begin with.\n\nThe user-friendliness of Ethereum Code allows users to get a personalized experience that can be achieved by customizing the dashboard easily. Moreover, the platform features comprehensive learning resources that can be used for upskilling trading techniques by users of all kinds. It features:\n\nAccess to the crypto market for trading needs\n\nHigh-end trading tools for accurate trading\n\nRisk assessment and tips\n\nEducational resources for learning needs\n\nPersonalized organizational dashboard\n\nHow Does Ethereum Code Work?\n\nOne of the best things about Ethereum Code is that it operates as a bridge between users, trading brokers, and educational companies. It allows users to access market insights for trading while learning from reputed educational sources.\n\nExplore Ethereum Code\u2019s Official Website\n\nUnlike other trading sources, it uses high-end and sophisticated trading bots that assist traders in their journey. In addition, it carefully sources educational materials so that traders can benefit from what they learn and implement it practically.\n\nWhile trading, it analyzes the preferences of the users and finds opportunities in the market accordingly. Hence, it's like a trading assistant that you can assign a task and let it handle the rest. All you have to do is sign up, check out the opportunities waiting for you, and trade to earn the benefit.\n\nFeatures of Ethereum Code\n\nLet\u2019s check out some appealing features of Ethereum Code:\n\nPersonalized Platform Experience\n\nAn attractive thing about Ethereum Code is that it allows users to customize their dashboard according to their preferences. This feature is usually limited in other platforms where you can only add limited resources to your dashboard.\n\nHowever, with Ethereum Code, you can easily add resources from educational to trading and tools on your dashboard. This kind of personalization makes navigation easy and the interface clean, giving the user good control over what they want to interact with.\n\nSupports Different Cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile working with any trading platform, users need to consider the kind of currencies it supports and allows trading with. Fortunately, the Ethereum Code allows trading in various currencies, including but not limited to Ether, Shiba, etc. as well as mixing these currencies for trading needs.\n\nHigh Success Rate\n\nSuccess rate matters a lot when choosing a trading platform. Success rate defines the rate of positive trading returns based on the insights the trading bots share. If the success rate is low, then you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with the platform at all.\n\nFortunately, with Ethereum Code, you can rest easy as it offers more than a 95% success rate. Although this rate is claimed, it's not entirely true and can vary based on the trading processes used by the traders.\n\nHowever, the platform creators still state that the platform features a high success rate, which makes it a compelling choice for a trading platform to begin with. Again, it's strongly recommended that the users adopt only legitimate ways of trading and investing only the amount that they can risk losing while working with a broker for risky trades.\n\nEasy Withdrawals\n\nWhile using most market platforms, it was discovered that the users had a hard time withdrawing their invested money. Moreover, it was also identified that users faced difficulties while trying to withdraw their profits. But thankfully, Ethereum Code facilitates the users in this matter.\n\nIt not only allows the users to withdraw their profits or transfer them to other sources but also withdraw their entire capital to close the account or for any other reason. After proper authentication, customer support assists the users in proceeding with their withdrawals, which are usually processed in 48 hours.\n\nDemo Account\n\nWhile it features numerous learning resources to begin your trading journey with, it also facilitates the users with practical trading through a demo account. The demo account is formed just to give a hands-on experience to the users of how the platform and trading with it works.\n\nIn other words, the demo account is filled with the exact features and tools that one can find in the real-time account except it features demo money. Hence, the users can trade without the fear of losing their investment.\n\nOnce the users have experienced trading, they can easily switch to the real account and start trading. The demo account is always available for the users whenever they want to switch and strengthen their learning or test various trading techniques.\n\nRobust Customer Service\n\nCustomer service plays an important part in the functionality of any trading platform. From entertaining the queries to resolving the issues, it has to be readily available so that the users can reach out to it in times of distress.\n\nFortunately, Ethereum Code features such robust customer service that is available to the users 24/7. Whether it\u2019s an issue with withdrawals, payments, etc. or you want to know how to get started with Ethereum Code, the customer service will entertain your queries and will assist with everything.\n\nCatalog of Useful Educational Resources\n\nAs it\u2019s an investment learning platform, Ethereum Code features numerous educational resources. These resources are carefully sourced so that they can entertain queries related to trading, eventually helping the users strengthen their concepts.\n\nMoreover, some of these resources are free to access and easily available when you sign up for the platform. As for others, these carry a small fee since they offer certifications and can help you earn a reputation as a well-versed and certified trading expert.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a small fee to pay for such an organized and useful catalog of educational sources, which is why Ethereum Code is reliable enough.\n\nHigh-End Security\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a trading platform, you cannot overlook the level of security and safety the platform has to offer. Crypto trading platforms hold sensitive information regarding payment methods as well as user profiles. Hence, it's only evident that this information is secured with high-end measures.\n\nThankfully, Ethereum Code ensures that its platform, the data, and the users are protected at all costs. It uses strong encryptions and two-factor authentication methods to guarantee only legitimate users are accessing the platform.\n\nSome Downsides to Ethereum Code\n\nEven though the platform offers a series of compelling perks and features, to begin with, it still has some downsides that the users should be aware of:\n\nLack of an App\n\nSimply put, there isn't any Ethereum Code app; however, the creators are vigorously working on creating and launching one.\n\nAvailability Issues\n\nEven though Ethereum Code is available to users in countries such as Germany, China, the UK, etc. it's not available to users in the US. Hence, in order to access Ethereum Code in the US, you'd need to use a VPN. However, VPN use isn't recommended for high-end trading since internet fluctuations can cause errors in the reports and insights fetched by the platform, causing losses.\n\nHow to Get Started with Ethereum Code?\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gone through what Ethereum Code is, how it operates, and its features, it\u2019s time to let you know how you can join and get started with it. Check out the process below:\n\nSigning Up\n\nThe first step is signing up with Ethereum Code. You need to visit the official website of Ethereum Code and click on register or sign up to create your account. Once you do, you\u2019ll be directed to a form where you\u2019d need to input your contact information including username, email, contact information, etc.\n\nExplore Ethereum Code\u2019s Official Website\n\nConnecting with an Expert\n\nOnce you input your details, you\u2019ve officially created your user account. Shortly afterward, you\u2019ll receive an email on your provided address, indicating that you need to verify your account.\n\nOnce you do, you\u2019ll connect with a customer service representative that will ask some basic questions. These questions will include your investment and trading goals, risk approaches, and other metrics.\n\nThe representatives will ask these so that they can customize your dashboard layout as well as feature relevant educational materials for you to begin with.\n\nInitial Deposit\n\nAfter connecting with an expert and sharing your trading requirements, you'll be directed to a payment form where you need to share your payment details. This will be used for depositing your initial capital of $250.\n\nThis amount is required to complete your registration as a legit user as well as provide initial capital that you can use later for trading. In addition, you can also add more funds to this capital amount and use it later instead of re-depositing the amount again.\n\nChoosing Your Account Type\n\nFollowing the submission of your investment capital, you\u2019ll be directed to the page where you need to choose the account that you need to begin with. This includes the demo account that we mentioned earlier.\n\nIf you're a beginner or even a professional who wants to begin your journey experiencing the platform, then you can choose the demo account right away. Once you've done getting hands-on experience, you can switch to your manual account easily.\n\nHave Celebrities Endorsed the Ethereum Code?\n\nAs far as our Ethereum Code review shows, the platform hasn't been endorsed by any celebrities. Hence, it's safe to say that any website claiming that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos supports the Ethereum Code is false and users should abstain from following such sources.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s also recommended that the users only follow the news sources provided by the platform itself instead of following any other material online. Ethereum Code has a community page as well where it shares recent updates in the market as well as news about the platform.\n\nIn any case of collaboration or official launches, users can easily refer to this page or reach out to customer service to know the details.\n\nIs There a Dedicated Ethereum Code App?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no Ethereum Code app in the market and the creators are working diligently to create and launch one. Hence, Ethereum Code is under work; however, it's recommended that users not trust any such apps available on the market since they are not legit.\n\nThe platform creators have clearly shared that any such applications are not legit and they don't take any responsibility for losses or scams occurring through these apps. It's only recommended that users stick with the official website of Ethereum Code for updates on its app launch.\n\nIs Ethereum Code Legit?\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons why the Ethereum Code is quite recommended for traders is that it operates as an investment educational platform. It not only allows traders to invest and trade cryptocurrency but also allows them to learn from its numerous educational resources.\n\nThe availability of online resources, robust customer service, and amazing workability and design allow Ethereum Code to feature competitive trading perks for users. Hence, it's well-equipped to offer risk assessment and trading expertise, giving better insights into trading even on other platforms.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum Code is a legit platform that has a trading success rate while offering great means for users to learn more about trading. The customer service is readily available to assist with all matters and the high-end security measures make it quite compelling to be chosen for a trading platform."

        "content": "Tether (USDT) is recording dizzying daily trading volumes, surpassing the combined total of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto. In 24 hours, traders exchanged USDT for over 55 billion dollars, almost double BTC and more than three times ETH.\n\nTether: daily trading volumes exceed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined\n\nAccording to reports, it seems that Tether is dominating the daily trading volume scene across the entire crypto market.\n\n#ICYMI: Tether 24 hour trading volume surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC and Ethereum combined\n\n\n\nRead the full article \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/rgvjPLCboo pic.twitter.com/1TQvGjuNfx \u2014 CryptoSlate (@CryptoSlate) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cICYMI: the trading volume of Tether in the last 24 hours surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC, and Ethereum combined. Read the full article\u201d\n\nIn fact, in 24 hours, USDT was traded by traders for over 55 billion dollars, doubling the 28 billion dollars of BTC and tripling the 15 billion dollars of ETH.\n\nNot only that, doing some calculations, Tether maintains a volume higher than the combined volume of Bitcoin, Ethereum, in addition to USD Coin, Solana and First Digital USD, highlighting its significant presence in the market.\n\nThis is possible because USDT remains the most used (and most favored) stablecoin in trading pairs, capable of providing coverage from the typical volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTether and daily trading volumes beyond those combined of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other assets\n\nIn general, the daily trading volumes of Tether have remained robust throughout 2024, remaining above 25 billion dollars. This allows Tether to strengthen its position as a key liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nNot only that, on March 16, 2024, Tether recorded the highest peak of daily trading volumes of 130 billion dollars.\n\nUSDT is also the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap. At the time of writing, in fact, Tether records a total market capitalization of over 112 billion dollars.\n\nIn addition to winning over crypto traders, Tether is also succeeding in its mission to extend the adoption of USDT to other sectors as well.\n\nIn fact, recently, Tether has entered the Philippines, where it will be possible to use USDT for payments to the Social Security System (SSS), managed by the State. This public service manages social security and employee compensation, and its payment is mandatory by law.\n\nClosing cycles to open new ones\n\nOther recent news also talks about Tether strategies that on one hand close roads that are no longer viable, but on the other hand open new ones.\n\nIn fact, the issuer of the largest stablecoin has announced the end of the minting of USDT on the EOS and Algorand platforms. Specifically, the minting of USDT on the two blockchains ended in late June, but the company has reassured users that the transition will be carried out meticulously and with minimal disruptions.\n\nThus, while on one hand Tether is closing a circle that began some time ago, on the other hand it assures users that it will decide to allocate resources where they can improve and innovate in the crypto sector.\n\nJust the week before, meanwhile, Tether had already announced an important piece of news regarding the launch of a new stablecoin collateralized in gold. It is called Alloy by Tether (aUSDT) and it is pegged to the US dollar but, instead of being collateralized in dollars, it will be collateralized in gold.\n\naUSDT is not even a stablecoin in the style of Tether Gold (XAUT), as the latter is a simple stablecoin pegged to the value of gold.\n\nTherefore, aUSDT is pegged to the dollar and technically over-collateralized in gold, meaning the total market value of all gold reserves held by Tether as collateral for aUSDT exceeds the market of all issued aUSDT tokens."

        "content": "On Saturday, July 6, nearly two hundred students gathered for an ask-me-anything event with Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of the Ethereum blockchain and a former University of Waterloo student.\n\nButerin studied computer science at Waterloo and worked as a research assistant for cryptographer and computer science professor Ian Goldberg. In 2013 he wrote a white paper proposing Ethereum. Buterin was awarded a $100,000 USD grant from the Thiel Fellowship in 2014 and subsequently left Waterloo to work on Ethereum full-time. Today, Ethereum is second only to Bitcoin in market value.\n\nIn his talk, Buterin discussed the math behind the blockchain, areas for innovation and the future of cryptocurrency. \u201cWill crypto become the Esperanto of finance, the Linux of finance or the Internet of finance?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI think it depends \u2014 there are a lot of countries, particularly in the developing world, where there is a lot of demand for cryptocurrency because the traditional banking system is not effective.\u201d\n\nButerin also distinguished between early-stage technologies (like cryptocurrency, AI and space travel) and later-stage technologies (like the pharmaceutical industry), arguing that early-stage technologies are an ideal space for ambitious thinking, innovation and employing pure math, engineering and science. \u201cThere\u2019s a real focus right now on building amazing things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly lucky to have Vitalik come into town to talk about Ethereum and its future roadmap,\u201d said systems design engineering master\u2019s student Monica Tsang. \u201cHe encouraged us to work on the optimistic, idealistic side of blockchain development instead of chasing quick money. Being a jack-of-all trades will help us learn new knowledge fast in this quickly changing blockchain space!\u201d\n\nButerin emphasized the importance of shared values in technological ventures, both for practical reasons and for ethical ones. \u201cMake sure you and your co-founders are aligned on values, both in terms of what you want to achieve in the world and also what you want to get out of the project,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider what kind of relationship you want to have with each other, with your investors, with your users and with your community.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s talk was the finale of a four-day workshop series, \u201cSolidity 101 Bootcamp,\u201d sponsored by De University of Ethereum, VentureMiner and the Faculty of Mathematics. The bootcamp was billed as a comprehensive educational program designed to empower the next generation of blockchain developers.\n\n\u201cIt was such a thrill hosting Vitalik Buterin,\u201d said Stephanie Whitney, director for Research & Innovation Partnerships in the Math Innovation Office. \u201cThe audience was blown away by how thoughtfully he outlined avenues for contributing to the blockchain ecosystem. We can\u2019t thank him and the Ethereum Foundation enough for this amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nYou can learn more about Ethereum on the Ethereum Foundation website. You can learn more about the Math Innovation\u2019s Entrepreneurship and Impact Series, including future visitors, on the Math Innovation Website."

        "content": "One of the creators of the largest smart contracts blockchain, Vitalik Buterin took the stage at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) to discuss the network, its strengths, weaknesses, and how to make it even better. At the Brussel\u2019s event, Buterin noted the strides the blockchain has taken, but what work lies ahead to optimize its offerings to a growing user base.\n\nThe keynote speech, to a room of more than 1,000 onlookers, covered a variety of topics. Among them was Buterin\u2019s concerns regarding transaction censorship. Moreover, the co-founder revealed a unique proposal to those in attendance that would have a massive impact on the overarching issue.\n\nSource \u2013 Watcher Guru\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin Wants to Redesign the Network\n\nButerin Talks Ethereum\u2019s Strengths, Weaknesses, and \u2018Hardening\u2019 The Network\n\nIt's time! It's time! @VitalikButerin is speaking right now in the Gold Hall \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nWe have a full house of eager beavers ready to hear his keynote \ud83e\uddab\u2728\n\n\n\nIf you can't find a seat, please check out the streams in the Silver and Copper Halls \ud83e\udef6 pic.twitter.com/e9xpRFy29s July 10, 2024\n\nThe network\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently spoke on Ethereum at a keynote talk. There, he expressed his belief that Ethereum thrives as a \u201clarge and reasonably decentralized staking ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThis proved to be its greatest strength, according to Buterin. Moreover, it is supported by a growing community that is both international and highly intelligent. Yet, there is still room to make it better. The co-founder noted that solo staking is still very difficult. Currenlty, the process requires 32 ETH to become a validator, while running a node is increasingly complicated.\n\nHowever, Buterin did note that these issues, \u201care very addressable.\u201d Specifically, he discussed various improvements that would allow for a simplified protocol. \u201cSo if you want a robust ecosystem, it needs to be simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not have these, like, 73 random hooks and some kind of backward compatibility,\u201d just because it was created by Vitalik himself.\n\nSource: CoinDesk\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF: Expert Predicts Official Launch in Next Two Weeks\n\nHe also voiced his worry about the 51% attacks on the blockchain. However, he noted a solution isn\u2019t all that simple. Buterin said it \u201cdepends on a lot of assumptions around coordination, ideology, and various other things, and it\u2019s not clear how to do something like that as well in 10 years.\u201d\n\nButerin did share a proposal with attendees. He noted the difficulty in recovering from attacks when the chain finalizes. Therefore, he proposed increasing the quorum threshold from 75% to 80% to prevent that.\n\nIn the end, the Ethereum leader noted a clear path forward for the newor. \u201cI think there\u2019s value in really doubling down on these strengths and at the same time, recognizing and fixing our inadequacies and making sure that we actually live up to our very high standards.\u201d"

        "content": "Major financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock have updated their Spot Ethereum ETF filings in compliance with the SEC July 8 deadline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remains stable above US$3,000 following positive regulatory developments and expectations of ETF approvals.\n\nFuture ETF prospects for altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and XRP depend on upcoming political and regulatory changes.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) saga goes into the next round. All applicants have now updated their S-1 filings: Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Grayscale and BlackRock.\n\nRelated: Republican Platform Promises to Halt \u2018Un-American\u2019 Crypto Crackdown, Opposes Government Digital Currency\n\nThese have been filed according to the request by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which had asked to stick to the deadline of July 8.\n\nThe filings do not include details related to fees, as the SEC has informed issuers that these are not needed yet. Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there shouldn\u2019t be too much back-and-forth from now on \u2013 with trading to start soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will give guidance back to issuers soon along with the game plan. Then the docs will come back with fees (and every other blank) filled [in] and then it\u2019s go-time. Eric Balchunas Eric Balchunas\n\nEthereum Price Holds Above US$3K Mark\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the second-largest crypto by market cap has remained steady at over US$3K (AU$4.5K) since the most recent overnight dip. The current price is a solid 6.4% increase from yesterday.\n\nEthereum (ETH), 1-day graph, source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe price of ETH seems tied to any news around these funds, with many observers firmly expecting a launch without further delays. The odds of the funds being approved increased dramatically last month when the SEC dropped an investigation about ETH\u2019s status as a security.\n\nPresident of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, said he would be shocked if these funds are not trading within the next two weeks, eyeing July 15 for the first trading day.\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026\n\n\n\nLater next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, price of eth \u2193 20%+ since \"surprise\" 19b-4 approvals in late May. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 6, 2024\n\nOther Altcoin ETFs Next? Chances of Solana, Cardano and XRP\n\nWith the Ethereum ETFs done and dusted \u2013 going by the experts at least \u2013 the next likely candidates for a fund are probably Solana, Cardano and XRP. VanEck and 21Shares have applied for a US listing of these funds and there has been talk around Cardano and XRP to also get a listing.\n\nHowever, many observers are highly doubtful if any of this is happening in the near future. If President Joe Biden remains in office \u2013 which is still out in the open given his recent shaky public appearances \u2013 some believe any such request for a fund for SOL, XRP or ADA will be shot down.\n\nRelated: Defying Market Fears, Notcoin and Celestia Rally, with TIA Gaining 27%\n\nOthers are hopeful that if elected, self-proclaimed crypto-president Donald Trump could fix the broken relationship between the US-crypto sector and the US Government.

After a legendary run up from 2019-2021, the price of Ether ($ETH) has underperformed Bitcoin and most other majors. Investors are left wondering where the edge is today.\n\n\n\nL2 networks on Ethereum have led the slide downwards over the past weeks, with Polygon ($MATIC) settling last week at levels not seen since the bear market in 2022. With more losses expected in July, keen investors are turning to new protocols such as Rollblock ($RBLK) which is defying market conditions after raising more than $1Million and generating gains in excess of 55%!\n\nEthereum ($Eth) Struggles To Maintain Price Parity With Bitcoin\n\nDespite continued development of features and the switch to the ESG friendly Proof-of-Stake protocol, Ethereum ($ETH) has failed to keep pace with Bitcoin. It\u2019s continued to underperform even with an upcoming ETF approval in the pipeline, slipping under the $3000 mark routinely over the past week.\n\n\n\nNew major networks such as Solana and The Open Network attract retail investors, while institutions continue to favor the stability and trust of the Bitcoin network. There appears to be no love for the middle as the jack-of-all trades Ethereum misses the mark with both speculators and long term capital allocation.\n\nPolygon ($Matic) Fails To Attract New Investors\n\nPolygon ($MATIC) blockchain was the first network built on top of Ethereum ($ETH). Designed to enable cheaper and faster transactions while maintaining the security of the base network, Polygon initially attracted investors looking for $ETH beta. This thesis has not played out the way they anticipated, with dozens of rollup networks now built on top of Ethereum, Polygon is struggling to remain relevant.\n\n\n\nPolygon has also failed to keep investor money on the protocol. With less than $1 billion of funds on the network after reaching a high of over $10 billion in 2021, the Polygon network appears to be largely forgotten by keen speculators. With a price of just 50 cents at the time of writing, Polygon is down over 80% from its bull market highs.\n\nRollblock ($RBLK) Soars Amid Market Declines\n\nHaving crossed the million-dollar mark in less than two months, Rollblock is becoming one of the markets most popular crypto presales. This highly lucrative project combines the best of DeFi innovations with traditional betting, offering a comprehensive experience not available elsewhere. The project uses blockchain and AI to offer greater security than traditional casinos, making it impossible to change bets once placed while recording all transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThe casino itself hosts over 150 games, including classics like roulette and slots, as well as digital games. These will soon be complemented by sports betting, which will let players place wagers on sports such as the NFL, NBA, soccer, golf, and more.\n\nTo support both users and investors, Rollblock has implemented a revenue share model that shares up to 30% of the platform's revenue with $RBLK token holders. To achieve this, Rollblock will use revenue to buy $RBLK from the open market. To create a deflationary effect, half of these tokens will be burned, and the remaining half will be allocated to staking rewards, where stakers can earn some of the highest APYs in the market.\n\nAnother key element of the Rollblock ecosystem is its ease of access. Unlike traditional casinos which require extensive background checks, Rollblock requires no KYC to get started. Instead, players can sign up using their email or cryptocurrency wallet. After signing up they can deposit over 20 major cryptocurrencies. This ease of access has sped up Rollblock adoption, with almost 5000 users signing up in Q2.\n\n\n\nRollblock is currently in the third stage of its presale, and $RBLK is selling for $0.0154. The token has already seen two price increases over the last week, and as a result thousands of investors are doubling down on what experts are calling the hottest presale of the year. As the project's momentum snowballs, analysts believe that 100x returns could be on the table.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\n\n\n\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Targets Upside Break: Positive Indicators Light the Path - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price seems to be aiming for a decent recovery. ETH could gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above the $3,110 resistance.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving higher above the $3,000 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance near $3,080 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $3,110 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Steady Recovery\n\nEthereum price remained stable above the $2,880 support zone. ETH started a decent upward move and climbed above the $2,950 resistance, like Bitcoin. The price even cleared the $3,050 resistance before the bears emerged.\n\nThe pair tested the $3,120 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,110 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below $3,080. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,895 swing low to the $3,110 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $3,080 level. There is also a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance near $3,080 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,110 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,150 level. A close above the $3,150 level might send Ether toward the $3,220 resistance. The next key resistance is near $3,320. An upside break above the $3,320 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,500 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,110 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,020. The first major support sits near the $2,975 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,895 swing low to the $3,110 high.\n\nA clear move below the $2,975 support might push the price toward $2,920. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,975\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,110"
