        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Hard-Fork Strategy to Protect Ethereum From Quantum Attacks - The Quantum Insider",
        "content": "Insider Brief\n\nEthereum co-founder floats a hard fork strategy to safeguard Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses.\n\nSome community members have voiced concerns over the efficacy of such measures if quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallet.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy aimed at safeguarding Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks. This proposal has ignited a widespread discussion on the necessity of quantum security measures within the blockchain ecosystem, as reported by Blockchain.News.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses in the event of a quantum computing breach.\n\nA quantum computer\u2019s theoretical ability to solve certain mathematical problems far more efficiently than classical computers are the cause for concern. These cryptographic techniques serve as much of blockchain\u2019s security. Quantum computers could \u2014 again, theoretically \u2014 undermine Ethereum\u2019s cryptographic bedrock by decrypting private keys and compromising the integrity of smart contracts. This quantum capability could also disrupt consensus mechanisms, centralizing control or threatening the security of staked assets, which would Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and undermining trust in the platform.\n\nKey Steps\n\nKey steps were discussed in the Ethereum Research forum. The steps include the reversion of all blocks subsequent to the detection of a quantum attack, the suspension of traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerabilities, and the introduction of a new transaction type tailored for smart contract wallets that aligns with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard.\n\nThe proposal also outlines the implementation of an innovative transaction type or opcode that would enable users to submit STARK proofs. These proofs verify the user\u2019s knowledge of a private preimage and a public address generated through approved hash functions, culminating in the replacement of the user\u2019s account code with a quantum-resistant validation mechanism.\n\nAmong these deliberations, the web site reported that some community members voiced concerns that these measures would not be effective if people with malevolent intentions secure quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallets. These skeptics argue that distinguishing between legitimate owners and attackers could be extremely difficult under such circumstances. They advocate for the adoption of NIST standardized algorithms in a hybrid configuration with classical algorithms, such as combining the Dilithium and ed25519 algorithms, despite the resultant increase in block sizes due to the high number of signature and public key sizes of many current post-quantum schemes.\n\nAlternative propositions include the development of machine learning systems dedicated to the surveillance and identification of anomalous transactions, serving as an early warning mechanism to activate a fail-safe fork.\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s engagement with these quantum security challenges underscores the sector\u2019s proactive stance in navigating the security arms race posed by quantum computing advancements. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets, along with the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic solutions in digital signature applications, epitomize the blockchain sector\u2019s commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of technological threats.\n\nIf you found this article to be informative, you can explore more current quantum news here, exclusives, interviews, and podcasts."

        "content": "London Stock Exchange To Accept Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs Applications Starting Next Quarter\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has announced plans to accept applications for Bitcoin and Ether crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of 2024. However, the exact date has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAccording to the LSE's Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet, eligible ETNs must be physically backed and non-leveraged. They must also be backed by Bitcoin or Ether and have a market price or value measure of the underlying asset that is publicly available.\n\nThe underlying crypto assets must be held in a cold wallet or similar storage solution, including cold staking, and by a custodian subject to Anti-Money Laundering laws in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland, or the United States.\n\nETNs are debt securities that provide exposure to an underlying asset. They allow investors to trade securities that track the performance of crypto assets during the exchange's trading hours.\n\nThe U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stated that it will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a market segment for crypto-backed ETNs.\n\nHowever, these products can only be offered to \"professional investors,\" such as credit institutions and investment firms. However, it will not be available to retail investors, with the statement saying:\n\n\u201cThe FCA continues to believe cETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of cETNs (and crypto derivatives) to retail consumers remains in place.\u201d\n\nThe FCA has also emphasized that cryptocurrencies are still deemed \u201chigh risk and largely unregulated,\u201d and warns the public that their investments could go to zero. The UK government has recently ramped up regulatory efforts in the crypto industry, including allowing law enforcement to seize crypto assets suspected of being involved in illicit activities without a conviction."

        "title": "3 Reasons Ethereum Price Could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum price broke above $3,9500 barrier again on Feb. 22, while Bitcoin price rally struggles for momentum: 3 vital market metrics suggest ETH could further extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are historically closely correlated, but in 2024, ETH seems to have gained the upper hand. A deep dive into the on-chain data trends and expert analysis provides key insights into which asset would come out on top as the year unfolds.\n\nIs Ethereum better than Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nSo far in 2024, Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two largest assets in the crypto sector have attracted billions of dollars in capital inflows. As of March 2024, BTC is trading at historic all-time highs of $71,200, while ETH price attempts to establish a steady support above the $4,000 milestone.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the price charts shows that ETH currently has the upper hand having outperformed BTC by 7% in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price action January to March 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nThe chart above shows that ETH price has increased 79% between Jan 1 and March 11 2024, which is significantly higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 72% price gains.\n\nHowever, while ETH currently has the upperhand, to determine which asset is a better value for money in 2024, it is important to examine the market catalyst driving both assets.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that both assets are driven by separate narratives and market catalysts in 2024.\n\nFor Ethereum, the ongoing ETH ETF filings, liquidity staking derivatives, the Eigen-layer re-staking and Dencun upgrade have emerged major themes within the ecosystem in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, the dominant themes for Bitcoin are the rapidly growing demand from the 10 newly-approved BTC ETFs and the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 19 2024.\n\nThese key events have triggered diverse changes in on-chain transaction trends and investment patterns across both ecosystems, leading to Ethereum price outpacing Bitcoin.\n\n3 reasons Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nRetail investors are rallying behind ETH as Institutions dominate BTC markets\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 10 new Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11 2024 marking a real milestone moment for the cryptocurrency sector. Within the 2 months post-launch the ETFs have rapidly acquired about 800,000 BTC, about 4.2% of the total supply in circulation.\n\nEvidently, Bitcoin price has benefited immensely from record-breaking inflows made by the corporate institutional investors in 2024. But interestingly, the ETF\u2019s dominance has triggered a skittish reaction among BTC retail investors, much to the apparent advancement of the Ethereum ecosystem growth.\n\nSantiment\u2019s total holders metric estimates the total number of active or funded wallet addresses that currently exist on a blockchain network. It serves a proxy for measuring the level of adoption among retail investors and the mass markets.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Total Holders vs Bitcoin (BTC) | Source: Santiment\n\nIn the last 50-days dating back to Jan. 21, the Ethereum network has attracted 3.59 million new holder addresses, while 200,000 BTC addresses emptied their wallets and exited the network.\n\nThis rare on-chain trend suggests that the retail mass markets are overwhelming behind Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes more concentrated in the hands of fewer whale investors and corporate entities, it puts BTC price at risk of market manipulation and external shock from the macroeconomic fronts.\n\nThe significant increase in new holder addresses on the Ethereum network compared to the number of BTC addresses emptying their wallets suggests a divergence in retail investor sentiment between the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nFirstly, this trend indicates that retail investors are increasingly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, potentially due to Ethereum\u2019s promise of profit-optimization and passive income from its low-risk staking yield to its retinue of decentralized finance applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the growing dominance of institutional investors and corporate entities in the Bitcoin market introduces a new layer of uncertainty and potential risk. While institutional adoption has been a key driver of Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally, it also increases the susceptibility of the market to large-scale sell-offs or coordinated trading strategies by these influential players.\n\nIn the event of a tradfi market downturn or macroeconomic policy changes, the concentrated ownership of Bitcoin in the hands of highly-sensitive Wall Street players could exacerbate BTC price declines and lead to heightened market volatility.\n\nBitcoin Miners Trading Bearish while Ethereum Node Validators remain bullish\n\nThe divergence in the current trading disposition of Bitcoin miners and Ethereum node validators is another vital market catalyst that could drive ETH price further ahead of BTC. On the Bitcoin network, miners dedicate computing resources to validate transactions and secure the network in exchange of BTC block rewards. Ethereum, since its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), now relies on its node validators for that critical function.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event slated for April 19, will see miners\u2019 rewards slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.13 BTC. With the event now less than 40-days away Bitcoin miners have entered a selling frenzy in a bid to cash-in before the halving date.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Miner Reserves December 2023 to March 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs of Dec. 29 2023, Bitcoin miners held a total of 1.96 million BTC. But as the halving date drew closer, the miners rapidly offloaded 300,000 BTC, cutting down their balances to just 1.93 million BTC at press time on March 11 2024.\n\nValued at the current prices of $71,200, the miners have sold $21.5 billion worth of BTC in Q1 2024 ahead of the halving.\n\nIf the Bitcoin miner\u2019s selling trend persists, it could slow down the BTC price rally, especially in comparison to Ethereum whose node validators have been accumulating more coins in recent months.\n\nEthereum node validators have doubled down on their bullish positions, depositing 2.4 million ETH worth $9.7 billion into the beacon chain staking contracts since Jan. 2024, meanwhile Bitcoin miners entered a $21.5 billion selling spree.\n\nEthereum (ETH 2.0) Staking Deposits Jan 2024 \u2013 March 2024 | Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nAt press time on March 11, the total staking deposits on the ETH 2.0 beacon chain stood at $1.4 million ETH, representing a 2.4 million ($9.7 billion) increase in 2024.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin miners, Ethereum node validators continue to double-down on their long-term bullish positions as ETH price edges further above the $4,000 mark. Positive speculations surrounding the Dencun upgrade, and progress of ETH ETF filings are key catalysts incentivizing ETH stakeholders\u2019 bullish disposition.\n\nWith these catalysts still in play, ETH could witness even more coins taken out of circulation, while BTC circulation supply increases as miners increase selling pressure as the halving approaches.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Head of Digital Assets to Cryptoquant also echoed this stance in a recent interview with Cryptoquant.\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, ETH tends to outperform BTC in the halving year, right? So I don\u2019t want to lose the forest for the trees. I don\u2019t think there will be flippening, but I do think when the year (2024) is said and done, ETH will have outperformed BTC.\n\nIf these scenarios play out as predicted, ETH price will likely extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nTechnical Indicators Highlight Ethereum\u2019s Path to $5,000\n\nIn summary, Ethereum is expected to pull greater retail market demand than Bitcoin and also experience a temporary decline in circulation supply amid rising staking deposits. These key factors put ETH price on a path to a new all time highs above $5,000.\n\nETH is currently trading above the $4,030 range at the time of writing on March 11. IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money chart shows that Ethereum has a relatively clear path to reaching a new all time-high.\n\n\n\nAs seen below, the chart highlights the $4,500 territory as the largest resistance cluster above the current prices. At that range, 617,760 addresses had acquired 1.6 million ETH at the average price of $4,557.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConsidering that they have been holding at a loss for 3-years, many of those holders could move to close their positions once Ethereum prices approach their break-even point.\n\nIf ETH price can establish a steady support level above that $4,500 area, it could potentially propel ETH price to a new all-time high above $5,000."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader Raoul Pal has doubled down on his forecast for the trio of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow high can Bitcoin soar?\n\nIn a YouTube chat with Anthony Scaramucci, Raoul Pal noted that he believes the Bitcoin price can end this current cycle with a massive price of $250,000. For reference, the Bitcoin price is actively in discovery mode, and it just recorded another all-time high (ATH) above $71,000 as optimism surrounding the coin remains sustained.\n\nDespite the $250,000 price target, Raoul Pal is not convinced this is the best the digital currency could do. He noted that the valuation could be higher depending on the trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF has remained the dominant catalyst driving the price of BTC to new heights. The daily accumulation from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Ark Invest and Bitwise, notably surpassed the amount of BTC generated through mining.\n\nWhile an average of 5,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC is stacked up daily, only about 900 BTC are generated across the board, creating a notable supply shock that might help drive the price toward the estimated $250,000 in the long term.\n\nEthereum and Solana get high targets\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin forecast, Raoul Pal projected a $17,000 to $20,000 surge for Ethereum this bull cycle, while he noted that Solana might jump as high as $700 to $1,000.\n\nWhile the duo of Ethereum and Solana have not retested their respective ATHs at $4,800 and $260 this ongoing bullish run, Raoul Pal has always highlighted their fundamentals as a key catalyst that can drive growth in the long term.\n\nOther analysts have even more bullish projections for Bitcoin as well as Ethereum and Solana, and time will tell how high the three digital currencies will grow this bull cycle."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum developers will roll out the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade on Wednesday, March 13. Developers have told Decrypt that the impact on gas fees for Ethereum scaling networks will be dramatic, with some estimating that they'll drop by 75% immediately.\n\nThe name is a portmanteau of Cancun and Deneb, two separate upgrades that have been combined to create the term \"Dencun.\" A word of caution for Ethereum upgrade first-timers: There's nothing that users need to do. Be wary of any blog, email, or Twitter (aka X) post that says otherwise and asks you to click a link or connect your wallet.\n\nLeading up to the upgrade, Dencun has already been pushed live on several of Ethereum's testnets. But the real push, to Ethereum's mainnet, will occur later this week. The upgrade is happening roughly a year after the Shanghai upgrade from April 2023, when the newly upgraded proof-of-stake network made it possible for users to unstake their ETH.\n\nThis new upgrade is targeted at addressing core aspects of Ethereum\u2019s framework, including its scalability, security, and overall user experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of proto-danksharding, a cutting-edge concept designed to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase processing speed across the network.\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new paradigm for how Ethereum operates,\u201d Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, which builds layer-2 network Optimism, told Decrypt earlier this month.\n\nThe optimization is expected to make Ethereum a more attractive network to build on for startups, which could add even more protocols to its already bustling decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nEthereum has long hosted the largest DeFi ecosystem when measured by the number of protocols. In fact, it has seldom accounted for less than half of the entire total value locked in DeFi projects. At the time of writing, there are 990 Ethereum-based projects, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upgrade also includes several key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), each tailored to enhance specific functionalities within the network. For example, EIP-7044 will introduce programmable staking exits.\n\nValidators secure the Ethereum network by locking up 32 ETH as their pledge to keep their validator client running and handle the transactions that come their way. If they don't, they stand to lose a portion of their 32 ETH to penalties.\n\nFor users who don't have 32 ETH to become a solo staker, there are pooled staking options. They allow users to deposit any amount of Ethereum and earn a share of the staking rewards (minus the pool fees, of course).\n\nBut what happens if the validator with whom you've staked your ETH experiences downtime and part of your staked funds get slashed?\n\nEIP-7044 will make it possible for ETH validators and stakers to store instructions for when to exit their position\u2014called perpetually valid signed voluntary exits\u2014in smart contracts, and specify when they should be carried out.\n\nFor example, someone running a validator node may want to exit if their hardware remains inactive for a certain number of blocks processed. This is an important protection for validators because they could face mounting fines if they're unable to process transactions on time.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Amidst this bull run, ETH prices tapped new yearly highs, feeding optimism around the crypto\u2019s outlook. The big question now is: just how high can Ethereum trend in the months ahead?\n\nAnalysis of price charts reveals Ethereum, with its $479 billion market cap, has surged past the $4,000 level for the first time in two years. A 75% increase in trading volumes to $22 billion supports this signal of strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAfter logging 15% gains last week, ETH has rallied 60% across the past 30 days. Ethereum has notched a bullish milestone that hints at a trend reversal.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: Top 3 Coins To Buy Under $10 For Better Gains\n\nCan Ethereum hit $5,000 next?\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price is able to sustain support around the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, some analysts estimate the next likely upside target could be around $6,835 based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.\n\nThis would represent the next key price milestone if the current bullish momentum is maintained. However, prices could also consolidate or correct before any potential further upside.\n\nEthereum hit its all-time high of $4,891 on November 16, 2021. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency is just 18% away from breaching its previous all-time highs.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forecasted To Surge 540% & Hit New ATH: Here\u2019s When\n\nOf course, if existing market conditions deteriorate again, Ethereum may see a downside. However, indicators presently favor the ongoing bullish structure persisting through February.\n\nSo, with ETH firmly back in recovery mode, early technical clues support the growing narrative of history repeating itself this cycle. If Bitcoin manages to sustain the $71,000 level, ETH and other altcoins could stage a bullish outlook in the coming days."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes a Quantum-Resistant Hard Fork for Ethereum Jessie A Ellis Vitalik Buterin proposes a hard fork strategy for Ethereum to protect funds against quantum computer attacks, sparking a community-wide discussion on quantum security.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy. This preemptive measure is designed to protect user funds in the event that quantum computers become capable of breaking current cryptographic defenses.\n\nThe proposal, outlined in a discussion on the Ethereum Research forum, highlights the urgency of preparing for quantum computers' ability to solve problems like the discrete logarithm, which underpins the security of many current cryptographic algorithms including those used by Ethereum.\n\nThe proposed hard fork would entail the following steps:\n\nReversion of all blocks following the detection of large-scale quantum attacks. Disabling traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerability. Introduction of a new transaction type for smart contract wallets, in line with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard. Implementation of a new transaction type or opcode allowing users to submit STARK proofs, demonstrating the knowledge of a private preimage and a public address derived through approved hash functions. The user's account code would then be replaced with a new, quantum-resistant validation code.\n\nThe conversation in the Ethereum community is informed by a range of expert inputs. One participant shared a visual aid to help understand the proof statement, while others discussed existing quantum-secure fallbacks for wallets and the integration of preimages into ECDSA signature nonces to create fail-stop signature schemes.\n\nSome community members have cautioned that if quantum computers capable of cracking Ethereum wallets are already in malicious hands, it might be too late to differentiate between legitimate owners and attackers. They suggest that instead of relying on stateful post-quantum algorithms, Ethereum should use NIST standardized ones in hybrid mode with a classical algorithm, like combining Dilithium with ed25519. This would, however, increase block sizes due to the large signature and public key sizes of current post-quantum schemes.\n\nOthers have proposed the development of machine learning systems to monitor and detect abnormal transactions as an early warning system to trigger a fail-safe fork.\n\nThe community's response underlines the importance of staying ahead in the security arms race against quantum computing. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets are already in development, as is the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic measures in other digital signature applications.\n\nThis initiative by the Ethereum community reflects the broader blockchain ecosystem's commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of emerging technological threats. As quantum computing advances, the blockchain sector's proactive stance on security promises to be a critical factor in its long-term viability and trustworthiness.\n\nThe Ethereum team and community's proactive approach to quantum security demonstrates a clear recognition of the challenges ahead and a willingness to address them head-on. This ongoing conversation will likely shape the future of Ethereum's infrastructure and set a precedent for other blockchain platforms."

        "title": "Comparison Between Solana and Ethereum - ForexLive",
        "content": "When evaluating the blockchain space, two platforms frequently come up for comparison: Solana and Ethereum. Both have garnered significant attention, each with its own set of strengths that appeal to different users and developers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nPerformance and Transaction Speed\n\nOne of the most notable differences between Solana and Ethereum is in terms of performance, particularly transaction speed. Solana has made a name for itself with its high throughput capacity, being able to handle about 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently processes roughly 30 TPS. This stark contrast is due to Solana\u2019s unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH), combined with the Proof of Stake (PoS) model, which allows for quicker validation of transactions and blocks.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to a PoS system through its Ethereum 2.0 update, aiming to increase its transaction speed and reduce energy consumption. However, until this transition is complete, Solana takes the lead in performance.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is another crucial factor in the comparison. Solana's architecture gives it a significant scalability edge, allowing for the support of thousands of nodes without sacrificing speed. Ethereum, with its current architecture, faces challenges in scaling, although layer two solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum are providing off-chain scaling options. The shift to Ethereum 2.0 also promises to address these concerns by introducing sharding, which will spread the network load across 64 new chains.\n\nCost\n\nTransaction costs are vastly different on Solana compared to Ethereum. Solana boasts extremely low transaction fees due to its efficient processing capabilities. Ethereum's fees, however, can vary widely and tend to be much higher, especially during periods of network congestion. This aspect makes Solana more attractive for microtransactions and decentralized applications (dApps) requiring a large number of transactions.\n\nDecentralization and Security\n\nEthereum is widely recognized for its level of decentralization and security, having a large and diversified network of nodes. While Solana\u2019s architecture has led to a smaller node count, its newer network hasn't yet faced the same level of scrutiny or attack as Ethereum. Thus, Ethereum might be seen as more secure and decentralized at this moment.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption\n\nEthereum has a first-mover advantage, being the pioneer for smart contracts and dApps. It has an enormous and thriving ecosystem with a multitude of dApps, tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Solana is newer but growing quickly, developing its ecosystem and attracting developers with its performance benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether Solana is \"better\" than Ethereum depends largely on what metric you're measuring. If transaction speed and cost are your primary concerns, Solana may appear to be the superior platform. If decentralization, security, and ecosystem maturity are more important, Ethereum might be the preferred choice. Ultimately, the \"better\" platform will depend on the specific needs of the users and developers, and the continuous evolution of both platforms keeps this as an ongoing conversation in the blockchain community."

        "content": "New York, Mar 10, 2024 -Bitcoin has captured the limelight in recent weeks as it surged to a new record high, yet another major cryptocurrency , Ether, has been enjoying its own meteoric rise.Launched in 2015, Ether, also known as Ethereum , is by far the second-largest digital currency in terms of total value, now estimated at over $460 billion.Along with other cryptocurrencies including Solana and Dogecoin, it benefited from the regulatory approval in the United States of a new bitcoin investment product, the exchange traded fund -- or ETF -- in mid-January, said James Butterfill of the investment company CoinShares.These ETFs allow investors to profit from any change to the price of cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly, while also letting them sell at any time.The launch of crypto ETFs has led to an influx of new money, sending bitcoin to a fresh record on Friday of $70,085.Bitcoin's rise has been well-documented, but Ether's has been even more impressive, surging almost 72 percent year to date in comparison to bitcoin's 61 percent rise.This strong performance is largely due to \"expectations that an Ethereum ETF could be approved in the United States,\" according to Dessislava Aubert of research firm Kaiko.Several asset management companies have applied for authorization from the US financial markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to market these Ether investment products.The SEC must rule on the first such applications, from VanEck and Ark 21Shares, by May 23 at the latest.\"Ethereum has started to wake up as investors are anticipating a potential approval,\" Michael van de Poppe of MN Trading told AFP, adding that \"people are rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum as a potential investment opportunity.\"Beyond the ETF effect, the digital currency dreamed up by Russian programmer Vitaly Buterin has several other cards up its sleeve.For Simon Peters of cryptocurrency exchange eToro, Ethereum is also buoyed by the prospect of \"Dencun,\" a major upgrade to the technology underlying this digital currency, scheduled for March 13.This major change will improve transaction processing capacity and cut transaction costs, but also has the potential to unleash the growth of an ecosystem with multiple applications.\"Bitcoin's primary use is as store of value, while Ethereum has much more potential use cases,\" Peters told AFP.For example, it is the destination of choice for non-fungible tokens -- or NFTs -- the certificates of digital authenticity that caused such a stir three years ago.The two cryptocurrencies are not in direct competition, according to van de Poppe from MN Trading, because Bitcoin is \"hard money,\" while Ether \"is basically an investment for the entire blockchain and smart contract ecosystem.\"Ethereum has already successfully negotiated two major technical transformations in recent years, including the switch to a less energy-intensive system in September 2022.James Butterfill said there is \"increasing optimism\" that a \"Dencun\" upgrade will \"go without a hitch,\" which would reinforce the currency's credibility.He added that Ether, by the very nature of its operation, offers the \"added benefit\" of interest generated by its holders.The mechanism for creating this currency involves owners putting up existing Ether coins as collateral in a process known as \"Proof of Stake,\" which differs from bitcoin's energy-intensive method involving highly complex calculations, known as \"Proof of Work.\"Ether investors who agree to put up some or all of their holdings receive a fee of a few percent a year, in addition to any potential capital gain if the currency appreciates in value.The \"Proof of Stake\" process adopted in September 2022 has significantly increased the amount of Ether used as collateral, notes Simon Peters, currently at 21 percent compared with just 10 percent 18 months ago.\"There is less Ethereum in circulation,\" he said, adding: \"If demand increases, given the squeeze in supply, then price should follow.\"\"I think that Ethereum is going to be outperforming Bitcoin,\" said Michael van de Poppe, adding the total market capitalization of Ethereum could end up exceeding that of bitcoin."

This surge in price occurred right alongside Bitcoin\u2019s successful attempt at setting a new ATH at over $71k. ETH\u2019s present price milestone underscores the leading altcoin\u2019s resilience and further highlights the increasing optimism surrounding the crypto industry\u2019s future.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThe recent climb of Ethereum\u2019s price can be attritbuted to a number of different related factors. These include the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which promises significant improvements in the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability and reduced transaction fees, and is expected to happen sooner rather than later. Ethereum also remains as the dominant platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which have continued to thrive and keep growing up to now.\n\nKeeping Up with Bitcoin\n\nThe news of ETH\u2019s $4,000 breakthrough coincides with BTC\u2019s surge to an entirely new ATH price of more than $71,000.

Any more gains might call for a test of $4,350.\n\nAre Dips Limited In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,950 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,600 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,211 swing low to the $3,9983 high. The next key support could be the $3,400 zone. A clear move below the $3,400 support might send the price toward $3,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,950"

        "title": "Ethereum surges past $4,000 for the second time in its history - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price neared the $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021 on March 8, 2024. As of March 11, it has gone past $4,000, the second time in the entire price history of Ethereum. The upward movement in Ether's price seems to be fueled by anticipation surrounding Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\n\nAs of writing, ETH is holding down at $4,010 and continues to be on the rise, while other major cryptocurrencies are also displaying positive sentiment, with Bitcoin at $71,085.\n\n\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, considered the most substantial enhancement to the Ethereum network since the merger, aims to incorporate several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which introduces \"proto-danksharding.\"\n\n\n\nProto-danksharding is a feature designed to enhance transaction processing by utilising blobs, thereby expediting transactions and reducing costs for layer-2 chains and rollups dependent on Ethereum. The Ethereum developers have scheduled the Dencun mainnet launch for March 13.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is optimism about the SEC's potential approval of spot Ether ETF applications. It's expected that the SEC will announce its decision on all spot Ether ETF applications simultaneously, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, to maintain fairness among issuers. The statutory deadline for the SEC's decision on ETFs is set for May 23.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the SEC's decision-making process for Ether ETFs won't be as prolonged as it was for Bitcoin ETFs. Drawing from the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, a spot Ether ETF product is anticipated to attract significant capital inflow into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that institutional investors may increase their exposure to Ether once attention shifts from Bitcoin's recent all-time high to the potential of an ETH ETF. This could lead to liquidity consolidating at higher levels, potentially triggering price rallies in the long term. With the potential for increased institutional interest and capital inflow, Ethereum's position as the second-largest cryptocurrency is poised for further growth.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been rallying rapidly over the last few weeks, breaking past several resistance levels. Yet, the price has reached a significant level that could hold the market for a while.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been steadily rising, making higher highs and lows. The market has left the 200-day moving average far behind, a behavior typically seen during crypto bull markets.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price is trying to pierce through the $4,000 resistance level after failing to do so last week.\n\nIf the breakout occurs, ETH will likely reach a new all-time high. However, judging by the massive overbought signals on the RSI, a pullback looks pretty probable in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been consolidating below the $4,000 level for a while. Yet, the bullish momentum has seemingly kicked in again, and ETH is on the verge of blowing past the $4,000 resistance zone.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index also shows values above 50% but is still not overbought in this timeframe. Therefore, the market might still rise higher before an eventual correction.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rate\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has yet to reach a new all-time high, market participants expect the price to rally much higher. This optimistic behavior can easily be witnessed in future market sentiment.\n\nThis chart presents the Ethereum funding rates, which indicate whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their orders more aggressively on aggregate. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values point to pessimism by market participants.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that the funding rates have been showing extremely high values recently, even higher than during the last all-time high. While this aggregate buying pressure is not inherently bad, it can lead to a potential long-liquidation cascade that could cause short-term price drops."

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen its price hover stubbornly below the $4,000 mark in recent days, despite registering over 10% gains in the past week. This consolidation phase has analysts pondering whether it\u2019s a healthy pause before further ascension or a sign of a potential correction.\n\nETH/USD Technical Analysis Paints a Mixed Picture\n\nLooking at the ETH/USD technical indicators:\n\nResistance: The immediate hurdle for ETH bulls lies at the $3,850 level. A decisive break above this point could propel the price towards $4,000 and potentially higher.\n\nSupport: The first line of defense in case of a pullback sits at $3,740. A clear breach below this level could see ETH revisit the $3,650 zone or even the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally, around $3,550.\n\nMoving Averages: The 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are currently acting as dynamic support for ETH prices, indicating a short-term bullish bias.\n\nMomentum Indicators: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the hourly chart is losing some momentum in the bullish zone, suggesting a potential slowdown in the upward trend. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, signifying that the market isn\u2019t yet overbought.\n\nPossible Reasons for Consolidation in Ethereum Price\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to ETH\u2019s current consolidation:\n\nProfit-taking: After a significant weekly rally, some investors might be taking profits, leading to a temporary price pullback.\n\nWider market correction: If the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a correction, ETH could be dragged down along with it.\n\nMacroeconomic factors: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising interest rates, could dampen investor sentiment across riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nLatest Developments to Know Before Trading Ethereum\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval Delays: Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret reported diminishing optimism surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23rd. Her sources suggest a lack of engagement from the SEC staff compared to Bitcoin ETF applications. Additionally, prominent anti-crypto politicians are reportedly opposing Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Quantum Readiness: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed confidence in the platform\u2019s ability to counter a potential quantum computing attack through a hard fork and new transaction types. This would involve a network rollback and user software updates to protect existing wallets.\n\nDeFi Resurgence: The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has seen a significant uptick, reaching a $100 billion total value locked (TVL) for the first time since May 2022. Ethereum maintains its dominance in DeFi with a 59% market share. Lido, an Ethereum-based staking protocol, remains the leader with $39 billion TVL.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe next few days will be crucial for determining the direction of ETH\u2019s price. A sustained break above $3,850 could signal a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a drop below $3,740 with increasing selling pressure could indicate a more significant correction."

        "title": "JPMorgan credits Ethereum for Crypto boost; Whales favoring this new AI Altcoin over Solana - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "Analysts at global investment bank JPMorgan have noted three primary catalysts for the crypto boost, naming Ethereum (ETH) as a significant reason for the surge in crypto retail interest. The altcoin\u2019s contributions are highlighted by two impending yet substantial developments within its ecosystem: the Dencun upgrade and the prospective approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Whale interest in the new AI altcoin InQubeta (QUBE) rises as market sentiment for Solana (SOL) drops.\n\nWith a promising price entry and a prevalent recommended presale, InQubeta is attracting institutional investors. This gem coin merges the blockchain and artificial intelligence industries, guaranteeing a unique and revolutionary crowdfunding model. This article explores Ethereum\u2019s role in the crypto boom and the rising whale interest in the Solana competitor.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Attracting Whales with NFT-backed features\n\nInQubeta is a top-rated AI token on the decentralized cryptocurrency list with impressive features that attract investors to the platform. This ICO offers a crowdfunding model backed by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring all willing participants can hold equity in AI tech startups without needing a considerable budget. Equity in these startups is minted into trending NFTs that are fractionated, allowing investors to own blocks in different projects, thereby diversifying their portfolios and reaping immense rewards from the growth of these startups.\n\nInQubeta is set to clear the eighth stage of its recommended presale as more whales gain interest in the token. Less than 9% of this stage is left, selling at $0.0245 per token, after which the price will increase to $0.028 apiece. The presale has recently hit the $11 million milestone as more tokens are purchased daily and whales buy in bulk. Over 861 million QUBE tokens have been sold, with investors looking to claim substantial returns upon launch.\n\nThis blockchain ICO is topping the decentralized cryptocurrency list with a deflationary token burn model that aims to reduce the supply of tokens in circulation, raising demand and market value over time. A buy-and-sell tax imposed on transactions within the platform funds a dedicated pool that rewards users who stake their QUBE tokens, further reducing supply and raising demand. From trading NFTs to offering exciting opportunities for diversified earnings and passive income, InQubeta continues to thrill investors, welcoming whales to purchase its presale at discounted rates.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Pushing the Crypto market with exciting developments\n\nAccording to JPMorgan analysts, the Ethereum network is credited with two of the three catalysts that will drive crypto prices over the coming months. The team, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a top-rated market strategist, has noted that the revival of retail impulse in February reflects market anticipation for the Bitcoin halving event, the Dencun upgrade, and the possible spot ETH ETF approvals. While the first two catalysts are priced in, the spot ETH ETF approval only has a 50% chance based on their on-chain data analysis.\n\nThe major upcoming upgrade for Ethereum, Dencun, is set to be released on March 13th. The upgrade merges Cancun and Deneb, two more minor upgrades on the network. It focuses on the execution and consensus layers of the network to enhance scalability, efficiency, and security while significantly reducing transaction fees on layer 2. The decision regarding the SEC approval for the spot ETH ETFs is expected to be made in May, but skepticism remains as the SEC Chairman has yet to clarify whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity.\n\nSolana (SOL): Continued defiance among top Altcoins\n\nAnticipation for a Solana rally is rising as the token maintains an upward trend, even with expectations of a market reversal for altcoins following recent pullbacks. Its charts indicate a solid bullish trend, as analysts note a series of high lows and higher highs. Following its week-long rally, analysis of the token\u2019s on-chain data predicts a promising trajectory in March, putting SOL within reach of possibly hitting its all-time high of $259.96.\n\nSOL-based products, particularly its decentralized exchanges (DEXes), have witnessed increased user interest. The project\u2019s DEXes have had their most productive week as DeFiLlama\u2019s data, analyzed by AMBCrypto, signified a cumulative volume of $11.24 billion between February 25th and March 2nd. Solana has surpassed all top smart contract blockchains, including Ethereum, with a total value locked (TVL) that surged by 52% in the past month and a 177% weekly growth rate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market is rallying, with a boost credited to Ethereum based on on-chain data analyzed by the JPMorgan team. Whale interest in Solana has dwindled as investors turn to other projects with impressive utility and exciting offerings. The AI altcoin is attracting whale investments with its trending NFTs and revolutionary crowdfunding model.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto market is gearing up for a pivotal week, with multiple significant events poised to shape investor sentiment and influence market dynamics. From crucial economic reports to blockchain upgrades, here\u2019s an overview of the key events to watch out for in the upcoming week \u2013\n\nCPI Report \u2013 March 12\n\nThe eagerly awaited February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on March 12, stands as a potential catalyst with the power to impact both crypto and stock markets. Investors are keenly observing whether the inflation reading will prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts.\n\nA positive macroeconomic environment is necessary for sustaining the current bullish momentum in the crypto market. We saw Bitcoin, Ethereum, dogwifhat and other altcoins and memecoins surge significantly this week. Considering past experiences, rising interest rates triggered a crypto winter in 2022.\n\nThe bond-market pricing shows that the market believes there is a 62.6% probability of the Fed being the one to execute a rate cut by June. Nevertheless, a delay in the change could result in a negative effect on crypto prices and risk assets.\n\nPPI Report \u2013 March 14\n\nOn March 14, the PPI report could provide additional information that would help the Fed judge the necessity of a reduction in rate. The PPI shows upward movement, which could have consequences for consumer prices now.\n\nIncreased PPI could be a sign of broadening the market outside the region. Cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, are generally referred to as having the ability to act as an inflation hedge just like other precious traditional assets, such as gold.\n\nTraders and investors in the crypto market are keeping a keen eye on the CPI and PPI data which will then determine the Fed\u2019s potential decision on upcoming rate-hike plans.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade \u2013 March 13\n\nEthereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun Upgrade, set for March 13, marks a significant milestone in the platform\u2019s evolution.\n\nBy integrating \u201cDeneb\u201d with the name of a famous tourist destination \u201cCancun,\u201d the upgrade will lead to improved scalability, security, and network efficiency. Proto-Danksharding and many other EIPs will be introduced, which aim at lowering costs of Layer 2 approaches, improving security measures, and creating a more rewarding staking experience.\n\nEIP-4844 could, conceivably, bring a drastic downfall in Ethereum\u2019s settlement costs quite effectively. This is a significant development in the context of Ethereum\u2019s pursuit of resolving its scalability challenges.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Sentencing \u2013 March 28\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, faces a potential prison sentence of up to 110 years on the 28th of March.\n\nBitcoin Halving \u2013 March \u2013 April\n\nBitcoin halving was predicted to happen earlier on 6th March. Nevertheless, we can expect the Bitcoin halving to take place supposedly around April or May.\n\n\u201cFor the previous halving in 2012 and 2016, the market followed by substantial price rise for bitcoin; a bullish narrative for the 2024 halving came up as the market talk\u201d, indicates Rikke Staer, the CEO of Coinify.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Options and Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 WHEN?\n\nCryptocurrency traders are anxiously waiting for the arrival of a spot bitcoin ETF options which may be several months away.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC is given a time extension until the end of May to make its decision regarding the first spot ETH ETF applications.\n\nThe green signal to the spot Bitcoin ETFs options and the spot Ethereum ETFs being approved are likely to introduce new dynamics in the crypto market.\n\nRegulatory clarity on spot Bitcoin ETF options and potential spot Ethereum ETFs is a key factor driving investor sentiment in the crypto space.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s interest rate, the sentencing of SBF and the Bitcoin halving to occur in a few weeks are likely to be the main news stories in the crypto industry, affecting traders\u2019 perceptions and strategies."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry concluded the first week of March positively with top tokens adding significant value to their respective portfolio. Further, the price of Bitcoin successfully achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of just over $70,000 on 08th March.\n\nThe leader of altcoins, Ethereum (ETH), has added over 14% to its portfolio during the previous week. Ripple (XRP) token on the other hand has successfully recovered its losses during this week, indicating an increase in the bullish influence within the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC):\n\nThe market leader, Bitcoin, traded in a closed range between $47,705 and $50,540 for a while, following which the bulls recorded a jump of 9.35%. However, the price faced rejection at $52,853, after which the price traded sideways for the next twelve days. As the market volatility grew, the BTC price jumped 27% within the next two days.\n\nAfter displaying a neutral trend for five days, the BTC token jumped 11.33%, recording a new ATH. Following this, the bulls lost momentum and recorded a correction of over 10%. The bulls quickly regained momentum, resulting in a bounce back in the chart.\n\nTradingView: BTC/USDT\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a constant flatline in the chart, indicating a neutral trend for the coin in the crypto market. Further, the averages show a similar trend, indicating an uncertainty in future price action.\n\nIf the bulls hold the price above the support level of $68,296, the price will continue to gain momentum and attempt to test its upper level of $72,000 during the coming week. However, a negative trend reversal may pull the price toward its support level of $64,287.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nThe Ethereum price displayed a neutral trend for a while, after which the market gained momentum and the ETH token recorded a jump of over 8% in value. After trading sideways for a while, the bulls regained momentum and the price jumped 22.5% over the next five days.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded sideways for the next few days. After testing its low of $3,176, the ETH price regained momentum and recorded a jump of over 24% and since then the price has been trading in a closed range.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a rising red histogram, indicating an increase in the selling pressure in the market. Moreover, the averages show a bearish convergence, suggesting the price may continue losing value in the coming time.\n\nIf the market pushes the ETH price above the resistance level, the bulls will regain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $4,200 in the coming days. Conversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $3,533.\n\nRipple (XRP):\n\nThe XRP price traded in a consolidated range between $0.530 and $0.5626 for a brief period during which the token displayed significant volatility in its price. As the bulls regained momentum, the Ripple price added approximately 25% over the next seven days.\n\nUpon facing rejection at $0.6624, the Ripple token traded under a bearish influence and recorded a correction of 14% in valuation. After testing its low of $0.5626, the XRP price recorded a jump of 11.80%. Since then, it has been attempting to break out of its important resistance level at $0.6290.\n\nTradingView: XRP/USDT\n\nThe MACD shows a neutral trend in the histogram, highlighting a weak buying and selling pressure in the market. However, the averages show a bullish convergence, suggesting a mixed sentiment in the crypto industry.\n\nIf the market holds the XRP price above the support level of $0.6290, the bulls will continue to gain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $0.680 by the coming weekend. Negatively, a bearish trend may pull the price toward its lower support level of $0.583."
