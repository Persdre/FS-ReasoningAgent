        "content": "Some Ethereum layer 2 networks have seen their median transaction fees decline by as much as 99% after the Dencun upgrade went live. These are some of the biggest winners.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade\n\nThe much anticipated Dencun upgrade has led to a significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum layer 2 networks, with the effects of the immediate scalability already taking shape across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live early on Wednesday after it activated on the Ethereum mainnet at epoch height 269568. The upgrade introduced the highly anticipated proto-danksharding functionality via EIP-4844, which integrates off-chain \u201cdata-blobs\u201d that decrease the costs associated with storing transaction data.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks, which are designed to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing transactions on the underlying blockchain, were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade. Data from a Dune dashboard created by \u201c@Marcov\u201d shows that popular layer 2 networks such as Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Zora and zksync have seen massive declines in their average transaction fees.\n\nAt the time of writing, median transaction fees had dropped to $0.05 on Optimism, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. So far, Optimism and chains based on Optimism\u2019s tech stack such as Base, have seen the biggest reductions in fees.\n\nWe love to see it. OP Chains have the most affordable decentralized L2 transaction fees after 4844, bringing us that much closer to the reality of seamless end-user experiences. \u2728In Blobs We Trust\u2728 pic.twitter.com/WOovhcZelk \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 14, 2024\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nStarknet, another Ethereum Layer 2 solution, posted a screenshot of the change in its transaction fees on X showing that a single gas transaction had declined 99% since the Dencun upgrade synchronized.\n\n\u201cDencun is both the most complex fork we\u2019ve shipped since the Merge, and tied for \u2018most total EIPs in a fork\u2019 with Byzantium. There were more teams than ever involved in the process, and it somehow all worked out smoothly,\u201d said the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Tim Beiko on X."

Once Ethereum sweeps support at $3,600, the altcoin could make its way back to the range high at $4,093.92.\n\nThere is a bearish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 1-day chart, and there are red bars on the Awesome Oscillator (AO). The technical indicators signal Ethereum is likely at the risk of decline, facing a potential correction.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf Ethereum price fails to bounce off the $3,600 level, the altcoin could drop to support at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap at $3,522.

        "title": "Blobs, MSTR and more: This is Ethereum\u2019s broadband moment - Blockworks",
        "content": "The internet turned 35 earlier this week, and it seems only fitting that Ethereum would undergo arguably its largest upgrade ever just one day later.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork went off mostly without a hitch on Wednesday. Its arrival delivered a bevy of nine improvement proposals, with the blob-centric EIP-4844 being by far the most memeable.\n\nFor more than a decade after Tim Bernes-Lee (himself a dabbler in NFTs) first conceived the World Wide Web, internet users languished inside a slow, cumbersome internet plagued by bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\nDial-up modems could only handle up to about 50 kilobytes per second. The platforms we now take for granted \u2014 YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and TikTok \u2014 were as unfeasible back then as high-frequency trading on many layer-1 DEXs are today.\n\nThe arrival of broadband in the early 2000s immediately 10x\u2019d consumer-grade internet to 512 kb/sec. Impossible ideas could now be realized into billion-dollar dot-com powerhouses, radically overhauling the dynamics of our culture and turning us all terminally online.\n\nNow, two decades later, TV is all but dead, replaced by a gamut of streaming services. AR headsets backed by hyper-fast wireless blend our physical worlds with the same digital space that Bernes-Lee laid out in his 1989 paper outlining the web.\n\nWhat broadband did for the internet, blobs are now doing for Ethereum.\n\nBlobs give the raft of layer-2s their own space through which to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet without clogging up the blockspace intended for other users.\n\nThey have their own fee market, which means regular folk and their protocols of choice won\u2019t have to compete with rollups and sidechains for blockspace \u2014 leading to lower fees for all involved.\n\nDencun and its blobs have already massively reduced fees for the layer-2s that have adopted the new rules. For example, Optimism and Base fees are down to a fraction of an American penny per transaction compared to nearly $1 before the fork.\n\nYouTube debuted in 2005, a half-decade after the rollout of the first consumer-grade broadband services. Justin.tv, the precursor to Twitch, came two years later.\n\nIt could be that layer-2 fees rise over time as more layer-2s compete for blobspace. The true impact of Ethereum\u2019s successful push toward a cohesive and holistic multi-chain ecosystem, powered by \u201cblobband,\u201d probably won\u2019t be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the groundwork has now been laid. Welcome to Ethereum\u2019s blobband era.\n\n\u2014 David Canellis\n\nData Digest\n\n\ud83d\ude43 Solana has flipped Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum for total value locked (TVL) to become the fourth largest DeFi ecosystem \u2014 a first since November 2021.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a A quarter of a billion dollars was liquidated on centralized exchanges over the past 24 hours, 60% longs.\n\n\ud83e\udd2a Memecoin mania puts Solana number-one for DEX volume over the past day \u2014 $1.45 billion to BSC\u2019s $1.14 billion\n\n\ud83d\ude34 All quiet on the crypto front as BTC hovers around $73,000 as ETH sits just below $4,000.\n\n\u270bNo budge in the benchmarks: S&P and the Dow were flat during the pre-market trade. That\u2019s no surprise, considering the VIX\u2019s drop to 14 from its long-term average of 20.\n\n\u2705 Good news: A bull market with a high VIX tends to spell \u201cbubble trouble\u201d \u2014 so lower volatility with higher prices may be a boon for traders.\n\nIs the SEC in the crypto market\u2019s rear-view mirror?\n\nThe crypto pump is upon us.\n\nSOL is up 18% this week and almost 50% over the month. Binance\u2019s BNB and Filecoin are each up more than 80% over the past 30 days. Wormhole\u2019s Portal Bridge has facilitated more than $113 million in transfers from Ethereum to alt chains like Solana, Sui, and Arbitrum over the past week.\n\nHas the market forgotten that in the eyes of the SEC, they are all securities? Probably. Or maybe traders are just confident that Coinbase and Binance will emerge victorious in their legal battles with the regulator.\n\nIn June 2023, the SEC filed back-to-back lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities, among other things. The regulator named 13 cryptocurrencies available on Coinbase and ten that trade on Binance securities \u2014 despite none of these issuers being named co-defendants in the cases.\n\nThe SEC has also not filed any individual lawsuits against these alleged security token issuers, opting to take a different approach than it did in 2020 when it sued Ripple over its XRP token \u2014 a suit that ultimately did not play out in the regulator\u2019s favor.\n\nBoth cases are still playing out in the legal system, and you might remember the SEC was notably absent from the Department of Justice\u2019s historic $4.3 billion settlement with Binance back in November.\n\nBut if you look at token prices, you\u2019d think the SEC had dropped the cases.\n\nCoinbase and Binance are both waiting for rulings in their motions to dismiss their respective cases. If the suits are not fully dismissed, the exchanges will move on to the discovery process.\n\n\u2014 Casey Wagner\n\nCan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop?\n\nAfter offering an oversubscribed round where MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised nearly $800 million in senior convertible notes \u2014 mind you, they initially sought to raise $600 million before upsizing to $700 million last week \u2014 the company has proposed another $500 million in convertible notes.\n\nMSTR could, all-in-all, raise around $1.3 billion from its convertible notes offerings to fund its bitcoin purchases.\n\nWhile this represents a new approach to the same tactic we\u2019ve seen from MSTR in the past, Michael Saylor\u2019s firm might have found a way to ensure that the stock remains more attractive than the bevy of bitcoin ETFs on the market today.\n\nBy the numbers: MSTR has about $48 million in cash on hand as of December, but it has roughly $15 billion worth of bitcoin at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to note that while the company may spend that cash on hand, MicroStrategy appears to largely plan to add to its BTC hoard. The stock was around before the bitcoin ETFs, and so far, it looks like it won\u2019t only stick around, but may even outperform.\n\nCompare IBIT and MSTR, for example. MSTR is outperforming BlackRock\u2019s ETF even as the two go head-to-head over who holds the most bitcoin.\n\nMSTR\u2019s bitcoin buying spree has proven to be a win-win for them: Wall Street\u2019s happy and, more importantly, the crypto crowd goes bonkers when the company announces a new buy. And, trust me, the company is always announcing new buys. This year alone, MSTR has bought nearly 16,000 bitcoin.\n\nAdding to that, when bitcoin\u2019s price rockets, so does the company\u2019s stock. The company, at the end of 2023, was trading around $680. Now, the stock is getting close to $2,000 \u2014 up 200% in the last three months alone.\n\nSuffice to say, Saylor and MSTR keep hodling. The company isn\u2019t afraid to hit the buy button \u2014 even if it means raising some debt to do so \u2014 and the most recent debt offerings show that the company\u2019s appetite remains ravenous.\n\n\u2014 Katherine Ross\n\nThe Works\n\nWelcome to The Works \ud83d\udc4b Your daily slice of crypto (and not-so-crypto) from around the Web. \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Bakkt against the wall?
