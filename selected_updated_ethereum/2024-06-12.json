        "content": "It\u2019s too early to say, but we might look back at this moment when Ethereum establishes itself as the \u201cAmazon\u201d of the digital asset economy. If scenario unfolds (still a big \u201cif\u201d), it might relegate other smart contract layer 1s to niche players (like \u201cEtsys\u201d), even if still supporting thriving communities. It\u2019s unclear (to me at least), whether this is the best path for the industry; perhaps a more balanced multi-chain world would ultimately maximize adoption \u2013 we may never know. But at this stage, Ethereum dominance sure looks like the most likely outcome."

        "content": "Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December\n\nAs the upcoming elections draw closer, former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in various sectors, including cryptocurrency, could play a significant role. Many are wondering if Trump is a big crypto investor himself as recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump reached a quick $33 million high last week. According to Arkham, he currently holds 475.6 ETH, worth $1.73 million.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn December 2023, Trump sent over 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.3 million. However, ETH has since performed well, and Trump may regret selling too soon.\n\nIf Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth around $3.9 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,600 today. If he held and sold now instead, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.\n\nWith many investment management firms aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s continued market share growth and its leading status among smart contract platforms could propel its value to a $2.2 trillion market cap, or approximately $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nWhile Trump might regret his sale, the ETH was free. He acquired the tokens through an NFT project that utilized his name, image, and likeness, granting Trump royalties through his licensing deals.\n\nThe Trump Digital Trading Cards project was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. Currently, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time).\n\nHowever, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump released another project in late 2023, coined the \"Mugshot Edition,\" a nod to his legal troubles. It offered personalized rewards, with those who bought at least 47 Trump cards getting to have dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago and receiving a piece of the suit Trump wore for his mugshot when he was arrested in August.\n\nAs Trump continues to earn royalties and performs well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he manages his ETH position going into the presidential election in November. Mark Cuban said earlier this week on X, that crypto could be a big factor in tipping the scale in favor of Trump this November.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.
