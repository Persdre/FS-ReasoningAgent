        "content": "Sat 06 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nThe battle of Layer 2 solutions is raging among Ethereum, Binance, and Coinbase. But is it mere vanity or a lifeline for Layer 1 blockchains suffering from congestion problems? According to VanEck analysts, containing the rise of L2 networks will be challenging. By 2030, the market capitalization of similar mechanisms deployed on Ethereum could explode to reach 1 trillion dollars.\n\nEthereum L2: Prediction of Colossal Capitalization\n\nThere is currently a rush toward Layer 2 solutions such as Base (Coinbase), Arbitrium One, OP Mainnet, and many others. The reason? Their remarkable scalability, which constitutes a major asset as a blockchain infrastructure.\n\nVanEck analysts forecast a spectacular rise of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks, reaching a market capitalization of 1 trillion dollars by 2030, reports CoinSpeaker.\n\nThe report, authored by Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel, highlights the challenges of Ethereum in terms of data processing. Despite its dominance in smart contracts, its scalability limitations remain a hindrance.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is striving to improve its Layer 2 transaction processing capabilities, as demonstrated by the recent Denizen upgrade.\n\nThe bold prediction of VanEck is based on the belief that L2 networks are ready to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses and meet the growing needs of an expanding ecosystem.\n\nWith rising transaction fees and prolonged processing times on Ethereum (ETH), the adoption of L2 networks seems like an inevitable solution for the future of blockchain.\n\nThe New Titans of Blockchain\n\nIn a striking report, VanEck analysts predict a future where Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 networks will surpass the base network in terms of revenue. According to Bush and Sigel, this rise is inevitable in the face of Ethereum\u2019s inability to compete in terms of transactions and user experience.\n\nThis futuristic blockchain landscape, depicted by VanEck, reveals a dynamic ecosystem comprised of thousands of specialized L2 networks, promising to redefine industries and open new horizons. From decentralized social media platforms to specialized financial applications, the possibilities for innovation seem limitless.\n\nDiscover our newsletter This link uses an affiliate program.\n\nHowever, enthusiasm must be tempered, warn analysts. Despite the opportunities offered by L2 tokens, the competition is fierce. The top seven Ethereum Layer 2 tokens already display a valuation of 40 billion dollars, which raises the possibility of market saturation.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "\u2018Ethereum ETFs will pull in more assets if they launch in December\u2019 \u2013 Why? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Odds of Ethereum ETF approval fall on the back of SEC\u2019s latest updates\n\nMatt Hougan believes Ethereum ETFs should be launched in December for optimal asset attraction\n\nThe probability of Ethereum [ETH] Spot ETFs being approved has fallen, primarily because of the absence of updates in the public filings and limited engagement with the SEC. While there\u2019s still a chance before May, the likelihood is falling as there\u2019s been no evident progress in the approval process.\n\nHowever, many in the industry remain optimistic about an eventual approval, citing parallels with the Bitcoin ETF. Echoing similar sentiments, Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, in conversation with Bankless, noted,\n\n\u201cMy view is that ultimately we will get an ethereum ETF. I think it\u2019s probably the best shot on goal that the ETH world has had for a Bitcoin ETF was the new Fidelity update so I think we\u2019ll eventually get it.\u201d\n\nETFs timing dynamics\n\nHougan further highlighted that cryptocurrency ETF approval follows a 240-day review cycle, typically concluding in May \u2013 A crucial juncture for SEC decisions. He added,\n\n\u201cI think Ethereum ETFs will pull in more assets if they launch in December than if they launch in May.\u201d\n\nThis idea stems from institutions still adjusting to the Bitcoin ETF launch. Therefore, launching towards the end of the year is seen as more practical, potentially leading to more assets being gathered.\n\nNow, some execs have been comparing a potential Ethereum Spot ETF to just an opening act. In fact, they believe that an underwhelming Ethereum Futures performance is a negative indicator.\n\nContrary to the sentiment, however, Hougan said,\n\n\u201cEthereum ETFs will be way more successful than the Ethereum Futures\u201d.\n\nLooming concerns surrounding Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite not generating the same level of initial excitement as Bitcoin, the exec remains optimistic about the potential success of Ethereum ETFs. He foresees these ETFs attracting billions of dollars in their inaugural year, although their growth trajectory is expected to be slower compared to that of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll be very successful and you\u2019ll have BlackRock and you\u2019ll have Bitwise and you have others talking about Ethereum and real-world use cases.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be broadly additive for the space, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be $50 billion in year one, it\u2019ll be billions. It\u2019ll be a success.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ryan Rasmussen, CEO of Bitwise, as Ethereum gains mainstream recognition and understanding, demand for Ethereum ETFs will grow, driven by the desire to capitalize on its transformative potential.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing inquiry into Ethereum\u2019s security classification and its decision on 23 May could significantly impact Ether ETF applications and Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory."

        "content": "On the weekly timeframe, Layer 2 tokens have printed nearly double-digit losses for holders. It remains to be seen whether the demand from users can aid recovery in L2 tokens in the coming week.\n\nThe radical increase in number of transactions despite rising competition from Solana and alternative chains marks a significant development in the Layer 2 ecosystem. As on April 6, Layer 2 tokens Polygon (MATIC), Stacks (STX), Mantle (MNT), ARB, ImmutableX (IMX), Starknet (STRK) piled on between 1% and 8% gains on Saturday.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows an increase in activity on the Layer 2 chains, as users respond to the declining transaction costs. This was anticipated as a result of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nWhile Solana is making headlines for failed transactions and rising DEX activity and meme coin narrative, Ethereum Layer 2 chains are seeing a consistent growth in activity. The Dencun upgrade resulted in a significant decrease in transaction cost on Layer 2 chains like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and Base (BASE).\n\nEthereum Layer 2 gas costs plummeted in response to the Dencun upgrade. Data from intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock show that the Dencun upgrade has reduced the transaction cost of Layer 2 chains and promoted an increase in on-chain activity on these protocols.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
