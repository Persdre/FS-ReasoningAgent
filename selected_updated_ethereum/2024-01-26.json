        "title": "Analyst projects Ethereum potentially to $2k amid market consolidation - crypto.news",
        "content": "FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevicha projects Ethereum\u2019s price could further dip towards $2,000, as the altcoin is down by over 8% weekly.\n\nThe crypto market is experiencing a period of subdued volatility, with the total market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion for the third consecutive day. Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years."

        "content": "Ethereum now stands at the center of volatility risks as the defunct crypto lender Celsius prepares over $1 billion worth of Ether tokens for liquidation.\n\nOn-chain analytics resource Spot On Chain and numerous crypto pundits have highlighted Celsius\u2019 Ethereum transactions. The bankrupt lender\u2019s most recent withdrawal frenzy saw it transfer 459,561 ETH to three exchanges.\n\nSpecifically, these transactions occurred within the last 24 hours, wielding a market value of $1,030,501,203, considering an average price of $2,242 for Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBreakdown of Celsius ETH Transfers\n\nOn-chain data indicates that the largest chunk of the transferred ETH went to Coinbase\u2019s institutional platform, Coinbase Prime. In particular, the platform took a store of 305,254 ETH tokens from Celsius, valued at over $674 million.\n\nSimilarly, Celsius transferred nearly 150k Ethereum worth $324 million to Paxos, a blockchain firm. Other recent dealings include $17 million in ETH moved to the crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX.\n\nThis is not the first time Celsius is moving assets to crypto exchanges. Three days ago, Spot On Chain disclosed that Celsius redirected $36 million to Coinbase and FalconX.\n\nFurthermore, the on-chain tracker observed that Celsius\u2019 withdrawal frenzy first peaked in November 2023 amid a cashout of $621 million Ethereum.\n\nThe recent $1.03 billion transfer brings the total amount moved by the embattled crypto lender to over $1.69 billion worth of ETH within the last three months. As of now, Celsius still retains 62,469 ETH worth $140 million in the address under scrutiny.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCommunity Reacts\n\nCrypto market participants have voiced apprehension about the potential implication of the persistent ETH transactions with exchanges.\n\nFor instance, X influencer MartyParty raised concern that Celsius might disrupt the gradual recovery in the ETH market as the past few weeks have been bloodbaths.\n\nAt press time, ETH sells for $ $2,242, marking a decline of over 10% since last week. During this period, the asset plummeted from a peak of $2,487 to a low of $2,180."

Some token creators have tried to capitalize on the attention around U.S. elections and have created tokens around the same.\n\nShitcoin Update: $BIDEN2024 and $TRUMP2024 on Ethereum are gaining marketcap. Is this the true election? Trending #8 and #11 on @dexscreener. ?https://t.co/8AO3d7z78ehttps://t.co/WXqV4WTt0Z pic.twitter.com/2ntHQHdHBf \u2014 MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 24, 2024\n\nNew tokens have arrived\n\nThe tokens BIDEN2024 and TRUMP2024 are two of the most popular tokens that have been created in this context. The TRUMP2024 token grew by 751% over the last month and was trading at $0.00000000451 at the time of writing.\n\nThe volume at which it was trading grew by 26.69% in the last 24 hours and was currently at 3.69 million.\n\nComing to the BIDEN2024 token, it grew by 694.25% last week and saw a gigantic surge of 1796.25% in volume. At press time it was trading at $0.00000000431 and its volume was $2.41 million.\n\nAs the presidential election inches near, the probability of these tokens seeing more growth is very high. However, after the event, the prices of the token may collapse.\n\nMemecoins are very susceptible to rug pulls and holders should be careful around these tokens. Holders and traders should hedge their bets if they decide to invest in these tokens.\n\nL1 networks gain\n\nEven though some holders may gain or lose out on money eventually, Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH] might see positive returns regardless.\n\nThe hype around these tokens on both Solana and Ethereum may add to an uptick in activity on both of these networks. The networks saw a massive surge in activity over the last few months as well.\n\nAccording to Artemis\u2019 data, the number of daily active addresses on Solana increased from 214,000 to 624,000 in the last 3 months.\n\nSolana was lagging behind Ethereum in this regard earlier, however, at press time, Solana had outperformed Ethereum by a large margin. At press time, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network amounted to 357,000.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn terms of transaction activity, a similar trend was observed. Solana completely left Ethereum in the dust in terms of transactions.\n\nAt the time of writing, daily transactions on the Solana network were 27.8 million.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe presale stage is often the best time to invest in new crypto projects before hype drives up the price. Right now, investors are researching Kelexo (KLXO) presale as supporters shift funds from major assets.\n\nEnthusiasts of Kelexo (KLXO) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nPotential supporters are watching KLXO\n\nKelexo (KLXO) is revolutionizing the peer-to-peer lending space by eliminating intermediaries and bureaucratic processes. Users can instantly lend or borrow funds in crypto with just a simple setup and without extensive KYC checks or long wait times.\n\nThis straightforward, decentralized model powered by blockchain technology provides significant advantages over traditional lending methods. Borrowers and lenders can connect directly, which removes the expensive overhead costs of intermediaries. Transactions in this marketplace close in seconds instead of days like at banks. Also, there are no minimum loan amounts or durations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy removing these pain points, Kelexo (KLXO) offers users a more efficient way to access lending markets. The minimal identification requirements also enable participation from a wider audience, including those with limited credit history who may not qualify through conventional channels.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) also incentivizes user participation and decentralized governance through its Kelexo (KLXO) token. Token holders can submit platform enhancement proposals and vote on key decisions. An inbuilt rewards program further drives engagement.\n\nWith cutting-edge cryptography guaranteeing security, minimal barriers to access and community ownership, Kelexo (KLXO) represents the future of decentralized finance. It efficiently uses blockchain's capabilities to create a better borrowing and lending experience for all.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) is currently in stage 1 of its presale , priced at just $0.022. The presale supply is 264,000,000 out of a total supply of 440,000,000 and the presale price increases as each stage sells out.\n\nMajor players have started taking notice\n\nIt is important to state that whales and institutional traders have taken notice of the hype surrounding Kelexo (KLXO) (KLXO). Significant volume has shifted on-chain from blue chip cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance coin (BNB) into Kelexo (KLXO) as presale snipers load up their bags.\n\nThese big players help drive momentum and they\u2019re likely expecting Kelexo (KLXO) to follow previous altcoins that did 100x or more out of the gate after presale.\n\nWith only 57% of the total supply available during the presale, scarcity of Kelexo (KLXO) tokens could drive fear of missing out (FOMO), which could lead to price surges post-listing.\n\nConsidering its strong real-world utility and advantage over existing lending platforms, Kelexo (KLXO) checks all the boxes for a breakout success story.\n\nMany believe getting in during presale could be like investing in Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) during their early days in terms of upside potential.\n\nAnalysts advise not to miss out on this presale as it could be an opportunity to invest in the top 100 coins of the bull market, an opportunity that is quickly disappearing the longer you delay.\n\nAs most experienced market movers know, investing in solid projects early is where huge gains are often made."
