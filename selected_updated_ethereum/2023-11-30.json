        "title": "SEC Acknowledges Ethereum ETF Filing by Fidelity - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "SEC is evaluating a proposed Ethereum ETF from the $4.5 trillion money manager.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged receipt of an application by asset management giant Fidelity to list a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to today\u2019s SEC filing.\n\nThe filing from Cboe BZX Exchange proposes listing and trading shares of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, structured as a commodity-based trust that would hold ether. The trust aims to track the performance of the Fidelity Ethereum Index, less expenses and liabilities.\n\nHas been long known that Fidelity entered the spot ETF race but this filing *essentially* starts the ~240+ day clock for their spot #Ethereum ETF. Just another step in the process. Will have definitive deadline dates in the coming weeks https://t.co/0C6NKcxNNz pic.twitter.com/gdW9ZQDgs9 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 30, 2023\n\nThe SEC has several Ethereum ETF applications under review that it must approve or deny, including filings by major financial firms BlackRock, ARK Invest, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital Holdings.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets Services would serve as the regulated custodian for the trust\u2019s ETH holdings. The filing argues that the CME Ether futures market is of significant size for surveillance-sharing purposes to meet SEC listing standards that aim to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe SEC has yet to approve a spot Bitcoin or ETH ETF in the US. However, the agency is reportedly preparing to allow simultaneous listings of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in January. The Fidelity filing aims to make the case that an ether spot ETF should also receive approval.\n\nThe proposal starts a 45-day clock for the SEC to approve, deny, or extend the deadline. The SEC is now seeking public comments on the proposed rule change to list the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF.\n\nETH is trading flat -0.1% over the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko."

        "title": "SEC opens comment period for Fidelity\u2019s proposed Ethereum ETF - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary crypto trader and investor Raoul Pal has waded into the supremacy debate between the two prominent proof-of-stake (PoS) Layer-1 networks Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). According to Pal, the use of Solana comes with a whole different feel that makes it a top contender as a relatively more user-friendly option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said once someone starts using Solana, it \"feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to pull off a major comeback in its price action post-FTX implosion.\n\nOnce you play around in the $SOL ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\n\n\n\nThe best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android.\n\n\n\nBoth win. Huge. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 29, 2023\n\nRaoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.\n\nSolana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems\n\nAlmost everything Ethereum can do, Solana can do as well. It appears that Raoul Pal has broad use of some of Solana's applications, as he attested to the ingenious designs of Phantom Wallet, the most popular unhosted Solana wallet. This he confirmed when an X user asked to know what his feedback is for Phantom Wallet and in his response, he said:\n\nAbsolutely love it. Super easy.\n\nSolana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal confirming he has been bullish all year. The coin soared to its 2023 high earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors."

        "title": "Ethereum Supply is Deflationary, Here Are the Two Main Reasons - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 30 Nov 2023 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Fitah\n\nA major transformation is shaking up Ethereum: validators are leaving the ship, slowing the issuance of new tokens. Coupled with a rise in network activity, this is making the global supply of the cryptocurrency ETH deflationary. Let\u2019s decrypt it!\n\n\u201cExodus\u201d of Validators on Ethereum\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum cryptocurrency is stalled around $2000, a significant change is taking place on the network. Indeed, the supply of ETH is undergoing a major shift, becoming deflationary once again.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThis deflation results from two key factors. First, there is the slowdown in the number of validators in the staking pools. Then, there is the increase in daily Ethereum cryptocurrency fees burned via EIP1559, fueled by an intensification of network activity\n\nThe growing number of validators leaving the pool since October indeed slows down the growth of the network. This leads to a decrease in the issuance of new ETH crypto tokens. According to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the number of participant exits has seen a notable increase. This has gone from an average of 309 per day in October to an impressive average of 1018 validators per day since early November. This trend aligns with the recent rise in crypto prices.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThe massive exits of participants, mostly voluntary, are particularly concentrated among the CEXs such as Kraken and Coinbase. A modest increase in exits at the liquid staking provider, Lido, is also highlighted.\n\nIncreased Activity and Pressure on ETH\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the network is also experiencing a significant increase in transaction demand, particularly for token transfers and stablecoins. This increased pressure on the network leads to a rise in gas fees, generating a notable growth in Ethereum fees burned via EIP 1559.\n\nGlassnode\n\nIn October, the daily amount of Ethereum burned reached 899 ETH, a figure that has climbed to 5,368 ETH in less than a month. These figures reflect a spike in activity, pushing Ethereum to new heights of demand and transactions.\n\nThis double pressure translates into a critical situation: ETH is once again becoming a deflationary resource. The reduction in the number of validators leads to a slowdown in the issuance of ETH. While the explosion in network activity exerts upward pressure on gas fees.\n\nThe combined effect of these two factors shows that Ethereum is responding to market changes. This creates a situation where the supply of ETH is once again shrinking, moving towards deflation.\n\nHow will this new dynamic influence the choices of investors in the weeks to come?\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
