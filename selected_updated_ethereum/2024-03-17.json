        "content": "Ethereum broke its lower timeframe bullish structure.\n\nThe liquidation levels heatmap outlined two support zones.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a sizeable pullback over the past few days after its steady bullish march over the past month. The $4.1k level was almost reached before the bulls were forced to retreat. Investors need not worry about this dent in prices too much.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] also faltered just above the $73k level and dragged the rest of the market down. While the rally is expected to continue higher in the long run, further losses are anticipated over the next few weeks.\n\nTraders need to be prepared for a fall below $3500\n\nThe 12-hour chart showed that the bullish bias remained intact based on the price action. Yet on the 4-hour timeframe and lower the structure has flipped bearishly. Even the 12-hour RSI fell below the neutral 50 mark to reflect bearish momentum was rising.\n\nThe recent pullback is not a flush of the overleveraged bulls as we saw on the 5th of March. The rally saw its momentum stutter after the 12th of this month, followed by an increase in selling pressure.\n\nThe OBV began to drop lower to support this idea. The Fibonacci retracement levels (pale yellow) highlighted that the 61.8%-78.6% region at $3100-$3315 would likely be retested as support. The $3463 level could also halt the bearish progress.\n\nLong-term investors need to brace for further losses\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the liquidation levels heatmap showed that ETH would likely post more losses. The $3560 level was estimated to trigger $2.6 billion worth of liquidations.\n\nThese large liquidation levels were concentrated in the $3520-$3560 region, marking it as a support zone. Ethereum could see a bullish reaction from here.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nBelow the $3520 level, the next large liquidation levels sat at $3300 and $3130. The former was estimated to have $2.2 billion in liquidations, and the latter to have $5.4 billion.\n\nIt also had confluence with the 78.6% retracement level at $3102.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "New demand for Ethereum now sits at a year-to-date high.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors, however, witnessed declines in the past week.\n\nThe daily count of new addresses on Ethereum [ETH] assessed on a seven-day moving average reached a year-to-date (YTD) high of 116,000 on 14th March, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nThis marked a 35% increase from the 86,000 unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction of the native coin in the network on 1st January.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rally in new demand to a YTD high came amidst a surge in its on-chain volume. AMBCrypto found that transaction volume on the network, also assessed using a seven-day moving average, attained a YTD high of $7 billion on 11th March.\n\nAs transaction volume rallied, the average fee paid per transaction on the network also climbed. According to The Block\u2019s data, this reached a YTD high of $25 on 11th March.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT sector fails to react\n\nDespite the recent uptick in demand for the Ethereum network, its decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token ecosystems have witnessed declines.\n\nFor example, the total value of assets locked (TVL) across the DeFi protocols housed within the chain declined by 5% in the last week. Per DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $53.4 billion.\n\nOut of the top 10 DeFi protocols on Ethereum, only one (ether.Fi) recorded a TVL hike in the past seven days. The rest of them witnessed a decline.\n\nThe network\u2019s NFT sector recorded a 21% decrease in sales volume in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, despite the 90% uptick in the number of traders trading NFTs on the network during that period, the transaction count fell by 2%.\n\nIn the last seven days, 166,000 NFT transactions worth $130 million were completed on the Ethereum network.\n\nLook before you leap\n\nThe network\u2019s native coin ETH sold for $3,721 at press time. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value dropped by 6% in the last week. The decline followed a sharp fall in Bitcoin\u2019s value on 14th March, when its value was below $68,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that its Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator has posted red upward-facing histogram bars since 11th March.\n\nAn asset\u2019s AO measures market trends and changes in momentum. When it displays red upward-facing bars, it suggests increasing negative momentum in the market. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or entering short positions."
