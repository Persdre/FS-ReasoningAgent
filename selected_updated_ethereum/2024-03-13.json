        "title": "Dencun Upgrade Goes Live, Ushering in New Era for Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade went live Wednesday morning without a hitch, ushering in a new chapter for the blockchain that is poised to substantially lower transaction costs across Ethereum layer-2 networks and massively expand the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\nJust before 10 a.m. EST, the Dencun upgrade was successfully implemented. It will now take a period of about a month or two for settlement contracts across all layer-2 networks to incorporate the update. Once they do, gas fees on layer-2 networks should immediately fall by 75%, Terence Tsao, a developer of Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, previously told Decrypt.\n\nScreenshot of Ethereum Foundation YouTube livestream\n\nLeading up to the hard fork, Ethereum developers held a livestream on YouTube to discuss the different Ethereum Improvement Proposals that would be rolling out as Dencun went live and explain some of the new terminology, like blobs\u2014which are a new way to organize and send data on the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the upgrade went live, ASCII art of a blob appeared on the screen.\n\nEthereum has undergone multiple flashy upgrades in recent years, including the 2022 merge, which transitioned the network to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model, and 2023\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked tens of billions of dollars worth of ETH staked with the network for withdrawal. But several developers who help build Ethereum believe that Dencun is poised to change the network to a degree never before seen.\n\n\u201cI think that this upgrade will have the biggest effect for users of all the Ethereum upgrades yet,\u201d Marius Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. \u201cDencun is a much bigger update than Shanghai.\u201d\n\nNot only will Dencun drastically cut transaction costs on layer-2 networks; it will also, by doing so, redefine the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s capacity to process massive swathes of transactions, and thus lower barriers significantly for moving projects, transactions, and data on-chain.\n\nDavid Silverman, VP of Product at Polygon Labs, previously analogized to Decrypt that Dencun will single-handedly expand Ethereum from a country backroad into a four-lane highway, in terms of the efficiency and ease with which the ecosystem will soon be able to process unprecedented amounts of on-chain traffic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas costs might drop so low following Dencun that they will be covered by crypto companies and projects going forward\u2014essentially making such fees a thing of the past, Silverman added.\n\nSuch an unprecedented shift in the economics of Ethereum would come at a time when gas fees on the network's mainnet have recently spiked to near-unusable highs. That fact isn't lost on Dencun's developers.\n\n\"We are focused on scaling and reducing fees in L2 at a time when Ethereum's usage is reaching high volumes again and gas fees are a noticeable cost to most users,\" Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon told Decrypt.\n\nKey to Dencun's near-elimination of gas fees is proto-danksharding, a novel method for data storage on Ethereum introduced by Dencun. Proto-danksharding, which utilizes features called \u201cblobs,\u201d will allow layer-2 data to be stored on-chain temporarily for a period of about a month. Until now, data could only be stored on Ethereum forever, an immensely expensive option that greatly limited what data was uploaded on-chain.\n\nDevelopers hope that Dencun will usher in a new chapter for Ethereum, one in which there are essentially no limits\u2014related to cost, storage, or anything else\u2014on the amount of data that can exist on-chain. Such a landscape could revolutionize the types of projects and tools built across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI hope Dencun will unlock new use cases that were not possible before,\u201d Ethereum\u2019s Van Der Wijden said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building this for short-term unsustainable gains, but for long-term sustainable growth.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Completes Milestone Dencun Upgrade, Which Should Substantially Reduce Fees - Unchained",
        "content": "Layer 2 blockchain networks can now use a different way to store data, which is intended to help these rollups scale the Ethereum blockchain network that was plagued by huge spikes in gas fees in years prior.\n\nEthereum has completed a significant upgrade of its blockchain network, which is expected to pave the way for the next generation of crypto users to transact onchain without suffering significant spikes in gas fees.\n\nThe upgrade, named \u201cDencun,\u201d was completed early morning Wednesday ET after it was activated on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at epoch height of 269568, according to Ethereum developers in a live stream on YouTube. At one point, more than 3,600 people were watching the official rollout of Dencun on the livestream.\n\n\u201cWe basically enter this new era of Ethereum scalability,\u201d said Anthony Sassano, the creator of Ethereum-focused media site The Daily Gwei, referring to how Dencun implements EIP-4844 and \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which creates a highly optimized and much cheaper storage space where rollups can post data to called \u201cblobspace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first step on a long journey that has been going on for a few years now towards what we [Ethereum contributors] call full danksharding, which will greatly increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability properties specifically for layer 2s,\u201d Sassano added.\n\nRead more: How Much Will the Dencun Upgrade Really Reduce Ethereum Layer 2 Fees By?\n\nDencun is Ethereum\u2019s most substantial software change since Shapella, which occurred about 10 months ago. Before the hard fork upgrade, rollups had to store information such as transaction history in calldata, which is \u201creally expensive, because Ethereum calldata has to be stored forever,\u201d said Polygon\u2019s vice president of product, David Silverman, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nAfter the upgrade, when rollups post data to this new blobspace in the form of \u201cblobs,\u201d the information isn\u2019t stored forever and so it\u2019s much cheaper, while still providing similar security guarantees. Consequently, \u201crollups can generally pass those cost [savings] on along to their users,\u201d lowering transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks, Silverman added.\n\nThis impact could occur immediately or more gradually over time. The various L2s will go through their respective governance processes to change the target of where they\u2019re posting data from either calldata to blobspace or possibly a mix of the two. This means some networks may see changes immediately on day one, while others may take as long as a month-and-a-half, depending on when their governance votes are held and how easy it is for a rollup to integrate the upgrade, noted Silverman.\n\nFor example, the team for the layer 2 blockchain network Base, which was incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, said in a blog post that Base will have support for the Dencun upgrade on the first day.\n\nAnother Ethereum rollup, zkSync, is already ready to submit blob transactions, per Daniel Lumi, senior product manager at Matter Labs, the software firm building zkSync, adding that zkSync has a solution for where the protocol decides to post data.\n\nGetting Lucky\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comes as the price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, is trading around $4,000, a level not seen since the end of 2021 before Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers don\u2019t implement upgrades based on market pressure, the Dencun upgrade implementation coinciding with the start of an early bull market and ETH trading around the $4,000 level is \u201clucky,\u201d Silverman noted.\n\nThe DeFi Summer in 2020 ended in part because Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure was not ready to accommodate the mass of new users coming onchain, which became evident when gas prices to execute a token swap on a decentralized exchange soared to hundreds of dollars.\n\nAs a result of Dencun and specifically EIP-4844, which will bring transaction costs down, \u201cwe now have a ton more capacity from all these rollups to handle this next generation of users without gas prices spiking up to $200 [or] $300 per swap, killing our momentum,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cWe got lucky in the sense that we got this [the Dencun upgrade] out of the way before retail is coming back.\u201d"
