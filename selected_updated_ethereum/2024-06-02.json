        "title": "Where crypto angel investors should deploy capital after Ethereum ETF approval - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Tim Haldorsson, CEO of Lunar Strategy.\n\nIn nine short years, Ethereum has gone from pioneering on-chain smart contracts and programmable crypto to becoming the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The recent SEC approval of ETH ETFs is just a single step in this journey, albeit a significant milestone that has solidified Ethereum\u2019s status as a mature asset class worthy of serious investment consideration.\n\nThis op-ed will highlight the most promising sectors within the Ethereum ecosystem that I believe angel investors should watch closely to take advantage of this economic momentum.\n\nLayer 2 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum paved the way for the birth of decentralized on-chain markets, planting the seeds that have blossomed into a global DeFi sector with a market cap of $104.55 billion. DeFi is a complex rabbit hole filled with unique financial mechanisms that are unparalleled in traditional finance. However, they rely on the security, speed, and decentralization offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and zkSync have emerged to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues, reducing usage costs and increasing transaction speeds without sacrificing privacy or security. These improvements make Ethereum\u2019s technology more accessible and perfect for DeFi activities.\n\nIn the DeFi space, projects like lending and borrowing platforms, futures and perpetuals trading platforms, token seeding and launching platforms, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have proven immensely successful. Even in the days when ETH only commanded the attention of a small niche of market participants, these technologies were spun into a myriad of business models that proved a real demand for DeFi solutions on a grand scale. Some of the top DeFi protocols have even grown to multi-billion dollar valuations, underscoring the strength of this sector.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions into a recognized commodity, the potential for further growth in DeFi becomes even more certain, making it a lucrative area for angel investors to deploy capital.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence is one of the most important technologies of our time, comparable to the impact of blockchain technology. The world needs AI technologies that can be trusted and that are free from centralized control.\n\nBlockchain enables secure, private, and decentralized frameworks for AI services, crucial for preventing monopolies on scarce compute resources and for providing broader access to decentralized machine learning networks. By leveraging Ethereum\u2019s blockchain for AI projects, developers are already building AI services that remain secure and decentralized.\n\nThis intersection of AI and blockchain is an attractive playing field for investment, as the demand for decentralized and secure AI solutions continues to rise. AI projects built on Ethereum have already achieved multi-billion dollar market caps, showing discerning observers that it is a powder keg of explosive growth. The recent approval of ETH ETFs might be the spark that ignites the next leg of expansion this sector is primed for.\n\nDecentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)\n\nDePIN is one of the exciting blockchain-dependent sectors that have emerged thanks to the miracle of smart contracts. In a nutshell, it merges physical infrastructure with digital networks of decentralized participants and facilitates the global exchange of limited but in-demand resources like sensors, data storage, or wireless connectivity in return for crypto tokens.\n\nDePINs offer decentralized governance, peer-to-peer infrastructure sharing, tokenization, and enhanced security and privacy for traditional and digital industries.\n\nAs demand for DePINs grows, so will the market for these resources, driving token appreciation and market expansion. Ethereum powers the smart contracts that run these DePINs, making it a crucial component of this ecosystem. With the recent approval of ETH ETFs, more angel investors are likely to turn their attention to DePINs, recognizing their potential for high returns and significant real world impact.\n\nETH Restaking\n\nStaking is a fundamental aspect of securing decentralized networks like Ethereum through economic game theory. Validators, who run the nodes powering the blockchain, are required to stake ETH. If they follow the rules, they earn rewards; if they attempt to cheat, they lose their staked ETH. Currently, over $100 billion worth of ETH is staked\u2014that\u2019s how important this mechanism is to operating blockchain networks.\n\nRestaking takes this concept further by applying the same game theory to secure any protocol on the blockchain. This enables smaller participants to maintain high levels of security through proof-of-stake mechanisms that would otherwise be unattainable. Restaking helps to create a more resilient network for multiple protocols, making it cost-prohibitive to attack any single participant within the larger proof-of-stake pool.\n\nLiquid restaking services further simplify the process for those seeking to stake tokens without managing complex validators. These services issue Liquid Restaking Tokens, which accrue yield and interest from validator rewards and can be traded or restaked to generate additional rewards. This sector\u2019s growth underscores its importance as a security mainstay for blockchains, making it a compelling area for angel investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approval of ETH ETFs has stamped Ethereum as a leading investment vehicle. The Ethereum ecosystem offers many exciting opportunities for angel investors, from Layer 2 DeFi and AI integration, to DePINs and restaking.\n\nIt\u2019s important to study these sectors and understand both their leading narratives and growth catalysts. This way, investors can deploy smart capital while contributing to the growth of Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs May Have Ended the SEC\u2019s War on Crypto - Decrypt",
        "content": "About the Author Carlo D\u2019Angelo is a lawyer, former law professor, and crypto and NFT enthusiast. Carlo\u2019s practice focuses on advising clients in all areas of blockchain technology law. Carlo is also the host of Lex Line, a weekly crypto and blockchain law podcast. The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMay\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the chef\u2019s kiss on what can only be described as a banner month for crypto policy\u2014and the move could severely undermine the SEC\u2019s ongoing crypto crackdown.\n\nAs the deadline to approve the Ethereum ETFs loomed, a bipartisan group of House of Representatives members sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler urging the Commission to not only approve the funds, but to also consider approval of \u201cother\u201d digital asset ETFs in the future. And finally, the SEC finally went public late on that fateful Thursday and announced approval of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nAccording to Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, the SEC\u2019s approval of spot ETFs effectively deems Ethereum (ETH) to be a commodity. If Grewal is correct in his assessment, then an ETH commodity would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as opposed to the SEC, which is tasked with regulating securities.\n\nThis is a key distinction for ETH, because the SEC\u2019s mandate is to police securities and protect investors. The CFTC instead regulates commodities such as raw materials and agricultural goods, with a focus on preventing market manipulation and fraud. The CFTC\u2019s regulatory framework over commodities is therefore generally less stringent compared to the SEC\u2019s treatment of securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I\u2019ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we\u2019ve always known it to be. I\u2019m proud to be on team @Coinbase, the trusted partner and custodian for many of the issuers who had 19b-4\u2019s approved tonight. pic.twitter.com/nz1HHFbBSQ \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) May 23, 2024\n\nAs digital assets continue to gain mass adoption, there remains an ongoing debate over which federal agency should have jurisdiction over the regulation and enforcement of this new and innovative technology.\n\nBack in 2021, former CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump gave a speech on the now-infamous XRP SEC enforcement action case, and noted that she was \u201cwatching the outcome of this case closely because it will help to establish the scope of the SEC\u2019s authority in the digital assets space.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Stump added:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe regulatory application to digital assets, much like the assets themselves, is evolving every day. It is exciting, yet also frustrating to those who seek more certainty. But the incredible transformation in this space requires adaptation and creative thinking, and let\u2019s be honest, neither are among a regulator\u2019s natural tendencies. \u2026 That is where the regulatory state of digital assets currently sits: We must enable innovators to think creatively such that the story can evolve, we must acknowledge there will be differences of opinion as to the utility and potential of various products, and we must expect some storms to arise. These are the considerations that should guide us as regulators in exercising the authorities to fulfill our mission such that the market can develop and meet its full potential.\n\nPerhaps the Ethereum ETF approval brings just the sort of regulatory clarity this sector has been looking for. If ETH and other similar cryptocurrencies are not securities, then the SEC lacks jurisdiction to regulate these assets under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThat means that the SEC can no longer argue that these tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test. If ETH and similarly situated tokens are commodities, then crypto lawyers could argue in court that these cryptocurrencies are not investment contracts that come with an \u201cexpectation of profits from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014critical elements that the SEC must prove under the Howey Test.\n\nCrucially, by tacitly acknowledging that Ethereum is a commodity, the SEC may have just undercut its own legal arguments raised in several pending crypto enforcement court cases.\n\nIf courts are receptive to ETH and potentially other cryptocurrencies being commodities, then this could turn the tide on pending SEC lawsuits against major crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. These lawsuits hinge on the SEC\u2019s argument that selected tokens traded on these platforms are securities. But if Ethereum and similarly situated tokens are instead commodities, then this could green light a renewed motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuits against both Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nIf the federal judges in these cases agree with this argument, then this would essentially gut the SEC\u2019s claims that both Coinbase and Kraken offer trading of unregistered securities.\n\nSuch a ruling would deal a devastating blow to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is already under intense scrutiny from critics who believe his aggressive approach to regulation by enforcement actions is stifling the growth of the digital asset technology sector in the United States\u2014and pushing innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions.\n\nAs noted in Grewal\u2019s recent Twitter (aka X) post, now that the SEC has effectively said that \u201cETH sales can\u2019t be securities because Ethereum ETFs may be registered by funds with an S-1,\u201d the SEC has essentially agreed that ETH has no more of an \u201c\u2018ecosystem\u2019 any more than does Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent approval of Ethereum ETFs has profound potential implications for both pending and future legal battles in the digital asset sector. By suggesting that ETH, and other similarly situated tokens are commodities, the SEC may have dramatically limited its power to aggressively police the crypto sector.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Ethereum ETF decision may therefore further embolden players in the digital asset sector to push back against overzealous enforcement actions, resulting in fewer settlements and more court battles.\n\nGetting long-awaited clarity on whether ETH is a security or commodity may also curtail the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction over Ethereum and other similarly situated cryptocurrencies. This could in turn lead to a dramatic narrowing of the SEC\u2019s regulatory reach in the digital asset sector. Crypto lawyers will no doubt use the ETF decision to aggressively push back against pending SEC enforcement actions and lawsuits, and argue that the agency has overstepped its mandate.\n\nIf more digital assets are treated as commodities similar to what the Ethereum ETF decision suggests, then legislators may finally pass laws to vastly curtail the SEC\u2019s reach over these assets. As a result, these tokens could be subject to potentially less stringent regulation under the CFTC. Such a shift in agency oversight would create fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto startups, and foster a new wave of innovation in this sector.\n\nCrypto lawyers will likely leverage the ETF decision to reshape existing strategies with respect to how they advise clients in the digital asset space. These strategies may include advising crypto sector clients to place greater emphasis on the commodity nature of their tokens and platforms, in an effort to better insulate them from the SEC\u2019s reach.\n\nIf the Coinbase and Kraken legal defense teams are successful in dismissing pending SEC lawsuits based on the Ethereum ETF decision, then this could generate highly favorable legal precedents that would influence future regulation of the digital asset sector\u2014and usher in a fresh wave of blockchain innovation in the U.S.\n\nA new era of clarity with respect to digital asset laws would also benefit investigators and lawyers employed within both the SEC and the CFTC, by creating a potentially more predictable and stable regulatory environment. This would result in a more efficient use of agency resources, as opposed to the legally ambiguous environment we currently operate under. Regulatory clarity would also bring much-needed consistency for the judges who preside over digital asset cases, and generate more consistent and predictable outcomes.\n\nIt\u2019s my firm belief that crypto lawyers are the guardians of the blockchain, and play a vital role in the continued growth and adoption of crypto technology in the United States. The recent Ethereum ETF decision will only further empower crypto lawyers to better advise and navigate clients in the digital asset sector\u2014and I\u2019m excited to see how they creatively use this opportunity to do just that.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"
