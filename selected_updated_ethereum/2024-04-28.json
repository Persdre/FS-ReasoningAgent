        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe price of Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency, has surged more than 6% over the past 24 hours.\n\nETH is currently trading at $3,320 on major spot exchanges, according to data provided by CoinGecko .\n\nBitcoin's dominance is currently sitting slightly above the 50% level.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is currency sitting at 0.051 BTC after peaking at 0.052 BTC earlier today. The pair is now up nearly 13% over the past two weeks alone. However, the pair is still down 15% from its 2024 peak of 0.061 BTC that was achieved on Jan. 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major resistance level\n\nAccording to the 100eyes Crypto Scanner account, the second-largest cryptocurrency has now approached a key horizontal resistance at the $3,300 level.\n\nThe largest altcoin came close to surpassing this resistance level on Apr. 24. However, this attempt resulted in a significant correction.\n\nMajor headwinds\n\nEthereum's price recovery came despite the fact that Consensys, the key backer of the second-largest cryptocurrency network, recently sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after receiving a Wells notice from the regulator.\n\nThe SEC wants to expand its jurisdiction by classifying the flagship altcoin as a security, the firm alleges.\n\nConsensys has already hired some of the best lawyers from Manhattan-based firm Watchtell, meaning that the industry is about to witness another contentious legal battle.\n\nMoreover, some analysts believe that the SEC could potentially face another lawsuit from Grayscale over its refusal to approve a slew of spot Ethereum ETFs in May."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBinance has experienced significant outflows: 14,146 ETH, valued at approximately $46.74 million, within 24 hours. Notably, a fresh wallet also extracted 95.67 million USDT along with 7,402 ETH, equating to around $23.3 million. The activity mirrors the withdrawal patterns of two other wallets known for moving large quantities of ETH and stablecoins off the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe smart money tracking service Lookonchain even raised a question: Could these transactions be linked to Justin Sun, known for his substantial funds movements, or are they simply routine redistributions? While the identity of the wallet owners remains unconfirmed, the movement of such large sums is not necessarily an alarm signal. It is often a simple transfer of funds.\n\nRecently, Binance has been witnessing continuous outflows and a dip in market share. This could suggest a trend of whales gradually reducing their presence on the exchange. It is important to consider these movements within the market's current tendencies.\n\nEthereum price chart suggests the second-biggest currency is currently in a mixed position. Ethereum's price appears to be consolidating with current support at the $2,900 level. If there is a potential growth scenario toward resistance at $3,400, ETH would need to maintain the current pace. A break beyond that could see Ethereum challenging higher levels, possibly around the $3,650 mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, if support at $2,900 is breached, Ethereum might face a slide toward the next support region near $2,800. Whales' actions, like those possibly associated with Justin Sun, can influence market sentiment, but the price chart suggests a steadiness that may not be easily swayed by individual transactions, regardless of their size.\n\nWhile the outflows from Binance and market share reduction could be part of a funds redistribution by large-scale investors, Ethereum's technical indicators and support levels remain mixed."

If you want to skip our analysis about some of the key players in the cryptocurrency market, you can proceed to the section highlighting the Top 5 Ethereum Competitors and Alternatives in 2024.\n\nThe Global Cryptocurrency Market and a Comparison of Giants\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $4.67 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5% from 2023 to 2030, to reach $11.71 billion by the end of the forecasted period. You can also take a look at 15 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two most traded cryptocurrencies in the world. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize blockchain technology, however, they have different purposes and technical architectures. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized digital currency primarily tailored for peer-to-peer digital transactions without the involvement of financial institutions. Bitcoin emphasizes security, and scarcity with its blockchain optimized primarily for monetary transactions. Bitcoin is powered by the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and operates on the SHA-256 hash algorithm, Bitcoin has the highest market capitalization among all cryptocurrencies, valued at over $1.3 trillion on April 14. However, its smart contract capabilities are limited compared to Ethereum. You can 15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\nEthereum on the other hand was launched in 2015 and is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications that empowers developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements encoded in code. Examples of decentralized apps that can be built on Ethereum include tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. Tokens are interchangeable digital assets that represent value on a blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, non-interchangeable tokens that represent ownership of digital items such as art, collectibles, or virtual real estate. Decentralized finance (DeFi) apps are blockchain-based financial applications that operate without centralized intermediaries, Lending protocols are DeFi apps that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies, which often use NFTs as collateral and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner, without any intermediaries. As of April 14, Ethereum has a market cap of over $386 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum charges a fee for transactions and smart contracts on its blockchain network known as Gas which is paid entirely in Ethereum coins. Gas is measured by the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract, the more complex the execution operation is, the more Gas is required to fulfill that operation, and can vary from time to time depending on the network\u2019s demand. Gas fees for Ethereum transactions can range from $0.0001 to over $100, depending on the blockchain\u2019s demand.\n\nKey Players in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCompanies offering user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platforms and providing services such as trading, lending, and wallets have contributed significantly to the growth of the cryptocurrency market and have also established themselves as key players in the digital finance industry. Some of the largest companies offering platforms and wallets for the cryptocurrency market include Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN), Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ).\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform and is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States in terms of trading volume. On April 3 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced that it had obtained registration as a Restricted Dealer by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), making it the first and largest international cryptocurrency exchange registered in Canada. The registration marks a significant milestone in Coinbase Global Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:COIN) commitment to the Canadian market, following its Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in March 2023 for regulatory compliance and formally launching its services back in August 2023. Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) plans to establish partnerships with local financial institutions and stakeholders in Canada to encourage the adoption of digital assets and promote economic development. On April 11 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced the launch of margined Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin futures contracts by Coinbase Derivatives, making it the first CFTC-regulated exchange to offer such contracts. Dogecoin futures contracts are also expected to launch later this month. Coinbase Derivatives aims to improve access to digital asset trading by reducing upfront capital requirements and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) provides a user-friendly platform that can be used to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies. On March 19, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its official launch in the United Kingdom and offered key features and benefits for investors including options trading, 5% AER (Annual Equivalent Rate) on uninvested cash, access to over 6,000 global companies, commission-free trading, and no foreign exchange fees on trades, in comparison to the significant fees charged by other UK brokers. On February 29, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its collaboration with Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution that will give Robinhood Wallet users access to Arbitrum swaps through decentralized exchanges. Robinhood Wallet users can now benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction speeds on some of the most prominent networks in the cryptocurrency market. Over the next few months, Robinhood and Arbitrum will also collaborate to facilitate access to cross-chain swaps and other initiatives that are aimed at lowering the barriers to using web3 on Robinhood Wallet. Commenting on the event, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Markets, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:HOOD) Crypto Divison said:\n\n\u201cEthereum gas fees are an essential part of securing the network, but these same fees can hinder adoption, Layer 2s like Arbitrum, which is currently the leading chain by total-locked value, help solve this problem for our users. Accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3.\u201d\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, Inc. is a global technology company with a focus on financial services and owns Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD. On December 07, 2023, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) launched Bitkey a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet in over 95 countries across six continents that consists of three components: a mobile app for seamless transactions on smartphones, a hardware device for securely storing cryptocurrencies offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both. Unlike traditional self-custody wallets, Bitkey uses three keys to secure cryptocurrencies: one integrated into the mobile application, another in the hardware device, and the third stored on Bitkey\u2019s server. Any two keys can be used to move cryptocurrencies or approve other security-related actions such as initiating recovery or modifying security settings. Bitkey has also partnered with prominent platforms like Coinbase and Cash App, enabling seamless transfers of cryptocurrencies from exchanges to the Bitkey wallet.\n\nEthereum's decentralized platform not only facilitates digital transactions but has also transformed the landscape of decentralized applications as they operate on a distributed network of servers and are not prone to censorship and fraudulent activities. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, innovations in blockchain technology will further expand the possibilities within the cryptocurrency industry.

If you want to skip our analysis about some of the key players in the cryptocurrency market, you can proceed to the section highlighting the Top 5 Ethereum Competitors and Alternatives in 2024.\n\nThe Global Cryptocurrency Market and a Comparison of Giants\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $4.67 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5% from 2023 to 2030, to reach $11.71 billion by the end of the forecasted period. You can also take a look at 15 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two most traded cryptocurrencies in the world. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize blockchain technology, however, they have different purposes and technical architectures. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized digital currency primarily tailored for peer-to-peer digital transactions without the involvement of financial institutions. Bitcoin emphasizes security, and scarcity with its blockchain optimized primarily for monetary transactions. Bitcoin is powered by the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and operates on the SHA-256 hash algorithm, Bitcoin has the highest market capitalization among all cryptocurrencies, valued at over $1.3 trillion on April 14. However, its smart contract capabilities are limited compared to Ethereum.

Examples of decentralized apps that can be built on Ethereum include tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. Tokens are interchangeable digital assets that represent value on a blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, non-interchangeable tokens that represent ownership of digital items such as art, collectibles, or virtual real estate. Decentralized finance (DeFi) apps are blockchain-based financial applications that operate without centralized intermediaries, Lending protocols are DeFi apps that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies, which often use NFTs as collateral and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner, without any intermediaries. As of April 14, Ethereum has a market cap of over $386 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum charges a fee for transactions and smart contracts on its blockchain network known as Gas which is paid entirely in Ethereum coins. Gas is measured by the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract, the more complex the execution operation is, the more Gas is required to fulfill that operation, and can vary from time to time depending on the network\u2019s demand. Gas fees for Ethereum transactions can range from $0.0001 to over $100, depending on the blockchain\u2019s demand.\n\nKey Players in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCompanies offering user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platforms and providing services such as trading, lending, and wallets have contributed significantly to the growth of the cryptocurrency market and have also established themselves as key players in the digital finance industry. Some of the largest companies offering platforms and wallets for the cryptocurrency market include Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN), Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ).\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform and is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States in terms of trading volume. On April 3 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced that it had obtained registration as a Restricted Dealer by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), making it the first and largest international cryptocurrency exchange registered in Canada. The registration marks a significant milestone in Coinbase Global Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:COIN) commitment to the Canadian market, following its Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in March 2023 for regulatory compliance and formally launching its services back in August 2023. Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) plans to establish partnerships with local financial institutions and stakeholders in Canada to encourage the adoption of digital assets and promote economic development. On April 11 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced the launch of margined Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin futures contracts by Coinbase Derivatives, making it the first CFTC-regulated exchange to offer such contracts. Dogecoin futures contracts are also expected to launch later this month. Coinbase Derivatives aims to improve access to digital asset trading by reducing upfront capital requirements and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) provides a user-friendly platform that can be used to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies. On March 19, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its official launch in the United Kingdom and offered key features and benefits for investors including options trading, 5% AER (Annual Equivalent Rate) on uninvested cash, access to over 6,000 global companies, commission-free trading, and no foreign exchange fees on trades, in comparison to the significant fees charged by other UK brokers. On February 29, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its collaboration with Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution that will give Robinhood Wallet users access to Arbitrum swaps through decentralized exchanges. Robinhood Wallet users can now benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction speeds on some of the most prominent networks in the cryptocurrency market. Over the next few months, Robinhood and Arbitrum will also collaborate to facilitate access to cross-chain swaps and other initiatives that are aimed at lowering the barriers to using web3 on Robinhood Wallet. Commenting on the event, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Markets, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:HOOD) Crypto Divison said:\n\n\u201cEthereum gas fees are an essential part of securing the network, but these same fees can hinder adoption, Layer 2s like Arbitrum, which is currently the leading chain by total-locked value, help solve this problem for our users. Accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3.\u201d\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, Inc. is a global technology company with a focus on financial services and owns Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD. On December 07, 2023, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) launched Bitkey a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet in over 95 countries across six continents that consists of three components: a mobile app for seamless transactions on smartphones, a hardware device for securely storing cryptocurrencies offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both. Unlike traditional self-custody wallets, Bitkey uses three keys to secure cryptocurrencies: one integrated into the mobile application, another in the hardware device, and the third stored on Bitkey\u2019s server. Any two keys can be used to move cryptocurrencies or approve other security-related actions such as initiating recovery or modifying security settings. Bitkey has also partnered with prominent platforms like Coinbase and Cash App, enabling seamless transfers of cryptocurrencies from exchanges to the Bitkey wallet.\n\nEthereum's decentralized platform not only facilitates digital transactions but has also transformed the landscape of decentralized applications as they operate on a distributed network of servers and are not prone to censorship and fraudulent activities. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, innovations in blockchain technology will further expand the possibilities within the cryptocurrency industry.
