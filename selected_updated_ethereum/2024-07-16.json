        "content": "SEC Issues Final Instructions for Ethereum ETFs, Targeting July 23 Launch\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly requested the final submissions of Form S-1 from asset managers by July 16, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC. These final submissions must detail the fees issuers plan to charge for their crypto funds. As the market anticipates the launch of these Ether ETFs, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a surge in the past 24 hours, gaining 3.69%. It is currently trading at $3,458.\n\nThis move follows the SEC\u2019s approval on May 23 of issuers' 19-b forms, which proposed rule changes to permit crypto-based investment vehicles. Now, asset managers require approval for their initial securities registration S-1 forms. The SEC is reportedly targeting to launch the new ETFs on July 23.\n\nSeveral leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, are in the race to secure approval and launch their Ether ETFs. Addressing regulatory concerns, some issuers have decided to exclude staking from their Ether ETF plans. This decision aligns with the SEC\u2019s focus on ensuring these new investment products meet regulatory standards.\n\nFees for these Ether ETFs will vary among the different issuers. Invesco and Galaxy have set their management fees at 0.25%, which is slightly higher than those of VanEck and Franklin Templeton, who have disclosed fees of 0.20% and 0.19%, respectively. These fees are notably lower than the 2.50% management fees currently charged by Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust. Although Grayscale has announced plans to launch a new spot Ether ETF, it has yet to disclose the associated fees."

        "content": "Solana SOL/USD is well-positioned against Ethereum ETH/USD, according to the analysis of a prominent industry expert.\n\nWhat Happened: According to Coin Bureau CEO and co-founder Nic, Solana is already outperforming Ethereum. Comparing the two blockchains, Solana started the year with fewer tokens but has since overtaken Ethereum since its ecosystem has seen 65% more token listings in the first half of the year.\n\nWill Solana outperform Ethereum?\n\n\n\nHere are 3 charts from the recent CMC H1 report that show how it is already doing so \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Nic (@nicrypto) July 15, 2024\n\nThis leads to more users and more active addresses on Solana, which has the most daily active addresses of any Layer-1 blockchain. Ethereum, in comparison, ranks fourth.\n\nSolana is \u201cthe home of NFTs\u201d and leads in unique wallets, buyers and transactions, while Bitcoin and Ethereum lead in terms of volume.\n\nNic points to the meme coin madness driving Solana usage and awareness. \"The higher the returns, the more users they draw. It\u2019s a degen cycle and Solana is top here,\" Nic concludes and thinks, \"Solana is no longer in Ethereum\u2019s shadow.\"\n\nAlso Read: Solana Up 7% And Could Get To 50% Of Ethereum\u2019s Valuation As \u2018Most Liquid Election Proxy In Crypto,\u2019 Trader Says\n\nWhy It Matters: Crypto chart analyst Ali Martinez sees bullish short-term price action coming for SOL:\n\n#Solana appears to be forming a W pattern, which suggests $SOL will surge toward $174! pic.twitter.com/OxXODWi1yA \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2024\n\nA \u2018W chart pattern' is formed when an asset\u2019s price drops and then rises again before dropping once more and rising for a second time. A double bottom with a W shape signals bullish price momentum.\n\nAnother crypto trader recently confirmed a breakout for Solana, with yet another trader seeing Solana making a new all-time high later followed by a rally in ecosystem-related tokens.\n\nPrice Action: In the past 24 hours, SOL is up 3%, taking its weekly gains to 10.7%.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage: Shutterstock"
