        "content": "Defiance ETFs has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a leveraged Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), designed to provide investors with twice the daily performance of the CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nThe proposed Defiance 2X Ether Strategy ETF would not only amplify gains but also magnify losses, reflecting the inherent risks of leveraged investment products.\n\nThis initiative comes after the SEC\u2019s October approval of Ether futures ETFs and the successful introduction of a 2X Bitcoin futures ETF in June.\n\nThe Defiance 2X Ether Strategy ETF seeks to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s market movements, yet it also carries the heightened risk associated with leveraged funds.\n\nLeveraged ETFs typically do not match the long-term performance of the assets they track, and the fund\u2019s prospectus cautions investors about potential losses.\n\nThe increasing number of filings for cryptocurrency-based investment products signal the growing investor interest in the sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs have attracted over US$12 billion in net inflows in the first quarter of this year."

        "title": "Ethereum spot ETF faces skepticism as SEC's decision looms - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "VanEck is bracing for a potential rejection.\n\nShare this article\n\nSeveral applications for spot Ethereum ETFs are pending SEC approval. As the decision date approaches, uncertainty grows, with financial and crypto leaders expressing a mix of skepticism and hope.\n\nA recent report from Barron\u2019s suggests an ongoing, frustrating situation for exchange-trade fund (ETF) issuers.\n\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, unlike the open dialogue that paved the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs, the conversation between the issuers and the SEC around Ethereum ETFs seems more one-sided. This lack of engagement foreshadows a rocky road for Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cSome ETF issuers have met with the SEC to talk about their products, but so far, those discussions have largely been one-sided, without the agency giving the companies the critical feedback needed to finalize their products, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d wrote Barron\u2019s. \u201cAt this point in the Bitcoin ETF process, the issuers were already engaged in a robust back-and-forth with agency staff.\u201d\n\nWhile Barron\u2019s is skeptical, JPMorgan believes the question is \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block that a spot Ethereum ETF approval might still occur, but it would take longer than expected.\n\nAccording to him, ETF companies may initiate legal lawsuits against the agency if the SEC doesn\u2019t approve these filings. \u201cIf there is no spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be a litigation process after May,\u201d said Panigirtzoglou.\n\nPanigirtzoglou suggested that the lawsuit will likely end up in opposition to the SEC, and just like what happened with Grayscale, the SEC would eventually be \u201cforced\u201d to approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nVanEck, one of the spot Ethereum fund issuers, projects an outright rejection of the ETF filings. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said in an interview with CNBC that the applications of VanEck and Ark Invest \u201care kind of the first in line for May\u2026to probably be rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,\u201d said van Eck.\n\n\u201c576 to one\u201d\n\nFor many fund managers, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement is a nerve-wracking waiting game. BlackRock, however, might be more accustomed to this process.\n\nBlackRock has a history of 576 ETF approvals with only 1 rejection. This high success rate creates a positive outlook for the asset manager\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nRecently, Ethereum has drawn attention after news that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation by an undisclosed state authority surfaced. Speculations suggest that this scrutiny, possibly from the SEC, aims to classify Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, as a security.\n\nDespite these speculations, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if ETH is classified as a security.\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, suggested BlackRock\u2019s possible application for withdrawal. He noted BlackRock\u2019s history of successful ETF approvals is attributed to a collaborative approach with the SEC, not just forceful tactics.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC asks Blackrock and the other ETH ETF sponsors to withdraw (a common practice), I bet they will,\u201d commented Chervinsky."

        "title": "What Are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) in Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "When you create a new account in your Ethereum wallet, you are setting up an Externally Owned Account (EOA).\n\nEthereum has been at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract development. At the heart of user participation on the network lies a fundamental concept: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which are required to initiate any transaction. These accounts allow Ethereum users to send, receive, and manage their digital assets.\n\nKeep reading to learn what EOAs are and how they work\n\nWhat Are Externally Owned Accounts in Ethereum?\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are a type of Ethereum account controlled by users rather than code, as is the case with smart contract accounts. EOAs operate independently but can interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. They are also essential for initiating any transactions on the network.\n\nEOAs are controlled by an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key, a cryptographic method for signing and verifying digital transactions. This process generates a private and corresponding public key, providing transaction security and authentication.\n\nEOAs have various purposes, such as sending and receiving transactions, managing ETH balances, and interacting with smart contracts.\n\nUsers interact with their EOAs and the Ethereum blockchain through wallets that allow them to manage the account\u2019s private keys. The underlying technology for EOAs functions similarly across different wallet types.\n\nSo when you create a new account in an Ethereum wallet, like MetaMask, you create an EOA.\n\nHow Do Ethereum EOA Accounts Work?\n\nEOAs can initiate transactions, send and receive ETH or Ethereum-based tokens (such as ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens), and interact with smart contracts. These accounts are commonly owned by average Ethereum users and interact with the blockchain through crypto wallets.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts have unique private keys, granting control over transaction signing. When users initiate a transaction or deploy a smart contract, they use their private key to sign the transaction, verifying their identity and authorizing the action.\n\nThe private key is then used to generate a corresponding public key that creates the account\u2019s Ethereum address.\n\nOnce verified, the transaction is made available on the Ethereum network, where it is validated and included in a block through the consensus mechanism. The transaction is now immutable and part of the blockchain\u2019s permanent and transparent record.\n\nEOAs are represented on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with an empty code string because they don\u2019t store smart contract data. Still, they hold balance information and transaction counts, which require storage on the blockchain.\n\nCreating an EOA itself incurs no direct blockchain transaction fee, but initiating transactions from it does attract gas fees. The network only recognizes an EOA\u2019s existence after its first transaction, and all transactions, including this first one, attract gas fees.\n\nEOA vs. Smart Contract Accounts: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nEOA accounts are user-controlled Ethereum accounts that require manual inputs for each action. On the other hand, smart contract accounts operate autonomously, executing code based on predefined rules within the blockchain.\n\nHere are more differences between EOA and smart contract accounts on Ethereum.\n\nCriteria EOAs Smart contract accounts Control EOAs are managed by private keys. Smart contract accounts are based on rules encoded within the blockchain. Creation EOAs are created through wallet interfaces, which generate a private key and a corresponding seed phrase applicable to both software and hardware wallets. A smart contract account is initiated when the associated smart contract deploys on-chain, incurring fees. Functionality EOAs are tools for transferring tokens and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum mainnet. Smart contract accounts incorporate programmable logic and advanced features for Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Gas fees EOAs need gas fees for mainnet transactions. Developers can design smart contracts to optimize gas usage, potentially reducing overall gas fees. Security EOAs rely primarily on user responsibility for security. Smart contract accounts allow users to combine multiple security layers, including authentication mechanisms and smart contract design best practices. Account Recovery EOAs don\u2019t support traditional account recovery methods due to the nature of blockchain technology. Account recovery is only possible in smart contract accounts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of EOA Accounts\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are the foundation of user activity on the Ethereum blockchain and offer several benefits. However, they also have limitations.\n\nPros\n\nFull User Control: EOAs give users complete control over the account and its funds. Only the individual with the corresponding private key can manage the account and execute transactions.\n\nVersatile Transaction Initiation: EOAs have the flexibility to initiate any transaction on the Ethereum network, enabling users to interact with various decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nCons\n\nPrivate Key Dependency: EOAs rely heavily on the users\u2019 secure private key management. A lost or compromised private key could lead to the manipulation or loss of funds in an account.\n\nNative Token Dependency on Gas: Requiring users to maintain a balance of native tokens in their EOAs to cover gas fees can bring complexity and additional management tasks.\n\nFinal Take\n\nExternally Owned Accounts are used for standard transactions such as sending and receiving digital assets and managing ETH. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, EOAs remain a foundational element that allows users to navigate various decentralized processes within the Ethereum ecosystem."
