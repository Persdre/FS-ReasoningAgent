        "title": "Ethereum Under Siege: Most Attacked Blockchain In 2024 Suffers 43% Of May's Crypto Losses - Benzinga",
        "content": "Ethereum ETH/USD was the most targeted blockchain by hackers and fraudsters in May, constituting nearly 43% of the total losses.\n\nWhat Happened: The world's largest network for decentralized apps and services suffered the most individual attacks, totaling 9, in the month, according to a report released by Web3 security firm Immunefi.\n\nThe second on the list was BNB Chain BNB/USD with 4 incidents. Together, Ethereum and BNB Chain accounted for a massive 62% of the total losses across major chains.\n\nAmong the most sensational of Ethereum losses was the $21 million exploit on the Web3 game Gala Games GALA/USD.\n\nOverall, total cryptocurrency losses to hacks and rug pulls dropped 20% this year compared with the same period in 2023. Additionally, losses in May declined 28% month-over-month.\n\nWhy It Matters: Ethereum was the most targeted chain last month, and also during the first quarter.\n\nWith a vast array of decentralized finance projects, the network has been vulnerable to attacks from bad actors. It is the largest DeFi chain, with upwards of $64 billion in deposits as of this writing, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nThe Immunefi report specifically underlined that DeFi projects were the main target of exploiters, representing 100% of all the losses.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,743.49, marginally down 0.38% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Foresees XRP, Solana, Cardano ETFs Amid Bitcoin, Ethereum Approvals\n\nPhoto by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThis article is an onsite version of our Cryptofinance newsletter. Premium subscribers can sign up here to get the newsletter delivered every week. Standard subscribers can upgrade to Premium here, or explore all FT newsletters\n\nHello and welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we\u2019re taking a look at a fast-growing new trend in decentralised finance.\n\nThe excitement over the arrival of stock market funds investing directly in cryptocurrencies this year has obscured the rapid changes taking place in the world of decentralised finance, or DeFi.\n\nThe hottest thing in the market at the moment is the emergence of EigenLayer, a new network that lets holders of the ether cryptocurrency simultaneously lend out the same coin multiple times.\n\nUnderscoring its appeal, its Seattle-based parent company Eigen Labs in February raised $100mn from Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s a16z, one of the most influential crypto venture capitalists.\n\nThe concept behind EigenLayer is \u201crestaking\u201d, a new concept for the crypto market. At present holders of ether can earn interest, in the form of more tokens, if they deposit or \u201cstake\u201d their ether on ethereum, allowing the system to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThey earn a reward for it but that keeps their coins locked up and immobile. EigenLayer takes the staked ether and allows it to be reused in other applications that are also built on ethereum \u2014 earning them further yield in the process.\n\nIt may well sound familiar. That\u2019s because, fundamentally, it is rehypothecation, or the practice of lending the same asset over and over again. It\u2019s something global financial regulators have clamped down on since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, when it emerged that the US bank had used collateral posted by clients to help fund its own trades. It took years for customers to be reunited with their assets.\n\nIn the world of crypto, this vice is turned into a virtue. Other services such as Lido Finance also rehypothecate assets but hand out tokens that represent the value of the staked ether.\n\nThe twist with EigenLayer is that it is trying to extend the security that underpins the ethereum network to other applications that are also being built on ethereum. EigenLayer sits in the middle, connecting people who want to use their staked tokens to lend with new applications that are being built. EigenLayer uses automated algorithms and smart contracts to manage the process.\n\nThe advantage of EigenLayer is that, at least in theory, it solves a major issue for the ethereum network. Every application built on ethereum has to sort out its own security with its own validation, and that makes it a highly inefficient, fragmented and costly system that is difficult to scale. EigenLayer can help the network grow by piggybacking on the complex and effective system that validates it.\n\nFrom a standing start in December there are now just under 5mn ether coins, valued at $18.6bn, locked up in EigenLayer, according to data provider DefiLlama. That makes it the second-largest application in the DeFi market, between longtime players Lido on $36bn and AAVE on $13bn.\n\nBut in a research paper this week, Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex in the UK, argued that restaking was creating a major, new risk in the market.\n\nShe said the $18.6bn figure was \u201cvastly overestimated\u201d because some of the numbers had been counted multiple times. The true figure backing the activity is closer to two-thirds of that, she thinks.\n\nThat matters because, she said, each new application needs to rely on highly leveraged tokens backed by very little in a thin market.\n\nThe EigenLayer system is designed to punish bad actors such as hackers by confiscating a portion of staked tokens or deposits as a penalty. It relies on algorithms that unilaterally decide when malicious activity is happening.\n\nThat leaves the leveraged staking market exposed if there are deliberate attacks to steal funds, if prices are manipulated or if lenders simply have poorly coded algorithms, light borrowing standards or poor risk controls. And all built on an IOU of ether, she says.\n\n\u201cBecause the vast majority of staking is on ethereum, any stress events . . . have the potential to spread credit contagion throughout the DeFi ecosystem, and this could precipitate another DeFi winter,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAlready the multiplication of layers is dizzying. Applications such as Renzo restake staked ether tokens on EigenLayer \u2014 and mint another token to represent that transaction. Applications such as Renzo \u201care taking on a very large credit risk\u201d, Alexander warned.\n\nThat could lead to a cascade of liquidations in the market and tokens could depeg from other tokens whose value they are supposed to track, she said.\n\nIt has happened before. The collapse of the terra stablecoin, which triggered the crypto market crash of 2022, began with staked ether tokens in the DeFi market and spread because bigger traders and lenders were interlinked with other markets.\n\nHowever some have argued that introducing layers of applications on top of staked ether is \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of the ethereum network.\n\nEither it can be a protocol for open innovation, more akin to a commodity, or it can be an investable asset that will deliver a yield for investors, said the head of research at one staking service who declined to be identified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really possible for them to do both. If you optimise ether as the financial asset . . . you\u2019re encouraging the creation of this kind of layers and going further out in the risk curve to maximise yield.\u201d\n\n\n\nYet market demand is potentially pushing ether and ethereum towards it being an investable asset, just when US lawmakers and financial regulators are leaning towards ether being a commodity.\n\nIf the Commodity Futures Trading Commission becomes the main US regulator for crypto as expected, then the agency may find itself going down a very deep rabbit hole when piecing together the aftermath of the next market crash.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Email me at philip.stafford@ft.com\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nFormer FTX senior executive Ryan Salame was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after pleading guilty last year to election fraud charges and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business while at Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s failed cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT became the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange traded fund even though it only launched in January. Its holdings of just under 300,000 bitcoin pipped those of Grayscale, even though its rival held more than 619,000 at the start of the year.\n\nUsers of Gemini\u2019s Earn lending programme will get nearly $2bn of their crypto that was stuck at Genesis, following the digital asset trader\u2019s bankruptcy in January 2023.\n\nSoundbite of the week:\n\nElon Musk dismissed stories that he had talked to Donald Trump about digital assets. He wrote on his X social media site:\n\n\u201cPretty sure I\u2019ve never discussed crypto with Trump, although I am generally in favor of things that shift power from government to the people, which crypto can do.\u201d\n\nData mining: the rise of ethena\n\nAmong the signs of soaring optimism in DeFi is the emergence of a stablecoin called ethena. It is pegged to the ether cryptocurrency rather than the US dollar, and offers buyers a yield of 36 per cent. From nothing in January, it is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest stablecoin with nearly $3bn in circulation. Its backers argue that it is fully decentralised \u2014 pegged to the price of ether so there are no deposited assets sitting in a bank. Instead it uses derivatives to keep the value in balance.
