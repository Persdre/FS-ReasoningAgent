        "title": "3 Reasons Why I Sold Ethereum and Never Looked Back - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The coin's potential has been very slow to materialize.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided to offload the vast majority of my Ethereum (ETH -1.13%) tokens after holding and accumulating them over the last few years. I don't expect to buy more anytime soon, even if the price drops to attractive levels.\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. The coin's price surpassed the target level in my investing plan\n\nThe biggest reason I decided to sell nearly all of my Ethereum was that its price was above the level that I had identified as my sell point.\n\nI first started to accumulate Ethereum in mid-2020. Per my initial investing plan, I did not set a price target for a sale at the time, opting instead to reassess the issue after roughly three years had elapsed. I continued to dollar-cost average (DCA) and build up my position through roughly the middle of 2023, after which I set a firmer target and stopped buying more.\n\nI resolved to think strongly about selling after the price hit somewhere above $3,000 per token, a level the coin had surpassed in at least three of the periods I'd held it, as shown in this chart:\n\nWhen the coin broke through that price level this year, it was only a matter of time. It's entirely possible that my sale will mean that I'll be missing out on the coin's future growth. But because of the next reason we'll discuss, I won't be losing any sleep over it.\n\n2. Transaction fees were too high, and not improving by enough over time\n\nTransaction fees, known as gas fees, are perennially high on the Ethereum chain. To transact, you'll need to cough up anywhere from $5 to $80 or more, depending on the day. And despite many repeated promises from the chain's developers regarding a permanent decline of gas fees, they have remained stubbornly and painfully high for years on end.\n\nI don't day trade in and out of my cryptocurrencies, so it might seem as though it's hyperbole to complain about the infrequent transaction costs associated with building up a position. But remember, my strategy was to dollar-cost average. Making a series of purchases entailed paying gas fees on the order of $600 in total -- way too much given the relatively small size of my position and my investments.\n\nWhat's more, the thing I kept noticing again and again over the years of my holding was that the high fees were discouraging my friends from buying Ethereum as an investment or trying to use it to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Noticeable commission costs are practically extinct for most retail investors trading stocks, so the expectation that people often have is that the same will be true in cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter a while, I stopped touting the coin as an investment because I wanted to avoid the subsequent conversations about how high the gas fees were. Ultimately I recognized that behavior in myself, and it was an unambiguous sign that it was time to sell.\n\n3. It's in the uncanny valley of cryptocurrencies\n\nThe final reason that I sold Ethereum is that it is presently in a bit of an uncanny valley.\n\nIf you're not familiar, the uncanny valley is a phenomenon in which a person's reaction to a humanoid robot is warm when the robot does not appear to be very human at all, warm when the robot appears to be fully human, but ice-cold or otherwise negative when the robot appears to be nearly human-like, but is overtly not an actual human.\n\nEthereum has a number of popular meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, a blockchain intended largely for fun or outright gambling rather than investing in serious projects and fostering frontier financial technologies. At the same time, it has a handful of rather esoteric cryptocurrency utility projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), much like you'd expect from a chain devoted to hardcore technology development, financial engineering, or methodical new experiments in corporate governance.\n\nYet its high transaction costs make meme coin investing exceptionally painful. Likewise, the same source of friction is a massive drag on for-profit projects, which tend to have a higher need to transact on demand, meaning that they can't wait for fees to decline.\n\nFor other purposes, like minting and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or creating smart contracts, there are plenty of solutions on the chain to choose from. But many of the marketplaces, exchanges, and tools on Ethereum have only rudimentary feature sets or sketchy credentials.\n\nOf course, the Ethereum blockchain itself can't fully control which projects use it or how well they work.\n\nBut for a chain's native token to be a good investment relative to other options, it helps if there's a critical mass of users within at least one (large) community that's loyal to where their projects are deployed. And for this chain, the various frictions are an impediment to that critical mass continuing to build, so I don't regret selling."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a week marked by notable movements in the cryptocurrency market, three coins have captured the attention of investors and analysts alike: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token ( FURR ) . Each of these cryptocurrencies has demonstrated unique behavior in response to global market conditions and internal developments, from halving events to presale successes.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes at $66,000 Following Halving Event\n\nAfter a period marked by significant fluctuations, Bitcoin's price has found stability early this week, maintaining a position around $66,000 following its anticipated halving event. The adjustment, which occurred over the weekend, resulted in the reward for Bitcoin mining being cut from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin, an essential part of the cryptocurrency's design to control inflation and reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation.\n\nThis halving, which takes place approximately every four years, is one of many steps in the long process towards the cap of 21 million Bitcoins. As of the latest event, there are projected to be 29 more such halvings before the final Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced to mere satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nLeading up to the halving, Bitcoin experienced weeks of price volatility. However, as of Monday morning, the cryptocurrency appears to be resting on a solid support level. Blockchain analytics firm IntotheBlock reports that Bitcoin is now trading just above a significant demand zone. \"With 1.66 million addresses having purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $64,800, this level may serve as strong support in the face of potential market downturns,\" stated IntotheBlock on social platform X.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the halving, Bitcoin transaction fees soared, reaching a record high of $127 momentarily during the weekend, as per data from Bitinfo Charts.\n\nIn related developments, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have also experienced modest gains, each up nearly 1% and trading at $3,100 and $152, respectively, as of Monday morning. The overall crypto market cap has seen a slight increase of 1.13%, climbing to a total of $2.41 trillion according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe crypto community continues to monitor these developments closely, considering the potential long-term impacts of Bitcoin's halving on the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Experiences Slight Increase Following Bitcoin Halving\n\nETH has successfully regained its footing above the $3,000 mark as of Friday and continued to stabilize over the weekend. Currently, the price of Ethereum hovers just over $3,200, marking a 1.3% increase in the last 24 hours and nearly matching its price level from the same time last week, with only about a 1% difference.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other positive developments, there is promising news for both Ethereum and Bitcoin as Hong Kong has conditionally approved spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. Local firms are optimistic about receiving final approvals to start issuing shares within the month. The initiation of trading is expected to alleviate some of the uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies in the region, potentially injecting $25 billion in new liquidity into the market\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Captivates Investors with Successful Presale During Market Surge\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out as a burgeoning favorite, having captured significant investor interest with its successful presale amid an overall market uptick. Furrever Token distinguishes itself by blending the allure of adorable kittens with the technological prowess of blockchain, offering a uniquely engaging and delightful user experience in a sector often dominated by more austere projects.\n\nCentral to the ethos of Furrever Token is the creation of an enchanting crypto ecosystem that prioritizes fun and camaraderie. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and community-focused, incorporating charming cat-themed graphics like stickers, emojis, and visuals. These elements not only enhance user interaction but also build a sense of community through regular social challenges and growth-oriented initiatives, making the crypto experience enjoyable for both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nThe financial structure\u2014or tokenomics\u2014of Furrever Token is strategically devised to drive participation and support the project\u2019s expansion. With 65% of the tokens allocated for the presale phase, the project has already raised over $1 million and is rapidly approaching the completion of stage 7 out of a planned 10 stages, with a fundraising goal of $1.9 million set before its expected launch on decentralized exchange PancakeSwap.\n\nThe investment appeal of Furrever Token is bolstered by its promising financial prospects, offering potential returns of up to 15X from its current pricing at $0.000564. This potential for high returns has piqued the interest of investors looking for both profitability and an engaging community experience. To ensure trust and transparency, Furrever Token has implemented comprehensive security measures including smart contract audits, token lock-up periods, and proactive community engagement, all of which reaffirm the project\u2019s commitment to legitimacy and investor reassurance.\n\nAs Furrever Token continues to progress and draw in new supporters, it remains a compelling project poised for further success in the expansive crypto market.
