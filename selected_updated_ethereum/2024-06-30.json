        "content": "According to data provided by DefiLlama, Solana has managed to destroy Ethereum in daily DEX trading volume ($1.148 billion and $745 million, respectively).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana-based Raydium, Meteora, Orca, Phoenix and Lifinity are among the top 10 DEXes by daily trading volume. Uniswap and PancakeSwap, of course, remain in the lead.\n\nAs noted by Patrick Scott, the founder of Dynamo DeFi, Solana's DEX volume dominance is also on the rise . In fact, it is on track to surpass the 25% level for the first time this June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, DEX volume has hit $26 billion over the past seven days, according to data provided by Dune Analytics .\n\nEarlier this year, trading on Solana-based DEXex spiked due to the growing popularity of meme coins.\n\nSOL summer?\n\nThis comes as the \"Ethereum killer\" is benefiting from increasing ETF buzz. As reported by U.Today , New York-based investment firm VanEck filed to launch an ETF for Solana on Thursday; 21Shares followed suit with its own filing for the red-hot altcoin on Friday.\n\nHowever, those who expect this ETF to see the light in the near future should cool their jets. According to leading analysts in the field, the product is now expected to be approved this year.\n\nAfter initially seeing a sharp price spike due to the ETF hype, the SOL price is currently in the red, slipping by 0.2% over the past two weeks.\n\nThe popular altcoin is currently valued at $65.2 billion, according to data provided by CoinGecko. This puts it in the fifth place by market capitalization (behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether and BNB)."

        "content": "On June 30, the Ethereum network recorded its lowest fees since 2016. According to data provided by Etherscan, the average gas fee is currently sitting at just 3 Gwei ($0.14), according to data provided by Dune Analytics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGas fees refer to the cost of various operations on the Ethereum blockchain. By paying gas fees, users help to ensure the security of the network. Apart from incentivizing validators, gas fees are also meant to prevent various spam attacks.\n\nDuring the 2021 bull run, Ethereum's gas fees were exorbitantly high due to high demand in the non-fungible sector (NFT). This prompted some pundits to argue that the network was unsustainable and gave rise to more affordable alternatives such as Solana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time around, Ethereum gas fees are hitting extremely low levels despite the fact that the network is also experiencing strong transaction activity. In fact, the volume of the leading altcoin is on the same level as it was during the beginning of the year.\n\nThe plunging fees can be explained by a higher level of efficiency of the Layer-1 market due to the combination of Layer-2 volume and the introduction of \u201cblob transactions\u201d with EIP-4844 that helped to significantly boost Ethereum's scalability.\n\n\"We will still see gas spikes above 15 gwei in times of higher activity. It\u2019s just that overall the gas market has been more efficient post 4844. So we\u2019ll have more affordable days than expensive ones,\" Pistachio Fi founder Brian Smocovich said in a post on the X social media network.\n\nBack to inflation\n\nThe massive drop in fees means that Ethereum is no longer a deflationary network since the amount of fees to burn is very small. This flies in the face of those who were pushing the narrative about \"ultra sound money\" prior to the Dencun upgrade.\n\nOver the past seven days, 14,393 ETH has been added to the network, according to data provided by ultrasound.money. This translates into annual supply growth of 0.62%.\n\nThe total supply of Ethereum currently stands at 120,185,061 ETH, which means that it is on track to reach a new 2024 peak."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by over 3% in the last 7 days\n\nA key metric revealed that ETH was undervalued, hinting at a recovery on the charts\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price action turned bullish on 28 June, giving investors hope for a recovery from their past losses. Unfortunately, this bullish trend didn\u2019t last for long, as the coin recorded a price correction soon after. This led to both its weekly and daily charts flashing red.\n\nEthereum faces rejection\n\nAfter the aforementioned hike in price, ETH\u2019s bears stepped up again and pushed the altcoin\u2019s price down by more than 3%. At the time of writing, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,391.51 with a market capitalization of over $407 billion.\n\nThe worst news was that Ethereum got rejected from the upper limit of a bullish wedge pattern in the recent past. As per a tweet from ZAYK Charts, a popular crypto analyst, the token\u2019s price started to consolidate inside the pattern in late May. A successful breakout could have resulted in a 30% price rise, which might have allowed Ethereum to go past $4k.\n\nInterestingly, a similar pattern had emerged earlier in March, only to break out in May. This allowed the altcoin to hit $3.89k on the charts. However, since ETH got rejected this time, the chances of history repeating itself might be slim.\n\nWon\u2019t ETH recover?\n\nAMBCrypto then took a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s current state to see whether it would fail to break out of the bullish pattern.\n\nWe found that market sentiment around the king of altcoins remained bearish. This was evidenced by the dip in its weighted sentiment after spiking on 28 June. Its network growth also dropped slightly, meaning that fewer addresses were created to transfer the token.\n\nNonetheless, a few of the metrics were in favor of a successful breakout.\n\nFor example, the MVRV ratio has improved over the last few days, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of Glassnode\u2019s data also revealed that Ethereum\u2019s NVT ratio had declined sharply. A drop in this metric usually means that an asset is undervalued \u2013 Implying an incoming price hike.\n\nAMBCrypto then took a look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to look for immediate support and resistance levels.\n\nAs per our analysis, it would be crucial for ETH to touch and go above the $3.5k-mark in order to sustain a bull rally as liquidations would rise sharply. Generally, a hike in liquidations often results in price corrections on the charts.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

This reversal indicates the overhead supply is high from market sellers and ETH buyers would need time to recuperate its momentum.\n\nConnecting the overhead peaks with a trendline reveals a potential triangle formation as the altcoin has also received dynamic support from an ascending trendline since October 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum price currently trades at $3389 and holds a market cap of $407.3 Billion. If the supply pressure persists, the coin price could plunge another 5% to seek support at the long-coming trendline.\n\nThe renewed buying pressure from the trendline could uplift the asset by 14-15% and challenge the triangle\u2019s upper boundary at $3860.
