        "content": "The chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management thinks that a setup never before seen in the history of crypto will push Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to fresh all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nIn a long thread on the social media platform X, crypto expert Travis Kling says that a confluence of factors is conspiring to fuel Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cBTC has essentially a free walk to ATHs.\n\nWe just got spot BTC ETFs, which unlock safe access to BTC for trillions of dollars that haven\u2019t previously had it.\n\nThe halving is a few months away.\n\nThe Fed is likely to cut rates multiple times this year. Stocks are at ATHs and look like they\u2019re heading higher\u2026\n\nWe can argue about the pace to ATHs (1H-24, 2H-24, 1H-25) and we can argue about how far beyond prior ATHs we\u2019ll eventually go this cycle ($75,000, $90,000, $100,000, $120,000, $180,000), but the path to ATH looks incredibly straightforward.\n\nCrypto will have to do very little \u2018work\u2019 to get BTC into the high $60,000s. It will likely just \u2018happen\u2019 because we have ETFs and the Fed is easing. We\u2019ve never had a setup like that before.\u201d\n\nThe halving, which cuts BTC miners\u2019 rewards in half, is expected in April.\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $43,022.\n\nKling says that Ethereum also has the same setup. But instead of the halving, Kling says Ethereum relies on its burn mechanism which destroys a small amount of ETH with every single transaction.\n\nThe Ikigai executive also believes that a spot market ETH is likely to get approved within the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe same setup as above is also essentially in place for ETH, just delayed by three-12 months.\n\nFor the exact same reasons that the SEC was forced to approve spot [BTC] ETFs (lost the Grayscale decision; court ruled that if you have BTC futures and BTC futures ETFs, you have to allow spot BTC ETFs), the SEC is forced to approve ETH ETFs.\n\nWe can argue about the timing of approval \u2013 March? Probably too early. May? Certainly possible but still maybe a bit early. August? Feels about right.\n\nI think it\u2019s quite unlikely we get to a year from now and won\u2019t have a spot ETH ETF.\n\nCombine that with Fed rate cuts and the reflexivity inherent in the ETH burn mechanism, and I think ETH also has a free walk to ATHs, which is up about 100% from here. Again, reasonable minds can disagree about the timing and how far beyond prior ATHs ETH will go this cycle, but it looks like basically a free walk.\n\nWe\u2019ve never had a setup like that before.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,304.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "This leading digital asset has rewarded early investors in a huge way.\n\nDespite its gut-wrenching volatility, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, and questionable utility, the cryptocurrency market doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Investors will continue to try to find winners among the wild asset class.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.80%) might make for a smart choice. This blockchain network has seen its price soar historically. If you were smart enough to invest $1,000 in Ethereum five years ago in early 2019, you'd be sitting on a balance of $21,500 today. That translates to a ridiculously large gain of over 2,000%, which crushes the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Ethereum's past, while trying to figure out what investors can expect going forward.\n\nThe second cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin was launched on the heels of the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 as the world's first cryptocurrency. With this invention, people anywhere in the world could send value to someone else without the use of an intermediary. It was truly revolutionary.\n\nBut Ethereum wanted to be much more than this. It was the second cryptocurrency, launching in 2015. The difference compared to Bitcoin was that Ethereum allowed for the creation of smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the parties of a transaction fulfill their requirements. Think of an escrow payment being released to a seller only after a buyer receives property, for example. This innovative feature put Ethereum on the map.\n\nNowadays, there are many other cryptocurrencies that enable smart contract functionality. But Ethereum is still the leader. According to Electric Capital, a venture investment fund, there were 2,400 active monthly full-time developers working on advancing Ethereum's network, far more than any other crypto asset. This bodes well for Ethereum's ability to continue introducing new features that could boost adoption over the long term.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum has already become the most popular cryptocurrency when it comes to decentralized applications (dApps). There are 3,000 different dApps operating on Ethereum. Ethereum's ultimate success will depend on its ability to drive greater use cases, something that it is well positioned to do compared to other cryptocurrencies out there.\n\nWhat the future might hold\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum originally operated with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This meant that so-called miners had to expend computational resources and energy in order to approve transactions and validate the blockchain. But because critics believe this is a waste of electricity, Ethereum made the long-anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake model in late 2022 with the completion of The Merge. This system leaves the approval of transactions to Ethereum owners who have locked up their holdings. It's meant to be significantly more energy efficient.\n\nThe Merge was viewed as a major breakthrough for Ethereum, not only due to its lower energy needs, but because it sets up the cryptocurrency to scale better in the future. The issue with Ethereum is that it can still only process 13 transactions per second, which doesn't even hold a candle to the 65,000 that a massive payments network like Visa can handle. If Ethereum wants to gain greater adoption across the world, it needs to scale better. And The Merge is one step in that process because it can help to reduce transaction fees while speeding up processing times.\n\nEthereum's developers have numerous other technical updates in the pipeline. While this does add a lot of implementation risk, as many things can go wrong that weren't anticipated, it is encouraging for supporters to see the blockchain constantly trying to improve itself.\n\nEthereum currently sits 52% below its all-time high. Bullish investors who have been on the sidelines might want to take a closer look at this cryptocurrency. It's best to start with a tiny position and potentially add more as your knowledge and conviction grow."
