        "content": "Crypto analysts at the investment management giant VanEck are predicting big things for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) in 2024.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, and Patrick Bush, a digital assets senior investment analyst, predict that Ethereum will lose market share to Solana next year due to the latter project having \u201cless uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also predict that Solana will rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, total value locked (TVL) and active users.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts. TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets. Solana currently ranks sixth among chains in terms of TVL, according to the decentralized finance aggregator DeFi Llama.\n\nSigel and Bush also predict that Solana will join the race for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. So far, financial firms have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSOL is trading at $74.05 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 6.65% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Ali Martinez is expressing bullish sentiment on Solana (SOL) amid triple-digit-percentage gains by the Ethereum (ETH) competitor this year.\n\nMartinez tells his 34,500 followers on the X social media platform that Solana could surge by around 25% from the current level if the bullish momentum is maintained.\n\n\u201cA sustained close above $68.20 will trigger a bullish breakout toward $90. But watch out for the $60 support! Any sign of weakness around this level can trigger a spike in profit-taking that sends SOL to $47.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading at $71.68 at time of writing \u2013 up by around 619% from the 2023 opening price of $9.97.\n\nTurning to Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez outlines key support and resistance areas that Bitcoin could test over the short term.\n\n\u201cBitcoin sits on stable support at $42,700. This level is significant, as 642,000 wallets have bought 347,000 BTC here.\n\nShould the bullish trend continue, we might see a push toward the next major supply zone at $47,300, where 614,000 wallets hold 427,000 BTC.\n\nHowever, if the $42,700 support breaks, all eyes will turn to the $38,000 mark as the next critical area to watch.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,423 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Chainlink (LINK), Martinez urges investors and traders to be cautious about the leading blockchain oracle.\n\n\u201cChainlink trades above a key support zone! Over 17,000 addresses bought 47 million LINK between $14.40 and $14.80.\n\nWhile this level may hold and trigger a rebound, you must watch out! Any signs of weakness could encourage investors to sell some of their LINK holdings to avoid incurring losses.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading at $16.42 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Prominent crypto analytics platform Santiment says one metric is indicating Bitcoin (BTC) may witness another leg up.\n\nSantiment says that an increase in \u201cbull trap\u201d mentions on social media platforms is indicating a spread of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) for the crypto market.\n\nHowever, the market intelligence firm says that periods following increased FUD tend to lead to a bump in prices for crypto assets and that could mean Bitcoin is on the verge of heading higher after a rally pause.\n\n\u201cTraders are fearful that crypto markets may be in a bull trap at the moment. But while Bitcoin may have stopped its momentum for the time being, Ethereum and altcoins are blasting off once again. FUD could propel BTC to $50,000 if it increases.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $44,198 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, Santiment says Ethereum has more upside potential as the biggest crypto whales holding (ETH) off of exchanges increase their wallet sizes. According to the analytics firm, non-exchange Ethereum whales hold an all-time high of 54.6 million ETH worth $128.69 billion.\n\n\u201cEthereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,353 at time of writing, down slightly on the day.\n\nLastly, Santiment says that peer-to-peer payments network Litecoin could see a bullish trend reversal as wallets holding small amounts of LTC abruptly decline amid rising FUD.\n\n\u201cApproximately 199,000 wallets that held LTC 10 days ago, no longer hold any coins. This is the biggest drop in wallets since October 2022. LTC\u2019s market value vs. BTC has dropped -55% in five months, but FUD and small wallets dropping could turn this around.\u201d\n\nLitecoin is trading for $78.21 at time of writing, up 5.55% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "For December 29 expiry, there are twice as many calls as puts and this implies Ethereum\u2019s derivatives traders are bullish on ETH price rally by the end of December. The altcoin is currently trading at $2,359 on Binance. The altcoin has sustained above the $2,300 level while Ethereum is in its uptrend. The altcoin has yielded nearly 13% weekly gains and upwards of 25% monthly gains for traders in the past month. The altcoin\u2019s trade volume has surged to $12.36 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nFor Ether , the put/call ratio is 0.38 on December 8, as seen on Deribit. For options contracts with January 26, 2024 expiry, the put/call ratio is 0.19. This rounds off to nearly 2 puts every 10 calls, a bullish bias among derivatives traders.\n\nData from Deribit reveals an underlying bullish bias among derivatives traders, on Ethereum. The put/call ratio is considered an indicator of the mood among market participants. It is a contrarian indicator and it looks at options buildup. Put/call ratio helps traders understand whether it is time to make a contrarian call on an asset.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Funding Wrap: Bitcoin, Ethereum-based projects see fresh capital - Blockworks",
        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
