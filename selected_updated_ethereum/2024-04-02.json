This could lead to additional risks as these providers will try to maximize rewards by restaking multiple times to attract more users. \"We believe what matters will be the risk-adjusted rewards and not absolute rewards, but it may be difficult to have transparency on that. This could lead to additional risks as LRT DAOs are incentivized to maximally restake multiple times to remain competitive.\""

        "title": "Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price falls for a second consecutive day as bears ignite $91.91 million of liquidated positions.\n\nPast gains during the year\u2019s second quarter can be a positive amid uncertainty in SEC's Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin explains key steps for \"The Purge\" on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nDaily digest market movers: liquidations, historical Q2 gains, and The Purge\n\nEthereum's chances of seeing a significant price boost face uncertainty as the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to show any positive sign of approving applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. As a result, much of its price movements in the past months have largely been due to its high correlation with Bitcoin rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin shed almost 6% of its value, triggering similar losses in Ethereum, which has seen more than a 6.7% decline. Losses in the two largest cryptocurrencies saw over $500.6 million liquidated from the entire crypto market in the past 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $7.48 million. The total ETH liquidations sit at $91.91 million, with long positions accounting for $75.1 million.\n\nHowever, historical records show Ethereum may still have a positive second quarter despite the downbeat start. A chart by crypto analyst @ali_charts on X shows Ethereum's Q2 results have always been positive except in 2022, when it recorded a 67.34% loss. According to the charts, ETH's Q2 historical performance has an average of 66.59% and a median of 15.29% in gains.\n\nEthereum returns in Q2 chart\n\nAlthough, he also noted that the \"high probability\" of the SEC delaying approval for a spot Ethereum ETF can cause \"turbulence in the market.\" On the contrary, a green light from the SEC would give Ethereum more institutional backing and exposure to a large number of retail traders, which may cause a rally in its price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided insights that indicate long-term progress for the cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. On Monday, he highlighted in a blog post that a lesser-known Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the EIP-6780, was introduced during the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. He mentioned that EIP-6780 is a huge part of what he terms \"The Purge.\"\n\nThe Purge would help \"slim down Ethereum and clear technical debt,\" said Buterin. In essence, it would shift workload from the main chain, reducing the computational and technical resources of running an Ethereum node while boosting decentralization and security in the process, Buterin said.\n\nIn other news, Vitalik Buterin reposted on Tuesday a former blog post he wrote squashing Layer 3s that serve the same purpose as L2s. He mentioned that L3s only make sense if they serve a different scaling purpose from an L2.\n\nAlso read: Vitalik Buterin announces next step in simplifying Ethereum protocol, ushers in the Purge\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH could fall below $3,000\n\nIn an analysis on Monday, @ali_charts said in an X post that Ethereum could crash to $2,800 if it breached the $3,400 support level. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,362.1. However, another X user noted a strong historical bidding at the $3,200-$3,000 area.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis aligns with earlier predictions by FXStreet analyst Akash Girimath, who stated that Ethereum's price could sweep the range low at $3,054 if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity run."

        "content": "It's been a rather choppy day in the cryptocurrency world. The entire crypto market is down 3.9% over the past 24 hours, as of 3 p.m. ET, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) leading the way lower. These three major tokens have declined 4.5%, 5.1%, and 7% over the same time frame, outpacing the losses of the overall market.\n\nIn the crypto world, these are three of the mostly closely watched cryptos, due to their importance to a wide range of investors. As the world's largest and second-largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are viewed as the benchmarks for the sector. Most of the value being accrued to this space goes to these two tokens, which currently account for well more than half the value of the overall sector. For investors in Dogecoin, plenty can be gleaned from this meme token's price movements with respect to sentiment in this sector, particularly among speculators.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving this price action today.\n\nThis year was supposed to the risk-on rally, was it not?\n\nMuch of today's move with respect to Bitcoin and Ethereum, seen as stores of value, appears to be tied to concerns around rate cut bets, and the effect on the U.S. dollar (which has remained very strong over the past month). As the dollar strengthens amid bets that interest rate cuts may be fewer (or farther away) than anticipated, that's going to have some impact on the valuations of these top cryptocurrencies that are benchmarked against the dollar, similar to other commodities.\n\nAdditionally, some concerns around cooling spot Bitcoin ETF demand has sent Bitcoin (and the entire market) lower today. The latest data as of April 1 shows net daily outflows from these exchange-traded products of around $1.1 billion, hurting the overall thesis that strong demand and an upcoming halving event for Bitcoin could lead to price outperformance. This could also hurt demand for Ethereum ahead of potential spot ETFs launched for this token, as well as overall institutional capital flows into this digital asset.\n\nDogecoin's decline today really needs to be put into perspective, since this token hit a fresh two-year high this week. There's still plenty of hype around the world's largest meme token relating to an upcoming meme token spinoff and an upcoming launch of futures contracts on Coinbase. But as is the case with most daily moves, Dogecoin's outsize plunge relates to its nature as a more speculative asset traders use to bet on broader price moves.\n\nIs the party over?\n\nThis crypto rally has been relatively orderly, so investors may want to consider today's decline in these three top tokens from a broader lens. Yes, a 5% to 7% daily decline in any asset is a big move. But in the larger scheme of things, these higher-risk volatile assets tend to move in such fashion on a frequent basis. Accordingly, I'm not entirely sure much can be made about today's decline signaling an end to the strong rally we've seen this year. At least, not yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, investors will certainly want to pay attention to incoming macro data and spot ETF inflows as a gauge of how demand for digital assets continues to evolve. I'm not surprised to see a downtick in ETF inflows in recent days, given the run-up we've seen thus far this year. However, it will be important to see if investors return to this asset class, or if a broader rotation is underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.
