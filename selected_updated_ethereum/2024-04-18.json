        "content": "I think they are. It\u2019s hard because the policy space is pretty confusing. The subject matter is pretty confusing. Many people they need to talk to just don't care one way or another. I mean, I'm biased, I'm on the board of Blockchain Association, but it does a really good job of keeping its membership informed, educating them about the Hill and and coming up with smart plans on how to pursue what we view as productive policy ends. Crypto lobbyists aren't some monolith. But there are people who are very effective both because they know the Hill and because they understand fundamentally what the technology is, what it can do and how we can figure out how public policy can be brought to bear to address some of the risks."

        "content": "After a rough 2022 and much of 2023, cryptocurrencies are booming again. Some of the most popular digital currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum and (perhaps surprisingly) Dogecoin.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies typically have a few things in common, what are the differences between these three popular cryptos? Quite a lot actually, and here are some of the biggest distinctions.\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies have in common\n\nCryptocurrencies are built using what\u2019s called blockchain technology, which uses a distributed ledger to produce, track and manage a digital currency. Think of it like a running digital receipt of all the transactions in the currency, including a list of who owns what and how much.\n\nThis \u201creceipt\u201d is being constantly verified by a decentralized network of computers, helping to prevent fraud and ensuring the proper functioning and accounting of the currency.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate the role of a traditional central bank in the creation, distribution and transfer of currency.\n\nCryptocurrency is \u201cmined\u201d by powerful computers called miners that perform complex math calculations to create coins. They also earn coins by processing transactions of the currency.\n\nThousands of cryptocurrencies exist, and literally any number could be created using similar blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies allow the user to move money semi-anonymously, though the FBI and IRS are getting better at tracking transactions and freezing accounts.\n\nKey differences among Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin\n\nWhen you first start learning about crypto, three names come up constantly: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. People invest in each coin for different reasons, and it\u2019s a mistake to lump the three most popular cryptocurrencies together into a single homogenous group.\n\nThe table below sums up some key differences among Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.\n\nBitcoin Ethereum Dogecoin Symbol BTC ETH DOGE Year developed 2009 2015 2013 Initial purpose Created to be used as a currency or store of value Created to sell processing power of the decentralized network Created as a joke spoof of Bitcoin and the doge meme Approximate market capitalization* $1.3 trillion $388.8 billion $23.5 billion Number of coins* 19.68 million 120 million 143.9 billion Maximum number of coins 21 million Unlimited, but issuance is fixed Unlimited, but yearly issuance limited to 5 billion coins\n\nPurpose of the cryptocurrency\n\nEach of these three cryptocurrencies was created for a different purpose. Notably, Dogecoin was a satire on the rising popularity of Bitcoin and the doge meme featuring a charismatic Shiba Inu. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum were created for more quixotic and serious purposes, including laying the foundation and framework for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem and facilitating transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket capitalization\n\nThe market capitalization of each consists of the total extant coins multiplied by the current trading price, and there\u2019s a wide divergence. Bitcoin is the largest, with Ethereum trailing a distant second and Dogecoin among the top 10, according to CoinMarketCap. Traders cluster around the most popular cryptocurrencies and volume drops significantly below the top 20.\n\nWhile these currencies may be among the most popular for traders, Bitcoin is the one that\u2019s emerged among the mainstream. It\u2019s becoming easier to access Bitcoin, with multiple ways to purchase or store the currency including the recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which lets investors get exposure to the cryptocurrency inside a traditional brokerage account. Of course, traders can also turn to popular apps to buy many cryptocurrencies, too.\n\nCoin issuance\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to note how many coins can be issued in each cryptocurrency. Many traders have flocked to Bitcoin because of its hard limit on issuance, just 21 million. If money continues to flow into Bitcoin and demand rises, this fixed limit virtually ensures that the price will rise over time. While that may be good for traders, the volatility makes Bitcoin harder to use as a currency.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2019s issuance is unlimited, but it has a fixed issuance schedule, which may slow the production of new coins. Meanwhile, the production of Dogecoin is unlimited, which is part of the joke. That unlimited issuance didn\u2019t seem to stifle the currency from skyrocketing in 2021, rising from about a half-penny a coin on Jan. 1 to more than $0.60 in May. However, the coin trended downward through the course of 2021 and well into 2022.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you\u2019re considering trading cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s valuable to understand that they\u2019re not all created equal. Some features such as Bitcoin\u2019s limited issuance may make a currency more attractive than others, at least over a longer period of time. But in the short term cryptocurrency is driven by sentiment, so even something created as a joke and with unlimited issuance may rally hard if a swell of interest sweeps in. \u201cMuch wow,\u201d as a famous doge meme might say.\n\n\u2014 Bankrate\u2019s Rachel Christian contributed to an update of this story."
