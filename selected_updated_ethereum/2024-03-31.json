        "content": "Ethereum price trades inside the $3,054 to $4,095 range on the four-hour chart.\n\nA sweep of the sell-side liquidity seems likely before ETH attempts to move $4,000.\n\nIn some cases, ETH could sweep the rang high at $4,095.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks ready for an ascent, at least from a breakout traders\u2019 perspective. But this isn\u2019t always the case as market makers or smart money tends to collect liquidity in the opposite direction first. So, eager ETH bulls need to exercise patience.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Retail watches from the sidelines with a bias for shorts\n\nEthereum price likely to trap impatient traders\n\nEthereum price set up a range, extending from $3,054 to $4,095 during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. Currently ETH is has triggered a quick ascent above the aforementioned range\u2019s midpoint at $3,574.\n\nWhile this volatile move might be alluring to trade, investors need to exercise caution. In crypto, the initial breakout is often undone by quick corrections. The aim of such a move is to collect the liquidity below key levels. In this case, ETH has produced higher highs since forming the range low on March 20.\n\nHence, a breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived, i.e., a correction might ensue soon. A sweep of $3,461 could be a good place to enter longs, provided Bitcoin (BTC) is also done with its short-term liquidity collection. In such a case, ETH is most likely to rally higher, overcome the $3,658 hurdle and eye a retest of the $4,000 psychological level. Resting, $95 above this level is the range high at $4,095, which could also be tagged if the buying pressure is high.\n\nAlso read: Crypto traders bet $2.4M on spot Ether ETF approval results\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the contrary, if Bitcoin price fails to recover after short-term liquidity run, it will most likely take altcoins down with it. In such a case, Ethereum price could sweep the range low at $3,054. A flip of the said level into a resistance level would invalidate the bullish thesis for ETH and confirm the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis development could lead to Ethereum price crashing nearly 2% and tagging the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin wants rollups to hit stage one decentralization by year-end\n\n(This story was corrected on April 1 at 06:10 GMT to say that the $4,095 level could be revisited if there is high buying pressure, not selling pressure.)"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is detailing when he believes Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins could outpace Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 321,000 YouTube subscribers that the altcoin market is setting up for a massive rally \u2013 with the ETH/BTC pair as its proxy.\n\n\u201cStill seems like the market is building for those mega 37x potential returns for altcoins. [ETH/BTC] is a bit of a proxy for the altcoin pump.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pizzino, if history repeats itself and ETH/BTC behaves the same way it did the last time Bitcoin hit its 2021 cycle peak, traders can expect a breakout of the pair sometime in the coming months. Pizzino\u2019s chart indicates that it could be in May or June.\n\n\u201cThe point here is: [we had a] new Bitcoin all-time high month, the following month was down and then ETH went on a pretty significant run from there.\n\nSo if things are similar to last time, maybe this is the move down because Bitcoin is pushing to new all-time highs, it\u2019s taking the show, then you see another red month here as Bitcoin continues on, and then a reversal here for ETH.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05145 BTC ($3,616) at time of writing.\n\nPizzino goes on to say that the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) will likely go through a similar process.\n\n\u201cSame sort of thing for Solana\u2026\n\nJust looking back at the previous cycle, [Solana was a much] weaker crypto at the time, [it is] now a lot stronger than what it was back then, but you can see also with the Bitcoin new all-time high price around November (2021), it still went lower even against [the] USD at that time, but then that was the time to skyrocket, so we\u2019re in a similar sort of period now where Bitcoin\u2019s gotten into its new all-time high.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $196 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
