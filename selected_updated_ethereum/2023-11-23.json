        "content": "The caveat is that staked assets can't be withdrawn until the Blast bridge goes live in February. In the meantime, users receive \"Blast points,\" which can be used to redeem an airdrop scheduled for May. Users can receive additional Blast points by introducing other users through unique referral links. As such, Blast is invite-only as of Thursday, requiring a code from an existing user to gain access."

        "content": "The alleged \u201conly L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins\u201d says it will launch its mainnet launch in February 2024.\n\nShare this article\n\nA new Ethereum project called Blast was announced on Monday claiming to be a Layer 2 network and promoting attractive staking yields. However, Polygon protocol engineer Jarrod Watts has called into question Blast\u2019s legitimacy, stating it is \u201cnot an L2.\u201d\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Blast has locked over $335 million in ETH and DAI in the last few days.\n\nBlast is not an L2. The Blast smart contract:\n\n1/ Accepts funds from users.\n\n2/ Stakes users' funds into protocols like LIDO. There's no testnet, no transactions, no bridge, no rollup, and no sending of transaction data to Ethereum. It's not an L2. (13/24) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) November 23, 2023\n\nWatts outlined multiple issues on Twitter, that Blast currently has no operational network for transactions or bridges back to Ethereum. Instead, the Blast smart contract accepts user deposits and stakes them into Lido ETH staking and MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol to generate yield.\n\nBlast is backed by major VC firms like Paradigm and influencers in the crypto space. However, users must trust that Blast\u2019s team of pseudonymous and mostly unknown developers will eventually build the promised technology to unlock deposits.\n\nWatts showed the bridge could be set to any basic contract, which would then have access to all $335 million in staked assets. The contract is controlled by a multi-signature wallet held by 5 newly-created addresses.\n\nWhile admitting the chances of an exploit seem low, Watts concluded \u201cIf I had to guess, I don\u2019t think the funds will be stolen.\u201d"

        "content": "Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform, predicts Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, can soar above $36,800 by the decade\u2019s end based on total addressable market projects.\n\nIn an in-depth analysis covering Ethereum on November 23, the analytics platform laid out several reasons that will drive the coin to astronomical levels, nearly 18X from spot levels.\n\nEthereum Is King, Predicted To Process $14 Trillion In Value By 2030\n\nThe Token Terminal report cited strengthening network effects, increasing token scarcity, and successful transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus as possible price drivers accelerating the rally towards $36,800. The first-mover advantage and network effects, among others, have given Ethereum a competitive advantage over rival smart contract platforms, including Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\n\n\nUsers can deploy decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions in these competing networks, mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and overly participate in web3 development. Even so, Token Terminal observes that despite Ethereum\u2019s limited scalability and fluctuating gas fees, which tend to rise in trending markets and intense network activity, discouraging engagement, it stands to dominate in the years ahead.\n\nQuantifying future adoption, Token Terminal estimates that by 2030, approximately half of the finance industry\u2019s trillion-dollar revenue will likely be flowing through Ethereum.
