Since the beginning of this week, the world's largest digital asset has slumped 9.5%, nearly 21% down from its all-time high clocked earlier this year.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, also crashed to a six-week low, erasing all the gains made since the hype of spot ETF approvals in mid-May.\n\nThe sell-offs were precipitated by the movement of 47,228 Bitcoin, worth $2.7 billion, by defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox from a cold wallet to a new wallet, possibly in preparation for payouts to its creditors.\n\nThe slump forced the largest wave of liquidations since mid-April, as $541.45 million in future contracts was wiped out in the last 24 hours. Long liquidations accounted for a whopping $472 million.\n\nBitcoin's Open Interest plunged 7% in the last 24 hours. A fall in price, coming alongside a fall in OI, is viewed by some analysts as a good sign because they think the downtrend will end once all long sellers have closed their positions.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flashed a \"Fear\" signal, implying that investors were bearish on the market prospects.
