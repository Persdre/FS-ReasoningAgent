        "content": "The founder of SkyBridge Capital says that Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) competitor have helped the firm see strong returns on its investments.\n\nIn a new interview on Bloomberg Television, Anthony Scaramucci says that October 2023 was the best month SkyBridge Capital has had on record due to BTC and smart contract platform Solana (SOL) rebounding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a good run right now. The month of October [has] probably been the best month in SkyBridge\u2019s history for that matter.

        "title": "Peter Brandt Predicts Ethereum Rally to $1,993 Upon Breakout of Right-Angled Expanding Triangle - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran trader with over 40 years of experience, has set a target of $1,993 for Ethereum (ETH) following the asset\u2019s breakout of a recently formed right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nBrandt made this projection yesterday during his latest analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements. The trader shared a daily ETH chart on X, identifying the formation of a right-angled expanding triangle pattern, which was completed on Oct. 23.\n\nA right-angled expanding triangle, or a right-angled broadening wedge, features an upper trendline and a lower trendline, with both lines expanding apart. The pattern can either signal a potential continuation of the previous trend or a reversal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nData from Brandt\u2019s chart suggests that the beginning of this pattern dates back to Aug. 17. Notably, ETH collapsed 6.76% on the day, dropping to a low of $1,683.5. However, this massive red candlestick formed the base of the right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s swings and lows since Aug. 17, the asset formed the broadening triangle, as it continued to trade within its confines until Oct. 23. Brandt\u2019s analysis emphasizes that ETH completed the formation of the triangle on Oct. 23 amid a 6.17% increase that day.\n\nETH Forms Flag Pattern, Poised to Rally 8.6%\n\nInterestingly, ETH broke above the upper trendline of the triangle, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend that began on Oct. 12. However, after the breakout, Ethereum formed a flag pattern that lasted for nine days, from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1.\n\nBrandt identified this flag pattern in his analysis. According to him, ETH recently completed the flag pattern, which is a further re-confirmation of the right-angled expanding triangle, which the asset completed on Oct. 23.\n\nNotably, flags are typically consolidation patterns that suggest a brief pause in the prevailing trend before a potential resumption of that trend. Since breaking above $1,800, ETH has consolidated between $1,744 and $1,865, but with an upward trajectory.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe asset has now completed the nine-day flag, and a bullish continuation of the uptrend is expected. Brandt\u2019s chart suggests a target of $1,993 for when Ethereum engineers another massive run. ETH would need to appreciate 8.5% from its current price to hit $1,993.\n\nEthereum trades for $1,836 as of press time, per CoinMarketCap data. The asset is up 1.76% over the past 24 hours, with its eyes set on conquering the $1,874 resistance. Impressively, ETH\u2019s trade volume has increased 71.30% to a current value of $11.6 billion, ranking it third in volume."

        "title": "Why everyone is talking about Solana in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Solana surges in 2023, joining top blockchains with its unique tech, large user base, and promising price forecasts, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nAs of 2023, Solana (SOL) has earned its place among the top 3 layer-1 blockchains, sharing the spotlight with giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Chain (BNB).\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly intriguing is that while Solana\u2019s market capitalization sits at about 7.5% of Ethereum\u2019s at nearly $16.5 billion, its daily active user base stands at 66% of Ethereum\u2019s, signaling an engaged and growing community.\n\nOver the last 30 days, SOL\u2019s price experienced a remarkable increase of nearly 90%, with a substantial 30% growth occurring in just the previous week. This aligns with the debut of Firedancer, its highly awaited scaling solution, on the testnet.\n\nMoreover, this year has been kind to Solana, showcasing a marked improvement in metrics such as uptime and transactions per second. Coinbase, a prominent US crypto exchange, acknowledges Solana as a formidable contender to Ethereum in the layer-1 blockchain space.\n\nLet\u2019s uncover the elements fueling Solana\u2019s growth, understand what it is, dissect its technological advancements, and take a closer look at its expanding community and ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Solana, and how does it work?\n\nSolana, often abbreviated as SOL, is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects at large scales.\n\nFor instance, a real-world application on Solana might be a decentralized exchange (DEX) where thousands of trades happen every second. The architecture of Solana facilitates the processing of these trades, aiming for efficiency, security, and accuracy.\n\nSolana introduces a mechanism known as proof of history (PoH), setting it apart from some traditional consensus methods. PoH is designed to generate a historical record to verify the occurrence of an event at a specific time.\n\nThis is achieved by encoding the passage of time in the data before it becomes a part of the ledger. The intention is to streamline the consensus-reaching process across nodes, as they have a shared, trusted notion of time.\n\nThis emphasis on time-saving is further realized in Solana\u2019s Tower BFT, a byzantine fault-tolerant derivative of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus.\n\nTower BFT utilizes the synchronized clock provided by PoH to reduce messaging overhead and latency. This allows for faster confirmations of transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana also features the Gulf Stream protocol, which attempts to optimize transaction handling by pre-processing and sending them to validators prior to the completion of the previous transaction set. This approach is intended to reduce confirmation times and improve network efficiency.\n\nWhen considering all these mechanisms together, Solana aims to support a high volume of transactions per second, positioning itself as a competitive entity in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana\u2019s tokenomics: understanding SOL\u2019s role and distribution\n\nSolana\u2019s financial structure is centered around its native token, SOL. This token has multiple functions within the network. The primary use of SOL is for transactions and for users to interact with dApps on the Solana platform.\n\nSimply put, if a user wants to carry out an operation or use a dApp on Solana, they need SOL.\n\nYou might also like: Solana close to 1-year high amid declining open interest\n\nStaking is another important function of SOL. Users can help secure the network by staking their SOL tokens. They can do this by either becoming validators themselves or by assigning their tokens to existing validators.\n\nThose who stake their tokens are rewarded, and the annual percentage yield (APY) for this is typically between 7-8%. However, it\u2019s important to mention that this rate can change based on several factors.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the network\u2019s security. They receive new SOL tokens as rewards, as well as a share of transaction fees. This approach encourages active participation in the network and aims to ensure its stability.\n\nRegarding the distribution of SOL, recent data shows that out of a total supply of 561 million tokens, about 420 million are in circulation. This implies that approximately 141 million SOL tokens have been burned over time.\n\nSolana use cases\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology has nurtured a variety of use cases due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Here are some notable use cases:\n\nDecentralized finance (defi)\n\nSolana\u2019s high throughput and low transaction fees make it a fertile ground for defi applications like DEXs, lending protocols, and digital wallets. Examples include Solana-based DEXs like Orca and Serum, and lending platforms like Apricot Finance and Solend\u200b.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nSolana facilitates the creation of NFT platforms and marketplaces where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Notable platforms include Metaplex and Solanart, which allow users to interact with digital artwork and other unique assets\u200b.\n\nGaming\n\nSolana hosts games with play-to-earn (P2E) systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs through gameplay. Examples include online metaverses like Chainers and Aurory, and survival-puzzle games like Naga Kingdom\u200b.\n\nWeb3 applications\n\nSolana supports the development of web3 apps that leverage modern internet technologies. Examples include Audius, a decentralized audio streaming app, Squads, a treasury fund management application, and Alchemy, a platform for building dApps quickly\u200b.\n\nCross-chain functionality\n\nSolana has also been leveraged for cross-chain transactions, as seen with the integration of USDC-SPL in Trust Wallet, enabling users to send and receive USDC with minimal fees and swift transaction times.\n\nSolana\u2019s hurdles in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Solana navigated a rough path marked by several network outages, casting a shadow on its robustness.\n\nThe most notable was a slowdown in block production on Feb. 25, following an upgrade attempt from validator software version 1.13 to 1.14, which led to considerable disruptions. Efforts to revert to version 1.13 were insufficient, ultimately necessitating a network restart.\n\nThe Solana network is currently restarting after an issue during the upgrade from 1.13 to 1.14 that slowed block finalization\n\n\n\nOnce validators with 80% of stake have restarted the network will resume\n\n\n\nYou can track the progress of the restart here:https://t.co/HclrUqWQ2y \u2014 Solana \ud83e\udded Compass \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc83 (@SolanaCompass) February 25, 2023\n\nThe February incident wasn\u2019t singular; Solana contended with multiple outages in the past, spotlighting stability as a critical area for improvement. These technical difficulties attracted criticism from the broader blockchain community and competitors, stirring a debate about Solana\u2019s reliability as a Layer 1 solution.\n\nComplicating matters, the root causes of certain outages remained elusive, even to Solana\u2019s developers, leaving some issues unresolved over extended periods. This ambiguity and the recurring downtimes prompted concerns regarding Solana\u2019s reliability, particularly given the fierce competition in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana long-term trend and price prediction\n\nThe Solana price has attracted attention recently, with many keeping a close eye on insights into its potential trajectory amid bullish market sentiment.\n\nAccording to DigitalCoinPrice, the Solana crypto price is set to reach around $83.44 by the end of 2023. The Solana price prediction for 2024 is approximately $94.60. By 2025, it\u2019s anticipated to climb to $141.53 and $389.83 by 2030.\n\nDespite the potential shown by Solana in various domains, it\u2019s essential to consider the rocky patches it navigated through in 2023, which have led some crypto analysts to project a lower price trajectory for SOL.\n\nReflecting on the slowdown in block production and recurring outages this year, some analysts have exercised caution in their forecasts, predicting an average SOL rate of around $23.89 in January 2024, which could potentially dip to a minimum of $23.34, with a maximum cap at $24.43.\n\nYou might also like: Solana gaining momentum according to Nansen report\n\nYet, those interested in the Solana crypto price should be wary of banking solely on forecasts. The volatile nature of the crypto market, combined with ever-evolving Solana news, suggests that price predictions shouldn\u2019t be the sole basis for investment decisions.\n\nInvestors must exercise caution and adhere to the cardinal rule of investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. It\u2019s advisable to conduct thorough research, understand the inherent risks, and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before making any investment decisions."
