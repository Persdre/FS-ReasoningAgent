        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum prices topped $2,050 Thursday, reaching the highest level since May. The rally comes amid rumors that BlackRock may soon file for an Ether ETF.\n\nThe chart shows Ethereum remains in a clear uptrend, with the 50-day SMA and 20-day EMA providing dynamic support.\n\nHowever, the RSI is overbought at 80, signaling the rally may be overextended short-term. This could lead to a pullback or consolidation as the indicator cools off.\n\nUpside resistance may emerge around the current highs and psychological levels above $2,000. Support could be present around the key moving averages.\n\nIf the uptrend continues, Ethereum could target new highs above $2,100. But overbought conditions raise the chance of a correction, which could retest previous lows if the trend shifts bearish.\n\nBlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust this week, sparking speculation it will submit an ETF application to the SEC soon. The asset manager took a similar step before filing for a Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "The BlackRock logo is displayed at its headquarters in New York City, Nov. 14, 2022.\n\nAsset management giant BlackRock appeared to take the first steps toward an ether ETF on Thursday, sparking a rally in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe website for Delaware's Division of Corporations showed that an iShares Ethereum Trust was registered Thursday. A similar notice for the iShares Bitcoin Trust came one week before BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin ETF in June.\n\nBlackRock declined comment on the matter. The firm's iShares product is the leader in exchange-traded funds with more than $2.3 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThe price of ether jumped 7% on Thursday, topping $2,000 for the first time since April. Bitcoin's price saw a similar rise when asset managers began filing to launch ETFs this summer.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has still not approved a bitcoin ETF. The regulator has long opposed such a fund and blocked Grayscale's attempt to convert its bitcoin trust product into an ETF, though a court overruled that decision in August.\n\nThe SEC did not appeal that court decision but still could choose to block Grayscale's conversion and the other bitcoin funds in the pipeline, including BlackRock's, for other reasons.\n\nIf the SEC does allow bitcoin ETFs, then ether funds would likely be next in line. Ether is the second most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "BlackRock has taken the initial step toward filing for a spot Ether ETF, with the iShares Ethereum Trust recently registered in Delaware.\n\nThis move is reminiscent of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which was registered in a similar fashion seven days before the ETF application was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn the context of an industry bristling with anticipation for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s move potentially signals a pivotal moment for Ethereum, shedding light on its status as a prospective asset class in institutional investment portfolios.\n\nDespite the positive indications, it\u2019s important to recall the precedent set by the SEC\u2019s handling of Bitcoin ETFs. As reported by CryptoSlate in October 2023 Source, despite rumors indicating otherwise, the SEC had not approved the iShares Bitcoin ETF. The regulator had delayed its verdict on several proposed rule changes, which included applications from leading firms such as Fidelity (Wise Origin), VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nIn light of this, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust registration, while a significant development, leads us into a territory of considerable uncertainty. The SEC\u2019s previous hesitance to approve Bitcoin ETFs might cast a long shadow over BlackRock\u2019s budding Ethereum trust, potentially heralding a new cycle of applications, approvals, delays, and rejections.\n\nAs the crypto community watches these developments with bated breath, two things have been game-changers for the industry: Grayscale\u2019s court victory and BlackRock\u2019s entry into the market. Ethereum ETFs, in this context, may just be the next frontier. However, for now, all eyes are trained on the SEC as the crypto industry awaits its verdict on the pending rule changes and the potential approval of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Trust filing surfaces as another key narrative to monitor closely. As the crypto industry continues to evolve and mature, such developments underscore the increasing intersectionality of traditional finance and digital asset markets, hinting at a prospective future where digital currencies like Ethereum may become more commonplace in institutional investment portfolios.\n\nMentioned in this article"
