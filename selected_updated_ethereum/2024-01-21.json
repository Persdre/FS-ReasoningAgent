        "content": "Crypto analytics firm Kaiko says that speculative fervor on Ethereum (ETH) hasn\u2019t yet kicked off, despite being well off its 2022 lows.\n\nIn a new report, Kaiko says that Bitcoin has benefited from the hype surrounding the approval of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, but that speculation on an Ethereum ETF has not yet begun.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently decided to delay its decision on banking giant Fidelity\u2019s spot market Ethereum ETF application until March.\n\nSays Kaiko,\n\n\u201cWhile there is some hype around ETH ETF applications, the data suggest that aggressive speculation hasn\u2019t yet begun. ETH trade volume has spiked, but derivatives markets have lacked the telltale signs of traders positioning for a rally. ETH futures ETFs have also had a slow few months of trading.\n\nETH and BTC correlation has sunk to multi-year lows as each asset matures and develops its own narratives. While ETFs were one of the most catalyzing narratives in BTC\u2019s history, it remains to be seen whether ETH will be able to replicate this. However, ETH has many narratives it can lean on; if ETFs don\u2019t spur enthusiasm, perhaps new Layer-2s or the success of EigenLayer and restaking can.\u201d\n\nKaiko says that derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have largely been driven by spot markets rather than by perpetual futures, which the firm says provides evidence that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October marked a low point in futures markets, with aggregated open interest (in USD) falling more than 20% from its summer levels. At this time, there was little price movement and funding rates were neutral\u2026\n\nPost-BTC approval, funding rates have reset to neutral, while open interest has surged ahead of price, indicative of increased shorting. Even still, we have not yet seen a major build-up in open interest that is typical of a bull market.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What Are Parallelized EVMs? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, allowing multiple transactions to be executed at the same time rather than sequentially.\n\nThe blockchain landscape is constantly evolving to overcome limitations and unlock new possibilities. One of the latest innovations to address scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem is Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs).\n\nRead on to learn about parallelized EVMs and the potential impact of parallelization on Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nWhat Are Parallelized EVMs?\n\nTo understand parallelized EVMs, let\u2019s first grasp the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe EVM allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. It provides the infrastructure vital to all transactions happening on the blockchain. The growing adoption of Ether and other Ethereum-based tokens strains the EVM, leading to calls for its scaling.\n\nOne intervention that\u2019s gaining traction is parallelized EVMs.\n\nParallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency by allowing multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nImagine them as supercharged versions of their predecessor capable of handling multiple transactions together. This approach is crucial in tackling the blockchain trilemma as it significantly reduces latency, boosting transaction throughput.\n\nSome of the front runners in the PEVM adoption are the Sei network, Neon, and Monad. The Sei Network went live in August 2023, attracting roughly 29,000 active users. Neon is also active and working on integrating Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) into the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monard is yet to launch despite being production-ready.\n\nHow Do Parallelized EVMs Work?\n\nPEVMs leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve timely and scalable transactions.\n\nUnlike the typical EVMs that handle transactions back-to-back, PEVMs split transactions into smaller, independent tasks that can be tackled simultaneously. This means setting up different points for the concurrent handling of multiple trades.\n\nThere are many approaches to parallel processing, but two popular ones stand out:\n\nSharding : Imagine dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, self-contained shards, each with its own EVM. Transactions are then distributed across these shards, allowing for independent and simultaneous processing.\n\nRollups: These batch transactions off the main Ethereum chain, processing them on a separate layer, and then re-submitting them to the mainnet for verification. This significantly reduces the burden on the main Ethereum network, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Parallelized EVMs on Ethereum\n\nPEVMs can significantly reduce transaction times and fees by removing network bottlenecks, making Ethereum more user-friendly and accessible to developers and users alike.\n\nWith PEVMs paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions, Ethereum can potentially handle a much larger volume of activity. This opens the door to widespread adoption of dApps and DeFi, bringing the power of blockchain to a broader audience.\n\nThe increased processing power of PEVMs could unleash a wave of more complex and resource-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on Ethereum. Applications that might have previously been impractical on the blockchain could become feasible.\n\nAdditionally, making improvements on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet could significantly impact other Ethereum layers. L2 scaling solutions could gain more attention, leading to further development and adoption among users.\n\nPEVMs, however, also present a possible downside. The technical complexity required to implement parallelized EVMs might lead to centralization if only a few big players can implement it. They could also present backward compatibility and transition challenges to existing smart contracts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Parallelized EVMs\n\nPEVMs could hold so much promise for crypto enthusiasts. But like any technology, it could have its drawbacks too.\n\nPros\n\nReduced transaction latency: Devolving transaction handling to many units hastens their confirmation. Users will no longer have to endure lengthy completion times due to network clogging.\n\nLower transaction fees: PEVMs streamline transactions, eliminating the need to pay more for prioritized exchanges, which makes transaction fees more affordable.\n\nEnhanced Interoperability: PEVM projects such as Neon are working on bringing Ethereum dApps to Solana. Such initiatives will make it easy for users to interact with their peers on different networks without migrating to their platforms.\n\nCons\n\nIncreased complexity: Implementing and maintaining robust PEVMs can be technically demanding. As such, developers and users may face a steep learning curve.\n\nPotential security risks: Parallel processing introduces new synchronization and coordination challenges, increasing the likelihood of bugs and errors with improper implementation\n\nFinal Word\n\nParallelized EVMs are the latest attempt at achieving Ethereum scalability. By introducing parallel processing capabilities, PEVMs open the doors to various applications, from real-time financial transactions to seamless cross-chain exchanges. However, these novel projects require meticulous development and rigorous security edits to ensure stability."
