        "content": "A turning point came last year when the U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash \u2013 a \"privacy mixing\" program on Ethereum that helped people transact without leaving a trace. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said the program was used by terrorists and other U.S.-sanctioned entities, so it added Tornado's Ethereum-based computer code to the same blacklist as Iran, North Korea and Hamas. In response, some blockchain advocates were defiant; they balked at OFAC's attempt at \"censorship\" and gloated that Ethereum would be immune to it as a result of its decentralized construction."

We're the first exchange to list $EURCV! EUR CoinVertible is Societe Generale-FORGE's innovative stablecoin, aiming for stability and safety in the volatile world of digital assets. \ud83c\udf10 You can start trading it on Bitstamp today. Dive in for more details:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Lt98ysjfeo \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) December 6, 2023\n\nEURCV is an ERC20 token, designed to provide a low volatility cryptocurrency that maintains a stable value equivalent to the Euro. The stablecoin is backed by cash deposits and cash equivalents denominated in EUR.\n\nSociete Generale states that robust legal structures are in place to ensure the segregation and availability of reserve assets to token holders.\n\nCrypto exchange Bitstamp is opening order books for the EURCV/USDT and EURCV/EUR trading pairs. Flowdesk, a crypto market maker, has been selected to provide liquidity and active market-making for EURCV on Bitstamp and other exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to partner with SG-FORGE as a designated market maker, a pivotal role in realizing our shared vision of a tokenized financial future. Looking ahead as we approach 2024, we envision a transformative impact where compliant blockchain-based operations by institutions will drastically increase in volume,\u201d said Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Flowdesk.\n\nInitially, EURCV deposits and withdrawals will only be enabled for investors whitelisted by Societe Generale. The bank states that its existing KYC and AML compliance procedures will apply to onboarding digital token holders.\n\nWhile not the first Euro stablecoin, EURCV is the first to have the backing of a major regulated European bank. A state-owned bank in Brazil called the Brazilian National Social Development Bank issued a stablecoin backed 1-for-1 by the Brazilian real in 2018. Circle and Tether have also launched similar euro-pegged tokens aimed at retail investors.\n\nThe EURCV launch comes soon after Societe Generale\u2019s first bond issuance on the public blockchain Ethereum. The \u20ac100 million digital green bond was fully subscribed to by institutional asset managers AXA and Generali."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt comments on Ethereum price action as the market embarks on a fresh crypto rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged to $44,000 for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also soared in response to the bullish impulse, touching highs of $2,312 in today's trading session.\n\nIn a new tweet, Brandt asks his 705,100 followers if Ethereum will emerge from the shadows anytime soon. He says that at least three narratives are possible, about which he launched a poll for his followers to participate in.\n\nVisual for reference pic.twitter.com/16YP1sZMQL \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 6, 2023\n\nBrandt's three narratives include a classic wedge that targets the $900 price for ETH. The second narrative is a running wedge pattern, which, if verified, has a price target of $3,300.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famed trader's third narrative is \"Morphology ahead,\" which could imply that the Ethereum price action is still brewing and in the process of taking a particular form or structure. Brandt provides a visual representation of these price patterns.\n\nThe first option, the classic wedge, received 24% of votes in favor. The amount of 60.7% of respondents voted for the more likely option of a running wedge with a target of $3,300 given the current market standing. A total of 15.3% of the respondents voted for the 'Morphology ahead' option.\n\nTypically, a wedge pattern can indicate either bullish or bearish price reversals. A rising wedge (which indicates a bearish reversal) or a descending wedge (which indicates a bullish reversal) are the two types of wedge patterns.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had gained 2.16% in the previous 24 hours and was trading at $2,264.\n\nIn ETF-related news, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it will take more than 45 days to review a rule change that would allow Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline has been set for Jan. 25, 2024."
