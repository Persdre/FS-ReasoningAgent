        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has unveiled an updated road map for the blockchain platform, focusing on long-term strategic upgrades. These updates are part of Ethereum's ongoing effort to bolster network security and optimize its protocol for a more efficient system.\n\nCombating centralization in PoS\n\nIn the realm of PoS, centralization can create vulnerabilities and unfair advantages, an issue Buterin is tackling head-on.\n\nThe updated \"The Scourge\" phase targets MEV, which refers to the maximum value that miners can extract from block production beyond the standard block rewards and gas fees. This practice can lead to centralization as it favors larger players with more resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin's strategy involves exploring new MEV mechanics and distributing blocks to mitigate these risks. Additionally, the road map addresses stake pooling issues by considering revised staking economics and validator experience improvements, which could lead to a more decentralized and secure network.\n\nInnovations in data storage and efficiency\n\nProgress in the \"The Verge\" phase signifies a significant step toward integrating Verkle trees, a data structure that promises to optimize storage and increase transaction efficiency on the Ethereum network. This move aligns with the broader goal of scalability and performance enhancement.\n\nFurthermore, the plan reflects a community consensus to deprioritize \"state expiry,\" recognizing the potential of stateless clients and other innovations to manage blockchain state more effectively.\n\nThese developments represent a deliberate and methodical approach to Ethereum's evolution, with an emphasis on timely and incremental improvements rather than waiting for large-scale overhauls."

        "content": "Crypto ETF approvals could attract a portion of the $5.6 trillion US pension market to crypto.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum will unlock \u201cthe universe of the pensions, insurers, etc,\u201d says Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn an interview with FOX Business, McDermott discussed the future impact of spot ETF approval on institutional adoption and commercial opportunities within the digital asset sector.\n\nAccording to McDermott, spot crypto ETFs will create \u201cinstitutional products that can be traded by institutions that don\u2019t need to touch the base assets.\u201d This will enhance liquidity and attract more pension funds, insurance firms, and other institutional investors to crypto.\n\nWith the US pension market now over $5.6 trillion, it\u2019s easy to see why McDermott envisions spot crypto ETFs attracting institutional capital. The approval of such products would enable more institutional participation in the digital asset space.\n\nMcDermott noted that while spot crypto ETFs may have a gradual impact rather than an immediate spike, he expects to see \u201ca broadening and a deepening of liquidity and those looking to trade the product\u201d in 2023.\n\nThe Growth Potential in Digital Assets\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, McDermott believes the blockchain industry will continue expanding due to increasing real-world adoption and supportive regulations. Over the past year, clearer policies and frameworks have already driven more institutional involvement in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs announced the launch of its tokenization platform, GS DAP, to streamline the issuance, management, and trading of tokenized assets across various asset classes.\n\nIn 2020, Matthew McDermott joined Goldman as head of digital assets. Known for his visionary approach to financial markets, he believes blockchain technology is key to revitalizing and empowering the financial system."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s price teeters: What about its bullish prediction? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH may fall to $2,215 as large sell-off spreads.\n\nTraders are confident that the altcoin will recover in no time.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, a whale sent 14,610 Ethereum [ETH] tokens to the Coinbase exchange on the 30th of December. The transaction was the second one within 12 hours after an initial transfer involving 9,991 ETH.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of the transaction was worth $33.50 million. The move is a sign that the altcoin might be at risk of selling pressure.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency keeps experiencing a high inflow into exchanges, then the price could drop from $2,220.\n\nInterestingly, the last week of 2023 has given the ETH a turnaround. On the 28th of December, the value of ETH hit $2,415 as AMBCrypto reported.\n\nThis increase gave the Ethereum community a glimmer of hope that the ETH price season to shine was close.\n\nNo backing down on the potential\n\nHowever, the past few days indicated that ETH holders might need to wait a little longer for an extended rally. But what do traders think of the price action?\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed ETH\u2019s funding rate via the crypto analysis tool Santiment.\n\nFunding rates show if long are paying a funding fee to shorts. It also indicates if it\u2019s the other way around. If the Funding Rate is positive, then most traders are bullish. Also, a negative Funding Rate suggests more short positions than longs.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.031%. This reading suggested that traders were bullish on the price at press time.\n\nAnother metric to consider in assessing market perception toward ETH is the Weighted Sentiment. From the chart above, the Weighted Sentiment had dropped from 2.47 to 0.48.\n\nThe decline suggested the broader market was being careful in betting on the Ethereum native cryptocurrency.\n\nETH eyes another downturn\n\nRegarding the Open Interest, Coinglass showed that the indicator had risen to $8.40 billion. Open Interest measures market sentiment and strength behind price trends.\n\nSo, the increase means that money was flowing into contracts related to ETH. However, it could also be a sign of strength for the downward trend ETH\u2019s price was going through.\n\nFrom the ETH/USD 4-hour chart, the altcoin had felt the impact of the sell-offs as the price decreased to $2,290. A look at the Awesome Oscillator (AO) also showed that the momentum around the coin was bearish.\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO was -10.45.\n\nShould the indicator remain that way, then ETH\u2019s price might plunge further. Another indicator to consider was the Fibonacci Retracement. At press time, the 0.786 Fib Retracement level was at $2,215.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis position indicated that ETH might drop to the region as long as selling pressure remained.\n\nHowever, $2,215 could be a good entry. This is because ETH has the potential to rebound, since the price was a previous support level for the altcoin."

        "content": "The last twelve months have been nothing short of a wild ride for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, from BTC price revival \u2014 the cryptocurrency jumped by more than 160% in 2023 \u2014 to innovations in the Web3 industry and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), to the government crackdowns on the industry.\n\nEven amid all this hullabaloo, crypto continues to be an enticing money-making gig. Take the record 19 billionaires \u2014 7 more than last year \u2014 who made a fortune after investing in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat links Elon Musk, the Winklevoss Twins \u2014 owner of crypto exchange Gemini \u2014 and Michael Saylor? They\u2019re all connected to some cryptocurrency. While Musk and Tesla are, more often than not, tied to Dogecoin and Bitcoin, respectively, the other two names have significant Bitcoin holdings.\n\nLargest ETH Holder Owns 29% of All Ethereum Tokens In Circulation\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, it\u2019s a different story altogether. Even the largest holders of ETH are often out of the limelight. However, data from Etherscan revealed that crypto exchanges were the largest holders of ETH in 2023, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, given ETH\u2019s availability on every exchange.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. Remember, these are only ballpark estimates.\n\n\n\nThe Beacon Chain Contract holds more than 35 million ETH, controlling over 29% of all ETH tokens in circulation, making it the largest ETH holder as of Dec 28, 2023. Coming in second place is Wrapped ETH (WETH) with more than 3.2 million ETH, worth around $7.7 billion.\n\nBinance has significant ETH Holdings\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, is the third-largest single address for ETH, holding more than nearly 2 million ETH. Kraken, which was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month for deceptive practices, grabbed the fourth spot, with ETH holdings of roughly 1.6 million.\n\nPopular trading platform, Robinhood is fifth on the list. At the time of writing, it had more than 1.4 million ETH under its belly, which loosely translates to about 1.24% of all ETH tokens in circulation.\n\nNotably, two other wallet addresses in the top 10 \u2014 each holding more than 550,000 ETH \u2014 are linked to crypto exchange giant Binance. Rounding off the top 10 are Arbitrum: Bridge, with holdings of over 1.3 million, and Bitfinex, with more than 450,000 ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that an ETH address linked to Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, named VB 3, holds more than 240,000 ETH.\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.
