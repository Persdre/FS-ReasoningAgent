        "content": "Kraken Head of Strategy Thomas Perfumo said spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs could help the crypto sector while commenting on political developments in the US.\n\nOn July 12, Perfumo told Bloomberg that spot Ethereum ETFs would attract capital flows while attracting attention to crypto, noting:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rising tide, lifts all boat story. \u201c\n\nPerfumo further explained that Ethereum\u2019s eventual value \u201chinges on the Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nHe said that the crypto market is \u201cpricing in\u201d $750 million to $1 billion of net inflows to Ethereum products on a monthly basis, which would imply that Ethereum could reach all-time highs between $4,000 and $5,000.\n\nPerfumo also compared expectations to Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in March, which he called a \u201cquiet peak\u201d that occurred without any evidence of millions of new investors entering the industry.\n\nPolitical developments\n\nPerfumo also commented on political developments. Early in the interview, he said US election outcomes will \u201cset the tone for policy making and the legislative agenda for the next four years.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of legislative action and clarity and noted that recent developments show bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nThe House recently decided to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and attempted to repeal the SEC\u2019s controversial accounting rules along with the Senate. However, President Joe Biden chose to veto the resolution.\n\nPerfumo said:\n\n\u201cEven though you\u2019ve hit barriers at the executive level, [there\u2019s] still good progress going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Republican party appears \u201cmore pro-crypto [and] more progressive\u201d on the matter, noting Donald Trump\u2019s plans to attend the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.\n\nTrump has also made numerous statements in favor of pro-crypto policy, including at recent campaign events in Wisconsin and San Francisco.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic is likely to face rejection at its former support zone\n\nOBV and Open Interest showed buyer enthusiasm was low\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] has retraced all of the gains it made during the rally from January to March. Back then, the altcoin\u2019s price had risen from $18.33 to $39.67 at the apex. Alas, the market\u2019s buyers have been underwhelming since then.\n\nThe fall below the $22.9-level meant that a new bearish move seemed more likely than a recovery. Here are the levels and scenarios that ETC swing traders need to watch out for.\n\nFormer support level is now the short-term bullish target\n\nIn April and again in June, the 78.6% retracement level at $22.9 was tested and defended as support. However, the Awesome Oscillator and the price action revealed that a strong downtrend was in play in June.\n\nSupport levels at the 50% and 61.8% retracement zones were lost quickly to sellers and in July, the bears marked another victory by forcing a descent below $22.9. The recent bounce from $18.3 doesn\u2019t mean the bulls are winning though.\n\nInstead, Ethereum Classic swing traders would want to take short positions around the $23.2-$24.1 zone. More conservative bears can wait for a bearish engulfing candle to go short. With the OBV just barely above its three-month support level and the AO resolutely below neutral zero, the bearish argument is very convincing.\n\nOpen Interest at its lowest since October 2023\n\nThe weakness of the bulls was captured by the Open Interest chart. Alongside the price, the OI has slid persistently and stood at $89.7 million at press time.\n\nDespite the 10.6% price hike over the past week, the speculators did not seem too keen to bid.\n\nAdditionally, the spot CVD halted its downtrend over the past week and was slowly climbing higher at press time. The funding rate was positive, underlining the presence of bullish sentiment.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe short liquidations on 8 July after the rejection from $21 suggested a liquidity hunt. Traders should be on the lookout for a price surge that takes out short positions, as that might warn of a liquidity hunt in the opposite direction during the move towards the $23 resistance zone.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "title": "Ethereum gas fees hit new low as Pectra dawns \u2013 What next? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum fees declined significantly and hit its lowest point in over a month\n\nDevelopers continued to work on the Pectra update, with the testnet expected to launch next week\n\nEthereum [ETH] has seen a significant surge in price over the past week, with the altcoin even managing to push past the $3,000-level. This has inspired some hope among investors. Despite the positive price movement though, overall interest in the Ethereum ecosystem declined.\n\nGassed out\n\nCryptoquant analyst Woominkyu\u2019s analysis of Ethereum gas fees revealed a downward trend since May 2024, reaching its lowest point in recent months. This suggests a relatively quieter period of network activity on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s chart visualized the average gas fee (Gwei) in blue, while the black line tracked Ethereum\u2019s price. Historically, periods of increased gas fees have often coincided with upward price movements for Ethereum.\n\nNew developments underway\n\nEven though interest in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem seems to be slowing down, new developments on the Ethereum network may help attract users to the network.\n\nEthereum developers on 11 July discussed advancements for development on the Ethereum network. Progress on the Pectra and PeerDAS testnets were the primary focus. Developers expressed confidence in launching Pectra the following week, while addressing remaining issues on PeerDAS. For context, PeerDAS stands for Peer Data Availability Sampling. It\u2019s essentially a method being explored to improve the scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nAdditionally, preparations for the Pectra testnet launch are now underway. Various client combinations are being tested to ensure a smooth transition. Efforts to integrate the EthereumJS client into the Pectra testnet are progressing too.\n\nAlongside testnet development, research is also being done into potential vulnerabilities in Ethereum\u2019s client software. A tool designed to identify these issues is being developed and refined with the goal of enhancing network security.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nOverall, the Pectra upgrade is primarily focused on adjusting the blob gas limit. Blobs are essentially data chunks that are processed off-chain to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nBy modifying the blob gas limit, the Pectra upgrade aims to optimize the efficiency of data processing and potentially enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,139.96 following a 2.23% hike in the last 24 hours.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the volume with which ETH was trading declined by 26.55% over the same period too."

        "title": "Key insights from Ethereum's performance in current bull cycle - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum's price has followed a divergent pattern in the first 365 days after a Bitcoin halving event.\n\nOver 90% of ETH's supply has been in profit since January.\n\nEthereum investors are slowly displaying confidence again with ETH ETFs on horizon.\n\nEthereum is up 0.3% on Friday as key insights from Glassnode reveal ETH's next potential move as the current bull cycle matures.\n\nDaily digest market movers: How ETH has performed so far in current cycle\n\nDespite earlier predictions that the agency would likely approve issuers' spot ETH ETF S-1 registration statements, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has remained silent. While the SEC remains mum, key on-chain data provide insight into key historical price moves in Ethereum and how they may affect the current cycle:\n\nEthereum has followed a somewhat divergent market performance in the first year after a Bitcoin halving event, according to Glassnode. In 2016, ETH suffered a 45% drawdown before picking up the pace to rally about 3,400%. In the 2020 halving, ETH charged up by 150% before rising about 2,150%. Since the past halving in April, its price has remained relatively flat.\n\n\n\nETH Price Performance after Halving\n\n\n\nEthereum has often experienced steeper drawdowns than Bitcoin during the early and later stages of previous bull cycles. In previous cycles, ETH saw corrections of above 65%. However, the largest drawdown in the current cycle is quite low compared to others, coming in at -42%.\n\n\n\nThe total supply of ETH in profit crossed the 90% mark in January and remained relatively above it throughout H1. According to Glassnode, extended periods where 90% of a coin's supply is in profit often indicate the later stage of a bull cycle. This is characterized by profit-taking from investors, which in turn outweighs demand.\n\n\n\nETH Percent Supply in Profit\n\n\n\nETH's growth is evident in its 267% rise, adding $354 billion to its market capitalization since the FTX lows of November 2022.\n\nETH technical analysis: ETH investors are slowly gaining confidence again\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,135 on Friday, up by a mere 0.3% on the day. After posting a bearish exhaustion candle, ETH briefly declined to $3,060, sparking over $40 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. Long and short liquidations accounted for 81% and 19% of total liquidations, respectively.\n\nThe move saw ETH's total liquidations flipping that of Bitcoin despite its relatively lower market cap. This could prime ETH to begin a fresh move toward the upside.\n\nETH options Open Interest (OI) declined to $5.16 billion on Monday, its lowest level in the past year. The move signified heightened uncertainty among traders as ETH's price retraced below $3,000.\n\nHowever, following a slowdown in the bearish pressure and a slight rebound in ETH's price, ETH options OI has begun climbing up again, nearing the $6 billion mark on Friday. The price recovery and rising OI indicate traders are slowly gaining confidence in ETH again.\n\nThis is also evident in ETH's Long/Short Ratio, which has risen to 1.04 in the past few hours.\n\nWith the potential launch of Ethereum ETFs on the horizon and BTC seeing heavy selling pressure from miners, the German Government, and Mt. Gox repayment, investors may reallocate capital into ETH. However, the SEC's delay to greenlight issuers ETH ETF S-1 drafts may hamper a good price increase.\n\nAs a result, ETH will likely follow a horizontal trend within the $2,852 to $3,300 range but slightly tilted toward the upside until the SEC moves on ETH ETFs.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, ETH may drop to around $3,041 in the short term, where there is a liquidity wall of $35.57 million, before rebounding."

        "content": "Ethereum price has seen a notable increase in value over the past day following the market recovery. ETH price is hovering above $3,100 after an upward trend over the recent hours.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading at $3,155 with a surge of 3% during the US trading hours. The current market capitalization stands at $379 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe trading volume for Ethereum has experienced a significant increase, rising 27% in the past 24 hours to approximately $11 billion. This uptick in volume indicates heightened trading activity and interest in Ethereum during this market recovery period.\n\nOver the past week, Ethereum price has been trading in a range bound between $2,800 and $3,1500. The popular cryptocurrency saw a 5% increase in value over the seven days. During this time, several market events have influenced price movements. A significant drop was observed, where prices briefly dipped before recovering strongly above the $3,100 mark.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction: ETF Speculation Fuels Optimism\n\nEthereum\u2019s spot ETF might trigger significant investments into the cryptocurrency sector, potentially seeing $1 billion added monthly. This forecast comes from Thomas Perfumo, Kraken\u2019s Head of Strategy, during his Bloomberg interview.\n\nPerfumo highlighted the Ethereum spot ETF as the foremost of four major growth drivers for the cryptocurrency market in the latter half of 2024. He predicts the ETF\u2019s approval would garner substantial interest from the broader financial community, channeling more capital into cryptocurrencies. According to him, this development marks a pivotal moment, promising to transform market dynamics by attracting new investors.\n\nCan ETH Potential Surge Towards $3,300 Soon?\n\nEthereum price prediction is on the brink of a significant market move. If it successfully breaks through the $3,200 resistance mark, it could ignite a bullish trend, pushing its value close to $3,300. This surge could set the stage for a challenge against the $3,400 level.\n\nConversely, a market downturn could see Ethereum price retreat to the $3,100 support. Prolonged bearish pressure might further drive its price down to $2,900, signaling a potential bearish shift in the market trend.\n\nTechnical Indicators Show Signs of Bullish Momentum for ETH\n\nThe 4-hour technical indicators for Ethereum price show signs of a bullish trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator currently displays a positive crossover. The MACD line (blue) has crossed above the signal line (orange), suggesting potential for upward price movement.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 57. This level is slightly below the overbought territory (typically above 70), indicating that there is still room for upward price momentum before the asset becomes overbought.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Ethereum 2.0? Ethereum 2.0, often referred to as Eth2, encompasses a series of upgrades aimed at enhancing Ethereum's scalability, security, and sustainability. 2. When will Ethereum 2.0 be released? The initial phase, the Proof of Stake Beacon Chain, was launched in December 2020.
