        "title": "Ethereum: Here\u2019s the latest prediction for its price and supply - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%\n\nProjections highlighted interesting observations for Ethereum\u2019s supply\n\nMore than 307,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins have exited circulation since the pivotal \u2018Merge\u2019 event. In fact, this was the lowest volume of ETH in circulation since the network made a historic shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nETH\u2019s supply goes south\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s scrutiny of ultra sound money data, the net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%. This might appear inconsequential to some but fathom this \u2013 Had the transition not taken place, ETH\u2019s total supply would have increased by more than 4.71 million with an annual inflation rate of 3.168%.\n\nScarcity is critical to the long-term demand of any financial asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the fewer tokens in circulation, the greater the likelihood of price increases, provided demand for the asset remains the same.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s current supply stood at 120.21 million. As per long-term projections, the supply has hit its peak, with the same to gradually start declining from next year. By the end of 2025, the total number of ETH in circulation is predicted to shrink to 117.7 million.\n\nA much-needed respite\n\nThis is a welcome development as not too long ago, ETH became inflationary owing to poor participation on the network. For much of September and early October, more coins were getting created than they were burned.\n\nAs examined by AMBCrypto using Glassnode\u2019s data, network fees tumbled to yearly lows during the aforementioned period. This suggested that transactions on the network had declined, leading to fewer ETH getting burned.\n\nNote that a part of the fee charged for validating transactions, called base fee, is burned and removed from circulation. Generally, a bull market with high network usage aids deflation and vice versa.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMarket still upbeat, despite pullback\n\nAt press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $2.240, having just recorded one of the sharpest corrections since the commencement of the bull rally in October.\n\nHaving said that, the market sentiment remains optimistic. Greed remains uniform across the market, with AMBCrypto using Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to highlight the same. This is a key finding since it is generally assumed that greed drives the asset\u2019s value higher."

        "title": "Ethereum burns $2.5B worth of ETH since merge as supply drops to 18 month low - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data on Ultrasound Money reveals a continued shift in its economic model since the historic merge in Sept. 2022.\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply stands at 309,663 ETH, equivalent to approximately $686.2 million. This reduction reflects a deflationary trend, contrasting the previous inflationary nature where new ETH was consistently created. The cause of this shift can be traced to the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, valued at around $2.65 billion. Permanently removing tokens from circulation plays a crucial role in reducing the total supply and could enhance ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time. Further, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH, worth about $1.96 billion, Ethereum\u2019s total supply experienced a net decrease, illustrating that the rate of ETH burning continues to surpass the rate of new issuance.\n\nPresently, the total supply of Ethereum stands at the lowest point since the merge at 120,211,380 ETH, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $266.39 billion, reinforcing its significant standing in the crypto market.\n\nA look at the ETH burning leaderboard presents further insights by analyzing the leading contracts contributing to the burning of ETH. The top contributors to this activity include major dApps and services, notably Uniswap in its various iterations, Tether, and OpenSea. Uniswap\u2019s prominent position suggests a high transaction volume within the DeFi sector, with $543.8 million burned across four contracts in the top 10.\n\nThe presence of Tether indicates substantial stablecoin transactions on Ethereum\u2019s network, while OpenSea\u2019s inclusion highlights the enduring nature of NFT transactions even through the bear market. This diversity, encompassing DeFi platforms, stablecoins, NFT marketplaces, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, showcases the multifaceted utilization of Ethereum.\n\nBurned ETH Entity Value (USD) 84,006.46 Uniswap Universal Router $186,158,315.36 75,926.77 Uniswap V2 $168,253,722.32 74,739.31 ETH transfers $165,622,310.96 58,030.71 Uniswap Universal Router 2 $128,596,053.36 53,626.72 Tether $118,836,811.52 27,441.92 Uniswap V3 $60,811,294.72 26,935.76 New contracts $59,689,644.16 23,405.50 OpenSea $51,866,588.00 22,891.92 Arbitrum $50,728,494.72 22,201.66 MetaMask $49,198,878.56\n\nSource: ultrasound.money\n\nThe top 10 contracts total $1,039,762,113.68 worth of ETH burned, just under half of the total burn since the merge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value, especially when contrasted with inflationary fiat currencies. The heightened activity in decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications indicates a robust trend toward decentralized finance.\n\nInterestingly, under its current proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the Ethereum network has burned an average of 1.83 ETH/min since the merge. However, since the burn mechanic was implemented as part of the EIP-1559 upgrade in Aug. 2021, the average burn rate is almost double, 3.09 ETH/min. Yet, due to the drastic reduction in supply issuance since proof-of-work mining was removed, the total supply has steadily declined.\n\nIf Ethereum had retained its PoW mode, the supply would have reached a mammoth 124,941,176 ETH, some 4.7 million ETH more than the current level. Theoretically, at the current price of $2,228, this would have given Ethereum a market cap of $12 billion higher than current $266 billion. Importantly, due to the increased supply, this is merely academic due to the nature of supply/demand market dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, these dynamics may influence Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in various ways. Continued deflationary tendencies could lead to increased demand and potentially higher ETH prices, assuming steady or rising demand coming out of the bear market. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes or macroeconomic trends can significantly impact these dynamics, especially with continued activity from the SEC in the U.S. toward categorizing PoS tokens as securities.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s post-merge statistics signal a notable move towards a deflationary framework, underscored by high network usage, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, and the potential for heightened value due to diminishing supply. However, these trends warrant continued analysis and understanding of macroeconomic factors to comprehend their long-term impact and sustainability fully.\n\nMentioned in this article"
