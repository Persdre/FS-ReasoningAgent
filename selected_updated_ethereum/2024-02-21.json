        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."
