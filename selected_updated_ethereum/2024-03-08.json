Since these rewards are shared across the validators, the more validators, the lower the rewards. Ethereum has seen the number of validators increase materially since it transitioned to proof of stake. As a result, consensus rewards have declined over that time period."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency is nearing the $4,000 mark for the first time since late 2021, according to the latest data from CoinGecko.\n\nCurrently priced at $3,980, Ethereum's ascent is in line with a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market, mirroring the movements of Bitcoin to some extent.\n\nThe crypto king has once again surpassed the $68,000 level, and it appears to be on track to hit a new record high.\n\nThe crypto market is also being propped up by an ongoing stock market rally. The benchmark S&P 500 rally recently hit a new all-time high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing profitability\n\nAccording to recent data provided by IntoTheBlock, 94% of Ethereum holders are making money at the current price, with only 6% at breakeven and none in the loss zone.\n\nAn in-depth look at Ethereum\u2019s global in/out of the money indicates that a majority of addresses (94.3%) are \"in the money,\" meaning they would profit if they sold their holdings at the current price. Interestingly, there are no addresses \"out of the money\" at present, and 5.70% are \"at the money,\" hovering around the break-even point.\n\nThis data indicates that the Ethereum market is currently experiencing a bullish phase, with most investors sitting on potential gains.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of addresses bought at various price points further displays the market's optimism, especially for those who invested when prices ranged between $3,381.23 and $4,579.78.\n\nEther's market dynamics\n\nThe price correlation with Bitcoin stands strong at 0.97, highlighting the interconnected nature of the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe holders\u2019 composition by time held shows a stable investment pattern, with 75% holding for more than a year, 21% between one month and a year, and a mere 4% for less than a month.\n\nIn terms of transaction demographics, there is an almost equal split between the West (51%) and the East (49%), with transaction volumes exceeding $58.49 billion over the past week alone, reflecting robust market activity."

        "content": "While the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been recently scaling unchartered territories, Ethereum (ETH) has also been fast off the blocks in 2024. The price of ETH is hovering around the $3900 mark, having risen 70.7% year to date as of Mar 8. Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nHaving completed the Shanghai Upgrade in 2023, Ethereum has ensured that it shifts its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Under the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption. The result has been far stricter trading, and the amount of Ether locked up has risen significantly.\n\nA massive boost has also come in from new institutional investments, with traditional financial giants following up their successful spot BTC ETF bids with ETH ones.\n\nHowever, the latest upgrade to its systems is going to be a game changer, and may see the stock shoot well above its all-time high of $4400 witnessed in May 2020. The ETH blockchain's Dencun upgrade, scheduled for Mar 13, is going to be a massive step toward allowing the network to function as a proper database for layer-2 blockchains to store data more efficiently. Also, it will make transactions cheaper on these blockchains and boost mainstream consumer demand.\n\nAnalysts around the world have pondered that with Bitcoin scaling the heights it is currently, Ether will only follow suit with the momentum from the upgrades and ETH applications and touch its all-time high pretty soon. In fact, it may go beyond the $10,000 markbefore the year ends.\n\nSo, with Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform. Here is a selection. These currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc.
