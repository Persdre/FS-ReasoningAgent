        "content": "Crypto markets flipped bullish after last week\u2019s carnage.\n\nFed Chair Powell said rate hike is \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nHigh inflation and unemployment worries have passed, says analyst.\n\nCrypto markets have recouped losses after last week\u2019s crash, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $56,000.\n\nThe renewed bullishness comes amid slowing job growth \u2014 a possible sign of easing inflation \u2014 and hopes of rate cuts later this year.\n\nToday, the largest cryptocurrency is back trading at just above $65,000. The second-largest Ethereum is up 11% since its low last Wednesday.\n\nOverall, the wider cryptocurrency market added some $200 billion, according to CoinGecko, since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke on May 1.\n\nHe signalled that a rate hike \u2014 when the central bank raises interest rates and increases borrowing costs for banks and businesses \u2014 would be \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cthe coast is far from clear\u201d for the Federal Reserve to begin lowering interest rates soon, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter.\n\nInterest rates in the United States have risen to record highs as the Federal Reserve combats rampant inflation stoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. High interest rates also increase the amount people earn on their bank holdings, another incentive to keep cash rather than spend it.\n\nRate hikes are thus less beneficial for stocks and riskier investments like cryptocurrencies, as seen in last week\u2019s dramatic drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn the first quarter, economic growth in the US slowed to its lowest level in nearly two years. The deceleration was partly attributed to a moderation in consumer spending and a widening trade deficit, or when a country imports more goods than it exports.\n\nWhen rates are higher, business loans become more expensive, which discourages owners from expanding or hiring. The ripple effects can slow the wider economy as well.\n\nRecent employment data released Friday, for instance, revealed the slowest job growth in six months and lower than the average monthly gain over the last year.\n\nStagflation concerns \u2018behind us\u2019\n\nHigh unemployment combined with inflation and slowed economic activity would spell even more trouble for Powell.\n\nPowell\u2019s key objective these days is to avoid stagflation, an economic climate in which the economy continues to face high inflation while in a recession.\n\nAccording to crypto venture capital firm Ryze Labs, that situation looks less likely to occur.\n\n\u201cWith rate hikes off the table and markets already pricing in little to no cuts for 2024, we think this bodes constructively for risk assets,\u201d Ryze Labs analysts told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe worst of stagflationary headwinds might be behind us,\u201d they said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin rose by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,200.\n\nEthereum jumped 1.9% to $3,200.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Michael Saylor thinks they won\u2019t launch at all, and even some fund issuers think it\u2019s unlikely this year. Meanwhile, other countries are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nThe battle to launch exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum\u2019s spot price in the U.S. is heating up \u2014 and so far, the journey looks similar to Bitcoin\u2019s long and messy road to approval.\n\nOnce again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dragging its heels on offering a definitive answer to the applications already made. A green light matters because it would allow investors to gain exposure to ETH without owning the underlying asset.\n\nGrayscale and Franklin Templeton were both due to receive a response from the SEC in April, but the regulator\u2019s now pushed their deadlines back to June.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock have had similar applications kicked into the long grass as well. VanEck and ARK Invest are due to receive a response later this month, but hopes of approval have been dwindling fast.\n\nWhy? Because there are signs that the regulator believes that Ether is a security, and not a commodity like Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: What\u2019s next for global finance?\n\nA growing dispute\n\nBack in June 2023, speaking in front of the House Financial Services Committee, SEC chair Gary Gensler had refused to say whether he believes ETH is a security.\n\nThe lack of a clear answer had spooked the crypto industry \u2014 especially considering this contradicted earlier guidance made by his predecessor Jay Clayton.\n\nAnd even earlier than that, around the time of The Merge in September 2022, Gensler had hinted that the staking process may fall under securities rules.\n\nEther\u2019s status matters because it determines which organization holds regulatory oversight in the U.S. \u2014 and if it is a security, this could cause big problems for other altcoins.\n\nConsensus recently sued the SEC and leapt to Ethereum\u2019s defense \u2014 arguing the commission\u2019s \u201cunlawful power grab threatens to undermine America\u2019s position as a leader of the next generation of the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Case for #Bitcoin on the Corporate Balance Sheet pic.twitter.com/LcZ4V2nqV0 \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) May 3, 2024\n\nSaylor\u2019s prediction\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin supporter who spearheaded efforts to add hundreds of thousands of BTC to the company\u2019s balance sheet, doesn\u2019t believe that ETFs based on ETH\u2019s spot price will ever see the light of day. Speaking at the annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, he warned:\n\n\u201cSome time this summer, it\u2019ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a cryptoasset security, not a commodity. After that, you\u2019re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano \u2014 everything down the stack \u2014 is just a cryptoasset security unregistered. None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as cryptoassets. [Bitcoin] is the one universal, consensus accepted, institutional-grade cryptoasset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d Michael Saylor\n\nOf course, you could argue that Saylor was bound to say this \u2014 especially considering that he believes BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is technically and ethically sound. Speaking at the Blockchain Economy Istanbul Summit back in July 2022, he had warned that Ether\u2019s continual upgrades \u201cintroduce new attack surfaces\u201d that undermine security and reliability.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe bigger challenge now appears to be that there\u2019s a lack of dialog between the SEC and firms hoping to bring an Ether ETF to market. As Barron\u2019s reported last month, applicants aren\u2019t being given \u201cthe critical feedback needed to finalize their products.\u201d By contrast, BTC ETF issuers had engaged in a \u201crobust back-and-forth\u201d before their funds started trading.\n\nJan van Eck, whose eponymous investment firm is awaiting a verdict from the SEC, candidly told CNBC in April that he believes the application will \u201cprobably be rejected\u201d \u2014 while Jean-Marie Mognetti from CoinShares predicted that no approvals will happen in 2024.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to be paralyzed by regulatory uncertainty, where a lack of clarity on Ether\u2019s status is leaving crypto firms exasperated, other jurisdictions are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nAlthough trading volumes were rather tepid on the first day, it remains significant that Hong Kong has now launched an ETH ETF, amid speculation this could one day open the door to investors from mainland China.\n\nAs S&P Global recently noted, funds based on Ether\u2019s spot price have already been approved in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany \u2014 with some offering additional yield by offering staking returns as well.\n\nWith ETFs in other territories now boasting billions of dollars in assets under management, the U.S. risks falling further and further behind."
