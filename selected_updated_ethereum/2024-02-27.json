        "content": "U.S. Buying on Coinbase Fueling Ethereum Rally: CryptoQuant\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen its price rise by 11% in the past week, driven primarily by buying pressure in the United States, according to data from CryptoQuant, a firm that tracks activity on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe data reveals a significant increase in demand for ETH from Coinbase, a US-regulated exchange. This surge is reflected in the \"Coinbase premium,\" which measures the price difference between ETH/USD pairs on Coinbase and Binance, a popular global exchange.\n\nThe rising Coinbase premium suggests that the upward trend for Ethereum may continue in the coming weeks. This indicator previously signaled price surges in the past, and its current rise hints at potential further growth.\n\nThe U.S. buying spree on Coinbase could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, experienced traders have been accumulating ETH since January, suggesting confidence in the asset's long-term potential. Secondly, anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. might be fueling investor interest. As of now, several major investment firms have filed applications for launching such ETFs.\n\nWhile the prospect of an ETF could lead to sustained growth for Ethereum, some traders believe it might not trigger explosive price increases. Currently, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, and an ETF could potentially attract more institutional investors, leading to a steadier growth pattern rather than sudden spikes."

        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum (ETH), has started 2024 on a great note. While Bitcoin (BTC), too, has been fast off the blocks, rising 20% year to date, ETH has risen 33%. Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nThe network has, over the past year, completed the Shanghai Upgrade. The upgrade has ensured that it shifts its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Under the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nThis has led to far stricter trading, and ETH supply has remained stagnant as a result. Also, the amount of Ether locked up has risen significantly, with ETH held on exchanges at an all-time low of 11%.\n\nHowever, per Bybit Research, the biggest boost has come from the new institutional investments. Institutions are over-allocating their portfolio to ETH compared to BTC. This is in contrast to the retail crypto market, where investors lean on Bitcoin.\n\nMajor players like Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, which already had Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are among firms that have submitted applications for an ether ETF. In fact, demand has gone up over the past few weeks, with market participants expecting a probable ether spot ETF approval by May of this year. ETH is currently trading above $3200, and the next earmarked resistance level is $3500.\n\nSo, with Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.
