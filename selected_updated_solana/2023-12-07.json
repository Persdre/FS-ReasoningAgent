        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Rival Solana Primed To Go \u2018Much Much Higher\u2019 \u2013 But There\u2019s a Catch - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is gearing up to continue its rally to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous crypto strategist Altcoin Sherpa tells his 200,700 followers on the social media platform X that he believes the smart contract platform will go much higher in the future, however, he warns traders of an upcoming dip after FTX\u2019s supply of SOL floods the market.\n\n\u201cSOL: I still think that we go a bit lower. FTX supply coming here eventually and I think this move up is to bait some buyers. Would just be patient on Solana. Note: I think that this one is going to go much much higher in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, investors should remain patient with Solana as the incoming cache of SOL tokens from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will add to its supply. However, the trader notes that during the last month, SOL has been consolidating.\n\n\u201cAlthough I think that you should still stay a bit patient given FTX supply is coming onto the market sometime (who knows when), Solana has also consolidated for a month in an overall macro healthy BTC (Bitcoin) upswing. In my opinion, this means you should at least be exposed now if you want in on this one.\n\nRecommend you do a swing trade on this one and have entries from here all the way down to sub-$50. It also works great as an investment too, where you just hold this for six months+ and let it ride. High percentage chance it\u2019s decently higher later.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $66.36 at time of writing, a 4.7% increase during the last day and an increase of over 550% from its price of $9.97 at the start of 2023.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair from Binance offers a glimpse into Ethereum's current market position \u2013 a position that, while seemingly bearish, may hold the seeds for a future rally against the digital gold that is about to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart presents a downtrend with Ethereum losing ground to Bitcoin, reflected by the downward slope of the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (black line) moving averages. This suggests that, in the short to medium term, Ethereum has been underperforming compared to the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThis underperformance can be linked to a subdued period for key Ethereum market drivers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With these sectors facing a downturn, Ethereum's price has not had the catalysts that could propel it forward, especially in comparison to Bitcoin, which often acts as a \"safe haven\" within the crypto market during times of uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the development activity within Ethereum's ecosystem tells a different story. Despite the lack of immediate market drivers, the consistent work being done on the platform could be laying the groundwork for a strong rebound.\n\nFor traders, the ETH/BTC chart is a vital tool for tracking market sentiment and volatility. A declining ETH/BTC ratio could indicate a period of risk-off sentiment where investors flock to Bitcoin's relative safety. Conversely, a rising ratio might signal a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to bet on Ethereum's growth prospects, which might also hint at the potential surge of altcoins in general.\n\nGiven the current chart trends, investors and traders may look for signs of stabilization or reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio as indicators of Ethereum's resurgence. Such a turnaround could be precipitated by a revival in the DeFi and NFT markets or by new developments and upgrades within the network."

        "content": "The Crypto Basic asked ChatGPT to provide insights on 5 top cryptocurrencies to buy in December. The AI\u2019s choices are presented alongside the reasons provided.\n\nAs a somewhat regulated AI chatbot, posing the question directly to ChatGPT met resistance as the application said it was not equipped to \u201cprovide specific financial advice, including recommendations on which cryptocurrencies to buy.\u201d\n\nUpon getting this answer, we decided to Jailbreak it, and here are the coins it suggested:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nAlmost everyone must have guessed that Bitcoin will top the list of assets ChatGPT will suggest. The chatbot said the digital currency is the pioneering digital currency and the most recognized asset in the industry.\n\nChatGPT states that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and decentralized nature \u201cmake it a reliable store of value, attracting investors seeking stability amid market fluctuations.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s choice of Bitcoin is ideal, seeing the coin has soared to a new year high above $44,000 on the sentiment of a likely approval of Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum made the list as a smart contract protocol whose capabilities open it up to welcome decentralized applications that can properly boost innovation and widespread adoption.\n\nChatGPT also named the Ethereum upgrades like The Merge that ushered in Ethereum 2.0 as a basis for this surge. The chatbot said these upgrades contributed to the scalability of the Ethereum protocol as a whole and might impact the price of the asset.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin is the native asset of the Binance ecosystem and also serves the BNB Chain protocol. ChatGPT added Binance Coin to the list for its \u201creduced trading fees,\u201d which typically \u201camplifies its utility and demand.\u201d\n\nThe success of Binance in incubating successful projects has also been named a factor that can influence the price of BNB.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano also made the ChatGPT list for its scalability and sustainability. ChatGPT highlighted Cardano\u2019s focus on providing proper scaling solutions in the Web3 world as well as its \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d drive as a key push for its relevance in the industry.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted the smart contract capabilities of Cardano as a gateway for DApps that can also boost investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe last pick on the list is Solana. The coin was chosen for its high throughput, relatively lower fees, and a hoard of DeFi projects running on it. Solana\u2019s ecosystem growth was also a major turn-on that ChatGPT believes can add to SOL\u2019s \u201cperceived value and potential future success.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that many experts and entities, including VanEck, share a similar sentiment that Solana is primed for an impressive surge in the long term."

Ethereum and Bitcoin also use different protocols to secure their blockchains. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Under this system, every computer on the network is working to solve a complex math problem to write the next block to the blockchain. Once a computer solves the problem, the other members of the network verify the solution (which takes much less work), and a new block attaches to the chain. Ethereum used the same system until September 2022. It now uses a proof-of-stake system that requires network members to hold ether to validate the next block in the blockchain. Validators are financially incentivized to verify correct data because they risk losing their stake if they\u2019re a bad actor. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network. Transaction costs can vary more widely on Ethereum based on how many people are actively trying to write new data to the blockchain, i.e., transaction volume.
