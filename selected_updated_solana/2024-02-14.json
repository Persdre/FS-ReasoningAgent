        "title": "Points Season: Who's Winning the NFT Marketplace Wars on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe \u201cpoints\u201d meta has overtaken the crypto space as of late, and NFT marketplaces across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin are jumping on the bandwagon (and in some cases driving it) in an attempt to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of traders everywhere.\n\nWill points translate to token airdrops? Will the NFT market return to its former glory? And if so, which company is in the best position to win the NFT marketplace wars? Here\u2019s how things are shaping up so far:\n\nMagic Eden is the latest NFT marketplace to try and lure in users through points-like loyalty models that could pay off with a token drop or other rewards. The marketplace recently launched its Diamonds rewards system, which includes a retroactive drop of rewards to Solana traders dating back to 2021.\n\nEthereum marketplace Blur pioneered the points model, and it was this time last year that the upstart platform dethroned longtime leader OpenSea by dropping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BLUR tokens to its most loyal users. By the end of the year, Blur had given away $818 million worth of BLUR tokens after users racked up points.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensor, the leading Solana NFT marketplace, has employed a similar points-based loyalty model, and similarly overtook leader Magic Eden last year\u2014but Tensor still has yet to launch its crypto token. To be clear, Tensor has yet to officially announce a token airdrop tied to the points, though it has teased such sentiments in the past.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s launch of its Diamonds system\u2014starting on Solana, but expanding to Bitcoin, Polygon, and Ethereum soon\u2014signaled an apparent attempt to catch up to Tensor. Similarly, we don\u2019t know yet what Magic Eden\u2019s points-like Diamonds will actually be used for, though there\u2019s also a separate NFT token drop coming in parallel with the rewards system.\n\nIs Magic Eden\u2019s rewards shift paying off in terms of boosting its market share? So far, not really.\n\nMagic Eden briefly saw a Solana surge that suggested it was making up ground on Tensor. On February 5, Decrypt observed that market data from analytics platform Tiexo pointed to Magic Eden claiming a 41% share of Solana NFT volume over the previous 24-hour period, compared to 53% for Tensor. That was much closer than it had been in recent weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, as of this writing, Tensor commands about 73% of Solana NFT market share over the past 24 hours, per Tiexo, compared to just 22% for Magic Eden. Zooming out a bit, there isn\u2019t a significant shift over the past weeks. In the last seven days, Tensor has over 75% share compared to 19% for Magic Eden; in the last month, Tensor claims over 73% with Magic Eden at less than 22%.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nExpanding the data to include platforms across several major NFT chains, however\u2014including Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain\u2014reveals some other interesting details about how rewards models are further reshaping the marketplace wars.\n\nLooking at the broader landscape, Blur rules the market by a wide margin, commanding about 42% market share over the past week. That\u2019s entirely on Ethereum mainnet, still the leading blockchain for NFTs, and Blur\u2019s existing token and history of sizable airdrops to users appears to be propelling its continued dominance.\n\nTensor is second overall with about 14.5% market share among tracked networks, all on Solana, followed by Magic Eden with 14%\u2014with the majority of that volume coming from Bitcoin Ordinals sales.\n\nOpenSea, which has no points system and has long resisted calls to launch its own token, lands in fourth with about 12.4% share, primarily on Ethereum and scaling network Polygon. Bringing up the rear is OKX\u2019s marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals, which are similar to NFTs, with about 7.7% market share.\n\nTiexo\u2019s 24-hour data shows some deviations due to the smaller sample size, with Blur holding an even larger share at 52.5% and Magic Eden up second with just under 12%\u2014but the majority of that volume is on Bitcoin, likely due to Tuesday's sale for the Bits gaming project. OpenSea, Tensor, and OKX bring up the rear, in that order.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nMagic Eden is readying a significant push on Ethereum with the launch of a new marketplace for that chain, created in partnership with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs. Set to debut on February 27, the marketplace has also set alliances with the teams behind major Ethereum projects like Pudgy Penguins and Azuki.\n\nWill the launch of Magic Eden\u2019s new Ethereum marketplace, with associated Diamonds rewards, help turn the tide and provide a sustainable boost as it battles rivals? We\u2019ll see later this month, as it\u2019s the next big shift on the horizon\u2014although the NFT world is ever full of surprises.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez"
