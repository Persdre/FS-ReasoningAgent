        "title": "Ethereum: Here\u2019s How to Be a Millionaire When ETH Hits $3,000 - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

        "content": "A crypto analyst who accurately called the bottom of the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bear market is flipping bullish on an altcoin running on the Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 232,400 followers on the social media platform X that Chainlink (LINK) is flashing multiple bullish reversal signals on the eight-hour chart.\n\nThe analyst predicts that LINK could rally to a level last seen in January 2022.\n\n\u201cOk LINK swept $13.9 one final time and made the fifth wave down for C and beautiful high time frame bullish divergence as well.\n\nI believe this is a major wave four low now in.\n\n$20 en route, RIP anyone who capitulated.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis method that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset goes through a five-wave rally with each wave having its own sub-waves.\n\nAt time of writing, LINK is trading for $14.57, suggesting an over 37% surge if it hits Bluntz\u2019s target.\n\nLooking at the smart contract platform Solana (SOL), Bluntz thinks that the altcoin is gearing up to break out against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC), indicating that its US dollar pair will likely see steep rallies.\n\n\u201cSOL/BTC trying to break this most recent bull flag after chilling for a few days.\n\nWhen this 37-day range breaks, SOL is going to gigasend.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is predicting market corrections for Solana (SOL) and another one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 201,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is setting up to dip below $50, more than 31% below its current value.\n\nAlthough the trader says that a correction is in sight for Solana, he thinks that SOL will eventually recover and regain its bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cSOL: for traders, I think sub $50 is coming for Solana in the mid-term.\n\nFor investors, SOL is going to go to much higher levels in the coming months, so probably just don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one. That\u2019ll be the one to consider shorting, to be honest. I think that this is in its distribution phase for now though. Expecting the other memes like MYRO to die soon (for a while).\u201d\n\nBonk is trading for $0.00001918 at time of writing, down 0.8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Lisk embraces Ethereum: a new era for blockchain interoperability. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Lisk blockchain, at the forefront of the Web3 ecosystem, has recently announced an epochal transition to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution.\n\nWith the support of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack and Gelato\u2019s advanced infrastructure, Lisk is poised to play a crucial role in bringing Optimism Superchain\u2019s vision to life. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe strategic transition of the Lisk blockchain to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution\n\nAs anticipated, Gelato has officially announced the expansion of its versatile all-in-one platform, known as Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nThis growth includes support not only for Polygon CDK, but also for OP Stack, the open-source modular development framework developed by Optimism Collective.\n\nIn this expansion phase, Gelato has opened its doors to Lisk, a top-level blockchain launched in 2016, so that it can join the Ethereum ecosystem by migrating to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2.\n\nLisk will become part of OP Mainnet, Base, and other OP chains, distinguishing itself as the first level 1 to commit to Optimism\u2019s Superchain vision.\n\nThe addition of OP Stack support by Gelato underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to revolutionizing the blockchain landscape.\n\nThe democratization of access to a modular block space allows a wide range of creators to easily implement their own level 2 blockchains, ready for launch.\n\nThis crucial step unlocks the potential of the main cryptographic applications, ushering in a new era in the adoption of blockchain, as highlighted by Luis Schliesske, founder of Gelato.\n\nDesigned to mitigate congestion issues on the main Ethereum network, OP Stack represents the open-source codebase and standards that power the Optimism ecosystem, aiming to support the Superchain.\n\nThanks to Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, OP Stack not only manages the implementation, hosting, and monitoring of new Layer 2 chains, but also obtains native integrations with Gelato\u2019s leading Web3 middleware services.\n\nThese include automation, off-chain data, and account abstraction, which enable a superior user experience. Additionally, the platform provides immediate access to high-level web3 services such as Etherscan, The Graph, LayerZero, and many others.\n\nThe Web3 revolution of Gelato\n\nLevel 2 chains implemented with Gelato, including Lisk, not only gain the benefits of the underlying blockchain, but also a fully production-ready web3 development environment.\n\nThis is a milestone for web3 development, as developers have access for the first time to an OP chain with end-to-end services and all infrastructure dependencies implemented from the start.\n\nBen Jones, head scientist at the Optimism Foundation, expresses enthusiasm for the extension of support from Gelato to Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk.\n\nGelato has already demonstrated its efficiency by executing one million transactions on OP Mainnet for projects like Synthetix, Lyra, and Velodrome. Jones anticipates that Gelato, with its developer experience, will contribute to turning Superchain\u2019s vision into a tangible reality.\n\nThrough Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, implementing your own complete OP chain of services becomes a simple process, without the need to write code.\n\nThis allows developers to focus on growing their core business, while Gelato handles the implementation and maintenance of the chain.\n\nDominic Schwenter, Chief Project Officer at Lisk, emphasizes that the use of Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to focus on creating products and tools appreciated by developers and end users, allocating resources to the development of Superchain.\n\nGelato and Optimism share a vision of a world where thousands of blockchains are interconnected, allowing for horizontal scaling of web3 applications. The Gelato Rollup-as-a-Service platform positions itself as a key component of this environment, managing clients\u2019 blockchains and providing an end-to-end development environment with essential infrastructure services for integrated developers."
