        "content": "Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories.\n\nBut fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand.\n\nForking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes.\n\nSome of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time.\n\nBut forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked.\n\nThe term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so.\n\nAs we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHow to track forks on DefiLlama\n\nTo navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection.\n\nAt the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks.\n\nUniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama)\n\nLower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code.\n\nThe list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own.\n\nThe greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code.\n\nDefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama)\n\nTake Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch.\n\nBut other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome.\n\nMany forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new.\n\nFor example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin.\n\nForking blockchains\n\nForking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked.\n\nThe most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract.\n\nHowever, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen.\n\nIn 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nA hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm.\n\nAfter much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today.\n\nHowever, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin.\n\nNext steps\n\nRead more about Sushiswap\u2019s vampire attack on incumbent decentralised exchange Uniswap.\n\nExplore the reasons Bitcoin\u2019s many forked networks came into being."
