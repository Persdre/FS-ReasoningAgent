There has been a lot of anticipation surrounding a possible Solana ETF soon. Crypto ETFs have entered the spotlight. As a result, the opening week performance of Ether ETFs may dictate how easily the next ETF is approved in the future."

        "content": "The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) issued listing notifications for five new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) scheduled to begin trading on July 23 \u2014 confirming reports from earlier in the week.\n\nThe notifications clarify that the funds are pending final regulatory approval. The five ETFs are 21Shares\u2019 CETH, Fidelity\u2019s FETH, Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZET, Invesco\u2019s QETH, and VanEck\u2019s ETHV.\n\nEach ETF will be listed on Cboe\u2019s BZX Exchange and quoted on the SIAC Tape B data feed.\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported on July 15 that the SEC had instructed issuers to submit final amendments in preparation for a trading launch next week.\n\nSources told Balchunas that the regulator would give the final green light on July 22, setting the stage for a Tuesday trading launch. The issuers subsequently filed amended S-1 forms on July 18, revealing the final details for their funds, including sponsor fees.\n\nThe introduction of these ETFs is anticipated to enhance Ethereum\u2019s liquidity and market depth. Analysts predict that the ETFs will attract a broad range of institutional investors who have been cautious about direct cryptocurrency investments due to regulatory uncertainties.\n\nThe ETFs are expected to pave the way for further institutional adoption, potentially driving Ethereum prices higher. Some analysts project that the token will climb above $5000.\n\nThe launch of these ETFs could mark the beginning of a broader trend of integrating digital assets into traditional financial products. The SEC\u2019s decision may influence other jurisdictions to follow suit, potentially leading to a global expansion of crypto ETFs.\n\nSome firms have already begun work on ETFs linked to other major crypto tokens like Solana and Injective.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP is in the process of correction as its price printed a 7% drop in the last 24 hours, potentially pushing the market to its first major correction. However, it could be temporary, and things could turn bullish again in a few days.\n\nThe 50-day moving average is the first major support level for XRP. If XRP remains above this barrier, it may level off and even rise once more. As a psychological barrier for traders, this level has historically served as a foundation for price rebounds. The support level at $0.50 is followed by the 100-day moving average. In the past, during downtrends, it has provided solid support. If XRP drops below $0.55, this level may act as a safety net to stop further losses.\n\nTraders frequently scan these levels for opportunities to buy, which could aid in a price reversal. Recovering from a drop below the 200 EMA level may indicate a longer-term bearish trend for XRP. Sustaining this level is critical to XRP's bullish outlook, as it is regarded as a long-term trend indicator.\n\nEthereum can't break it\n\nEthereum could not break the 50 EMA resistance level and is currently sliding below the moving average. Unfortunately, the lack of a breakthrough will lead us to a drop below $3,300. There are a few levels for traders to watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum encountered significant resistance during its most recent attempt to breach the 50 EMA, suggesting that bearish momentum may be developing. A critical technical indicator, the 50 EMA frequently acts as a level of support or resistance. The failure of an asset to cross this threshold may signal waning bullish sentiment and potential losses.\n\nThe 50 EMA has consistently demonstrated its ability to predict market trends. Ethereum frequently retraces its losses when it is unable to rise above this level. This pattern implies that there may be more selling pressure on the market in the near term.\n\nIt is critical to avoid a drop below the $3,000 barrier. Ethereum may experience panic selling if it drops below that barrier, which would accelerate the decline. It has historically served as both support and resistance.\n\nThe amount of $3,200 represents yet another crucial support level. This threshold has previously been tested several times and has frequently served as a buffer against additional declines. Ethereum must stay at this level in order to stabilize and prevent a more severe correction. The 200 EMA acts as a longer-term support at around $3,200. That is why long-term investors need to keep an eye on this level, as a decline below it might signal a longer bearish phase.\n\nToncoin does not attract bulls\n\nToncoin's success was enormous during the market downturn, but as soon as the majority of digital assets retraced, TON quickly lost most of its momentum and even dropped below the crucial 50 EMA support.\n\nCertain investors have perceived Toncoin as a possible hedge against the larger cryptocurrency market, notwithstanding its recent performance. Due in large part to its integration with the Telegram ecosystem, this thesis's strength lies in its foundation.\n\nOne of the main benefits of Toncoin is its integration with Telegram. Telegram offers TON an audience that is already there and the chance to be widely adopted thanks to its enormous user base. TON may be more resilient than other cryptocurrencies due to this fundamental strength, particularly in times of market turbulence.\n\nIn times of market turbulence, investors frequently seek investments that offer some degree of stability. Its ability to function as a more stable investment was demonstrated by Toncoin's performance during the market slump.\n\nTON is not totally immune to larger market movements, though, as seen by the most recent decline below the 50 EMA support level. The support of a significant platform such as Telegram, and Toncoin's strong technological base, contribute to its increasing popularity.\n\nInvestors seeking long-term stability over short-term gains may be drawn to this strength. The theory is that despite difficulties facing the market as a whole, Toncoin's strong fundamentals will enable it to weather storms better than its competitors."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a No-Brainer Buy After the Bitcoin Halving? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The world's second largest cryptocurrency still has near-term catalysts.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies pulled back a couple of years ago from their all-time highs as rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments. Yet three tailwinds have lifted the broader market this year: expectations for lower rates, the approvals of the first Bitcoin (BTC -4.01%) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, and Bitcoin's halving in April.\n\nBut now that Bitcoin has concluded its long-awaited halving, which reduces the rewards for mining Bitcoin every four years, there will probably be fewer near-term catalysts for the world's top cryptocurrency. So is it time to turn our attention toward Ethereum (ETH -6.78%), the world's second largest cryptocurrency, for bigger gains this year?\n\nThe differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nEther is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which was launched in 2015. Ethereum initially used the same energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method as Bitcoin, but it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method in a process called The Merge in 2022. That transition reduced Ethereum's mining energy consumption by 99.95% and made it deflationary -- which meant more coins were being burned, or permanently removed from circulation, than created. PoS blockchains also allow investors to stake, or lock up, their tokens for fixed periods to earn interest-like rewards.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was also developed to support smart contracts, which can be used to create decentralized apps (dApps), smaller tokens, and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's blockchain can be used only to mine more coins. That's why Ethereum is usually valued by the expansion of its developer ecosystem, while Bitcoin is often compared to gold or silver.\n\nThat key difference drove the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to say that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified a commodity. That classification supported its approvals of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet the SEC was reluctant to call Ethereum and other PoS coins commodities, saying the staking process made it similar to securities. Nevertheless, the SEC still cleared the way for Ethereum's first spot-price ETF applications earlier this year.\n\nThe tailwinds and headwinds for Ethereum\n\nEthereum's biggest near-term catalyst will be the potential approvals of its first spot ETFs. The SEC has already reportedly granted preliminary approvals to at least three of the eight planned spot-price ETFs, according to Reuters, and the latest speculation suggests most of those funds could start trading as early as July 23.\n\nEthereum's price has already risen about 50% this year, but the first spot ETFs might drive its price even higher. For reference, Bitcoin's price has rallied more than 40% since the approvals of its first 11 ETFs on Jan. 10.\n\nAnother major catalyst is Ethereum's recent Dencun upgrade, which increases its speed and reduces the gas fees -- essentially network user fees -- for its Layer-2 blockchain. Stabilizing and declining interest rates could also drive investors back to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nYet Ethereum still faces unpredictable headwinds. The Dencun upgrade made Ethereum inflationary again, and its supply will keep rising unless more tokens are burned. It also still processes transactions at a slower rate than newer PoS blockchains such as Solana (SOL -6.89%) and Cardano (ADA -9.13%) -- and those limitations could curb the expansion of its ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's planned spot ETFs also won't feature any staking mechanisms like its underlying tokens, so it might not be a compelling alternative to directly owning the cryptocurrency. Lastly, the market's expectations for lower rates and ETF approvals might have already been baked into its current price.\n\nSo is Ethereum a no-brainer buy right now?\n\nEthereum is trading at about $3,400 as of this writing, but some bullish investors expect it to generate huge gains during the next few years. VanEck's Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush expect its price to more than triple to $11,800 by 2030, while Ark Invest's Cathie Wood says it could be worth a whopping $166,000 by 2032.\n\nWe should take those rosy estimates with a grain of salt, but I believe Ethereum's spot-price ETF approvals and lower interest rates should limit its downside potential this year. The Ethereum network's next planned upgrade, Pectra, should further increase its speed and lower its gas fees to keep pace with Solana and Cardano. Therefore, I believe Ethereum is still a good cryptocurrency to accumulate right now -- but investors shouldn't necessarily expect it to blast off in the next few months."
