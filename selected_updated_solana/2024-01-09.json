        "title": "Fantom Founder Andre Cronje Reflects On Bitcoin & Ethereum\u2019s State Bloat Problem - CoinGape",
        "content": "Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje, known as the godfather of decentralized finance (DeFi), further raised concerns over probabilistic finality in blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market sees expanding use cases and adoption in traditional finance. He said Fantom has already solved state bloat as Ethereum developers look to solve state bloat in the chain.\n\nAndre Cronje Says Fantom Has Resolved S tate Bloat Issue\n\nIn response to Ambient Finance founder Doug Colkitt\u2019s belief that Ethereum is the only chain looking to solve state bloat in its long-term plan, Andre Cronje said \u201cI am pretty confident in saying we already solved state bloat at Fantom.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum roadmap entails using Verkle trees to allow for \u201cdata to be small enough to be attached to every block.\u201d It could help validators and nodes to become stateless as all \u2018state\u2019 can be stored more efficiently off-chain.\n\nHowever, Andre Cronje said any blockchain that uses probabilistic finality or any variant of the longest chain rule won\u2019t resolve this issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum chains depend on probabilistic finality. Finality refers to when a block of transactions is considered permanent and cannot be altered or reversed.\n\nFantom uses aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, which does not require the longest chain rule.\n\nMoreover, Fantom introduced the new database Carmen, a flat storage method that does not use tree or dictionary structures while maintaining a cryptographic signature of the world state. This greatly reduces the bloat of the current active state (two epochs). Carmen supports real-time pruning, and although archive nodes still need to retain all data, most validators can enable pruning.\n\nAfter adopting the above technology, Fantom\u2019s status is reduced from about 2TB (archive) to 60GB (archive). Cronje said state bloat has been one of Fantom\u2019s core milestones since its early days.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock And VanEck Files Updated S-1 For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

        "content": "Wallet drainers have now started targeting Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities to execute phishing scams. Earlier, they focused on conducting crypto scams via EVM chains. However, the trend has changed after they expanded their reach into well-established crypto groups.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Scam: Trading Platform Coinspaid Might be the Latest Victim\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Wallet Drainers\u2019 Airdrop Scam\n\nAccording to a post by Scam Sniffer on X, phishing scams have been initiated by attracting crypto enthusiasts via fake airdrops. They have designed a webpage wherein one can claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThe scammers term the airdrop scam as an \u201cexclusive opportunity\u201d for the community. Moreover, they encourage people to connect their primary wallet to be able to access these airdrops. In addition, Scam Sniffer noted that these fraudsters can drain various types of crypto wallets via this webpage.\n\nThis update is an alarming one considering the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, Solana, and Tron. It could instill crypto investors into believing such wallet drainers in anticipation of high-end crypto rewards. Thereby, millions and billions of digital asset investments could be wiped off owing to such wallet drainer scams.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify such scams via a few checks. The snapshot shared by Scam Sniffer shows that the concerned airdrop scam webpage has grammatical errors, which could be a way to be safe from such fraudsters. But, they can upgrade their strategies from time to time.\n\nHence, it\u2019s always better to check the source of such links. If a trusted entity isn\u2019t posting such airdrop updates, then avoid such offerings completely. Moreover, it\u2019s time to be even more cautious since hackers have been hacking reputed companies\u2019 X (formerly Twitter) accounts to promote crypto scams.\n\nCertik and Mandiant Official X Accounts Get Hacked\n\nEarlier this month, Certik, a blockchain audit firm, witnessed its X account being hacked. Thereafter, malicious links were posted that promised people to return the digital assets they lost to various crypto scams. The dubious link was available on their website for quite sometime before the Certik team managed to regain access.\n\nThe X account of Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, was successfully reclaimed by its rightful owner on January 4, 2024, after falling victim to hacking. The incident unfolded over several hours on X, with users presenting evidence of the account takeover. The attackers, posing as the Phantom, a non-custodial crypto wallet, used the compromised Mandiant X account to promote a cryptocurrency scam.\n\nAlso Read: Just In: Founder of ACE Crypto Exchange Arrested for Fraud\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Today: Bitcoin Rises Above $47,000 For The First Time Since April 2022 - ABP Live",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to touch the $47,000 mark early Tuesday, before settling down at around $46,800 at the time of writing. The coin managed to achieve the $47k high for the first time since April 2022.

The upcoming SEC decision on Bitcoin ETF approval, anticipated this week, has the market eagerly awaiting. BTC has maintained an upward trend for the last five days, marking a 10 percent increase month-to-date and an impressive 173 percent rise year-to-date. If the current price level holds, the next hurdle lies at $49,000.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cThe crypto market experienced a rise of 5.8 percent in the last 24 hours, resulting in a total market capitalization of $1.8 Trillion. The crypto fear and greed index is highly positive and has jumped by 6 points as compared to yesterday. With just one day to go for SEC\u2019s decision on ARK/21 Share\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, SEC Chief Gary Gensler posted a series of posts on Twitter mentioning the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. If history is to be repeated this might be considered a positive sign as in Oct 2021 a similar post was made by SEC\u2019s investor education account, a day before the first Bitcoin futures ETF became effective.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin has surged up to $47,000, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors. This rally has sparked anticipation about the digital currency potentially reaching $48,000 soon. A key catalyst propelling this momentum is the fervent speculation surrounding the potential introduction of a Bitcoin ETF, which has garnered considerable attention and excitement.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's surge past $47,000 is attributed to expectations that the US SEC will approve a spot bitcoin ETF this week. With a 7 percent daily gain and an 87 percent increase since September 2023, the market is expecting a historic moment after the ETF's approval. Applicants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which are updating their filings and disclosure fees, have fueled FOMO as analysts predict spot bitcoin ETFs will attract significant demand and legitimacy, easing investor scepticism. Standard Chartered predicts an inflow of $50-100 billion in 2024 and a potential BTC price of $200,000 by 2025. Traders are trying to stop this rise, looking for short-term profits towards $48,500 and the psychological level of $50,000. However, caution prevails with expectations of choppy conditions and potential profit-taking, while the long-term outlook appears bullish, driven by factors such as the Fed tapering cycle, Bitcoin rate halving and growing institutional adoption via new ETFs.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market witnessed a mini rally as the deadline for SEC approval for Bitcoin ETF nears. The total crypto market cap touched the $1.72 trillion mark with Bitcoin and Ethereum jumping by almost 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. Any confirmation of ETF approval by the SEC will push the market higher and it may lead to a market-wide rally. It is important to note that Bitcoin has surged by 10 percent since the beginning of 2024.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
