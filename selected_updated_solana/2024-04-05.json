        "title": "DWS Group debuts Bitcoin and Ethereum ETCs in Germany - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Coinbase and Zodia Custody act as custodians for the digital assets underlying the ETCs.\n\nShare this article\n\nDWS Group (DWS), an asset management firm managing almost \u20ac900 billion in assets, has partnered with Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to introduce two new Xtrackers exchange-traded commodities (ETCs): the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC securities and the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC securities. These new ETCs are now listed on Deutsche B\u00f6rse, as DWS shared in a recent press release.\n\nAn exchange-traded commodity (ETC) functions as a debt security similar to an exchange-traded note (ETN) but with added protections for investors. These protections include collateral, limited recourse, and bankruptcy remote issuer. Unlike ETNs, ETCs can track single assets or smaller, focused baskets of assets.\n\nAccording to Manfred Bauer, Global Head of DWS\u2019 Product Division and Member of the Executive Board at DWS Group, the growing value of Bitcoin and Ethereum is making it impossible for investors and financial institutions to simply ignore them. With this launch, DWS seeks to provide investors with direct access to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cSince the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009, digital assets have developed from a niche technology innovation to a globally recognized asset class. With a combined market capitalization of more than USD 1.7 trillion, Bitcoin and Ethereum alone are now too significant for investors and asset managers to ignore,\u201d stated Bauer.\n\nThe strategic partnership between DWS and Galaxy aims to accelerate digital asset adoption in Europe, leveraging their collective expertise, noted DWS. Through this collaboration, Galaxy will equip DWS with the tools and expertise to offer institutional-grade access to digital assets for European investors.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be working with Xtrackers to offer investors institutional-grade access to digital assets and to support them with our deep digital asset expertise,\u201d commented Steve Kurz, Global Head of Asset Management at Galaxy.\n\nAs noted in the press release, each ETC is supported by segregated offline storage solutions provided by Zodia Custody and Coinbase, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets.\n\nWith an annual product fee of just 0.35%, DWS expects that these ETCs will be a cost-effective option for investors looking to tap into the digital asset market. The firm claims that its new products will offer the ease of trading an ETP with the perceived safety of having an underlying physical asset."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader Peter Brandt has unleashed a torrent of criticism aimed exclusively at Ethereum (ETH), labeling it a \"junk coin\" in a harsh assessment of the popular alternative cryptocurrency. Brandt, known for his insights into the financial markets, held no words as he criticized Ethereum, dismissing it as a useless challenger to Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandt's disrespect for Ethereum was evident in a recent social media post where he disdained its status, asserting that it lacks the fundamental qualities necessary for long-term viability. He pointed to its alleged shortcomings as a store of value and criticized its functionality, citing difficulties with layer-2 solutions and exorbitant gas fees.\n\nBacking up his claims, Brandt referred to the Ethereum/Bitcoin price chart, highlighting Ethereum's steady decline against Bitcoin since the end of 2021. According to Brandt's analysis, ETH's recent drop to a critical support level of 0.05 BTC per altcoin signals further weakness compared to BTC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get tired of saying it, but $ETH is a junk coin despite mindless devotion of Etheridiots.\n\nAs a store of value it is junk - a $BTC pretender\n\nIts functionality is also junk - difficult to deal with L2s and outrageous gas fees\n\nOf course it will always attract \"investors\" pic.twitter.com/7KAYMiwsnf \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 4, 2024\n\nThis is not the first time Brandt has expressed skepticism toward Ethereum. In January, he publicly announced a short position on the altcoin when it was trading at $2,265, citing weak price behavior. Despite Ethereum's subsequent price surge, Brandt admitted a month later that the trade did not go as planned.\n\nBrandt's criticism of Ethereum reflects his broader conviction that Bitcoin reigns supreme on the cryptocurrency market. He previously declared his belief that everything apart from Bitcoin is \"junk,\" emphasizing the main cryptocurrency's role as a primary store of value with significant potential for appreciation."

The e\u00adstimate suggests a 3.2x rise in SOL\u2019s price\u00ad, propelling it to reach $600 during the ne\u00adxt distribution oscillation.\n\nTradingView\n\nThe analysis shows the past price fluctuations of Ethere\u00adum and Solana, with annotations highlighting their respective\u00ad values at various intervals. Ethere\u00adum\u2019s price reached its pinnacle\u00ad around $5000, while SOL\u2019s apogee occurre\u00add at approximately $600, indicating a parallel trajectory in the\u00adir ascent.\n\nSolana eme\u00adrges as a formidable contende\u00adr in the blockchain realm. Its exce\u00adptional throughput and minimal transaction costs, driven by the innovative Proof of History (PoH) conse\u00adnsus algorithm coupled with Proof of Stake (PoS), position SOL as a viable alte\u00adrnative to Ethereum. While\u00ad Ethereum\u2019s pionee\u00adring role in smart contracts and decentralize\u00add applications is undeniable, Solana\u2019s technological advance\u00adments present a compe\u00adlling case for its future growth and potential impact.\n\nSolana\u2019s design e\u00adnables parallel transaction exe\u00adcution, a significant advantage over single-thre\u00adaded blockchains like Ethere\u00adum. MartyParty\u00ad underscores Solana\u2019s architecture\u00ad, which concurrently processes multiple\u00ad transactions, departing from Ethereum\u2019s se\u00adquential approach. This parallel processing e\u00adnhances efficiency and scalability.\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nCurrently, SOL\u2019s trading value stands at $188, maintaining its position above the crucial support le\u00advel of $181. Its current objective\u00ad is to reclaim the 50-day Exponential Moving Ave\u00adrage (EMA) as a supportive factor. Despite\u00ad potential efforts to surpass the $200 barrie\u00adr, there exists a like\u00adlihood that SOL may experience\u00ad a decline back to $165.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe blockchain platform re\u00adtains an advantage among institutional investors despite\u00ad obstacles.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could revisit $60,000 before returning to the $73,777 peak as pre-halving dips are common.\n\nEthereum price could reclaim $4,000 if BTC closes above $69,000.\n\nRipple price could go as low as $0.5000 before XRP becomes attractive to buyers.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to drive markets, with the effects of its show of strength and weakness being felt across the industry in kind. As the market walks into the weekend, volatility is expected to increase as trading volumes reduce, which is characteristic of the weekend.\n\nAccording to analysts, the market could be due for a final shakeout before we continue on our next leg up. If there is any truth to this prediction, then three things stand:\n\nPre-halving dips should not be a surprise if history is enough to go by. The recent meme coin mania inspired euphoria across the market, with the current correction making it seem like the bull market has been canceled. This dip is probably the cheapest traders can buy altcoins for possibly the rest of the bull run.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price upside potential grows as BlackRock draws more of Wall Street players into BTC market\n\nBitcoin could provide another buying opportunity\n\nWith the BTC halving barely two weeks out, Bitcoin price could provide a buying opportunity by retesting the supply zone between $58,375 and $65,518. BTC is already overbought, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is falling. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is also recording dwindling histogram bars.\n\nAs BTC price consolidates along the $69,000 threshold on the weekly time frame, a pullback is likely before the bulls can decisively overcome this blockade.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure above current levels could confirm the continuation of the primary trend. The first confirmation of this would be a candlestick close above $69,000, above which more buy orders could send BTC price to reclaim $73,777 or even higher to take $75,000.\n\nAlso Read: Layer 3 tokens see double-digit losses dragged by Bitcoin price drop\n\nEthereum price eyes $4,000, but there is a catch\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains well above the ascending parallel channel and sits atop the ascending trendline. A successful bounce above this technical formation could see ETH price extend north to the $4,000 psychological level. Such an outcome, however, is contingent on BTC price decisively reclaiming ground above $69,000.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the Ethereum price extends the fall in the hands of ETH sellers, the altcoin could fall back into the channel. A break and close below the upper boundary of the governing chart pattern would delay the uptrend. For it to be invalidated, however, ETH must break and close below $2,500.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum on course to post weekly losses as debate over security status continues\n\nXRP price eyes $0.5000\n\nRipple (XRP) price could extend the fall to the $0.5000 psychological level if the bears can see the price close below $0.5783. A breakdown of this buyer congestion level could see XRP holders exit the market to avoid more losses.\n\nThe position of the RSI below 50 points to a bearish stance, reinforced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in negative territory and the bearish histogram of the AO.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls find their way, Ripple price could push above $0.6685. A candlestick close above this level could set the tone for XRP price to foray into the supply zone between $0.7311 and $0.7942. A candlestick close above its midline at $0.7655 would confirm the continuation of the trend, likely going as high as $0.8000.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price ranges below $0.60 despite Ripple stablecoin launch announcement"

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving, Ethereum ETF: The Most Important Trends in the Cryptocurrency Market 2024 - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "The upcoming bitcoin halving is a significant event that happens about once every 4 years and is of great importance to the entire crypto industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year 2024 has seen and is expected to see several important milestones for the crypto industry: the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, as well as the upcoming bitcoin halving and the possible approval of the Ethereum ETF. These events reflect important milestones in the development of the cryptocurrency space and are attracting increasing attention from investors and the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, I will dive into the specifics of bitcoin, review the nature of the halving and its significance, compare bitcoin to ethereum, and discuss other key events. The rapid growth of this sector inevitably leads to many questions and discussions, and this article will help you better understand the nature of the ongoing changes and their implications.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. It is a digital currency powered by blockchain technology that allows users to make decentralized transactions. This means there is no centralized control in this network and no need for a third party. It was designed to be a non-inflationary cryptocurrency, and the mechanisms that limit the issuance of the new BTC cryptocurrency are fundamentally built into the Bitcoin protocol itself. The mechanism that ensures a permanent reduction in issuance is called halving. Let's take a look at how it works. The bitcoin network is organized into nodes. Each node maintains identical copies of the blockchain. These copies are agreed upon by the nodes according to rules called a consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of Work (PoW) consensus is used in bitcoin. Proof of Work is a mechanism that ensures the safety and reliability of the bitcoin network. As part of PoW, miners use special hardware to solve complex mathematical challenges. When a miner solves such a challenge faster than other ones, he creates a new block with transactions and adds it to the blockchain, receiving a reward in the form of BTC cryptocurrency. According to the rules built into the protocol, new blocks are formed by miners about every 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that bitcoin issuance takes place as miners are rewarded for forming blocks. In fact, all BTC that are created in the network are miners' rewards for mined blocks. Bitcoin is divided into smaller units - they are called \"Satoshi\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSatoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin and represents one hundred millionth part of bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n100 Satoshi = 0.000001 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n10 000 Satoshi = 0.0001 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n1 000 000 Satoshi = 0.01 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n10 000 000 Satoshi = 0.1 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n100 000 000 Satoshi = 1 Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nWhat is halving?\n\nHalving is an event in the bitcoin protocol where the mining reward for creating a new block is reduced by half. It occurs approximately every 4 years and is a built-in mechanism that limits the total number of bitcoins that can be created.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalving is hugely important for bitcoin, as this event directly affects its economic model. As the miners reward for each block decreases, the number of new bitcoins coming into circulation also decreases, which helps maintain bitcoin's value in the long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bitcoin protocol was designed with the idea of a limited supply. The protocol includes a rule that limits the maximum total number of bitcoins that can be created. This limit is 21 million bitcoins and its issuance will stop by 2140.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the bitcoin blockchain was launched in 2009, the reward to miners for a new block was 50 BTC, which is its issuance. During the history of bitcoin there have already been 3 halving, in 2012, 2016 and 2020. In 2012, the first bitcoin halving took place and the miners' reward for mining a block decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, in 2016 during bitcoin halving the miners' reward per block was already reduced to 12.5 BTC, and in 2020 after bitcoin halving the miners' reward per block became only 6.25 BTC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next bitcoin halving will occur in April 2024 and miners' reward per block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of bitcoin halving on its price and market dynamics is significant. The expectations associated with halving that supply will decrease and demand will increase often leads to positive market sentiment. The decrease in available bitcoins after halving creates scarce demand, which in turn increases their price and makes this cryptocurrency more attractive to investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is important to realize that past performance does not guarantee that it will be repeated in the future, and the price of the bitcoin cryptocurrency can be affected by various factors other than halving events. In addition, an increase in the price of the bitcoin cryptocurrency following halving events may also be justified by an increase in press coverage of cryptocurrencies or an increase in real-world options for its use. Although past bitcoin halvings have stimulated a bullish trend of bitcoin cryptocurrency price in the long term, one should keep in mind the unpredictability of the market.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum is the second largest capitalized cryptocurrency after bitcoin. It is a decentralized protocol based on blockchain technology. It was launched in 2015 and its key idea is to support smart contracts that allow creation of decentralized applications. Smart contracts are programs that are hosted and running in the Ethereum environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone can deploy smart contracts on the network or interact with existing ones. The advantage of this model is that there is no need to trust third parties or intermediaries. There are a huge number of decentralized applications built on Etherium, from DeFi and NFT to decentralized autonomous organizations. It also opens up the possibility of tokenizing any tangible and intangible assets, which brings many benefits in the form of automating transactions and reducing transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries. This is one of the major trends in the industry right now. Smart contracts also allow even traditional money to be tokenized, transferred and used in a decentralized digital world. The native cryptocurrency in Etherium is called Ether, and it is used to pay transaction fees on the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that Ether cryptocurrency is needed when sending any transaction that represents actions on the network. The Ether cryptocurrency is also divided into smaller parts. Up to 18 decimal places. The smallest unit is called Wei. Below is an example of converting Ether to Wei.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Ether = 1000000000000000000 Wei\n\n0.01 Ether = 10000000000000000 Wei\n\n0.000000001 Ether = 1000000000 Wei\n\n0.000000000000001 Ether = 1000 Wei\n\n0.000000000000000001 Ether = 1 Wei\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin lies in their functionality. Bitcoin provides the ability to send basic value transfer messages between users without the need for centralized intermediaries, and is designed primarily as a digital payment system. Ethereum, instead, extends this concept by allowing the creation of any kind of program (smart contracts) that can be executed on the network. Almost any decentralized applications can be created on Ethereum, which drives innovation and growth in various areas: decentralized finance, exchanges, tokenization of real-world assets and currencies, games, social networks, decentralized autonomous organizations, and others.\n\nSo unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is focused not only on financial transactions, but also on creating digital decentralized ecosystems and applications.\n\nBitcoin ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of the bitcoin ETF on January 10, 2024 had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market as well as the price of bitcoin itself. Shortly after this event, the bitcoin price rallied from a level of around $46,000 to a new all-time high of around $73,740 within two months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of the spot bitcoin ETF opened up new opportunities for investors by giving them access to the digital currency through traditional investment accounts, leading to a visible increase in interest in bitcoin from institutional and individual investors.\n\nThe approval of bitcoin ETFs has also brought a new set of benefits. It has opened up opportunities for capital inflows from traditional financial markets, as bitcoin is now available to institutional investors who can do transactions through their regular brokerage accounts. Hedge funds, pension funds and other large institutional players who previously did not have access to this asset class can now do transactions in bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of bitcoin ETFs has also increased the liquidity of the cryptocurrency market, as it has stimulated more capital inflows and increased bitcoin trading activity. Increased liquidity may help improve the structure of this market and reduce volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, this event has the potential to affect the further progress of the cryptocurrency market and raise even more interest in bitcoin from investors. In general, this year is very significant for bitcoin, because its halving is expected ahead, which will reduce miners' reward per block by 2 times, which means that the issuance of new BTC will be reduced in the same amount.\n\nEthereum ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequests for an Ethereum ETF have been submitted and a decision is expected to be made in the near future. Potentially, the approval of the Ethereum ETF could have a major impact on Ether and cryptocurrency market price rates in general. Approval of the Ethereum ETF could lead to increased demand for Ether cryptocurrency from investors, including institutional investors for whom it may become available, interested in diversification of their portfolios. Such an injection of capital could boost Ether's price and overall popularity. But it is important to realize that the impact on the exchange rate may be unpredictable and dependent on many other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe possible approval of an etherium ETF also opens up new opportunities for investors by giving them access to Ether price movements through regular brokerage accounts. This will allow investors familiar with traditional investments to access new markets without having to manage digital wallets or navigate complex cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the approval of an Ethereum ETF could make investing in the Ether cryptocurrency more accessible and attractive to a wide range of investors, opening up new horizons for capital inflows.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe next major event that is expected is the bitcoin halving. According to the bitcoin protocol, the next halving will take place in April 2024, when the reward for miners for mining a block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to a reward of only 3.125 BTC per block. This event could significantly affect bitcoin's market dynamics and raise investors' attention to its potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of bitcoin ETFs has brought significant price impulse to the cryptocurrency market, and helped drive the bitcoin price to a new all-time high. The move has opened up new opportunities for investors, allowing them to invest through traditional investment accounts. The approval of the Ethereum ETF could also lead to increased investor interest in the Ether cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be pointed out that one of the key factors that will also have an impact on cryptocurrency price rates is the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. This upgrade, which introduces proto-danksharding, not only improves the scalability of the Ethereum network, but also reduces fees in L2 rollups, which may become an additional motivation for investors and increase interest in the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nHowever, it is worth remembering that the actual impact of these events on cryptocurrency price rates can be complex and multifaceted. Other factors such as regulatory changes, technical innovations and macroeconomic conditions can also have a significant impact on market dynamics. Therefore, it is important to take all aspects into consideration and base your decisions on a multitude of other factors. Only time will tell the real impact of these events on the market and the crypto industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information presented in this article is the subjective opinion of the author and should not be considered a recommendation or a call to action.
