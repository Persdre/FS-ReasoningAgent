        "content": "Not many cryptocurrency investors think of XRP as an Ethereum competitor. That would be blockchain coins like Solana, Cardano, BNB Coin for Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Avalanche.\n\nRipple Is A Real Ethereum Competitor\n\nXRP Ledger (XRPL), however, extends the RippleNet ecosystem. With it, the cross-border payments platform for easy foreign currency exchange and fast settlement is a full-fledged DeFi chain.\n\nXRPL provides support for coin issuance, smart contracts, and the full gamut of DeFi use cases, with XRP as the native token. That makes XRP Ledger an Ethereum competitor.\n\nSolana, Cardano, and Avalanche get most of the media attention as potential \u201cEthereum Killers.\u201d But XRP Ledger is in the background, quietly and steadily developing Ripple into a DeFi crypto.\n\nXRP Ledger\u2019s Road Map In 2024\n\nMoreover, in a recent update on X, XRPL lead developer Wietse Wind outlined the Ledger project\u2019s road map:\n\n\u201cWell, [Vitalik Buterin] had a profound impact on this entire space, and now, 10+ years later, the XRPL ecosystem is still trying to capture even the tiniest bit of developer activity compared to what EVM did. If we can iterate on his contributions, ship even better L1 smart contracts more suitable for real life, every day utility, and capture dev and retail activity, we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d Well, the guy had a profound impact on this entire space, and now, 10+ years later, the XRPL ecosystem is still trying to capture even the tiniest bit of developer activity compared to what EVM did.

        "title": "Grok AI predicts Ethereum price for the end of 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and a leader in its Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) niche. Up nearly 100% in 2023, ETH investors now turn their eyes to the token\u2019s performance in 2024.\n\nIn particular, Finbold recurred to Grok\u2019s AI for insights on the price of Ethereum for the end of the year. Grok is an artificial intelligence model developed by xAI, a start-up founded by Elon Musk and directly connected to X.\n\nNotably, Grok sets the most likely range for the end of the year between $4,000 and $5,000 per ETH. According to the AI, the maximum Ethereum can reach in 2024 is $6,500, while the minimum is $2,500.\n\nThe artificial intelligence forecast is extremely bullish because ETH currently trades at $2,306 by press time. However, Grok shows inaccuracy because the market is already below the minimum. For context, Finbold prompted the AI with the current prices; thus, it was aware of this information.\n\nGrok AI Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for the end of 2024. Source: Finbold\n\nEthereum (ETH) analysis\n\nInterestingly, Grok provided the following analysis to justify the above forecast:\n\n\u201cOur Ethereum price prediction for the end of 2024 takes into account various factors, such as the successful Shanghai upgrade, the transition to Proof-of-Stake, and the potential for Ethereum ETFs. The Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s growth, as well as the impact of the Dencun Upgrade, are also considered. With a projected minimum price of $2,300, a maximum of $6,500, and an average of $4,000, Ethereum has the potential to experience significant gains in 2024.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok AI Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for the end of 2024. Source: Finbold\n\nNevertheless, its justification is solid and considers recent or current events possibly impacting Ethereum\u2019s value. It is also notable how Grok fixed the minimum to what ETH is currently trading at. Therefore, a run to the aforementioned average at $4,000 is likely and would result in a 74% yearly price appreciation.\n\nIn a bullish outlook, ETH could see a surge superior to 180% to its maximum. This is an attractive case of a great risk-reward opportunity if Grok is proven right moving forward.\n\nAll in all, investors must play cautiously and do their own research to find the best investment strategy. Institutional investors like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have their eyes on the leading Web3 blockchain, which could fuel its demand. The highest risk is Ethereum being dethroned by capable competitors like Solana (SOL).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "title": "$500 Million Worth Of ETH Leave Exchanges Last Week - What This Means For ETH - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently trading at $2,290 and is on a marginal increase of $0.17 in the past week. Although lacking much action and trading around $2,300 for most of the week, on-chain data regarding outflows has revealed the current sentiment among traders. According to data from on-chain analytics company IntoTheBlock, $500 million worth of ETH was withdrawn from centralized exchanges this week, bringing the total outflow in the past month to $1.2 billion.\n\nSurge In Ethereum Outflow From Exchanges\n\nEthereum went on an unforeseen price growth subsequent to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States. Consequently, various on-chain data have revealed a strong bullish sentiment, with the second largest crypto witnessing outflows from exchanges since this period. Outflows were particularly exacerbated last week, per IntoTheBlock, contributing a larger portion of $1.2 billion ETH withdrawn from exchanges in the past month.\n\n$500M in $ETH was withdrawn from CEXs this week, adding to a total of over $1.2B in outflows in the last month pic.twitter.com/e8NFOGtrDV \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 2, 2024\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,308 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant, 1.622 million ETH were withdrawn from crypto exchanges last week. A similar metric from the analytics platform shows the ETH reserve on exchanges has been on a free fall for the past year. As of the 4th of January, the statistics indicated that the total quantity of Ethereum that was deposited with various cryptocurrency exchanges amounted to 14.69 million. This number, however, has decreased by 397,012 ETH over the past month, bringing it down to 14.296 million ETH at the time of this writing, its lowest level ever.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For ETH Price?\n\nDropping exchange reserves reduces the amount of ETH available for trading, thereby increasing scarcity. The data from both Cryptoquant and IntoTheBlock indicates Ethereum might be gearing up for a price spike fueled by increasing scarcity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is up by 3.21% in a monthly timeframe. However, it is important to note that the crypto has been on a downtrend after reaching a 23-month high of $2,706 on January 12. A larger part of this downside can be attributed to a $1 billion selloff by Celsius Network as part of its plans to repay its creditors. At the same time, the cryptocurrency is facing constant competition from other blockchains, with Solana recently surpassing it in terms of daily trading volume on Decentralized exchanges.\n\nBased on the current price action, it appears like Ethereum has established a support level slightly above $2,280 and is now attempting a strong increase above this price point. According to a crypto analyst, the current configuration is an apparent replica of a price movement in 2021 which led to ETH reaching its current all-time high of $4,878 in the months after.\n\nFeatured image from Adobe Stock, chart from TradingView"
