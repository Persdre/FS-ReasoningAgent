        "title": "Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that following the Dencun hard fork, scaling on Ethereum is no longer a \u201czero-to-one\u201d problem but rather a \u201cone-to-N\u201d problem.\n\nInitially, Ethereum\u2019s development was centered around building its foundational infrastructure, effectively going from non-existence (zero) to establishing the baseline of a functional ecosystem (one). This phase was marked by significant challenges, like limited scalability and high transaction fees. These issues constrained Ethereum\u2019s ability to support widespread adoption of dapps and maintain operational efficiency.\n\nFollowing the Dencun update, Ethereum has pivoted to a more scalable infrastructure, highlighted by innovations such as proto-danksharding and, importantly, \u201cblobs\u201d for more efficient data handling and notably lower transaction costs. These advancements mark a transition from laying down the network\u2019s foundational framework to enhancing and broadening its capabilities. Developers will now work to scale from a solid baseline (one) to new, undefined heights (represented as N; an indefinite, but foreseeably large number).\n\nRead more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live on Ethereum on March 13. It featured EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which introduced \u201cblob\u201d transactions or sharded data. These transactions are designed to place data into \u201cblobs\u201d and guarantee data availability, subsequently reducing transaction costs on rollups.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, Buterin notes that important scaling work still needs to be done, like improving rollups\u2019 ability to optimize each blob, though the fundamental problems around scaling have already been addressed.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been slowly shifting from becoming a layer-1 ecosystem to a layer-2-centric ecosystem, with many applications moving towards building on layer-2s.\n\nWith this in mind, Buterin remarks that the next stage of Ethereum development will likely focus on bringing data availability sampling (DAS) to life, specifically PeerDAS.\n\nPeerDAS is designed to reuse battle-tested peer-to-peer components to enhance Ethereum data availability scaling beyond EIP-4844 while minimizing the amount of work that honest nodes need to do.\n\nRead more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone\n\n\u201cIn PeerDAS, each node stores a significant fraction (e.g. 1/8) of all blob data, and nodes maintain connections to many peers in the p2p network. When a node needs to sample for a particular piece of data, it asks one of the peers that it knows is responsible for storing that piece,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nUsing PeerDAS, more solo stakers can also participate in securing the network. They can download 1/8th of the data instead of a full blob, which helps decentralize the network.\n\nBesides DAS, Buterin also highlights four key areas of improvement for layer-2s. First, he notes that layer-2s can explore data compression techniques to decrease byte size for transactions. Secondly, it is worthwhile exploring Plasma as a technique, which will mean that data is only posted on layer-1s in exceptional circumstances.\n\nRead more: What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again?\n\nAdditionally, he remarks that layer-2s should investigate improving execution-related constraints and security as well as code reliability, noting that existing ecosystem standards are too lenient.\n\n\u201cEthereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem. It\u2019s a full-stack replacement for large parts of \u2018centralized tech,\u2019 and even provides some things that centralized tech does not. And we need to build with this broader ecosystem in mind,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Mining and Renewable Energy: Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum Lead Sustainability - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency mining has long faced scrutiny for its excessive energy consumption and subsequent environmental impact. In 2022, The White House discovered that crypto assets accounted for 0.4% to 0.9% of the total annual global electricity consumption, exceeding the energy usage of some individual countries.\n\nHowever, a recent study published in the journal PNAS has proposed a partnership between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, offering a potential avenue for accelerating the transition to cleaner energy while promoting broader adoption. In this article, we delve into the dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum mining, introduce BlockDAG Network mining, and explore how these projects' approach could contribute to democratizing the industry while supporting renewable energy initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study featured in PNAS underscores the synergistic potential between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, envisioning a scenario where profits from mining activities could be reinvested into clean hydrogen production and renewable energy businesses. This innovative solution involves utilizing crypto profits to drive the expansion of solar and wind energy indirectly through green hydrogen production.\n\nBitcoin:\n\nBitcoin, operating on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, traditionally relied on energy-intensive mining operations powered predominantly by fossil fuels. However, the PNAS study offers an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin's potential role in renewable energy expansion. It suggests a shift towards clean energy sources for Bitcoin mining, with energy companies or climate-focused groups undertaking mining activities instead of conventional individual miners. This shift aims to democratize the space, and ensures that earnings from mining are directed towards sustainable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network:\n\nBlockDAG Network presents a distinct departure from traditional blockchain consensus methods, offering a novel approach to transaction processing. Unlike linear blockchains like Bitcoin, which arrange transactions in sequential blocks, BlockDAG employs a graph-like structure, facilitated by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), enabling parallel processing and enhanced scalability. With the introduction of its mining solution, BlockDAG Network seeks to usher in a new era of accessibility and democratization within the passive income generation industry.\n\nBy harnessing the unique attributes of DAGs, BlockDAG Network pioneers a system where mining is no longer confined to large-scale operations that are not energy-efficient but instead, users can seamlessly integrate the machines into everyday households. Unlike conventional blockchain networks relying on Proof of Work (PoW) mechanisms and intensive computational power, BlockDAG eliminates the need for expensive, specialized mining hardware. Instead, it adopts a more inclusive approach, allowing individuals to participate in the mining process using affordable mining rigs available for purchase on the website, priced at $1,500 or less. This accessibility empowers anyone with a computer or smartphone connected to the internet to initiate mining activities promptly thereby generating passive income.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough its innovative home mining solutions, BlockDAG Network democratizes access to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and enables individuals worldwide to actively engage in block creation and validation while reshaping the landscape of digital currencies for the financial benefit of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum formerly operated on the same unsustainable proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism as Bitcoin. However, on September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent a transition, replacing its PoW mechanism with an alternative known as proof-of-stake (PoS). The transition of Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is known as the \"Merge\" and promised a drastic reduction in electricity consumption. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, projected that the transition to PoS would decrease global electricity usage by 0.2% and slash crypto carbon emissions by 99.992%. The Crypto Carbon Rating Institution reported a staggering 99.99% reduction in Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon footprint immediately after the Merge.\n\nThis change eliminated the network of energy-intensive mining devices that previously competed to create the next block for the underlying blockchain. Instead, wealth became a pivotal factor in the block creation process under PoS. Coins are staked as collateral, with the software randomly selecting a stakeholder to create the next block. Unlike PoW, where the chance of obtaining a reward depended on employing more energy-intensive devices, PoS incentivizes acquiring a higher stake to increase the odds of creating a new block.\n\nNow, Ethereum\u2019s PoS represents a significant improvement over PoW in terms of electricity consumption.\n\nWhile decentralization is crucial for blockchains to function effectively, it often comes with environmental costs. This appears to be about to change as Bitcoin and Ethereum mining together with BlockDAG Network mining hold the potential to drive a more sustainable and democratic future within the cryptocurrency industry. By embracing innovation, inclusion, and sustainability, these projects can pave the way for a greener, more resilient digital future.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
