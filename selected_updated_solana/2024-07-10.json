        "content": "Bitwise CCO Katherine Dowling said spot Ethereum ETFs are \u201cclose to the finish line\u201d while noting that the SEC is \u201cquite welcoming\u201d about discussions regarding other products.\n\nOn July 9, Dowling told Bloomberg that the SEC and ETF issuers are addressing fewer issues in each S-1 amendment, pointing to a close launch.\n\nDowling affirmed SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s assertion that the agency will fully approve issuers\u2019 registration statements over the summer but described an open time frame. She said:\n\n\u201cYou know, everyone has a different definition of summer. It\u2019s been a little bit of a long, hot summer for the issuers waiting \u2026.\u201d\n\nDowling said that Bitwise intends to set itself apart from other applicants, including giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, as a \u201ccrypto specialist\u201d with years of focus on the sector.\n\nBitwise filed its most recent amendment on July 3, while many other applicants filed on a July 8 deadline. Applicants must still add certain details, including sponsor\u2019s fees, in future amendments.\n\nSEC welcoming to other discussions\n\nDowling also said that Bitwise has spoken to the SEC about potential new products \u201ccoming down the pipe.\u201d She described the conversations positively, stating:\n\n\u201cI think our communication with the SEC about the prospects for these products has actually been quite welcoming.\u201d\n\nHowever, she agreed with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas that some products may only be approved under a new SEC chair.\n\nOtherwise, she said, it could take considerable time to bring the products to market due to the history of previous product approvals and the lack of future markets underlying the potential products.\n\nDowling did not identify the products in question. Currently, the only other pending spot crypto ETFs are VanEck and 21Shares\u2019 spot Solana (SOL) ETFs.\n\nBitwise has not applied for a similar product as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that the leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) is close to carving a mid-cycle bottom.\n\nIn a new video update, pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 264,400 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is about to conclude its ABC corrective wave.\n\nBluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a consolidating asset tends to witness an ABC correction before igniting a fresh five-wave surge.\n\n\u201cLooking at ETH/USD, we\u2019re basically down here at the lows again, but I think it would be very odd if we just moved up from here\u2026\n\nI think ultimately ETH needs to sweep $2,800, take out the low and reclaim it and then finally we would have what looks like a proper ABC down on Ethereum\u2026 [I think] we go sideways here on ETH for a little bit and take the lows and then look to bounce.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, Ethereum\u2019s ABC correction will eventually resolve to the upside, sending ETH initially to a new all-time high of $6,000 before pulling back and rallying to a cycle top of $8,000.\n\n\u201cI still firmly believe ETH has not had its big run yet and I do think it will definitely be coming this cycle. It\u2019s just late.\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to be induced by the ETH ETF narrative, which is supposedly coming out any day now. Everyone\u2019s talking about it, everyone\u2019s expecting it to be this giga-bullish ETH news. So I think what will most likely happen in my opinion is ETH will sell off first, take the lows, f**k everyone over and then start to get bid up heavily.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,048.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has just set a major milestone - this time in staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaking refers to the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software. However, there is some flexibility, as any user with any amount of ETH can help secure the network, while earning rewards based on how much they want to stake. While 32 ETH might be required to activate being a validator, it is possible to stake less.\n\nValidators are responsible for storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. This helps to secure Ethereum, while also allowing users to earn ETH rewards.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the ETH2 Beacon Deposit Contract, used for staking deposits for Ethereum 2.0, now holds an all-time high of 47.36 million ETH. Santiment regards this as positivity, with this figure accounting for 33.9% of the entire ETH supply.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f The ETH2 Beacon Deposit Contract, used for staking deposits for Ethereum 2.0, now holds an all-time high 47.36M ETH, This is good for 33.9% of the entire supply, and more than tripling since the 10.9% it held two years ago. pic.twitter.com/aCnEhfClfb \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 10, 2024\n\nSantiment noted a trend of growth in ETH staked, pointing out that this has more than tripled from the 10.9% the ETH2 Beacon deposit contract held two years ago.\n\nThis milestone remains significant as the network gets stronger against attacks, as more ETH is staked because it requires more ETH to control a majority of the network.\n\nIn another significant milestone, Blackrock's BUIDL fund operating on the Ethereum network continues to attract new investors. The fund requires a minimum entry of $5 million, and its total assets have nearly reached $500 million.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading down 0.29% in the last 24 hours at $3,079. In the short term, the $2,850 level is being eyed as a solid support for ETH's price action.\n\nThe $2,850 support cracks, the selling may increase and Ethereum may begin a downward trend to $2,200. The bulls are likely to strongly defend this level.\n\nAlternatively, if the ETH price bounces off its current level and goes above $3,110, it might signal the beginning of a relief rally above $3,200."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has once again sparked speculations among crypto market participants. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the crypto amid soaring anticipation over a potential Ether ETF launch soon.\n\nHowever, ETH has recently reclaimed the $3K level, but on-chain data indicates that it faces significant resistance at $3,200. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at why the $3.2K level poses a significant threat to Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Holders Ready To Sell ETH\n\nA recent Into The Block data revealed that approximately 2 million addresses that previously traded Ethereum at around the $3,200 price level are currently holding ETH at a loss. This paves the path for potential selloffs as these addresses break even with price gains ahead, adding selling pressure to the asset.\n\nHowever, a bullish catalyst in the pipeline might prevent this from happening. For context, the approaching launch of an ETH ETF (exchange-traded-product) could serve as a catalyst for a remarkable rising price action in the future. Aligning with this, the commencement of ETF trading could counteract the selling pressure, in turn generating positive momentum in the asset due to money inflow.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum has continued to struggle to reach its resistance level of $3,200.\n\nAlso Read: Institutional FOMO On Spot Bitcoin ETF As German Govt Continues BTC Sell-off\n\nETH Price Faces Turbulency\n\nAt press time, the ETH price showed a 0.20% dip in value, trading at $3,100.56. The token\u2019s 24-hour bottoms and peaks were $3,025.51 and $3,129.02, respectively.\n\nCoinglass data further validated ETH\u2019s turbulent movement, spotlighting an uncertain investor sentiment in the market. ETH Futures OI jumped 0.51% to $12.67 billion, while its derivatives volume dipped 30.71% to $21.15 billion. Notably, the RSI was recorded to be hovering at 40, underscoring that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that the current market sentiments could take a paradigm shift ahead with the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. CoinGape Media recently reported that a whale bagged a staggering 16K ETH in light of the looming ETF.\n\nAltogether, broader market sentiments remain optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future price movements, although traders and investors currently exercise caution due to the highly volatile nature of the crypto realm.\n\nAlso Read: Solana ETF Approval Stands Strong: VanEck Exec\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
