        "content": "Ethereum has surpassed Bitcoin in fee income over the past year by an epic 100%, according to the newest report from Lookonchain. Thus, its network has recorded $2.73 billion in fee income, the most in the industry. Bitcoin, in second place, generated $1.3 billion. Closing the top three is Tron Network, with almost $460 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther networks also contributed to the overall fee income landscape. Solana generated $241.3 million, Binance's chain accumulated $176.6 million and Avalanche recorded $68.83 million. Additionally, the zkSync Era earned nearly $60 million, Optimism $40.4 million and Polygon $23.9 million.\n\nHere are the top 10 chains by 1-year fee revenue.#Ethereum earns a fee of $2.728B per year, #Bitcoin earns a fee of $1.302B per year, and #TronNetwork earns a fee of $459.39M per year. pic.twitter.com/ixAiP9g8JA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 3, 2024\n\nAs the data highlights, Ethereum has a significant lead, doubling Bitcoin's revenue. This result is attributed to a broader range of applications and services on the network of the main altocin, with higher usage and transaction fees as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure win?\n\nEthereum's ecosystem supports decentralized finance platforms, NFTs and various applications, all of which contribute to increased transaction volume and fee income. This is what has positioned ETH as a more versatile and widely used network compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn return, Bitcoin's revenue, while still over a billion dollars, is primarily driven by its role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Its transaction fees are affected by network congestion and the price of BTC itself, which can fluctuate significantly.\n\nHowever, it still lacks the extensive range of applications found in the Ethereum ecosystem, resulting in lower overall fee income."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAsset manager Bitwise submitted an updated registration statement for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF with regulators on Wednesday, disclosing its plans to waive fees. While largely procedural, this latest revision is seen by market observers as a sign that the launch of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\n\u201cExpect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter (aka X). \u201cWe're thinking these things could potentially [be listed] later next week, or the week of the 15th at this point.\u201d\n\nAfter shares in the Bitwise Ethereum ETF are listed on an exchange, Bitwise will waive a yet-to-be-defined management fee on the first $500 million its fund garners during that period, the amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated.\n\nBitwise\u2019s move follows similar ones from Franklin Templeton and VanEck. Both ETF hopefuls have included fee waivers in filings for the first $10 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnticipation of the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs has grown steadily since the regulator\u2019s last-minute approval in May. While the SEC approved several so-called form 19b-4s, it has yet to green light individual S-1 filings from asset managers, which are needed for trading to begin.\n\nBitwise submitted its amended S-1 days before it was actually due, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Twitter, he floated the idea that Bitwise \u201cwanted to get it off their plate,\u201d and that the SEC\u2019s latest round of comments appeared to be minimal.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear the last round of comments were \u2018literally nothing\u2019\u2014took zero time to update,\u201d he said.\n\nBalchunas concurred that the class of products seems on track to begin trading this month. At the same time, he wondered why the regulator appears to be dragging its feet, considering the SEC seems mostly satisfied with the filings that firms have put forward so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCould be one 'problem' issuer slowing down [the] process or just summertime.\u201d\n\nNot long after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23, the cryptocurrency rallied to around $4,000. Yet as the approval process has played out, Ethereum\u2019s price has shed most of those gains, drifting down $3,270, as of this writing.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said last month that the process for launching spot Ethereum ETFs is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Summit, he added that progress is dependent on asset managers providing full disclosures.\n\nThough Bitwise\u2019s amended filing has few changes, it does include new disclosure language. For example, a clause was inserted stating the \u201cchair of the SEC has stated that the SEC has authority under existing laws to regulate the digital asset sector\u201d within a section on oversight.\n\nBitwise also added a few sentences disclosing that certain digital asset trading platforms, to the extent that they are regulated, may not be in compliance with applicable rules.\n\nFinally, a section also outlines the \u201cInitial Creation of Ether.\u201d Looking at Ethereum\u2019s initial supply of 72 million, it shows how most was sold to the public through a crowd sale in 2014, alongside distributions to the Ethereum Foundation and the network's developers.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."
