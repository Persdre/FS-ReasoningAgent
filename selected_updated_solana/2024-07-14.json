        "content": "PEPE\u2019s large holders sold off significant portions of their holdings in the last 30 days\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the memecoin was undervalued and could rally after the event\n\nMany investors in the market consider the upcoming Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF launch to be bullish. However, AMBCrypto found that large holders of Pepe [PEPE] seem not to share a similar sentiment.\n\nWe found this information after examining the addresses by holdings data. This indicator groups addresses into different segments and shows if they are accumulating or selling off their assets.\n\nIs the memecoin in chains?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto noticed that PEPE addresses holding tokens worth $100,000 to $10 million fell by double-digits. This decline implies that they have sold off some of their tokens within the last 30 days.\n\nThis is a surprise, primarily because PEPE is the top memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it was expected that the big wigs of the memecoin sector would give the same bullish cues as the rest of the bullish market.\n\nIf this stays the same when the spot Ethereum ETFs go live, PEPE\u2019s price might hike as a result of the development. However, it could be challenging to sustain the hike unless buying pressure increases.\n\nAt press time, the value of PEPE was. $0.0000087. This price meant that it was down 49.27% from the all-time high it hit on 27 May.\n\nGoing by the analysis above, further distribution could drag the price, and the token could be 55% down for the highs. However, post-Ethereum ETF\u2019s launch, the token might perform well on the charts.\n\nHigher highs will come later\n\nThis was the signal the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio gave. This ratio provides insights into profitability in the market.\n\nWhen the ratio rises, it means that the market cap is outpacing the realized cap. In this instance, holders of a cryptocurrency have motive to sell. However, if the ratio falls, it means that the realized cap is much more than the market cap.\n\nMost of the time, this brings about unrealized losses and there is little to no motive to sell. At the time of writing, PEPE\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was -10.90%, indicating that it experienced a poor level of demand dynamics lately.\n\nHowever, the good part is that the negative ratio might force market participants to hold on to the token. Therefore, the memecoin could be termed undervalued relative to its current market conditions.\n\nAs such, if buying pressure intensifies much later, we could see the price attempt to revisit its May highs. Despite the bearish signs pre-ETF launch, some analysts believe that the memecoin would gain from the development.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s PEPE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nOne of them is Donny Dicey, an analyst on X. The quote below is what Dicey thinks of the token\u2019s reaction to the Ethereum ETF launch."
