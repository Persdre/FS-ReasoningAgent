        "content": "The founder of SkyBridge Capital says that Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) competitor have helped the firm see strong returns on its investments.\n\nIn a new interview on Bloomberg Television, Anthony Scaramucci says that October 2023 was the best month SkyBridge Capital has had on record due to BTC and smart contract platform Solana (SOL) rebounding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a good run right now. The month of October [has] probably been the best month in SkyBridge\u2019s history for that matter. A lot of it is Bitcoin, some of it is tech, some of it is [a] newer economy \u2013 things that have rebounded aggressively since the beginning of the year. But of course, Bitcoin has had a spectacular month.\n\nYou know, we own a lot of Solana. I think Solana is probably up 70% this month. And so this is just another explanation [for] people stay in things, stay convicted. Don\u2019t listen to the chin music throughout the day, but have a very long-term focus on what you\u2019re doing. We never sold a Bitcoin. In fact, if anything, we accumulated Bitcoin this year at lower prices and it served us and our clients well.\u201d\n\nScaramucci goes on to say that SkyBridge would \u201clove\u201d to buy back the 30% stake of the company purchased by bankrupt crypto exchange FTX in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe would love to buy the stake back. Of course, we were defrauded by that company FTX. And so we have issues with that transaction. We\u2019d like to get the stake back. They\u2019re not ready to transact with us. We\u2019ve reached out to them many times.

        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran trader with over 40 years of experience, has set a target of $1,993 for Ethereum (ETH) following the asset\u2019s breakout of a recently formed right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nBrandt made this projection yesterday during his latest analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements. The trader shared a daily ETH chart on X, identifying the formation of a right-angled expanding triangle pattern, which was completed on Oct. 23.\n\nA right-angled expanding triangle, or a right-angled broadening wedge, features an upper trendline and a lower trendline, with both lines expanding apart. The pattern can either signal a potential continuation of the previous trend or a reversal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nData from Brandt\u2019s chart suggests that the beginning of this pattern dates back to Aug. 17. Notably, ETH collapsed 6.76% on the day, dropping to a low of $1,683.5. However, this massive red candlestick formed the base of the right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s swings and lows since Aug. 17, the asset formed the broadening triangle, as it continued to trade within its confines until Oct. 23. Brandt\u2019s analysis emphasizes that ETH completed the formation of the triangle on Oct. 23 amid a 6.17% increase that day.\n\nETH Forms Flag Pattern, Poised to Rally 8.6%\n\nInterestingly, ETH broke above the upper trendline of the triangle, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend that began on Oct. 12. However, after the breakout, Ethereum formed a flag pattern that lasted for nine days, from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1.\n\nBrandt identified this flag pattern in his analysis. According to him, ETH recently completed the flag pattern, which is a further re-confirmation of the right-angled expanding triangle, which the asset completed on Oct. 23.\n\nNotably, flags are typically consolidation patterns that suggest a brief pause in the prevailing trend before a potential resumption of that trend. Since breaking above $1,800, ETH has consolidated between $1,744 and $1,865, but with an upward trajectory.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe asset has now completed the nine-day flag, and a bullish continuation of the uptrend is expected. Brandt\u2019s chart suggests a target of $1,993 for when Ethereum engineers another massive run. ETH would need to appreciate 8.5% from its current price to hit $1,993.\n\nEthereum trades for $1,836 as of press time, per CoinMarketCap data. The asset is up 1.76% over the past 24 hours, with its eyes set on conquering the $1,874 resistance. Impressively, ETH\u2019s trade volume has increased 71.30% to a current value of $11.6 billion, ranking it third in volume."

        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machines: Your Guide to create, create2 and create3 - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Creating contracts on blockchains that work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) involves the use of special instructions called opcodes. Among these instructions:\n\n\u201cCREATE\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE2\u201d\n\n\u201cCREATE3\u201d\n\nWhile the first two are actual opcodes, \u201ccreate3\u201d is a useful library that acts similarly. This guide will give you a quick overview of what each one does and why they matter.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate\u201d Opcode\n\nThe create opcode is the most commonly used contract creation opcode. When contracts are deployed from scripts or other development environments, the create opcode is the low-level instruction executed by the EVM to deploy and generate a contract address.\n\nUse-case:\n\nCreating new contracts within a contract dynamically. More cost-effective for deploying multiple contracts. When the address predictability is not a requirement.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate2\u201d Opcode\n\nA fixed prefix, which is always 0xFF . The sender\u2019s address ensures the contract is tied to a specific creator. A chosen salt value adds uniqueness to the contract address. The bytecode contains the code of the new contract to be deployed.\n\n\n\nBy combining these parameters, CREATE2 computes a deterministic address for the new contract, which remains the same even as the blockchain evolves.\n\nUse-case:\n\nEnsuring a deterministic and predictable address for a new contract. Useful in state channels, contract wallets, and off-chain interactions. Offers an added layer of security by checking for existing contracts before deployment.\n\nLeveraging the \u201ccreate3\u201d Opcode\n\nCREATE3 is similar to CREATE2 but without including the contract initCode on the address derivation formula. It can be used to generate deterministic contract addresses that aren\u2019t tied to a specific contract code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE3 is a way to use CREATE and CREATE2 in combination such that bytecode no longer affects the deployment address. CREATE3 is more expensive than CREATE or CREATE2 (Fixed extra cost of ~55k gas).\n\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense pragma solidity ^0.8.0; /** @title A library for deploying contracts EIP-3171 style. @author Agustin Aguilar <[email protected]> */ library Create3 { error ErrorCreatingProxy(); error ErrorCreatingContract(); error TargetAlreadyExists(); /** @notice The bytecode for a contract that proxies the creation of another contract @dev If this code is deployed using CREATE2 it can be used to decouple `creationCode` from the child contract address 0x67363d3d37363d34f03d5260086018f3: 0x00 0x67 0x67XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX PUSH8 bytecode 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0x363d3d37363d34f0 0x02 0x52 0x52 MSTORE 0x03 0x60 0x6008 PUSH1 08 8 0x04 0x60 0x6018 PUSH1 18 24 8 0x05 0xf3 0xf3 RETURN 0x363d3d37363d34f0: 0x00 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x01 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x02 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 0 cds 0x03 0x37 0x37 CALLDATACOPY 0x04 0x36 0x36 CALLDATASIZE cds 0x05 0x3d 0x3d RETURNDATASIZE 0 cds 0x06 0x34 0x34 CALLVALUE val 0 cds 0x07 0xf0 0xf0 CREATE addr */ bytes internal constant PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = hex\"67_36_3d_3d_37_36_3d_34_f0_3d_52_60_08_60_18_f3\"; // KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = keccak256(PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE); bytes32 internal constant KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE = 0x21c35dbe1b344a2488cf3321d6ce542f8e9f305544ff09e4993a62319a497c1f; /** @notice Returns the size of the code on a given address @param _addr Address that may or may not contain code @return size of the code on the given `_addr` */ function codeSize(address _addr) internal view returns (uint256 size) { assembly { size := extcodesize(_addr) } } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode) internal returns (address addr) { return create3(_salt, _creationCode, 0); } /** @notice Creates a new contract with given `_creationCode` and `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @param _creationCode Creation code (constructor) of the contract to be deployed, this value doesn't affect the resulting address @param _value In WEI of ETH to be forwarded to child contract @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error */ function create3(bytes32 _salt, bytes memory _creationCode, uint256 _value) internal returns (address addr) { // Creation code bytes memory creationCode = PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE; // Get target final address addr = addressOf(_salt); if (codeSize(addr) != 0) revert TargetAlreadyExists(); // Create CREATE2 proxy address proxy; assembly { proxy := create2(0, add(creationCode, 32), mload(creationCode), _salt)} if (proxy == address(0)) revert ErrorCreatingProxy(); // Call proxy with final init code (bool success,) = proxy.call{ value: _value }(_creationCode); if (!success || codeSize(addr) == 0) revert ErrorCreatingContract(); } /** @notice Computes the resulting address of a contract deployed using address(this) and the given `_salt` @param _salt Salt of the contract creation, resulting address will be derivated from this value only @return addr of the deployed contract, reverts on error @dev The address creation formula is: keccak256(rlp([keccak256(0xff ++ address(this) ++ _salt ++ keccak256(childBytecode))[12:], 0x01])) */ function addressOf(bytes32 _salt) internal view returns (address) { address proxy = address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex'ff', address(this), _salt, KECCAK256_PROXY_CHILD_BYTECODE ) ) ) ) ); return address( uint160( uint256( keccak256( abi.encodePacked( hex\"d6_94\", proxy, hex\"01\" ) ) ) ) ); } } contract Child { function hola() external view returns (string memory) { return \"mundo\"; } } contract Deployer { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3(keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), type(Child).creationCode); } } contract Child2 { uint256 meaningOfLife; address owner; constructor(uint256 _meaning, address _owner) { meaningOfLife = _meaning; owner = _owner; } } contract Deployer2 { function deployChild() external { Create3.create3( keccak256(bytes(\"<my salt>\")), abi.encodePacked( type(Child).creationCode, abi.encode( 42, msg.sender ) ) ); } }\n\nFeatures:\n\nDeterministic contract address based on msg.sender + salt.
