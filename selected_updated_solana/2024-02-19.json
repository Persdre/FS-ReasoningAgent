        "title": "AI tokens jump 10% as Vitalik Buterin explains how AI can enhance security and efficiency on Ethereum - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Digital assets in the artificial intelligence sector continued their recent surge, increasing by 10%, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that the technology could help the blockchain network mitigate its \u201cbiggest technical risk.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data show that several tokens in the sector, including SingularityNET\u2019s AGIX, 0x0.ai, Ocean Protocol\u2019s OCEAN, The Graph\u2019s GRT, Fetch.AI\u2019s FET, and others, rose more than 10%, respectively, during the past day, pushing the sector\u2019s market capitalization to $18.06 billion and its trading volume to approximately $2.5 billion.\n\nHow AI can aid Ethereum\n\nAccording to Buterin, AI technology could help blockchain network developers identify bugs and assist with the verification of codes.\n\n\u201cRight now ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d he added.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of his recent exploration of the synergy between AI and crypto, detailed in a blog post on Jan. 30. Buterin outlined various potential applications of AI within the crypto sphere.\n\nHe pointed out that integrating AI could revolutionize crypto-systems, particularly in scenarios where individual participants are replaced by AI entities, enabling more efficient operation on a micro-scale.\n\nWhile recognizing AI integration\u2019s functionality and safety enhancements, Buterin also urged caution, especially in high-value and high-risk settings.\n\nBeyond Ethereum, other protocols and exchanges like Solana, Polkadot, Binance, and stake.link also explore AI-driven solutions.\n\nHowever, despite the enthusiasm for AI, concerns linger regarding its efficacy in bug detection. Daniel \u201cHaxx\u201d Stenberg of cURL highlighted potential challenges, including the risk of AI-generated false positives complicating bug identification efforts.\n\n\u201cAn (AI-generated) security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature,\u201d Stenberg argued.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Explodes Toward $3K: Two Things to Watch This Week (ETH Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently surged with notable momentum, signaling a bullish uptrend.\n\nThis increase has seen the price reclaim a critical resistance level, reflecting strong buyer confidence and market participant optimism.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals a significant shift in market sentiment, characterized by an impulsive uptrend and heightened bullish momentum.\n\nAccordingly, the price has approached a crucial multi-year resistance zone \u2013 the psychological barrier at $2.9K and successfully surpassed it.\n\nThis indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment among market participants, with buyers dominating the market. The trend appears sustainable, with eyes set on surpassing the major yearly swing high at $3.6K. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the only concern is the emergence of an expanded bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, signaling a possible short to mid-term correction or consolidation phase before the next surge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, a significant price reversal can be observed near the multi-month ascending trendline, supported by substantial buying pressure. This upward momentum led to a breakthrough above a crucial prior major swing high, establishing a new higher high. The above underscores the presence of active buyers targeting higher resistance levels.\n\nWith the price reclaiming a significant resistance zone and completing a pullback to the broken level, the trajectory is expected to remain bullish with intermittent downward corrections. However, given prevailing market conditions, periods of heightened volatility may lead to notable price fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and reclaiming of crucial resistance levels signify strong buyer confidence and a sustainable bullish trend. While short to mid-term corrections are possible, the overall outlook remains positive, with buyers likely to continue driving the market toward higher price targets.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed from the significant support level of $1.5K to surpass $2.8K in recent months, investors are keen to gain insights from futures market sentiment analysis.\n\nThe chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, representing the total number of open futures contracts, regardless of the trade direction. Higher values signify increased confidence among futures traders in the prevailing trend, while lower values indicate uncertainty. Moreover, heightened open interest often correlates with heightened price volatility, as it amplifies the probability of cascading liquidations.\n\nNotably, the chart reveals a significant surge in open interest, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s upward price trend, reaching its peak levels since July 2022. This surge indicates sustained confidence among futures traders in Ethereum\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nHowever, given the impulsive nature of the recent ascent, traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for sudden liquidation events, which could trigger notable short to mid-term price declines."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price briefly surges over $2,900 on Monday, sparking renewed interest in the community ahead of the upcoming Dencun upgrade. ETH price upswing comes after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest post regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and its use cases in crypto.\n\nVitalik Buterin Hints At AI Integration in Ethereum?\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has been actively looking at artificial intelligence (AI) recently, talking about its pros and cons. He recently talked about how crypto and AI overlap, pointing out potential use cases and risks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his excitement about artificial intelligence in a blog post on February 19. The use of AI in formal code verification and bug detection is one application about which he is quite enthusiastic. According to him, code problems represent \u201cEthereum\u2019s biggest technical risk pro\u201d at the moment, and AI will revolutionize bug remediation.\n\n\u201cOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding. Right now Ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nAptos Labs\u2019 Wolfgang Grieskamp commented that the design of the EVM, unfortunately, makes verification very hard, with difficulty in discovering simple control flow because of indirect branching. \u201cNot sure whether AI will help here. Formal verification of Move is easier and works today, AI can further boost it.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF is \u201ca Giant Mistake\u201d \u2013 Market Expert Jim Bianco Says\n\nEthereum Verkle Trees\n\nAs Ethereum goes for the Dencun (Deneb and Cancun) upgrade is scheduled to go live on March 13, Vitalik Buterin really looking to Verkle trees. Citing a website maintained by Ethereum Foundation developers, Buterin said it will enable stateless validator clients, allowing staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync almost instantly. This will offer a better solo staking user experience.\n\nETH price hit $2,904.71, up 3% in the past 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $2,780 and $2,902, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by over 30% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop 10% after a weeklong consolidation with BTC bulls showing exhaustion.\n\nEthereum price is likely to revisit $2,800, a 5% fall that could trigger a cascade of losses.\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000 as XRP bulls show strength on the heels of SEC lawsuit conclusion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price\u2019s bullish breakout appears to be losing steam, with the sentiment spreading across the market and leaving Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins in general susceptible to a crash. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is an outlier, pushing north on the heels of developments in the legal front.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to drop 10% as US markets commemorate Presidents\u2019 Day\n\nBitcoin likely to correct before next leg up\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting resistance at $52,768 blockade, a roadblock that has stood for the past week. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dejected and moving horizontally, coupled with its position at 79, BTC is overbought, a status that often precipitates a correction.\n\nLikely targets in a southbound directional bias would be the 78.6% and 61.8% Fibonacci levels, at $49,786 and $47,445, respectively. In a dire case, Bitcoin price could roll over to the 50% Fibonacci level at $45,801, 12% below current levels.\n\nThe Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator also suggests a possible correction, having increased above 1 as a 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is bolstered by fading histogram bars on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNotably, however, the bulls still have a presence in the BTC market, seen with the status of the MACD in positive territory. If these traders act, Bitcoin price could push north, clearing the $52,768 blockade and potentially record a new range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price bullish outlook inspires IntoTheBlock\u2019s 85% forecast of BTC at a new ATH by August\n\nEthereum price likely to revisit $2,800\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has outperformed BTC. However, it appears to be delaying the inevitable as altcoins await the Bitcoin cue. The RSI shows ETH is already overbought, worsened by the SOPR above 1, hinting at possible correction.\n\nA move south could see Ethereum price lose the immediate support at $2,874, potentially extending the fall to the $2,800 base, 5% below current levels. In a dire case, ETH could roll over to the confluence between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,689. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a reentry by the bulls could send Ethereum price further north, clearing the $2,944 range high and potentially extend the gains to the $3,000 psychological target, almost 3% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains bullish despite the broader market showing weakness, an optimism inspired by hopes of a conclusion in the legal saga against the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith RSI at 58 and leaning north, Ripple price could increase amid rising momentum and the fact that there is still more room north before ETH is overbought.\n\nEnhanced activity among the bulls could see XRP price shatter the resistance due to the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus. A tag of this milestone would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary could send Ripple price south, first losing support due to the $0.5368 buyer congestion level. An extended fall could see Ripple price test the midline of the channel at $0.5145, or in a dire case, slip to the support floor at $0.4734, 15% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price steadies above $0.56 ahead of deadline in SEC v.

        "title": "Selling Ethereum in 2024: is now the right time? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts and far-reaching dApps. If you wish to trade in ETH, you need to analyze the project\u2019s performance, trends, upgrades and updates, and basically any other aspect that could impact its price. This will help you determine the right time to sell or buy ETH. Depending on these factors, you may then decide to hold onto your ETH or convert ETH to USD.\n\nHere, we examine Ethereum in more detail to help you determine whether now is the perfect time to sell your ETH.\n\nWhat Is Unique about Ethereum\u2019s Technology?\n\nThe Ethereum network is an open-source protocol that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It supports an immense ecosystem of decentralized apps as a pioneer of blockchain smart contracts. Since its inception, Ethereum has been a pacesetter in digital trends such as NFTs, GameFi, Web3, Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThanks to the network\u2019s vast applications, serious concerns have emerged regarding its massive energy consumption, high transaction costs, and scalability. Some investors are already considering selling ETH in preference to its competitors \u2014 Solana, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano. You can read more about some of these crypto projects on the Paybis blog.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Updates and Upgrades\n\nEthereum 2.0 reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed from 30 TPS to 100,000 TPS. The goal is to ensure ETH is more usable with increased adoption to grow and stabilize its price.\n\nThe upgrade also saw Ethereum move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This migration helped the network to reduce its carbon footprint by over 90%.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been long in the pipeline. It started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, and ever since, we\u2019ve witnessed the Berlin and London upgrades.\n\nOther notable upgrades that followed included Arrow Glacier, Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris. The last three were collectively referred to as \u2018The Merge.\u2019\n\nIn 2023, the Uniswap V4, a new smart contract protocol, was launched. However, Ethereum\u2019s developers also recently rolled out the Shanghai upgrade that would allow ETH validators to unlock staked ETH, making rewards accessible.\n\nHow Has Ethereum Performed in Previous Years?\n\nLooking back at Ethereum\u2019s ICO, we see how affordable the coin was at just $0.31. Up until 2016, the price averaged less than $1. ETH skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1,270 in 2018 but the real bull run came in 2021 when it hit an unprecedented $4,891.\n\nSince then, the crypto market has experienced a bearish market, which saw most crypto projects shed a lot of their value. The crypto asset plunged to $890 on June 18, 2022, but has recovered well to register a 130% price gain from its current price. However, it\u2019s important to note that it still grapples with a 58% decrease from its ATH.\n\nNavigating through the highs and lows, Ethereum faced heightened volatility throughout 2023. Towards the end of October, the entire crypto market received a significant boost fueled by the anticipation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. This optimism propelled the price of ETH upward, breaching the $2,000 mark on November 9th for the first time since July.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum?\n\nLooking at expertly derived technical charts for Ethereum, there\u2019s a strong indication that the price will pull through the $2,300 resistance point.\n\nOnce Ethereum 2.0 updates and upgrades start fully rolling out, experts have forecast ETH to hit $2,700 in 2024 and $3,000 by 2025.\n\nSeasoned analysts and market veterans exhibit a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum, maintaining an optimistic outlook on its future price trajectory. Some even project that Ethereum could reach an impressive $40,000 by 2030. These forward-looking expectations underscore the confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for substantial growth and sustained value over the coming decade.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransformative Ethereum 2.0 updates are poised to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and sustainability. With the current ETH price at $2,500 and a market cap of more than $300 billion, the crypto market continues to showcase Ethereum\u2019s resilience.\n\nAs the crypto landscape evolves, staying informed and adaptable is crucial when considering selling ETH. Consider diversifying your portfolio away from Ethereum, you can exchange ETH for up-and-coming competitors such as Solana, Polkadot, Binance, or the more established Bitcoin."
