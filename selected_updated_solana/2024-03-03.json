In this regard, consolidation around the $3,400 zone is the more likely scenario.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nOn the daily time frame, the situation is quite similar. The rate of the main altcoin is far from the resistance. Traders may only expect an ongoing rise if the bar returns to the $3,480 zone.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nFrom the midterm point of view, Ethereum (ETH) has almost touched the $3,582 level. However, one should focus on the candle closure. If it happens above it and with no long wicks, the upward move may lead to a test of the $3,600-$3,700 area this month.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,428 at press time."

        "content": "Ethereum price is consolidating gains above $3,400. ETH is showing positive signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,500 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is holding gains and consolidating below the $3,500 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair seems to be setting up for a move toward the $3,650 and $3,800 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum price formed a base above the $3,350 level and started another increase, like Bitcoin. ETH broke the $3,400 level to set the pace for more upsides.\n\nThere was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $3,519 swing high to the $3,305 low. The bulls are now active above the $3,420 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is showing positive signs above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $3,519 swing high to the $3,305 low.\n\nImmediate resistance on the upside is near the $3,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,520 level. The next major resistance is near $3,550, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. The next stop for the bulls could be near the $3,650 level.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf there is a move above the $3,650 resistance, Ether could even rally toward the $3,720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $3,800.\n\nAre Dips Supported In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,520 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,420 level and the trend line.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,400 zone or the 100 hourly SMA. The next key support could be the $3,350 zone. A clear move below the $3,350 support might send the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,400\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,520"
