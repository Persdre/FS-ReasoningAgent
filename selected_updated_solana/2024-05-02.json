We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant downturn this week as Ethereum (ETH) faced a substantial drop of over 9.6% since the week began, marking its lowest values since mid-February. Currently priced at $2,950 per ETH, Tuesday saw the bulk of this decline, culminating in a weekly low of $2,817.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAmid this turbulence, attention has been drawn to a suspected Ethereum Foundation address, \"0xd7,\" which reportedly sold 100 ETH for 291,267 DAI via the Cow Protocol today.\n\nThis transaction was followed by a transfer of the acquired DAI to another Ethereum Foundation address, \"0x9e.\" Notably, this suspected Ethereum Foundation address has been consistently exchanging ETH for DAI through the Cow Protocol in recent times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow solid is that foundation?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of Ethereum and related technologies. According to reports from Arkham, the known accounts of the Foundation currently boast 310,867 ETH, valued at $915.15 million.\n\nExcluding exchanges and select projects, the foundation stands as one of the largest altcoin holders, with assets estimated to exceed $1 billion, encompassing holdings in WETH.E worth $91.87 million, along with 329,239 DAI \u2014 some of which arrived in foundation addresses today.\n\nThe revelation of one of the foundation's key holders offloading a portion of their ETH holdings has sparked speculation regarding its potential impact on Ethereum's future trajectory. The implications of such actions on the price of main altcoin remain uncertain, leaving investors and enthusiasts with unanswered questions."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBut the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.\n\nEconomist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve.\"\n\nAnalysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee\u2014which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates\u2014would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.\n\nSome thoughts on the current crypto cycle #1 The crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF. #2 ETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers. #3 Solana established itself as the chain of choice for\u2026 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) May 1, 2024\n\nDuring a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said, but warned that it was \u201clikely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.\u201d\n\nBut even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. \"I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut,\" he said during a press conference in Japan last month. \"This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that.\"\n\nHe was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time."
