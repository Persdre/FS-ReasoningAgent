Additionally, leading Solana-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced an over 35% increase over the past 7 days, reaching $3.28.\n\nSolana's recent resurgence coincides with a surge in new tokens deployed on the network using the SPL standard.

        "title": "MEV collected by validators is now higher on Solana than on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s validators are a bit like baristas flipping around an iPad \u2014 they\u2019re nicer to you when you include a tip. And as traders keep cramming into Solana\u2019s metaphorical coffee shop, the validator tip jar looks increasingly stuffed with money.\n\nValidators are a group of 1,728 computers that run software to produce blocks on the Solana blockchain. Coinbase Cloud is a prominent Solana validator, as is Google Cloud. One revenue stream that validators earn is called maximal extractible value (MEV), which refers partly to tips paid by searchers to be included in Solana blocks.\n\nThis MEV revenue has been growing quickly since mid-March. Notably, Solana validators are earning more from MEV overall than Ethereum validators, according to Blockworks Research. Just a few months ago, Solana\u2019s MEV revenue was a rounding error compared to Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nRead more: MEV doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game, research suggests\n\nBroadly defined, MEV refers to the largest amount of value that validators can create by packing transactions into blockchain blocks. Blockworks Research\u2019s dashboard suggests Solana validators raked in a hair under $7 million from MEV last week.\n\nAt the moment, Solana MEV is almost entirely the product of a protocol named Jito. Jito offers a fork of the Solana validator called Jito-Solana, and 78% of Solana\u2019s validators use this client, according to Jito\u2019s website. The client lets searchers, or traders, arrange transactions in bundles. Searchers can include a tip to try getting validators to send their particular bundle to the blockchain.\n\nWhether all this is good for Solana is something of a matter of perspective. Some forms of MEV can be predatory. Jito recently suspended its mempool, a kind of waiting area for transactions, due to \u201csandwich attacks\u201d that let opportunists create MEV by trading right before and after a transaction to manipulate the price and take profit from the trader.\n\nRead more: Jito Labs ends mempool functionality citing impact on Solana users\n\nIn Jito\u2019s telling, the protocol is making Solana more efficient while also minimizing negative forms of MEV like sandwich attacking. If it can pull that off, Solana could see a lot of benefit.\n\nContinued long-term growth in Solana\u2019s MEV would likely imply that less spam is being included in blocks, and Solana would have more available blockspace, Blockworks Research analyst Hayden Tsutsui said. In a best case scenario, more blockspace could free up room for more on-chain activity, which could also bring along more liquidity, Tsutsui said.\n\nBut it bears mentioning that as things currently stand, Solana is still staggering under a mountain of spam. More than 60% of non-vote transactions fail on Solana, according to Blockworks Research, largely due to bots taking advantage of Solana\u2019s cheap fees by inundating the network in hopes of getting transactions to land.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- During turbulent times in the cryptocurrency market, where uncertainty looms large and volatility reigns supreme, certain tokens defy the odds and chart their path to success. Solana stands tall, riding a wave of surging momentum, while Ethereum grapples with its challenges, struggling to maintain its position amidst the chaos. Yet, amidst this backdrop of fluctuating fortunes, a beacon of excitement and opportunity emerges: Furrever Token (FURR). As Solana's meteoric rise captures headlines and Ethereum's struggles dominate discussions, FURR enters the fray with a sense of ambition and optimism fueled by the promise of its unique charm and a compelling $10,000 competition.\n\nEthereum ETF Decision Delay Sparks Volatility: SEC's Latest Move Sends ETH on a Rollercoaster Ride\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again postponed its decision on the proposed Invesco Galaxy Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), extending the deadline to July 5, 2024. This announcement has triggered a downturn in Ethereum's (ETH) price, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs. With major financial institutions like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and BlackRock also awaiting regulatory clarity, the market response has been marked by slight downward pressure on ETH, particularly among short-term traders.\n\nDespite briefly breaching the critical resistance level of $3,220, Ethereum has seen a decline of approximately 4% today. The volatility has led to significant liquidations among long traders, totaling $67.42 million, indicative of a cautious sentiment among investors amid regulatory uncertainties. As attention remains focused on further updates from regulatory authorities, Ethereum's trading volume has surged by over 66% in the past 24 hours, reaching $13.78 billion, highlighting the market's keen interest in developments impacting ETH's price.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana Surges: Breaking Trends and Charting New Heights\n\nSolana (SOL) has experienced a notable uptick in its price, currently standing at around $158.12, marking a 1.5% increase from yesterday. This surge follows a significant breakthrough that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Solana has signaled a potential reversal of its previous bearish trend by successfully breaching a key trendline resistance, instilling confidence in its upward trajectory.\n\nThe next obstacle in its path is the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), historically a formidable resistance level. Should Solana surpass this barrier, it could pave the way for further gains, potentially reaching the 50-day EMA at around $163.29. This technical achievement underscores Solana's resilience and heralds the possibility of a bullish phase, reinforcing its position as a compelling investment option in the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR)'s Path to Success: Leveraging Community Engagement and a Lucrative Competition\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is positioned on the brink of mirroring Solana's triumphs, propelled by its inventive strategy and recent strides in community engagement. With its mission grounded in fostering a warm and inclusive ecosystem, FURR has captivated investors and enthusiasts, boasting a vibrant community and rapid organic growth. Currently priced at $0.000648, FURR offers investors the potential for up to 15X returns, further enhancing its appeal in the market.\n\nThe recent unveiling of the Furrever Token $10,000 Frenzy Bonanza Competition is pivotal in FURR's journey toward success. This competition represents more than just a mere event; it embodies FURR's commitment to community involvement and excitement. Participants are invited to partake in simple tasks on the Gleam platform, accumulating points and increasing their chances of winning substantial rewards. With a $10,000 prize pool up for grabs, the competition ignites fervor within the FURR community and attracts new participants eager to be part of the excitement. However, time is of the essence, as there are only two days left to join, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging enthusiasts to act swiftly to seize this opportunity.\n\nMoreover, the competition's strategic significance extends beyond mere rewards. By incentivizing participation and rewarding community engagement, FURR aims to solidify its position as a leader in the market. The competition fosters long-term loyalty and enthusiasm among its supporters, laying the groundwork for sustained growth and success. As FURR harnesses the momentum generated by the competition, it sets its sights on a future defined by innovation, prosperity, and unwavering community support.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token $10,000 Bonanza Competition\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
