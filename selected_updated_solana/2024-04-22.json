        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC dominance drops as rotation starts slowly - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is likely to suffer rejection as BTC market shows cautious optimism after halving.\n\nEthereum price making a strong close above $3,238 could kickstart a 15% rally to $3,750.\n\nOnly a candlestick above $0.6791 would make Ripple token attractive to buy for XRP bulls.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias following a successful halving event that has since renewed optimism in the market. With it, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices are showing promise, amid calls of a looming altcoin season.\n\nPost-halving, markets are gathering modest gains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is going back down after establishing a peak of 57.03%. As it continues to drop, the rotation is slowly gaining steam in favor of altcoins. A drop in dominance below 54% could be a good confirmation.\n\nBTC dominance\n\nAlso Read: Is Bitcoin sucking liquidity from altcoins, or will alt season begin again?\n\nBitcoin price at the cusp of a pullback\n\nBitcoin price is stuck within the lower section of the market range, confronting overhead pressure from the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $66,727. The market is leaning in favor of the downside, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appearing subdued after spending quite some time barely above the 50 mean level and hinting at buyer exhaustion.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is in negative territory. While it is above the signal line in the 12-hour time frame, the positions are reversed in the daily time frame, showing a continuation of the bearish sentiment. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator in negative territory accentuates this.\n\nBitcoin price is likely to reverse to $63,284, followed by a subsequent drop to $60,000 before a possible pullback. Notably, there remains some uncollected liquidity below this level, marked by the March 5 low of $59,005 and whose residue needs to be collected for balance.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nHowever, if the bulls can manage to breach the $66,727 roadblock and move above the most crucial Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8% at $68,391, it could open the expanse for extended gains, potentially as high as a new peak above $73,777.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price nicks $66K after halving as BTC transaction fees reverse\n\nEthereum price could rally 15%\n\nAmid speculation of an altcoin season, Ethereum price could rally 15% to $3,750, levels last tested around mid-March. This could be driven by an altcoin season, with ETH bulls primed for a rally as showed by the buy signals on both the RSI and MACD indicators, which have already crossed their respective signal lines.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the Ethereum price could extend a neck higher to $4,093, nearly 30% above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, if traders succumb to their profit appetite, Ethereum price could retract 6%, losing all the gains made over the past few days. In a dire case, the slump could extend to the April 13 low of $2,850, 10% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nRipple price must rise 25% before XRP bulls flock the scene\n\nRipple price is bending to the alt season narrative, but XRP bulls will only come in after the price closes above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.6791. With the RSI and the MACD teasing with buy signals and the AO showing a bold resolve by the bulls to recover the market after multiple successive green histograms, the upside potential for XRP continues to grow.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a rejection could send the XRP price south to find initial support at the $0.5000 psychological level or lower at $0.4500. A lower low below $0.4188, however, would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Price Outlook: A breakout or significant price movement may be imminent for Ripple\u2019s token"

        "title": "Ethereum Price: 2 Reasons Why ETH Price is Rising ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The long anticipated Bitcoin halving is finally completed, after Ethereum (ETH) saw slow growth amid the recent market crash. This was partly fueled by the fading expectation of SEC approving Ethereum ETFs in may. ETH experienced losses by 15% slightly over a week ago, losing ground to Bitcoin. Although there was no immediate reaction to the halving event by top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin itself, Ethereum (ETH) has since seen an uptick of approximately 0.8% in its market value. As investors and enthusiasts closely monitor the next move of Bitcoin and altcoins, let\u2019s unravel why Ethereum price is rising.\n\nCurrent Market Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nOver the past day, the price of Ethereum has risen by 1.39% to $3,214.11. This increase maintains a favorable pattern for the week, increasing by 2.16%, but exhibits an 8.40% drop over the month. This shows potential volatility and market correction in the long-term\n\nEthereum holds the second position in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap, amounting to $385.8 billion. The token has experienced a slight increase of approximately 1.8% in its trading activity, by recording a trading volume of $10.16 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nETH has been trading between a low of $3,119.55 to a high of $3,210.30, indicating moderate volatility within the day. However, when compared to its all-time high of $4,891.70 it achieved on November 16, 2021, the token has recorded losses of 34.69%, indicating a notable pullback from its highest point.\n\nWhale Activity\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is underscored by significant on-chain transactions, particularly one involving a substantial withdrawal of 10,119 ETH from Binance, indicative of a notable Ethereum whale activity. According to Lookonchain investor has been progressively accumulating Ethereum, amassing a total of 127,388 ETH since April 8, totaling around $405.19 million.\n\nNotably, the average purchase price of this whale, standing at $3,172 per ETH, signals a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum\u2019s potential within the market.\n\nAdding to the rumors is the participation of Justin Sun, the creator of Tron (TRX), a well-known figure in the crypto world recognized for his financial ventures and public remarks. Claims imply that Sun has been buying Ethereum, with evidence suggesting that a wallet reportedly linked to him has been accumulating a substantial quantity of ETH since the start of April.\n\nThis wallet\u2019s activity aligns with a pattern observed from March 31, wherein large sums of stablecoins were moved from Binance to Ethereum, followed by substantial purchases of ETH from both Binance and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe similarities in transaction behavior between this wallet and another previously linked to Justin Sun, which acquired Ethereum in February, further bolster the speculation that Sun may indeed be behind these transactions.\n\nIn total, the suspected wallets attributed to Sun have reportedly acquired 295,757 ETH, valued at approximately $891 million, since February 12, at an average price of $3,014 per ETH.\n\nThese transactions, coupled with the ongoing interest and investments from notable figures like Justin Sun, contribute to the upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is still being traded at $3,206.30, indicating the current market trends and investor feelings towards the digital currency. The participation of powerful people like Sun illustrates the changing interactions within the Ethereum community, emphasizing its importance and possibility for more expansion.\n\nStrong Support Levels and Bullish Technical Patterns\n\nVarious crucial factors can be credited for the recent increase in Ethereum\u2019s price. During the pre-halving consolidation phase in the wider cryptocurrency market, Ethereum successfully held its position above the important $2,875 level. This level aligned with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, giving buyers a strong base to take charge of the market direction.\n\nFurthermore, the strong pullback seen in Bitcoin\u2019s halving phase helped boost Ethereum\u2019s price, driving it to peak at $3,198. Upon further analysis of the 4-hour chart, it is evident that a double bottom pattern has emerged, which is a common technical formation seen at the end of a downtrend, indicating the possibility of a substantial increase in price. This trend, along with the strong market momentum, boosted buyers\u2019 confidence.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price showing positive momentum, there is hope it will exceed the key resistance level of $3,300, boosting buyer confidence and possibly extending the recovery process. If this breakout occurs, Ethereum may reach higher price levels, with forecasts suggesting a potential rise to $3,730, then $4,100.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Ethereum continues to defy market pressures, its resilience above key support levels and the formation of bullish technical patterns signal a potential uptrend. With buyers eyeing critical resistance levels, the stage is set for further price appreciation in the near term."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to ride the wave of excitement surrounding their recent halving events, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating whether Furrever Token ( FURR ) will seize the momentum and catch the presale hype train. With BTC and ETH experiencing slight climbs post-halving, investors are speculating whether FURR, with its unique approach to infusing cuteness into the crypto space, will capitalize on the current market sentiment to propel its presale to new heights. Join us as we delve into the intersection of traditional cryptocurrencies and the whimsical world of Furrever Token.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving Day and ETF Inflows Surge on 4/20 Caused a Slight Climb\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $65,177.84, marking a 2.5% increase since the halving event that took place yesterday. The timing of this halving has sparked curiosity, as it coincided with the infamous \"4/20\" meme date, leading to a curious alignment observed by Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nDespite a slowdown in inflows for Bitcoin ETFs since their peak in March, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to attract consistent inflows, with 69 consecutive days of positive inflows. Other ETFs, including those operated by Fidelity Investments, also saw significant inflows on April 19, signaling a potential return of momentum.\n\nWhile outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) were modest on the day, recent Form 13F filings have raised concerns about the penetration of Bitcoin ETFs into the mainstream investment landscape. However, Balchunas remains optimistic, likening the asset managers' approach to Bitcoin ETFs to \"hot sauce,\" suggesting that while the number of holders may be relatively small, there is significant potential for growth and adoption.\n\nOverall, the surge in ETF inflows on 4/20 raises questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin's price and the broader adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs in traditional investment portfolios.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Surges 4% Post-BTC Halving: Whales Return as Investors Seek Alternatives\n\nEthereum (ETH) has surged by 4% to reach approximately $3,163.71 following Bitcoin's halving event and the ensuing market hype. This uptrend in Ethereum's price mirrors the overall positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency market, with total market capitalization rising by 3.5% in tandem. Notably, the gains in Ether versus the U.S. dollar are largely attributed to capital inflows from the Bitcoin market, driving the ETH/BTC pair up by roughly 2.5% to 0.048 BTC on April 21. This ETH/BTC ratio surge, along with the Ethereum Dominance Index (ETH.D) growth of over 1%, reflects a pattern observed after previous Bitcoin halving events. Historically, Ethereum has seen increased capital inflows from Bitcoin investors seeking new growth opportunities post-halving. Furthermore, Ethereum's latest gains coincide with a period of accumulation among its wealthiest investors, as highlighted by the increase in Ether supply held by addresses with significant balances. Technical indicators also suggest strong support for Ether's price, with key support levels aligning closely with Fibonacci retracement lines and moving averages, indicating an attractive entry point for traders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Rides the Crypto Resurgence: Presale Momentum and Up to 15X Returns Propel its Charm\n\nIn the midst of the crypto market's resurgence following Bitcoin's halving and Ethereum's notable surge, Furrever Token ( FURR ) emerges as an intriguing contender poised to capitalize on the renewed enthusiasm. Priced at an enticing $0.000564, FURR offers investors an opportunity to partake in a project that transcends the traditional boundaries of cryptocurrency, infusing the space with an irresistible dose of cuteness and charm.\n\nAs FURR continues its journey, it is currently in the midst of its presale phase, which has already garnered significant attention and support from investors. With over $1,000,000 raised thus far and nearing the completion of stage 7 out of 10, FURR demonstrates strong momentum and investor confidence. The presale, with its ambitious target of raising $1.9 million, presents an opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards in return.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of FURR's presale is its offer of up to 15X returns, a tantalizing prospect for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto market. This generous return potential underscores FURR's commitment to delivering value to its early supporters and incentivizing participation in its presale. Moreover, the absence of buy and sell taxes when trading FURR further enhances its attractiveness to investors, offering a streamlined and cost-effective investment experience.\n\nWith its unique blend of cute cat-themed imagery, engaging community initiatives, and robust tokenomics, Furrever Token (FURR) stands at the forefront of innovation in the crypto space. As it rides the wave of excitement generated by Bitcoin's halving and Ethereum's rise, FURR has the potential to further increase its momentum and solidify its position as a leading project in the crypto landscape. By leveraging its current market momentum, FURR can continue to attract investors, drive community engagement, and deliver on its promise of revolutionizing the crypto space with cuteness and charm.\n\n\n\nDiscover the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
