        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) to Hit $5,000 After Major Move, Says Top Analyst - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a bold prediction that has captured the attention of the crypto community, prominent analyst Jelle has forecasted Ethereum (ETH) to reach an all-time high of $5,000 by the end of the year. This comes on the heels of ETH successfully turning the $3,500 level into solid support, a milestone Jelle highlighted in a recent tweet .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $3,540, reflecting a slight decline of 0.33% over the past 24 hours. Despite this minor dip, there has been a significant increase in trading volume, which has surged by 22.88%, amounting to $12,881,843,193. This uptick in trading activity signals growing investor interest and potential momentum for Ethereum in the near term.\n\nAnalyst optimism amid market trends\n\nAlthough Ethereum has experienced a slight bearish trend recently, market analysts remain optimistic about its future performance. Jelle\u2019s prediction is based on recent price action, where ETH turned the $3,500 level into a critical support zone. This technical development is seen as a positive indicator , suggesting that Ethereum has the potential to push higher in the coming months.\n\nA major catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s projected rise is the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Expected to start trading within the next couple of months, these ETFs are likely to attract substantial institutional investment, providing a significant boost to Ethereum's price. The introduction of spot ETFs is seen as a pivotal moment for ETH, potentially leading to increased adoption and market confidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s journey to $5,000 is not without challenges. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and various factors, including regulatory developments and macroeconomic trends, could influence its trajectory. However, the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, coupled with its growing ecosystem and the upcoming launch of spot ETFs , provide a strong foundation for potential growth.\n\nIn addition to the technical analysis, Ethereum\u2019s development continues to progress. These advancements are expected to enhance the network's scalability, security and sustainability, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position on the market. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on Ethereum to see if it can achieve this new milestone and redefine its place on the cryptocurrency landscape."

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Ethereum While It's Below $4,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Is Ethereum on its way to a new all-time high? These three factors say yes.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC -2.22%) captured the imagination of crypto investors. But don't sleep on Ethereum (ETH -4.27%). Up 54% year to date, it has largely kept pace with Bitcoin, and it has one new catalyst in place that could send it soaring in the second half of the year.\n\nSo this could be the time to put Ethereum on your investment radar. There are three good reasons why it could soar past the $4,000 mark on its way to a new all-time high.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nThe big catalyst, of course, is the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. If they enjoy anywhere near the same success as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could send the price of Ethereum soaring. During the first six months of the year, the spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $30 billion from investors, and that is what led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in price by 60%. The current thinking is that the new spot Ethereum ETFs could pull in as much as $3 billion in their first six months.\n\nThe only question, really, is when the new ETFs will start trading. The original consensus was the end of May. That was then pushed back to the end of June. And now SEC head Gary Gensler says it will be sometime before the end of the summer. Maybe by the time you're back from summer vacation, you'll be able to buy them.\n\nEthereum's market dominance\n\nOne underappreciated fact about Ethereum is just how dominant it is in many niches of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, web3, and the metaverse, Ethereum is the clear market leader. Its blockchain technology powers so many of tomorrow's most powerful and interesting apps. That means more users, more developers, more active wallets, more transactions, and more cash flows than any other blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCase in point: In the world of DeFi, Ethereum currently accounts for 60% of all total value locked (TVL), one of the most important metrics for blockchain performance. By way of comparison, its chief rival Solana (SOL -4.85%) has only a 4% market share. Other up-and-coming rivals -- such as Sui and Aptos -- barely show up as blips on the radar. Thus, this group of \"Ethereum killers\" could pose less of an existential risk to Ethereum than originally feared.\n\nNew blockchain upgrades\n\nI can't think of another cryptocurrency that gets more attention for its blockchain upgrades than Ethereum. It has followed up The Merge (a massive blockchain upgrade) with a number of smaller technical upgrades meant to make its blockchain faster and cheaper to use. Last year, we had Shapella. Earlier this year, we had Dencun. And now the buzz is building for the next upgrade, known as Prague-Electra.\n\nThere are two reasons these stepwise upgrades are so important. First of all, they make it easier for Ethereum to fend off its rivals. Yes, Solana might be faster and cheaper to use right now, but Ethereum is doing everything in its power to narrow the gap. The ultimate goal is the ability to process 1 million transactions per second, and each new upgrade brings Ethereum closer to this target.\n\nAlso, each new upgrade helps to build confidence in Ethereum's roadmap for the future. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which often seem to have a helter-skelter feel to their overall development, Ethereum lays out a roadmap at the start of every year and patiently explains how all the steps in this roadmap fit together. I've always viewed this process as similar to the way that publicly traded corporations give guidance about upcoming results.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nGiven these three factors, I think there's a reasonable chance that we could be talking about a new all-time high of $5,000 for Ethereum sometime by early 2025. That's a 40% gain from today's price of $3,500.\n\nBut $5,000 may be entirely too low a future projection for Ethereum. It's not hard to find analysts predicting a price of $10,000 for Ethereum. And investment firm VanEck thinks Ethereum is on a rocket to $22,000 by the year 2030.\n\nIn many ways, this depends on how well those new spot Ethereum ETFs perform. If the end of summer comes and they still are not trading, or if new investor inflows disappoint, then it might be time to tamp down expectations. If you are comfortable with assuming that risk, it could be time to start thinking about investing in Ethereum while it's still trading below $4,000."

        "title": "New scaling milestone for the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In recent days, an important milestone has been reached regarding the scaling of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and its layer-2 and layer-3.\n\nJust yesterday, in fact, the all-time high of the number of daily transactions recorded overall on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 and all its upper layers was registered.\n\nAccording to the data from L2BEAT, the average daily TPS on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1, that is, its actual blockchain, has settled at a modest 13 tx/s, but the overall figure, which also includes the upper layers, has approached 246 tx/s.\n\nJust think that seven days ago the average TPS on layer-1 was practically the same, but with the upper levels it was just 123 tx/s, or about half. At the beginning of the year, it was only 73 tx/s, while the one on layer-1 has always been more or less around 13.\n\nThe second layer and the scaling of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain\n\nWhat is making the most difference is the layer-3 Xai, a scaling solution for gaming created by Offchain Labs, the company behind Arbitrum One.\n\nJust yesterday it recorded a TPS of over 101 tx/s, followed far behind by layer-2 Base at about 33 tx/s.\n\nIt should be noted that there are two other upper layers that have recorded a higher daily average TPS than Ethereum, namely Arbitrum, with more than 20 tx/s, and Proof of Play Apex with almost 16.\n\nMoreover, both Taiko and Blast are also recording interesting numbers, because they are both above 11 transactions per second.\n\nL2BEAT monitors as many as 74 chains, including layer-1 (Ethereum), layer-2, and layer-3, although for about ten of these it is not managing to collect data.\n\nIn the last twelve months, the daily average TPS of Ethereum has remained more or less constant around 12 or 13 tx/s, while the overall TPS was just 30 tx/s, which is slightly more than double that recorded on layer-1.\n\nAs recently as February of this year, the overall TPS was still only at 40, but after the Dencun update in March that reduced fees on the upper layers, it skyrocketed first to 100 and then recently well beyond 200 tx/s.\n\nThis makes it very clear that by now the majority of transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem do not occur on layer-1 (the native Ethereum blockchain), because there they are relatively slow and expensive, but on the upper layers where they are faster and above all much more economical.\n\nThe fees\n\nThe average cost per transaction on the Ethereum blockchain yesterday was over $2. Five days ago, however, it was over $6, and a good ten days ago it had risen to almost $9. Not to mention the fact that on March 5th it skyrocketed to over $30.\n\nInstead, according to the data from L2BEAT, yesterday on Base the average cost per transaction was 0.4 thousandths of a dollar, or 0.0004$.\n\nOn Optimism it was 1 thousandth, and on Arbitrum slightly above 2 and a half thousandths.\n\nThe difference is truly remarkable, and this is due to the fact that on layer-1 it is not possible to reduce costs by increasing TPS, while the upper layers can scale much more easily.\n\nIt should be remembered that the average cost of a single transaction depends on the level of network congestion, so a network that supports higher TPS can clear the queue of pending transactions much faster, greatly reducing congestion.\n\nInstead, on layer-1 like Ethereum and Bitcoin it is not possible to increase the number of validated transactions per second, making it very difficult to reduce congestion in case of many requests.\n\nThe price of ETH\n\nThis remarkable increase in on-chain activity has not, however, had positive effects on the price of ETH, also because ETH is used to pay the cost of transactions on layer-1.\n\nAbout ten days ago it had risen above $3,800, but starting from Friday, June 7, it began to fall.\n\nFirst it went back to $3,600, and then it dropped below $3,500.\n\nIn particular, last Friday for a brief moment it had also dropped below $3,400, but at that point, it recorded a quick rebound that in fact then brought it back around $3,500.\n\nThe current price levels are in line with those of mid-April before the early sell-the-news on Bitcoin was triggered about a week before the halving.\n\nAt that time, the price of ETH dropped to $3,000, and then fell below $2,900 during the month of May.\n\nIt then recovered after the news of the possible approval of spot ETH ETFs in the USA (which later happened), but since we are still waiting for their actual debut on the stock exchange, there is still a lot of calm and uncertainty at the moment.\n\nIt is worth noting that the current price of ETH is still 28% lower compared to the all-time highs of late 2021, while for example that of BTC is -% from the all-time highs of March."
