        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn 2024\u2019s largest crypto raise so far, Monad Labs, the firm behind the upstart layer-1 network Monad, secured a whopping $225 million in funding on Monday from a round led by crypto venture juggernaut Paradigm.\n\nThe raise, which was also supported by crypto VC Electric Capital and the tech investment firm Greenoaks, constitutes a significant show of faith by crypto mainstays that Monad\u2014which has yet to launch\u2014will become a speedy, affordable, and dependable decentralized finance (DeFi) alternative to both the Ethereum ecosystem and layer-1 networks like Solana.\n\nFounded in 2022 by Jump Crypto alum Keone Hon, Monad is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network that is seeking to fill what is sees as a gap in the current crypto landscape: A blockchain able to easily interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, that is distinctly more capable of accommodating extremely high traffic while remaining speedy, cheap, and secure.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchains out there that would argue they already fit that criteria, to be sure. Following the landmark Dencun upgrade last month, Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have seen transaction costs plummet to near-zero. If any of those networks were to see massive upticks in usage, however, their gas fees would almost certainly spike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNon-Ethereum layer-1 networks, particularly Solana, have ballooned in popularity in recent months\u2014particularly for DeFi users\u2014due to their speed and lower fees. But Solana has also suffered repeated outages as it attempts to scale to become a linchpin of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBy offering full capability with EVM\u2014the software that powers Ethereum, and all networks built on top of it\u2014Monad appears to be tapping into the dominant influence Ethereum has over crypto users and developers, while simultaneously attempting to build a more streamlined version of the network from the ground up.\n\nIt also looks like a play for attracting top-level developers. According to a January report from Electric Capital, some 90% of crypto developers working on multiple chains work with EVM.\n\nOther EVM-compatible layer-one networks are already out there, most notably Avalanche and BNB Chain, the latter of which was created by Binance. But Monad Labs\u2019 fundraise today marks the flashiest entry into the crowded blockchain ecosystem in some time\u2014certainly since the crypto crash of 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are excited about Monad because it solves one of the critical bottlenecks in scalability for the Ethereum ecosystem: the Ethereum Virtual Machine,\u201d Electric Capital Managing Partner Avichal Garg told Decrypt. \u201cMonad\u2019s parallelized EVM can unlock a 100x improvement in throughput in the EVM ecosystem and make consumer-grade, decentralized applications possible.\u201d\n\nPrior to today\u2019s news, Monad Labs previously raised a $19 million seed funding round in early 2023, led by Dragonfly Capital.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Restaking protocol EigenLayer heads to Ethereum mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "EigenLayer, the highly-anticipated Ethereum restaking protocol that has attracted billions of dollars worth of customer deposits, went to mainnet Tuesday afternoon.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s data availability solution, named EigenDA, also went live as an actively validated service (AVS) built on top of EigenLayer.\n\nThe launch came with training wheels of sorts, however, as critical components of EigenLayer are not set to go live until later this year.\n\nEthereum is secured by ether (ETH) that is staked, or pledged to earn yield in return for accurately verifying transactions. EigenLayer takes this a step further with restaking, which allows staked ETH be restaked and used to secure and run AVSs, which are various blockchain-based platforms built on EigenLayer.\n\nRead more: Restaking platform EigenLayer \u2018flips\u2019 Aave in TVL\n\nWith the mainnet launch, restakers can now delegate their restaked balance to EigenLayer operators, who can then run AVSs.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has raced above $13 billion in the past few months, making it the second-largest DeFi protocol according to DeFiLlama. EigenLayer\u2019s offering of points for depositors, which some speculate will determine allocation in a future token, played a major part in the rapid growth.\n\nIt has also benefited from the popularity of liquid restaking tokens that restake deposits and issue liquid tokens in return, similarly to how Lido\u2019s stETH works.\n\nRead more: DeFi \u2018points\u2019 farming has reshaped the crypto investment landscape\n\nSome have expressed concerns over potential risks that could stem from restaking, which until now was a totally unproven model for Ethereum security.\n\nAny risk that EigenLayer could create \u201cfeels very systemic,\u201d Sebastian Higgs, chief operating officer of Cordial Systems, told Blockworks prior to the mainnet launch.\n\n\u201cIf there is an issue, the knock-on impact could be far reaching and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m proceeding very cautiously and I still have more questions than answers at this point,\u201d said Higgs.\n\nWhatever those risks may be, they aren\u2019t likely to surface quite yet. In an X thread announcing its mainnet, EigenLayer said it would allow its marketplace to \u201cdevelop and stabilize\u201d before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing later this year. In this case, slashing refers to an EigenLayer operator being financially punished for not adhering to rules set by an AVS.\n\nIf payments are enabled before slashing, operators and liquid restaking tokens would likely support every AVS, Ian Unsworth, co-founder of Kairos Research, told Blockworks. \u201c[B]ut once slashing gets implemented, we will see a \u2018de-leveraging\u2019 so to speak, as the stake gets re-delegated to reflect the actual risk.\u201d\n\nThe mainnet launch means some large venture bets will start to play out. A16z invested $100 million into Eigen Labs in February, adding to the $50 million it raised in early 2023. Multiple recently-funded startups are also teed up to become AVSs, including shared sequencer marketplace Espresso and restaked rollup provider AltLayer.\n\nRead more: Espresso lands $28M to become marketplace for shared sequencing\n\nElsewhere, investors have seemingly taken a liking to liquid restaking projects like ether.fi, which announced its $23 million Series A in February.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The recent launch of several Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) was a positive step for the crypto industry, offering investors a clearer path to participate in the virtual digital asset class. This regulatory progress has fueled optimism within the crypto space, with many anticipating a similar green light for Ethereum ETFs in the near future.The success of Bitcoin ETFs, alongside the ongoing price rally, has undeniably instilled a sense of excitement about the potential of Ethereum and the broader blockchain landscape.Amidst these, the recent media reports about SEC reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH) \u2019s potential classification as a security, raises critical questions about the impact on Web3, the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem built on Ethereum's blockchain technology.Ethereum, conceived by the visionary Vitalik Buterin in 2013, introduced a revolutionary concept: a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its impact has been profound, fueling the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and a myriad of other innovations that comprise the Web3 industry.Previously Ethereum relied on a proof-of-work system to secure its network. Like in Bitcoin, in Ethereum computers competed to solve complex puzzles, with the winner earning newly minted Ethereum tokens. Every time a transaction is carried out on the Ethereum platform, one has to pay a gas fee or a transaction fee, irrespective of what the nature of that transaction might be. The gas fees previously were high, going up to $150 per transaction.To solve this problem and after years of testing to replace energy-intensive mining, Ethereum switched on its proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022. The new proof-of-stake system eliminated this competition. Instead, users \"stake\" their existing Ethereum holdings to validate transactions and earn rewards. This shift is estimated to have reduced Ethereum's energy consumption significantly. The ecosystem carried out another upgradation recently, called the Dencun upgrade, as a result of which transaction fees are expected to plummet to almost zero.
