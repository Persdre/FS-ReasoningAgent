        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Holds at $3K but is Another Crash Imminent? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently experienced increased selling activity, breaching the 100-day moving average and leading to a substantial decline toward the 200-day MA.\n\nNevertheless, the price faces a significant support region, possibly leading to a temporary period of consolidation correction in the mid-term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that after an extended period of corrective retracements near the crucial 100-day moving average at $3386, sellers ultimately gained control, leading to a break below this key MA.\n\nGiven that this area was filled with buying interest and demand, the breach caused a notable long liquidation cascade, accelerating the bearish momentum. As a result, the price plummeted toward the substantial 200-day moving average of $3096 and breached it.\n\nThis price action clearly indicates a bearish sentiment in the market, with sellers dominating. However, Ethereum is currently hovering around the crucial and decisive support region of $3K and is expected to undergo a period of consolidation before initiating its next major move. If a pullback to the broken 200-day MA occurs, the continuation of the bearish trend will become more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that following a period of sideways consolidation above the $3.3K support, the price ultimately faced aggressive selling activity and breached this crucial support region. This breakout led to a notable impulsive downtrend, indicating a long-squeeze event in the perpetual markets.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has landed on the substantial support region of $3K, which has previously supported the price multiple times. This area is likely filled with demand, potentially halting the downward pressures in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI indicator has dropped below 30, indicating potential short-term market correction before the next significant move. Hence, consolidation is likely in the short term, allowing the market to rest and regain momentum. In this scenario, the price range between 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels will be the main target for the corrective movements in the short term.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has recently seen a rise in selling activity, leading to a significant decline toward the critical $3K support zone.\n\nUnderstanding the key factors behind this rejection is crucial for predicting upcoming price movements. The accompanying chart highlights potential liquidation zones within Ethereum\u2019s price action, providing valuable insights for mid-term strategies by smart money.\n\nThe chart indicates a notable liquidity pool below the crucial $3K. This pool is filled with sell-stop orders from aggressive long positions that contributed to a significant price surge in mid-May. If sellers push the price below the $3K support zone, a massive long-squeeze is expected. This would trigger the sell-stop orders, accelerating the bearish momentum. Traders should closely monitor the price action around the $3K support zone in the upcoming days to determine the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend direction."

        "content": "President of ETFStore Nate Geraci does not see any reason why spot Ethereum ETF will not start trading in the next two weeks.\n\nJuly 15 For Spot Ethereum ETF Trading?\n\nGeraci believes that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will conduct all due processes for its approval of spot Ethereum ETF trading this week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026 Later next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely. Interestingly, price of eth \u2193 20%+ since \u201csurprise\u201d 19b-4 approvals in late May. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 6, 2024\n\nThis is with the optimistic view that the offering will go live in the next week. In his X post, Geraci stated that he expects the trading to begin by July 15 or around that time. It is worth noting that the ETF expert had earlier shared this same timeline for the spot Ethereum ETF trading approval.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the U.S. SEC returned the S-1 filings that it received from the potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, iShares, and Invesco.\n\nThe document returned by the regulator contained light comments in the feedback to filers. According to people familiar with the matter, the spot Ethereum ETF issuers are expected to submit the S-1 forms with the amendments by July 8. Geraci noted that the last round of S-1 revisions was quite \u201clight\u201d and the regulator will likely clear issuers for trading within the next 14-21 days.\n\nPrecisely, he stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Therefore, July 15 would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs, Geraci added.\n\nSEC Receives More Crypto ETFs Applications\n\nGenerally, it is clear that the securities regulator is having some constructive dialogue and communication with the spot Ethereum ETF filers and this may be a good sign. The optimism has even attracted other firms to also submit their filing.\n\nYieldMax, a popular ETF issuer, recently submitted a filing with the US SEC to introduce an Ether Option Income Strategy ETF. The plan is to list the ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca, as detailed in a June 21, 2024 filing. This kind of offering is designed to leverage the volatility of underlying Spot Ethereum ETFs for generating profits for investors.\n\nSimilarly, investment asset management firm Hashdex also filed to list a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the offering and published a notice to solicit comments from the public on the proposed rule change. The firm may have to wait until the regulator makes a decision on spot Ethereum ETF before its filing is considered.\n\nRead More: Celsius Network Resurfaces With Creditor Lawsuit, Here\u2019s What To Know\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Weekends are characterized by a drop in market activity until the following Monday. The lower trading volume and reduced liquidity over the weekend caused crypto assets to stabilize after a recent sell-off. The Bitcoin price found temporary support around $55,000, easing the sell pressure on altcoins. Ethereum price also showed renewed demand around $2900. However, with several analysts anticipating the Ethereum ETF launch around mid-July, there is potential for a major reversal in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAlso Read: Justin Sun Faces $66M Loss As Ethereum Records 10% Fall, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Analysis Hints $3800 Rally Amid Healthy Pullback and Potential ETF Approval\n\nThe current correction in Ethereum price was initiated in late May as the price reverted from $3974. This fresh lower-high formation of the daily chart indicates the buyers lack sufficient momentum to chase new highs, thus shifting the price trajectory sideways.\n\nThe bearish turnaround tumbled the Ether value by nearly 30% to seek support at the confluence of $1815 and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Along with broader market correction, the U.S. SEC\u2019s delay in approving ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts has contributed to bearish sentiment.\n\nOn Thursday, Bitwise filed an amended S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF ahead of the July 8th deadline.

        "content": "Sun 07 Jul 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nEthereum ETFs are about to get SEC approval, marking a major turning point in the crypto world. Even Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, seems to be in favor of this development. Discover how this approval could shake up the crypto markets and what it means for investors, according to John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn.\n\nInevitable Approval of Ethereum ETFs and Investor Rush\n\nEven Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is not against Ethereum ETFs. This says a lot about the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler, known for his caution, recognizes the growing importance of crypto assets in the global financial system.\n\nIt seems that the era of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\nJohn Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn, views this positively. According to him, the approval of ETH ETFs could not only legitimize Ethereum as an investment asset but also catalyze a new wave of institutional investments.\n\nGlover highlights that the approval of ETH ETFs could attract new investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market.\n\nHe also anticipates an increase in liquidity and price stability thanks to a better market structure.\n\nFurthermore, he sees this development as a way to reduce the often-criticized volatility of cryptos.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes with many expectations and fears.\n\nIf the approval of Ethereum ETFs materializes, it could very well mark the beginning of a new era where crypto assets are more seamlessly and securely integrated into traditional investment portfolios.\n\nJohn Glover\u2019s Opinion, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, on Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe Potential Impact on the Crypto Market\n\nThe arrival of Ethereum ETFs could significantly shake up the crypto ecosystem. John Glover explains that the impact of these ETFs on the market could be twofold.\n\nFirstly, they could bring a new wave of legitimacy to Ethereum, encouraging financial institutions to invest. Glover compares this situation to the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which significantly increased institutional interest and Bitcoin\u2019s price stability.\n\nHe believes that Ethereum ETFs could follow a similar trajectory, stimulating interest and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum ETFs could improve market liquidity in the crypto space. Glover asserts that this could result in reduced price volatility, a point often cited by cryptocurrency critics.\n\nWith more liquidity, sudden and erratic price movements would become less frequent, making Ethereum a more stable and attractive investment for conservative investors.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in liquidity could facilitate large-scale transactions, making the crypto market more efficient.\n\nFinally, Glover mentions that the approval of Ethereum ETFs could serve as a catalyst for other financial innovations in the crypto sector. For example, we could see the emergence of new financial products based on Ethereum, such as investment funds and more sophisticated derivatives.\n\nThis would help diversify and enrich the crypto ecosystem, attracting even more investors.\n\nGlover\u2019s Optimistic Projections\n\nJohn Glover is adamant: the approval of Ethereum ETFs is good news for the future of Ethereum and the crypto market in general. According to him, this approval could trigger a series of positive market reactions. For instance, K33 Research predicts 4 billion dollars in inflows in just 5 months.\n\nFirstly, it could reinforce Ethereum\u2019s position as a safe haven in the crypto universe. Institutional investors, who have already begun to show interest in cryptocurrencies, might see Ethereum as a viable option to diversify their portfolios.\n\nGlover also emphasizes that this dynamic could attract long-term investments, thereby increasing market stability. He predicts a rise in Ethereum prices in the medium and long term, once the ETFs are launched and adopted by the market. And this despite the recent declines of the crypto prince.\n\nFor Glover, the diversification of financial products based on Ethereum could also pave the way for greater innovation in the sector, with increasingly tailored solutions to the needs of institutional investors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: the clash between titans - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article, we compare two leading blockchains in the cryptographic sector: Solana vs Ethereum.\n\nBoth have very developed DeFi ecosystems and a wide range of successful applications built within them.\n\nThe two networks work together to create the most thriving web3 environment possible, with the goal of becoming the premier layer of the on-chain future.\n\nThe challenge is also played out on the token level, with ETH and SOL trying to offer the best return on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s see everything in detail below.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: the main differences on the technological level\n\nWe are talking about one of the most heated and intense clashes on the technological front of the last decade, as well as the most discussed in the crypto landscape: the Solana vs Ethereum war.\n\nEveryone knows by now that these two blockchains have been in conflict for years to win the title of dominant web3 infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, however, they are quite different in many aspects: Ethereum is an EVM network built with the programming language Solidity while Solana is SVM built with C, C++ and Rust.\n\nThis alone is enough to distinguish two poles in which the development of decentralized applications takes place according to different coding rules.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d also changes significantly depending on the context, whether it is used in an Ethereum or Solana environment.\n\nIn fact, on Ethereum the term account is used to describe an entity that owns ether (ETH) and can initiate transactions. It is classified as follows:\n\nEOA (Externally Owned Account): account in possession of a private key, conceptually similar to a wallet;\n\nCA (Contract Account): account for smart contracts not in possession of a private key.\n\nSimplifying, we can say that EOA does not have storage space and therefore cannot be used as a contract for carrying out operations (except for exceptions with ERC-4337).\n\nThe CA, on the other hand, is simply a software program executable by EVM with a code (contract) that distinguishes it. An EOA can therefore execute a call through CA but not vice versa!\n\nOn the opposite front of Solana, however, the concept of \u201caccount\u201d is broader and refers to an entity that can always store and save data.\n\nThe state of transactions is therefore saved using accounts in a manner similar to what happens in operating systems like Linux. It is worth noting that Solana natively supports the account-abstraction function, allowing self-calling between programs.\n\nThe accounts in Solana are of two types:\n\nExecutable account (program account): smart contracts called \u201cprograms\u201d that store the code;\n\nNon-executable account (data account): entities that can receive tokens or data but cannot execute code.\n\nBelow is a map of the main technical differences.\n\nTwo different approaches for the development of DeFi environments\n\nDescending to a less technical level, we notice that Ethereum and Solana use different marketing approaches for their respective DeFi environments.\n\nAlthough both chains are intent on attracting the widest possible base of capital and users, they focus on different segments.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum presents a more \u201cinstitutional\u201d character with its main values oriented towards the security of the network and decentralization.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has a more \u201csmart\u201d personality, oriented towards the scalability of operations and cryptographic efficiency.\n\nThey follow the limits of both blockchains on their own: for Ethereum scalability, for Solana decentralization.\n\nLIVE NOW \u2014 Ethereum vs. Solana\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the debate we\u2019re having today. On Ethereum\u2019s side, we have @Ethereum Researcher @drakefjustin, and on the @Solana side, we have Solana\u2019s Co-Founder @aeyakovenko\n\n\n\nThey give us the good, the bad, and the ugly of each other\u2019s blockchain,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MlCWd4NtOT \u2014 Bankless (@BanklessHQ) June 3, 2024\n\nEthereum presents a TVL of 59 billion dollars, much greater than Solana\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars. For this reason, the Foundation uses a softer communication with the public and with less intention to create engagement.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, focuses entirely on innovation, user experience, and transaction throughput. The latest innovations launched, such as the Saga smartphone and the Blinks, speak volumes about the approach the network uses with retail.\n\nWe can say that Ethereum is a less performant blockchain, at times less \u201cconvenient\u201d, but more secure and reliable.\n\nSolana is much more \u201cfun\u201d and efficient to use, but less decentralized based on a few clients and less secure.\n\nIf you are high-net-worth individuals with a moderate risk exposure, you will surely appreciate Ethereum more.\n\nIf you are young, fearless, and have a limited budget, you will probably find the features of Solana more appealing.\n\nThe main web3 dapps of the two ecosystems\n\nThe war between the two titans Ethereum and Solana continues uniquely in the creation of the best decentralized web3 applications.\n\nOn Ethereum the largest dapp in terms of TVL is the liquid staking platform Lido: it alone attracts almost 10 times the entire capital absorbed by Solana.\n\nNext, we find successful dapps such as EigenLayer, Aave, Maker, Ether.fi, Uniswap, RocketPool, Ethena, and Pendle.\n\nIn the suite of protocols of Solana, we find Jito as the top-ranked, with a TVL of 1.74 billion dollars. Then the most used applications are Marinade, Kamino, Sanctum, Jupiter, Marginfi, Drift, BlazeStake, Meteora, and Solend.\n\nThe majority of Ethereum dapps are integrated with various layer-2, ensuring greater scalability. At the same time, the differentiation of blockspace requests leads to a fragmentation of liquidity, which is often inconvenient.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum is often criticized by its detractors because as a Settlement Layer it has to rely on external solutions to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, the competitor is criticized for the absence of a flourishing and secure DeFi ecosystem: almost all the dapps on Ethereum surpass the total TVL of Solana!\n\nIn any case, it is worth noting how Solana is producing very interesting products, such as the recent platform pump.fun.\n\nProposed as a launchpad for memecoin, in a short time it managed to become the most profitable dapp in the entire cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nOn July 1st, it recorded record fees of 2 million dollars, even surpassing the entire revenue of the whole Ethereum blockchain.\n\nChapeau.\n\n\ud83d\udea8Breaking Big: @pumpdotfun Becomes No. 1 Crypto App Across All Chainshttps://t.co/VS31GZ2FXq has surged to the top spot as the leading crypto app, surpassing Ethereum with a staggering $1.99M in revenue generated over the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/59euyqCRWp \u2014 SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 2, 2024\n\nA speculative war: Solana with SOL vs Ethereum with ETH\n\nThe Solana vs Ethereum challenge can only conclude with a focus on their respective gas tokens SOL and ETH.\n\nIt is clear that the better these cryptocurrencies perform on a speculative level, the more users are interested in purchasing them and becoming part of the community.\n\nThe metric of active addresses and the volume of transactions, in fact, largely depends on the evolution of the price of SOL and ETH.\n\nBoth networks are interested in pushing the price of their respective coins upwards, both for a boost in on-chain metrics and for obvious economic reasons.\n\nIn 2024 the two coins recorded similar trends, with a growth of about 50% from the January quotations. SOL, however, grew at a faster pace in the last quarter of 2023, attracting more new buyers compared to what Ethereum did.\n\n>>Solana Vs Ethereum in 2024\n\n\n\nSolana is Winning by Huge Data Growth Margin\n\n\n\nGrowth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 Price\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Volume/Marketcap\n\n\u2013 TVL/Fees\n\n\u2013 NFT Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Transactions/ Daily Active Addresses\n\n\n\nEthereum Growth Metrics(%):\n\n\n\n\u2013 DEX Trading Volume\n\n\u2013 Daily Volume pic.twitter.com/Q8GV7mQ9Jy \u2014 hitesh.eth (@hmalviya9) May 30, 2024\n\nAt the moment both SOL and ETH are close to their respective all-time highs, with the latter seeming slightly advantaged.\n\nThe evolution of the prices of the two coins from now until the end of the bull market will be essential to bring more adoption to blockchain technology.\n\nPlaying a decisive role in the coming months will also be the upcoming inauguration of the spot ETFs for the two cryptocurrencies. First that of Ethereum, then (perhaps) that of Solana, will contribute to attracting more capital inflows.\n\nAt stake is the dominance as a settlement layer for the major financial operations of the cryptographic world.\n\nIt is not certain, however, that in the future only one network between Solana and Ethereum will survive, and indeed a coexistence scenario is much more likely.\n\nObviously, there will be a network that will have a larger market share but without precluding the existence of the other\n\nETH vs SOL\n\n\n\nDONT BE A MAXI.\n\n\n\nThe world is gonna be multi-chains!\n\n\n\nStop wasting time arguing about which one is better, and start learning about all the benefits and use cases each bring.\n\n\n\nMore ETFs will grow the pie!\n\nETF products will bring attention and money into the space.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MdtTDdCf7X \u2014 Gun (Kingbund.eth) (@KingBund) July 2, 2024\n\nAlthough in a perspective of coexistence, the dispute between the maximalists will continue for many years to come.\n\nAs we can learn from the historical Pepsi vs Coca Cola discount that has been ongoing for over 100 years, the fight for supremacy is always around the corner."
