        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Opens Up on Ethereum's Strategy Against Quantum Attacks - U.Today",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, renowned for his pivotal role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape, has recently unveiled groundbreaking insights regarding Ethereum's resilience against potential quantum threats. In his latest research, Buterin delves into strategies to safeguard users' funds in the face of quantum computing advancements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing the pressing concern of quantum-enabled theft, Buterin elucidates on Ethereum's preparedness for such a scenario. He highlights the inherent vulnerability stemming from the nature of ETH addresses and the implications of quantum computing on cryptographic functions.\n\nDrawing upon the architecture of Ethereum's blockchain, Buterin proposes a pragmatic approach toward mitigating quantum risks. His solution involves a strategic hard fork combined with the adoption of quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques. By reverting to a prior block and implementing alterations in transaction protocols, Ethereum could potentially avert large-scale fund breaches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin emphasizes the role of advanced cryptographic mechanisms such as STARKs in fortifying Ethereum's security posture against quantum threats. These innovations, coupled with modifications to transaction types and validation processes, could render Ethereum more resilient in the event of a quantum emergency.\n\nQuantum era\n\nThe proposal outlined by Buterin underscores the proactive stance of Ethereum's development community in addressing emerging challenges. By laying the groundwork for potential hard forks and infrastructural enhancements, Ethereum aims to bolster its readiness to navigate the uncertain terrain of quantum computing.\n\nIn essence, Buterin's insights herald a new chapter in Ethereum's ongoing quest for robustness and adaptability in the face of evolving technological landscapes. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem braces itself for the quantum era, Ethereum stands poised to confront these challenges head-on, guided by the vision of its pioneering creator."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation \u2013 Why Pullbacks Could Be Limited - TradingView",
        "content": "Ethereum price is still struggling to clear the $4,000 resistance zone. ETH might consolidate for some time above $3,600 before the bulls gain strength.\n\nEthereum traded to a new multi-month high above $3,980.\n\nThe price is trading near $3,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term breakout pattern forming with resistance at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its increase if it clears the $3,950 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits $4K\n\nEthereum price extended its rally above the $3,900 level, like Bitcoin. ETH cleared the $3,950 level and traded close to the $4,000 resistance zone. It traded to a new multi-month high above $3,990 and recently started a consolidation phase.\n\nThere was a pullback below the $3,920 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,211 swing low to the $3,9983 high. Ethereum price is now consolidating near $3,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is also a short-term breakout pattern forming with resistance at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the pair stays above the $3,800 level, it could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $3,900 level.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,940 level. The next major resistance is near $4,000, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $4,120 level. If there is a move above the $4,120 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,220 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,350.\n\nAre Dips Limited In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,950 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,600 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,211 swing low to the $3,9983 high. The next key support could be the $3,400 zone. A clear move below the $3,400 support might send the price toward $3,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,950"

        "content": "New York, Mar 10, 2024 -Bitcoin has captured the limelight in recent weeks as it surged to a new record high, yet another major cryptocurrency , Ether, has been enjoying its own meteoric rise.Launched in 2015, Ether, also known as Ethereum , is by far the second-largest digital currency in terms of total value, now estimated at over $460 billion.Along with other cryptocurrencies including Solana and Dogecoin, it benefited from the regulatory approval in the United States of a new bitcoin investment product, the exchange traded fund -- or ETF -- in mid-January, said James Butterfill of the investment company CoinShares.These ETFs allow investors to profit from any change to the price of cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly, while also letting them sell at any time.The launch of crypto ETFs has led to an influx of new money, sending bitcoin to a fresh record on Friday of $70,085.Bitcoin's rise has been well-documented, but Ether's has been even more impressive, surging almost 72 percent year to date in comparison to bitcoin's 61 percent rise.This strong performance is largely due to \"expectations that an Ethereum ETF could be approved in the United States,\" according to Dessislava Aubert of research firm Kaiko.Several asset management companies have applied for authorization from the US financial markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to market these Ether investment products.The SEC must rule on the first such applications, from VanEck and Ark 21Shares, by May 23 at the latest.\"Ethereum has started to wake up as investors are anticipating a potential approval,\" Michael van de Poppe of MN Trading told AFP, adding that \"people are rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum as a potential investment opportunity.\"Beyond the ETF effect, the digital currency dreamed up by Russian programmer Vitaly Buterin has several other cards up its sleeve.For Simon Peters of cryptocurrency exchange eToro, Ethereum is also buoyed by the prospect of \"Dencun,\" a major upgrade to the technology underlying this digital currency, scheduled for March 13.This major change will improve transaction processing capacity and cut transaction costs, but also has the potential to unleash the growth of an ecosystem with multiple applications.\"Bitcoin's primary use is as store of value, while Ethereum has much more potential use cases,\" Peters told AFP.For example, it is the destination of choice for non-fungible tokens -- or NFTs -- the certificates of digital authenticity that caused such a stir three years ago.The two cryptocurrencies are not in direct competition, according to van de Poppe from MN Trading, because Bitcoin is \"hard money,\" while Ether \"is basically an investment for the entire blockchain and smart contract ecosystem.\"Ethereum has already successfully negotiated two major technical transformations in recent years, including the switch to a less energy-intensive system in September 2022.James Butterfill said there is \"increasing optimism\" that a \"Dencun\" upgrade will \"go without a hitch,\" which would reinforce the currency's credibility.He added that Ether, by the very nature of its operation, offers the \"added benefit\" of interest generated by its holders.The mechanism for creating this currency involves owners putting up existing Ether coins as collateral in a process known as \"Proof of Stake,\" which differs from bitcoin's energy-intensive method involving highly complex calculations, known as \"Proof of Work.\"Ether investors who agree to put up some or all of their holdings receive a fee of a few percent a year, in addition to any potential capital gain if the currency appreciates in value.The \"Proof of Stake\" process adopted in September 2022 has significantly increased the amount of Ether used as collateral, notes Simon Peters, currently at 21 percent compared with just 10 percent 18 months ago.\"There is less Ethereum in circulation,\" he said, adding: \"If demand increases, given the squeeze in supply, then price should follow.\"\"I think that Ethereum is going to be outperforming Bitcoin,\" said Michael van de Poppe, adding the total market capitalization of Ethereum could end up exceeding that of bitcoin."
