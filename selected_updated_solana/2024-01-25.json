        "title": "Strike CEO calls Ethereum 'tech play,' says Bitcoin solves the 'biggest financial problem' of our time - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Strike founder Jack Mallers recently expressed his firm belief in Bitcoin\u2019s potential to solve what he describes as \u201cthe biggest financial problem ever\u201d \u2014 central banking and the global debt crisis.\n\nMallers made the statement during an interview with Yahoo Finance on Jan. 24, where he highlighted Bitcoin in relation to government debt by focusing on the significant issue of global financial instability, primarily driven by excessive government debt.\n\nBitcoin is a hedge.\n\nMallers said that the staggering global debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently stands at an alarming 360%, represents a critical problem where governments have accumulated debt to such an extent that there seems to be no feasible way to pay it back. He added:\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s run up a $37 trillion bill at the bar, so who\u2019s paying for that?\u201d\n\nMallers argued that the holders of government-issued currencies will ultimately bear this massive debt burden. He reasoned that governments might address their debt by debasing their currencies by printing more money. This currency debasement process erodes the currency\u2019s value, leading to potential inflation and financial instability for those holding these currencies.\n\nAdditionally, Mallers pointed out the current state of the traditional financial markets, particularly the bond market, which he notes as being in its worst condition ever. Combined with the underperformance of conventional investment strategies like the 60/40 portfolio, this paints a bleak picture of the financial landscape, further underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s relevance as an alternative investment.\n\nAccording to Mallers, Bitcoin is \u201cthe only innovation\u201d to solve the \u201ccentral banking problem\u201d and serve as a global reserve currency.\n\nEthereum is a \u201ctech-play\u201d\n\nMallers further stated that other cryptocurrencies like \u201cEthereum, Solana, and Dogecoin\u201d should not be grouped together because they do not address the fundamental financial issues that Bitcoin can solve.\n\nHe referred to Ethereum as a \u201ctech play,\u201d suggesting that its value and utility are more aligned with technological innovation and adoption rather than serving as a stable financial instrument. He said Ethereum is more akin to a speculative investment, dependent on its technological success and acceptance in broader applications, such as finance and tech industries.\n\nMallers likened Ethereum to equities, comparing investing in it to investing in stocks like Tesla. He suggested that people might invest in Ethereum, hoping it will soar in value like high-performing stocks, based on technological advancements and leadership rather than its potential as a stable currency or store of value.\n\nHe also implied that Ethereum\u2019s success and adoption depend on the acceptance and use of major financial players, like banks and institutional investors. This dependence on external factors contrasts sharply with his view of Bitcoin, which he sees as more autonomous and independent of mainstream financial systems.\n\nHis skepticism towards Ethereum stems from its history. He recalled a significant hack and instances where the Ethereum Foundation intervened in transaction processes.\n\nIn his view, these events cast doubt on Ethereum\u2019s reliability and integrity as a financial instrument. He criticized the Ethereum Foundation for cherry-picking transactions in response to issues, which, according to Maller, undermines the predictability and trustworthiness essential in a financial system.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts - U.Today",

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.\n\nThe steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.\n\nFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.\n\nBitcoin ready to fight\n\nRecent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.\n\nThe chart illustrates Bitcoin\u2019s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.\n\nA sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.\n\nAs for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.\n\nThe moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.\n\nSolana among leaders\n\nSolana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a \"dead cat bounce\" since volume profiles signal restraint.\n\nAnalyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.\n\nOn the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.\n\nThe price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout."

        "title": "Four \u2018breakout\u2019 DeFi trends that will define crypto\u2019s coming bull market - DLNews",
        "content": "What you'll learn Novel DeFi like liquid restaking will draw more attention in 2024.\n\nLiquid restaking is already a $600 million market.\n\nYield chasing and airdrop farming will spur greater multi-chain engagement this year.\n\nDeFi was crypto\u2019s primary growth driver last year as it had twice as many users who completed over 100 transactions than any other crypto market sector.\n\nThis growth was fuelled by an increase in transaction activity on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism, and the return of Solana post-FTX collapse.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue this year amid a possible bull run with trading on decentralised exchanges and yield farming expected to be the most dominant on-chain activity in 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new on-chain crypto user report by blockchain data platform Flipside Crypto.\n\n\u201dSignificant regulatory, institutional, and financial announcements emerged every month,\u201d of 2023, the report said. \u201cThese developments set the stage for a breakout 2024.\u201d\n\nDriving that growth lately: EigenLayer, an Ethereum liquid restaking protocol.\n\nStaking in DeFi means to lock a token in a blockchain network or DeFi protocol, usually in exchange for yield.\n\nLocked tokens are typically unusable but some protocols like Lido offer liquid staking where a liquid staking token or LST is given in exchange for the locked crypto, as well as the opportunity to earn yield.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cNovel DeFi like EigenLayer will rise in prominence and adoption among web3 native audiences,\u201d Flipside said.\n\nLiquid staking has the advantage of giving users access to their locked coins in the form of the LSTs which they can deploy on other DeFi protocols to earn compounded gains.Flipside highlighted four other trends to watch:\n\nRestaking staked crypto\n\nLiquid restaking is an expansion of the DeFi liquid staking primitive. It allows users to restake their LSTs to earn more yield and another token called a liquid restaking token, or LRT.\n\nThere are even protocols like Pendle that will accept an already yield-bearing LRT deposit from a user and provide them with another yield-bearing token, taking the compounded yield potential further.\n\nFlipside\u2019s prediction of a liquid restaking boom this coming year may already be showing signs of becoming a possibility. The new DeFi sector is already a $600 million market \u2014 a market growth driven not only by the compounded yield frenzy but also the possibility of airdrops.\n\nNovel DeFi niches like liquid restaking come with the expectation of airdrops for early participants. Such expectations have been boosted by majors like EigenLayer offering a points system for depositors as points have become a bellwether for possible airdrops.\n\nDespite its growth potential, Flipside does not envisage a bubble emerging because of liquid staking this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a ways away from the 2021 frenzy, where anyone could simply fork a project and slap on 10,000% APY inflation tokens to attract users,\u201d Flipside data scientist Carlos Mercado told DL News.\n\nInstead, Mercado identified the lack of client diversity among Ethereum stakers and validators as a possible cause for concern. More than 80% of Ethereum validators run Geth, an execution client responsible for processing transactions and deploying smart contracts.\n\nThis dependence on Geth makes it a supermajority client in Ethereum and any problems with Geth could cause system-wide failures in Ethereum.\n\nGiven the possible scale of the problem, Mercado said he expects stakeholders to diversify to other clients.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that these staking methods compete directly with other on-chain opportunities, so there\u2019s natural pushback against it becoming \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2014 as the yields fall with more participants,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nMulti-chain engagement\n\nFlipside\u2019s report only covers eight blockchains \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, Solana, Avalanche \u2014 all but Bitcoin and Solana are EVM networks.\n\nEVM networks run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and use the same smart contract logic for their applications. This compatibility also makes for easier liquidity migration via protocols called bridges that allow users to send crypto across different blockchains.\n\nLast year, however, only a small percentage of users interacted with at least two EVM chains. But Flipside expects a change this year with greater multi-chain engagement among DeFi users, especially those looking to capitalise on yield and airdrop opportunities across different blockchains.\n\nGreater multi-chain engagement will mean flexible liquidity migration and an uptick in the volume of crypto flowing across bridges. Bridge protocols have historically been targets for hackers leading to some of crypto\u2019s biggest thefts including the $125 million that disappeared from cross-chain bridge Multichain last year.\n\nMercado noted that bridge security is a big deal while adding that market participants are gravitating towards more secure solutions for cross-chain crypto transactions.\n\n\u201cThe lock and mint mechanism prevalent throughout 2021-2022, which left a honeypot of tokens that hackers eyed, has faced significant competition from order book or routing bridges that are more efficient in volume transferred per value locked, and canonical bridges like USDC\u2019s Cross Chain Transfer Protocol,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nCompeting layer 2 blockchains\n\nThree of the blockchains covered in the Flipside report \u2014 Arbitrum Optimism, and Base \u2014 are Ethereum layer 2. These are networks created to scale Ethereum by processing transactions away from the mainnet but still rely on Ethereum\u2019s security for finality.\n\nPolygon is also an Ethereum scaling blockchain but is technically not a layer 2, but rather, a side-chain.\n\nEthereum layer 2s have experienced a Cambrian explosion in the past 18 months, bloating the EVM blockchain market. With limited investor liquidity, the report predicts greater competition among incumbents especially in lowering transaction costs and offering a smoother user experience.\n\nEthereum, itself stands to gain from the rivalry among its layer 2 networks as increased network activity means more money for validators.\n\nThis struggle for market share dominance among Ethereum layer 2 networks may also affect the value of their respective native tokens, the report said.\n\nBooming infrastructure and chain specialisation\n\nApart from Ethereum layer 2 networks, crypto\u2019s overall infrastructure stack expanded last year and Flipside is predicting an even greater boom in 2024.\n\nThe report pointed to significant gains in the likes of zero-knowledge technology and data availability solutions like Celestia as reasons for such expectation.\n\nNewer entrants like scaling blockchain Monad and Berachain are also expected to contribute to this growth, the report said.\n\nUltimately, the report expects that developers will optimise for their respective technological strengths leading to specialised blockchains rather than the general-purpose blockchain networks currently available.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Top trending inscriptions in 2024 - OKX",
        "content": "In 2023, thanks to developers like Casey Rodarmor from the Bitcoin dev community, inscriptions became a buzzword in the crypto space. But what are they? Similar to NFTs, you can view them as digital artifacts. Inscriptions are, in short, metadata within the blockchain. For example, if we were to examine ordinals, the metadata is encoded on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. For total clarity, ordinals are a means of tracking individual satoshis, which you can attach data to via inscriptions.\n\nThe inscriptions found on the Bitcoin network can include various digital elements, such as text, images, and other forms. They exist as singular digital entries or artifacts within the network, serving as an expansion of the network itself. The inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain are remarkable because of their lasting and unchangeable nature.\n\nWhile it started with Bitcoin, the idea of inscriptions has spread to other cryptocurrencies, causing curiosity and concern among community members. Could these inscriptions change the way we perceive the value of our digital collectibles?\n\nTL;DR\n\nInscriptions emergence: Developers like Casey Rodarmor propelled inscriptions into the crypto space, creating digital artifacts (similar to NFTs) on the blockchain, starting with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin's ordinals and beyond: Writing on satoshis, also known as Bitcoin's units, has created inscriptions for other cryptocurrencies. This has changed the way digital collectibles are valued.\n\nKey developments: Some notable advancements in inscription technology include BRC-20, Ethscriptions, SRC-20, ARC-20, and DRC-20. Each of these developments adds distinctive digital asset capabilities to their respective blockchains .\n\nExpanding blockchain functionality: The advancements to inscriptions have brought about different characteristics, such as token creation, extensive transaction data, and the evolution of managing digital assets.\n\nFuture implications: The developments indicate a significant transformation in blockchain technology, potentially altering the way assets are owned and controlled in the crypto space.\n\nWhat are inscriptions?\n\nInscriptions incorporate different forms of information, such as text, images, videos, or smart contracts, onto the smallest unit of Bitcoin, called a satoshi. This process converts these satoshis into distinct digital items, commonly known as NFTs or non-fungible tokens.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions have evolved significantly, particularly following the introduction of the ordinals protocol by Casey Rodarmor, a core contributor to Bitcoin, in early 2023.\n\nEstablishing this protocol marked a crucial turning point in developing the first NFTs on the Bitcoin network. These inscriptions are made possible by the Bitcoin network's Taproot upgrade, which provided technical support for such innovations.\n\nHow do inscriptions work?\n\nAdding information to the Bitcoin blockchain involves using \"envelopes.\" These envelopes, known as Bitcoin scripts, aren't executed but are used for storing data. The data is then added to the transaction's witness data using the segregated witness (segwit) update and Taproot improvement. This method allows for more data to be included in each transaction compared to the previous use of OP_RETURN.\n\nIn 2023, inscriptions moved beyond Bitcoin's ecosystem with Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin all introducing inscriptions to their communities. Will other token standards catch on too?\n\nWhat are the technical challenges of inscriptions?\n\nA major obstacle in the technical aspect is the oracle issue. Due to the nature of blockchains, they need to be more capable of verifying the accuracy of real-world data. This creates a need for a certain level of trust for the system to function, which goes against the trustless principle of blockchain.\n\nUpdates and corrections\n\nAn additional concern arises when making changes or fixes to existing inscriptions. The unchangeable characteristics of blockchain imply that it can't be modified or removed once information is recorded. This presents a challenge when attempting to update agreements or rectify errors, as any adjustments would call for a new transaction, causing financial strain and restricting progress.\n\nScaling and privacy issues\n\nThe addition of inscriptions on a blockchain can also cause it to become bloated with non-financial data, resulting in problems with scalability. Each node in the network is responsible for storing and handling this extra information, potentially causing a need for more powerful hardware and increased internet usage, which could impact decentralization. But in recent developments, the Runes protocol has offered a solution to help reduce the bloat.\n\nNetwork congestion and transaction fees\n\nThe surge in inscription-related transactions has led to network congestion on multiple blockchains. This transaction increase has resulted in higher transaction fees and delayed processing times. For example, the Bitcoin network experienced significant congestion and increased fees due to the popularity of BRC-20 transactions.\n\nWhat are the top trending inscriptions?\n\nBRC-20\n\nBRC-20 is a new token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling the creation of fungible tokens using ordinal inscriptions. The inclusion of NFT capabilities for Bitcoin, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, uses a Proof of Work system and doesn't offer support for smart contracts.\n\nThis standard diversifies Bitcoin's functionality, fostering innovation in digital assets like meme coins. Even with difficulties and discussions among Bitcoin users, the introduction of BRC-20 is a notable advancement in broadening the potential uses of Bitcoin and improving its digital asset environment.\n\nEthscriptions\n\nEthscriptions enables the generation and trading of digital objects recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Taking inspiration from Bitcoin's original recordings, it allows individuals to incorporate information \u2014 and specifically visuals \u2014 directly into Ethereum transactions, presenting a fresh method for managing digital assets.\n\nMany believe the Ethereum ecosystem has been enhanced significantly by this protocol, which challenges the conventional functions of blockchain and broadens the range of possibilities for Ethereum. It showcases Ethereum's flexibility and potential for creative use, encouraging a new era of digital assets and data storage on the blockchain.\n\nSRC-20\n\nBitcoin's blockchain has a token standard called SRC-20, which allows for the creation of digital collectables known as Bitcoin Stamps. This standard allows for the inclusion of data directly into transactions, bringing a new efficiency level to managing digital assets on Bitcoin.\n\nThe introduction of this advancement broadens the capabilities of Bitcoin beyond its primary purpose as a means of preserving wealth, transforming it into a flexible platform for distinct digital possessions. SRC-20 marks a notable change in Bitcoin's role in cryptocurrency, defying conventional beliefs and unlocking fresh opportunities.\n\nARC-20\n\nARC-20 is a set of rules dictating how tokens are made on Bitcoin's blockchain. The tokens are called fungible tokens and use satoshis, which allows them to work with Bitcoin's system and gives each token value. Meanwhile, Atomicals are a different way to manage digital assets on Bitcoin.\n\nThe latest developments show Bitcoin's adaptability in managing digital assets and tokens. ARC-20 and Atomicals offer new opportunities for asset management on Bitcoin, highlighting its potential in decentralized finance and expanding its use.\n\nDRC-20\n\nThe Dogecoin blockchain has introduced a fresh token standard called DRC-20, allowing users to generate fungible tokens and NFTs, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20. This standard boasts speedy transactions, affordable fees, and effortless token generation.\n\nBy diversifying Dogecoin's abilities, this standard expands its potential uses and strengthens its position in the crypto market.\n\nRunes Protocol\n\nRunes Protocol is a novel Bitcoin-based system for efficient fungible token management, emphasizing simplicity and transaction efficiency. This development aims to improve Bitcoin's scalability and usability, potentially transforming its utility in digital asset management. It introduces the UTXO-based fungible token protocol to provide a more streamlined approach to fungible tokens.\n\nSATS\n\nSATS is a BRC-20 token on the Bitcoin blockchain, not to be confused with 'sats' (the smallest Bitcoin unit), and represents a step towards hosting fungible tokens on Bitcoin. This token demonstrates innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering new functionalities like tokenization and peer-to-peer transfers, despite challenges and community debates on its impact\n\nSPL-20\n\nSPL-20 inscriptions on Solana's blockchain enable direct digital art and NFT storage, moving away from traditional external storage methods. They mark a significant advancement in blockchain technology for integrated digital asset creation and management, particularly in digital art and NFTs.\n\nRecursive inscriptions\n\nThe ordinals community has implemented a method of recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin's blockchain, which allows for the storage and execution of sophisticated software. This approach enhances data storage efficiency on the blockchain by connecting data from previous inscriptions to new ones. The inclusion of these inscriptions is another advancement for the abilities of Bitcoin, and opens up the possibility for more complex functions and smart contracts.\n\nThe final word\n\nInscriptions, akin to NFTs, are digital artifacts embedded within the blockchain that mark a shift in how digital collectibles are valued and perceived. Originating for Bitcoin, where metadata is inscribed onto satoshis, this feature has since spread to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nToday, inscriptions can be applied from the Ethereum blockchain through to that of the memecoin Dogecoin, introducing distinct features to individual blockchains. That includes developing interchangeable tokens and virtual collectibles and incorporating complex data and graphics into transactions.\n\nThis wave of innovation is reshaping what's possible from major assets such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana, expanding the scope and capabilities of digital asset management and ownership in the blockchain space."

        "title": "Legal Analysis: Decoding A Spot Ethereum ETF Approval - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a detailed legal analysis shared via X, Davis Polk lawyer Scott Johnsson dissected the complex path that Ethereum (ETH) must traverse to secure a spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval. This deep-dive analysis, while drawing parallels to the successful Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF approval, highlights the unique challenges and potential regulatory shifts necessary for Ethereum\u2019s spot ETF prospects.\n\nPart I: General Roadmap To Spot ETF\n\nJohnsson begins his analysis by emphasizing the importance of understanding the general regulatory path for a digital asset to transition into a spot ETF offering. He points out that BTC pioneered this journey through a 4-step path, with each step building on the prior one. \u201cIt took seven years from step 1 to spot ETF for BTC, with disapprovals and regulatory hurdles at almost every turn,\u201d Johnsson notes, highlighting the lengthy and complex process involved.\n\nThis is the timeline for BTC. You can see it took 7 years from step 1 to spot ETF, with disapprovals along the entire period. During this time, arguments evolved and matured\u2026 resulting in the current regime following the 19b-4 approval order for spot ETFs this past month. pic.twitter.com/KchdpnRZwn \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 25, 2024\n\nFor Ethereum, the timeline appears to be compressing, an observation Johnsson attributes to the maturation of arguments and the refining of regulatory stances, particularly influenced by key litigation events such as the Grayscale case.\n\nStep-by-Step Process For BTC\u2019s Spot Approval:\n\nObtain a DCM Futures Listing: This step is pivotal, primarily establishing the regulatory classification of the asset as a non-security commodity and setting up the necessary futures market for the asset. \u201940 Act Futures ETF: This step gains importance as it doesn\u2019t necessitate explicit SEC approval and implicitly ratifies the commodity designation by the SEC. \u201933 Act Futures ETF: Integral in the Grayscale ruling, this step requires a formal 19b-4 approval from the SEC, laying the groundwork for logic applicable to spot approval. Spot Approval: The ultimate goal, necessitating another formal 19b-4 approval from the SEC.\n\nPart II: The Threshold Question & Grayscale\n\nIn the labyrinth of regulatory frameworks and legal precedents, the journey to spot ETF approval hinges pivotally on navigating the nuances of Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. Johnsson delves deep into this aspect, identifying it as the linchpin in the process of securing a spot ETF approval. \u201cThe essence of the challenge lies in satisfying the stringent demands of Section 6(b)(5), particularly its stipulations concerning the potential for fraud and manipulation in the market,\u201d Johnsson articulates, emphasizing the critical nature of this requirement.\n\nDissecting the SEC\u2019s Approach: The Three-Pronged Path\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approach to addressing these concerns has historically unfolded along three potential pathways, each presenting its unique set of challenges and intricacies:\n\nInherent Resistance to Fraud and Manipulation: The first path involves demonstrating that the digital asset (e.g. Ethereum) inherently possesses attributes that make it resistant to fraud and manipulation. Johnsson notes, \u201cThis route demands a robust demonstration of the asset\u2019s inherent market mechanisms and structures that inherently guard against fraudulent activities and manipulative schemes.\u201d It\u2019s a path less traveled, primarily due to the high threshold of proof and the complexities involved in substantiating such inherent safeguards.\n\nThe first path involves demonstrating that the digital asset (e.g. Ethereum) inherently possesses attributes that make it resistant to fraud and manipulation.

Other Means to Prevent Fraud and Manipulation: The second avenue, as Johnsson outlines, \u201cinvolves identifying and implementing additional measures that effectively mitigate the risks of fraud and manipulation, separate from the asset\u2019s inherent characteristics.\u201d This path necessitates a comprehensive exploration of supplementary safeguards and regulatory mechanisms that can be fortified to protect the integrity of the market.\n\nThe second avenue, as Johnsson outlines, \u201cinvolves identifying and implementing additional measures that effectively mitigate the risks of fraud and manipulation, separate from the asset\u2019s inherent characteristics.\u201d This path necessitates a comprehensive exploration of supplementary safeguards and regulatory mechanisms that can be fortified to protect the integrity of the market. A Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA): The third and often most scrutinized pathway revolves around establishing a robust Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA) with a significant market. \u201cThe SSA is pivotal, as it represents a concrete, collaborative effort between the market and regulatory bodies to actively monitor and combat potential fraudulent activities and manipulative practices,\u201d Johnsson explains.\n\nThe Grayscale Ruling: A Paradigm Shift\n\nThe landscape, however, experienced a seismic shift with the advent of the Grayscale ruling, which brought the SEC\u2019s reliance on the \u201csignificant size\u201d test under a glaring spotlight. Johnsson dissects this development, stating, \u201cThe Grayscale ruling was a watershed moment, unraveling the SEC\u2019s previously impervious stance and exposing the vulnerabilities and inconsistencies in the \u2018significant size\u2019 test.\u201d\n\nThis test, which had long been a cornerstone of the SEC\u2019s rationale in denying previous spot ETF applications, was subjected to intense scrutiny. Johnsson illuminates this, saying, \u201cThe \u2018significant size\u2019 test, once a bastion of the SEC\u2019s defense, was dissected and found lacking in coherence and consistency, marking a critical inflection point in the narrative surrounding spot ETF approvals.\u201d\n\nThe ruling underscored two pivotal facts that turned the tide: the close correlation between spot and futures markets, and the identical nature of SSAs with significant markets like the CME. \u201cThis correlation and the homogeneity of the SSAs were the fulcrum on which the Grayscale ruling pivoted, compelling a reevaluation of how these factors are weighed in the approval process,\u201d Johnsson observes.\n\nHe further elaborates on the intricate dynamics post-Grayscale ruling, \u201cThe ruling didn\u2019t just challenge the SEC\u2019s previous denials; it necessitated a profound reconfiguration of the SEC\u2019s approach, paving the way for BTC\u2019s spot approval and setting new precedents for assets like ETH.\u201d\n\nPart III: BTC 19b-4 Approval Order\n\nJohnsson examines the SEC\u2019s tactful navigation around the \u201csignificant size\u201d test, a move he perceives as both shrewd and indicative of the agency\u2019s responsive recalibration. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s decision to sidestep this contentious test illustrates a deliberate shift, steering the discourse towards uncharted yet potentially more stable grounds,\u201d he articulates. This strategic pivot, while resolving the immediate challenge, subtly reshapes the regulatory landscape for future digital asset considerations.\n\nEmbracing The \u201cOther Means\u201d Test: A Paradigm Shift\n\nThe SEC\u2019s adoption of the \u201cother means\u201d test under the provisions of 6(b)(5) marked a pivotal shift from its previous stance. Johnsson describes this as \u201ca recalibration of approach, charting a new course in the SEC\u2019s methodology to tackle the concerns of market manipulation and fraud.\u201d This move, characterized by a comprehensive correlation analysis, signified a fresh perspective on assessing the integrity and resilience of digital assets in the market.\n\nThe Methodological Refinement: A Rigorous Correlation Analysis\n\nDelving into the SEC\u2019s correlation analysis, Johnsson highlights the meticulousness and foresight embedded in this approach. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s methodology is not merely thorough; it\u2019s a testament to their commitment to data-driven and forward-looking regulatory practices,\u201d he asserts. The emphasis on a substantial sample period, intra-day trading data, and, crucially, consistency across the period, underscores a rigorous and methodical approach that sets new precedents in digital asset evaluation.\n\nJohnsson points out the SEC\u2019s directive to exclude references to the Coinbase SSA in the 19b-4 applications. He interprets this as a calculated, strategic maneuver, suggesting, \u201cThis deliberate omission opens a subtle yet profound window into the SEC\u2019s broader strategy, hinting at a complex tapestry of considerations and tactical plays at work.\u201d\n\nPart IV: Ethereum Analysis\n\nJohnsson begins with an optimistic perspective, drawing parallels between Ethereum\u2019s journey and the recently paved path by BTC. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s approval of a BTC spot ETF, particularly its reliance on the \u2018other means\u2019 test and the correlation analysis, lays down a potential blueprint for ETH,\u201d he observes. This precedent, he argues, offers a glimmer of hope, positing that \u201cETH, much like BTC, stands on the brink of achieving a similar breakthrough, provided it can navigate the intricate web of regulatory nuances.\u201d\n\nThe Correlation Conundrum: Ethereum\u2019s Unique Challenges\n\nDespite the optimism, Johnsson delves into the unique challenges Ethereum faces, particularly in establishing a sufficient level of futures-spot market correlation\u2014a cornerstone of the SEC\u2019s recent approval rationale. \u201cETH\u2019s correlation metrics, while promising, are not a mirror image of BTC\u2019s. This distinction forms the crux of the challenge, necessitating a nuanced understanding and strategic alignment with the SEC\u2019s evolving benchmarks,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe further dissects the SEC\u2019s methodological rigor, emphasizing that \u201cEthereum must not only demonstrate high correlation but also ensure consistency and robustness across a substantial historical sample, aligning with the SEC\u2019s methodical and data-centric approach.\u201d\n\nStrategic Considerations: The SEC\u2019s Balancing Act\n\nJohnsson highlights the broader strategic considerations at play within the SEC, particularly in light of its recent actions and legal stances. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s approach, especially its decisions regarding Coinbase and Binance, casts a long shadow over ETH\u2019s prospects. The agency\u2019s actions and the legal precedents they set form a complex tapestry that ETH\u2019s application must deftly navigate,\u201d he points out.\n\nHe underscores the significance of ETH\u2019s non-classification as a security in recent SEC actions, suggesting that \u201cThis implicit recognition of ETH\u2019s status, while not an outright endorsement, offers a subtle nod to its potential pathway towards spot ETF approval. [\u2026] The SEC listed a dozen+ digital assets in each action as alleged securities, [\u2026] Notably, ETH is not included in either. Nor has there ever been such an allegation.\n\nThe Countdown To The May Deadline For Ethereum\n\nAs the May deadline looms, Johnsson presents a multifaceted analysis of the converging factors that could influence the SEC\u2019s decision. \u201cThe clock is ticking, and with each passing moment, the SEC\u2019s decision matrix grows more intricate, woven with legal, strategic, and market considerations,\u201d he states.\n\nAlso, Johnsson points out the influence of BlackRock with regards to a potential spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cNear undefeated in ETF applications led by highly influential Larry Fink. And there is strong reason to suspect they may have been a stronger catalyst to BTC approval than even the Grayscale ruling.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer acknowledges the potential headwinds, especially the SEC\u2019s meticulous correlation methodology and the relatively shorter historical trading data for Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. \u201cEthereum\u2019s journey is not a straightforward sprint but a marathon laden with strategic hurdles and regulatory checkpoints,\u201d Johnsson remarks, emphasizing the complexity of the path ahead.\n\nIn concluding his analysis, Johnsson strikes a note of cautious optimism. \u201cThat said, there should be plenty of clues leading up to the deadline which should inform us as to how the SEC is thinking about its decision. And it would certainly not surprise me if the SEC decided to avoid the DC Cir at all costs and simply issue approval,\u201d he reflects.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $2,223.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"
