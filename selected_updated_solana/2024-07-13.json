        "content": "Ethereum Classic is likely to face rejection at its former support zone\n\nOBV and Open Interest showed buyer enthusiasm was low\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] has retraced all of the gains it made during the rally from January to March. Back then, the altcoin\u2019s price had risen from $18.33 to $39.67 at the apex. Alas, the market\u2019s buyers have been underwhelming since then.\n\nThe fall below the $22.9-level meant that a new bearish move seemed more likely than a recovery. Here are the levels and scenarios that ETC swing traders need to watch out for.\n\nFormer support level is now the short-term bullish target\n\nIn April and again in June, the 78.6% retracement level at $22.9 was tested and defended as support. However, the Awesome Oscillator and the price action revealed that a strong downtrend was in play in June.\n\nSupport levels at the 50% and 61.8% retracement zones were lost quickly to sellers and in July, the bears marked another victory by forcing a descent below $22.9. The recent bounce from $18.3 doesn\u2019t mean the bulls are winning though.\n\nInstead, Ethereum Classic swing traders would want to take short positions around the $23.2-$24.1 zone. More conservative bears can wait for a bearish engulfing candle to go short. With the OBV just barely above its three-month support level and the AO resolutely below neutral zero, the bearish argument is very convincing.\n\nOpen Interest at its lowest since October 2023\n\nThe weakness of the bulls was captured by the Open Interest chart. Alongside the price, the OI has slid persistently and stood at $89.7 million at press time.\n\nDespite the 10.6% price hike over the past week, the speculators did not seem too keen to bid.\n\nAdditionally, the spot CVD halted its downtrend over the past week and was slowly climbing higher at press time. The funding rate was positive, underlining the presence of bullish sentiment.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe short liquidations on 8 July after the rejection from $21 suggested a liquidity hunt. Traders should be on the lookout for a price surge that takes out short positions, as that might warn of a liquidity hunt in the opposite direction during the move towards the $23 resistance zone.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is keeping issuers of spot Ethereum ETFs in suspense with extended delays. Additionally, Ethereum bulls are eagerly anticipating a significant price rally once the approval process concludes.\n\nNate Geraci Predicts Timeline for Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nETF Store President Nate Geraci recently shared his observations of the SEC\u2019s approach towards the spot Ethereum ETFs review process. Geraci stated that the US SEC seems to be treating the spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings in a manner similar to the 19b-4 forms, thereby maintaining a high level of secrecy in the matter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the silence, Geraci believes that the approval shall happen by the next week. \u201cI still think approval is likely next week. There is absolutely no reason for delay,\u201d he said.\n\nIt appears the SEC is playing the spot eth ETF S-1s similar to the 19b-4s\u2026 *Extremely* tight-lipped. Still think approval next week. Absolutely no reason for delay. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 12, 2024\n\nThe SEC is repeating the same mistake this time as it did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said Geraci while quoting SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce. Back then Pierce said: \u201cHad these products come to market in the way other comparable products typically have, we would have avoided the circus atmosphere in which we now find ourselves.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas also commented on the SEC\u2019s lack of action regarding the Ethereum ETFs. He said that there\u2019s been no communication throughout this week after the issuers submitted S-1 forms on Monday. This leaves the issuers puzzled over the delay.\n\n\u201cEvery issuer is ready. Docs are ready. It\u2019s like a rain delay in baseball. Gotta just wait,\u201d Balchunas remarked. He expressed hope that the situation might progress quickly next week, but uncertainty remains. As per the market sentiment, the issuers are expecting one more filing submission before the final approval by the SEC.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Gas Fee Flashes Inactivity Concerns Before Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nTop Players Accumulate ETH Before the ETF Approval\n\nOver the last few weeks, some of the top market market players and Ethereum whales have been accumulating ETH in preparation for the ETF approval.\n\nThomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken showed that the US Ethereum ETFs can see inflows to the tune of $1 billion every month following the approval. Additionally, big market players like Tron founder Justin Sun have accumulated $1.1 billion worth of Ethereum gearing up for a big rally ahead.\n\nAs of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.25% up trading at $3,123 with a market cap of $375 billion. Ethereum bulls should take the price past $3,200 in order to trigger the bull run up to $4,000 and beyond.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Executive Says Ethereum ETF Is Close to the Finish Line\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum News: Whale Scoops $33M ETH As Spot ETF Approval Speculation Looms - CoinGape",
        "content": "A significant Ethereum whale has made a substantial purchase, investing millions into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This notable transaction occurred at a crucial time, as the crypto community anxiously awaits potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe timing of this large-scale acquisition, combined with the ongoing regulatory uncertainty, has ignited intense interest among investors and analysts. Many view this as a possible indicator of shifting market dynamics for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDetails Of The Whale Purchase & Market Context\n\nA significant Ethereum transaction has caught the attention of the crypto community, highlighting growing interest in the cryptocurrency as speculation about ETF approval intensifies. An Ethereum wallet, identified by the address 0x517\u20267aF15, has made a substantial purchase of 10,545 ETH coins.\n\nThis acquisition occurred over a brief three-hour period, indicating a rapid and decisive move by the buyer. The total value of this purchase amounts to approximately $33.29 million, with each ETH coin acquired at an average price of $3,156. Interestingly, the buyer executed this large purchase through five separate transfers. Each transfer involved an identical amount of ETH, suggesting a strategic and possibly automated buying approach.\n\nOver recent weeks, there has been a noticeable trend of accumulation among top market players and Ethereum whales. Thomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken, has provided valuable insight into the potential impact of spot Ethereum ETF approval. According to Perfumo, U.S. Ethereum ETFs could see substantial inflows, potentially reaching $1 billion every month following approval.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, other high-profile figures in the crypto space have been making significant moves. For instance, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has reportedly accumulated Ethereum worth $1.1 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Hong Kong & Australia Bitcoin ETF Inflows Hit Record High\n\nCurrent Ethereum Market Status & Regulatory Outlook\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum price is trading at $3,153.88, with a 24-hour trading volume of $8.9 billion. This represents a 1.30% price increase over the last 24 hours and a 4.60% increase over the past week. The current circulating supply stands at 120 million ETH.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has been delaying its decision, creating uncertainty for ETF issuers and investors. Market analysts remain optimistic about an imminent approval, with some predicting it could happen as soon as next week.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the SEC might be repeating its approach from the Bitcoin ETF approval process, potentially causing unnecessary delays. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas noted a lack of communication from the SEC this week, despite ETF issuers submitting their S-1 forms on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, just before the final decision on ETF approval, Ethereum gas fees dropped to a two-month low, suggesting major inactivity on the Ethereum network. This development adds another layer of complexity to the current market situation and regulatory expectations.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Co-founder Highlights US Govt\u2019s Crypto \u2018Mess\u2019\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
