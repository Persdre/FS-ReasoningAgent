        "content": "Web3 digital infrastructure provider COTI announced plans to launch a layer-2 chain on the Ethereum network that will be focused on adding a privacy layer to its products and services.\n\nAccording to a statement seen by CryptoPotato, the new protocol, COTI V2, will use a cryptographic technology called Garbled Circuits to enhance privacy while ensuring high speed and scalability.\n\nCOTI Unveils Privacy L2 Network\n\nCOTI claims Garbled Circuits is ten times more efficient than the Zero-Knowledge protocol, a method used by several layer-2 blockchains on the Ethereum network. COTI\u2019s new protocol will utilize Ethereum\u2019s pre-existing liquidity and security while implementing robust privacy protection for the ecosystem.\n\nThe launch of COTI\u2019s new protocol is driven by the lack of privacy and confidentiality on all layers of the public blockchain. The digital infrastructure provider believes the current state of the blockchain ecosystem gives malicious actors enough room to operate and that only strong privacy-centric architecture can protect the Web3 community.\n\nBesides ensuring privacy protection, COTI intends to focus on building areas that are \u201cwoefully lacking\u201d in Web3. The protocol\u2019s first challenge would be resolving users\u2019 ability to use the blockchain in complete privacy. COTI V2 will implement cryptography, enabling users to execute transactions without exposing their payment histories, wallet values/addresses, or other sensitive information.\n\nDeveloping a Complaint Ecosystem\n\nCOTI believes that focusing on anonymity to create privacy causes regulatory issues, which is ineffective in developing a complaint ecosystem. The new protocol will ensure transparency while protecting information that could harm users and the growth of web3.\n\nShahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI, said: \u201cSensitive data transmitted as public information on a blockchain is a bug, not a feature. This isn\u2019t tolerated in legacy business systems, so why should it be tolerated on-chain? COTI V2 will solve for this, preventing sensitive data from being broadcast to competitors, partners, and clients.\u201d\n\nThe digital infrastructure firm has scheduled the COTI V2 devnet release for the second quarter of 2024, after which the testnet and mainnet launch will follow. The company expects the launch to unlock countless new use cases in the industry and, in turn, trigger an immediate surge in web3 development."

        "content": "In a new post, the Ethereum co-founder laid out the benefits and challenges of an \u201censhrined\u201d ZK-EVM to improve security and speed.\n\nVitalik Buterin says that the setup of Layer 2s are \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\n\nIn a new blog post on Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin detailed a proposal for \u201censhrining\u201d a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) into the Ethereum blockchain, in large part to improve the security and speed of verifying transactions.\n\nEnshrining, in the context of development of the Ethereum blockchain, refers to the integration of a new feature directly into the fundamental code of the chain.\n\nAn enshrined ZK-EVM would seek to internalize the EVM verification methods currently used by layer 2 solutions, such as optimistic and ZK-rollups. These solutions have typically relied on large external codebases, which may present security vulnerabilities. Buterin\u2019s proposal aims to address this by bringing the verification process under the Ethereum protocol\u2019s governance and update mechanisms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Virtual Machine Chain Inscriptions Gain Traction, Dominating Polygon Transactions\n\nButerin outlines several technical considerations and challenges associated with implementing the ZK-EVM. Technical considerations include ensuring data availability, supporting various types of EVMs, and the need for adaptability and upgradeability.\n\n\u201cWhat key properties do we want out of ZK-EVM implementations?\u201d Buterin asked rhetorically. \u201cThe most important property, in addition to basic guarantees of correct functionality and security, is speed.\u201d\n\nOngoing Roles for Layer 2s\n\nButerin notes that the setup of Layer 2s is \u201csuboptimal,\u201d since they replicate functionality already available on Ethereum, where Ethereum governance is already responsible for making upgrades and fixing bugs.\n\nHowever, he still sees ongoing roles that Layer 2 solutions could play in the Ethereum ecosystem. Those roles might include providing fast pre-confirmation activities for before a block is confirmed and helping to mitigate the negatives of maximal extractable value (MEV), which is the maximum amount of value a miner can make by manipulating the order of transactions when a block is being made.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Devs Aim to Activate Dencun in January 2024\n\nButerin also said that Layer 2s are good at attracting users and are compensated for this popularity by capturing MEV and congestion fees in their network, which would all continue to happen."

        "content": "Ethereum price dropped close to the $2,100 level early on Wednesday, entering a crucial demand zone.\n\nOver 5.58 million wallet addresses hold nearly 40 million Ethereum tokens in the demand zone.\n\nAnalysts have predicted an ETH price rally to $3,000 since Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the $2,000 level.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, declined to $2,148 early on Wednesday. The fall in prices follows a broader sell-off in the crypto market since Monday, likely driven by investors\u2019 de-risking strategy ahead of a macro-packed week, with US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) last meeting of the year.\n\nEthereum price has entered a critical demand zone, according to on-chain metrics, in which market catalysts could help determine where ETH is headed next.\n\nAlso read: XRP price drop to $0.55 likely amidst Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s final push in US crypto legislation\n\nEthereum price reaches demand zone\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, Ethereum price has dipped into a demand zone considered crucial for the altcoin. The price range between $1,934 and $2,160 is key for Ethereum price as this is a range where 5.58 million wallet addresses accumulated nearly 40 million ETH tokens.\n\nThis makes the demand zone a critical support for ETH. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), this makes it an ideal reloading point for traders looking to add more Ethereum to their portfolio before the altcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money ETH. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum price eyes $3,000 target\n\nSeveral crypto analysts on X said Ethereum is primed for a rally. Since ETH price tested and broke out of the psychological barrier at $2,000, these analysts say the altcoin is ready to target the $3,000 level.\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @CryptoJelleNL argues ETH is ready to rally to $3,000 in the ongoing cycle.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart. Source: @CryptoJelleNL.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa), agrees with @CryptoJelleNL\u2019s thesis and notes that Ethereum is likely \u201cone of the easiest trades.\u201d Sherpa notes that after ETH consolidated under the $2,000 level for nearly two years, the altcoin is finally out of the range and ready to catch up to the $3,000 mark in the coming months.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nIn its predicted run up to the $3,000 mark, Ethereum price is likely to face resistance in the range between $2,160 and $2,247, where 1.04 million wallet addresses bought 5.49 million ETH tokens, according to IntoTheBlock data. A break past $2,247 is key to validating the bullish thesis for ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,171.38 on Binance. The altcoin is trading sideways close to the $2,100 level, after yielding nearly 5% weekly losses for holders."
