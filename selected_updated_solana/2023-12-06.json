        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that prominent gaming influencer FaZe Banks loves crypto. Now, he\u2019s buying more.\n\nRichard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson is the CEO and co-founder of esports organization and lifestyle brand FaZe Clan. The gamer took to Instagram this week to report his latest crypto purchases and double down on his pro-crypto stance amidst a broader gaming industry where crypto remains a controversial topic.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be my typical normie homie and call me asking for plays a year from now when the mainstream media and your mom [are] talking about crypto again,\u201d Banks urged his 2.8 million Instagram followers Tuesday along with a note of Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,300, a yearly high.\n\n\u201cExpose yourself now,\u201d Banks continued in a post evangelizing crypto and arguing that potential buyers should look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBTC is the safest, ETH is about as safe with slightly more upside in my opinion. My personal favorite. A large percentage of my net worth is in Ethereum,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that in his view, Solana is the \u201criskiest\u201d of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cMy money is definitely where my mouth is on this one. Buy it and leave it alone. Chill,\u201d he added.\n\nLike many financial assets and purchases, though, it\u2019s important to note that buying or trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk\u2014and fans should be careful not to take financial advice from influencers or celebrities they follow online. It's often not clear what an influencers motivations may be in promoting a cryptocurrency, NFT project, or any financial asset.\n\nBanks also claimed that he recently spent $200,000 on four altcoins: Prime, Pepe, Mog, and Clouds, the last of which has not yet been officially released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrime is the sci-fi NFT card game Parallel\u2019s official token, Pepe is a frog-inspired meme coin which recently rose to a $666 million market cap, and Mog is a meme coin that\u2019s been swirling on Twitter among fans who have paired it with memes of people and animals wearing a specific pair of colorfully-tinted glasses. Clouds is an upcoming token from the Endless Clouds crypto startup that is developing the Treeverse gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThese are the first real plays I\u2019ve made since the big market crash,\u201d Banks said, who over the summer also hopped onto the \u201cSocialFi\u201d trend and made over $70,000 by signing up for Friend.tech.\n\nBanks did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment on his latest crypto purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that FaZe Clan\u2019s newly-appointed CEO has been in crypto for years now. Back in 2021, Banks was accused of allegedly pumping and dumping an altcoin he promoted, BankSocial.\n\nAnd a quick glimpse at a wallet connected to Banks called \u201cBanksfucks\u201d currently holds some NFTs from Azuki\u2019s collections, two Bored Apes, four Mutant Ape NFTs, a staggering 72 Otherdeed NFTs for Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse game, two Clone X NFTs, and one Doodles NFT, among others. He has also recently boasted of CryptoPunks holdings.\n\nWhile Banks is a crypto and NFT enthusiast, not everyone in FaZe Clan shares this view. The org\u2019s only current female member, Kalei Renay, previously told Decrypt in an interview at TwitchCon that she isn\u2019t a fan of NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs a community, everybody hates NFTs,\u201d FaZe Kalei said of gamers. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, do whatever, but I don\u2019t care for NFTs. I don\u2019t do crypto, I don\u2019t do any of that. I stay so far away from it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
