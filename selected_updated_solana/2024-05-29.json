        "title": "$8 Billion of Ethereum (ETH) in 24 Hours: What's Happening? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nWith the Ethereum ETF craze covering the cryptocurrency market like a fog, the activity of large holders is through the roof. More than $8 billion worth of ETH has been transferred between whales, which creates an interesting situation: the activity is here, but the price is not moving for now, consolidating at around $3,900.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis amount of large transactions is remarkable. There have been more than 6,780 large transactions in the past 24 hours and a seven day high of 9,790 transactions, But for all the activity, the price of ETH has been relatively unresponsive.\n\nThe chart reveals that there are extremely high levels of transactions being offered up, amounting to an incredible 2.14 million ETH in the past day. This level of transactions is in line with the current hype over an ETF, since institutional interest tends to drive whale behavior.\n\nThe seven-day high for transaction volume was 3.21 million ETH, while the low was approximately 981,530 ETH. The implications of this volatility are that there is an extremely fluid market in which large holders are very much on the move and shaking about, presumably in the hope of signaling impending price movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOddly, though the transactions are high in the number of units and in value in many cases, there is relative moderation in price volatility. The volatility index lists a 30-day high of 62.38% and a low of 40.72%, and that means the market, with all of its transactions, is not experiencing big price swings.\n\nIf the ETF story continues to play out and more institutional money comes into the ETH space, a breakout higher than $4,000 may become a reality in the future. But, if this action is simply a reprieve to profit, or a redistribution in the face of weakness being perceived below the surface of the market, it may have trouble keeping up its courage."

        "title": "Ethereum may continue outperforming Bitcoin as 'programmable money' may be ETH's new slogan - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in an event christened \u201cThe Merge.\u201d The transformation came as the network wanted to achieve more security, cut down on energy consumption by 99.95%, and execute new scaling solutions with a possible threshold of 100,000 transactions per second. With PoS, there are less entry barriers for miners considering the reduced energy demands.\n\nStaking is a process where investors grow their portfolios by locking their assets for a specified duration instead of selling them. It is used by most blockchains, especially the ones that employ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, with users earning rewards as an incentive for committing their tokens. For most long-term cryptocurrency holders, staking is a strategy to make passive income from your assets, putting them to work in exchange for reward generation.\n\nEthereum uses decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that are independent of the central authority. To make this easier, the network has a programming language in place, which helps users create self-executing smart contracts. A smart contract is basically a code that can be verified and allows inter-user transactions.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Serving as the basal network for the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, it is the second largest crypto and largest altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, attributes that make it popular among developers.\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,837 on Tuesday as it enters a sideways movement. While current price movement suggests bulls may be running out of steam, it may also indicate a temporary slowdown until the market receives clarity on conversations surrounding the spot ETH ETF S-1 approvals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) followed a sideways trend on Tuesday as the crypto community seems to favor the term 'programmable money' as ETH's one-liner. Meanwhile, whales have continued accumulating ETH despite profiting from the recent price spike.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "5 Things to Know About Ethereum's First Spot Price ETFs - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC has finally cleared the way for the first Ether spot price ETFs.\n\nOn May 22, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first eight applications for Ether (ETH 0.33%) spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, Ark Invest, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Ether is the world's second largest cryptocurrency and the main coin of the Ethereum Network.\n\nThat announcement came just four months after the SEC cleared the first spot price Bitcoin (BTC -0.94%) ETFs for trading. But should investors assume these planned ETFs will set a firm floor under Ether's price and become compelling long-term investments? Let's review the five key facts to decide.\n\n1. The first Ether ETFs won't start trading anytime soon\n\nThe SEC approved the initial regulatory filings for the eight Ether ETFs, but they won't start trading until the agency approves their S-1 filings. That process could take several months. For reference, the SEC approved the S-1 filings for the first Bitcoin spot price ETFs approximately three months after clearing their initial regulatory filings.\n\n2. The decision turns Ether into a commodity\n\nIn the past, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains both used an energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method to produce coins. But in 2022, the Ethereum Network switched to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, known as \"The Merge,\" reduced the network's energy consumption by 99.95% and made it deflationary -- which meant more Ether was being burned than produced.\n\nHowever, the SEC initially claimed The Merge made the Ether coin and Ethereum-based tokens more similar to securities than commodities. The move made a radical change to how Ether coins are created and managed. Regulators then repeatedly declared that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified and pinned to spot price as a commodity, since it was digitally mined like a precious metal through the PoW method.\n\nTherefore, the SEC's decision to approve the first Ether ETF filings implies the coin can now be classified as a commodity instead of a security. That shift might clear the way for smaller Ethereum-based tokens such as Shiba Inu -- as well as independent PoS-driven cryptocurrencies like Solana -- to get their own spot price ETFs.\n\n3. Ether ETF investors can't stake their holdings\n\nAnother key difference between Ether and Bitcoin is the process of \"staking,\" which allows investors to earn interest by locking up their Ether coins on the network for a period of time. The SEC, which argues that staking-as-a-service solutions should be classified as unregistered securities, previously sued cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase (COIN -6.83%) and Kraken for allowing users to stake their own coins.\n\nGrayscale, Ark, and the other firms originally wanted to add staking features in their ETFs, but they removed those proposals in their updated filings last month. That change could make their ETFs less appealing than the actual digital coins.\n\n4. The SEC approved the filings probably to avoid more litigation\n\nLast year, the SEC lost a lawsuit against Grayscale, which had sued the agency for trying to block the conversion of its popular Bitcoin trust into an ETF. That loss softened the SEC's position and cleared the way for the first Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEarlier this year, blockchain company Consensys sued the SEC for its refusal to recognize Ether as a commodity, while Grayscale and its peers were widely expected to sue the SEC again if it didn't approve their regulatory filings for spot price ETFs. So for now, it seems the SEC has backed off on tightly regulating Ether to avoid more legal battles.\n\n5. The Ether ETFs should attract less attention than the Bitcoin ETFs\n\nGrayscale currently holds nearly $11 billion in assets in its GrayScale Ethereum Trust (ETHE -3.95%), which it's attempting to convert into a spot price ETF. However, that's a lot smaller than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust before its conversion into its spot price ETF, which now hosts more than $20 billion in assets.\n\nThese new Ether ETFs might attract some attention from mainstream and institutional investors, but they probably won't gain as much momentum as the Bitcoin spot price ETFs earlier this year. Ether also doesn't have any major near-term catalysts that are comparable to Bitcoin's halving, which halved the rewards for mining, earlier this year.\n\nShould you buy the Ether ETFs?\n\nThe Ether ETFs might not attract as many investors as the Bitcoin ETFs, but they might represent an easy way for investors to gain exposure to Ether without directly buying the coins. But investors should still be mindful of the fees, see if they actually match Ether's spot price, and realize they won't be able to stake their holdings.\n\nTherefore, investors shouldn't rush to buy the Ether ETFs once they hit the market. Instead, they should wait and see if the convenience of owning these ETFs in a brokerage account outweighs the advantages of owning Ether in a crypto wallet."

        "content": "Yesterday, ENS Labs, the company responsible for managing the decentralized service Ethereum Name Service, presented a governance proposal where it invites the community to expand its dapp into a layer-2 network.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know anything about the prototype of the network that ENS aspires to migrate to: all we know is that as a fundamental criterion the new chain must be EVM compatible, censorship-resistant, decentralized, and open source.\n\nAnche il money market Aave e la piattaforma di restaking Etherfi stanno pensando di tuffarsi nel panorama dei layer-2 lanciando una rete proprietaria.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nENS wants to launch its own layer-2 blockchain\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS), protocol for the creation of domini on the Ethereum blockchain, is considering migrating to a layer-2 to address some technical limitations and improve the end-user experience.\n\nQuesto \u00e8 quanto riportato da ENS Labs, organizzazione non-profit situata a Singapore che si occupa dello sviluppo della piattaforma ENS, che con una proposal di governance ha condiviso ieri l\u2019idea con la community del progetto.\n\nWithout revealing too many details, the company emphasized the potential benefits that would be brought to the protocol, such as improved scalability with reduced gas fees and the introduction of new advanced features.\n\nIl nuovo layer-2 dovr\u00e0 essere necessariamente compatibile con lo standard EVM, oltre che resistente alla censura, decentralizzato e open source.\n\nIntroducing ENSv2: The Next Generation of ENS \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nENS Labs is excited to announce our proposal to extend the ENS protocol to a Layer 2 network. This move isn't just about migrating parts of the protocol; we're re-envisioning the architecture from the ground up! pic.twitter.com/3xM6owTpKk \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) May 28, 2024\n\nIn the world of finance, the terms \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d are often used to describe market trends. A \u201cbull\u201d market is characterized by rising prices and investor optimism, while a \u201cbear\u201d market is marked by falling prices and investor pessimism. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the financial markets effectively.\n\nSince 2017 ENS has established itself as the leading platform for on-chain domain registration, effectively becoming the bridge between traditional internet and the decentralized web.\n\nWith the passage of time, however, the ambitions of this protocol have also changed, which now in order to truly become mainstream aims to offer lower gas costs than Ethereum fees and faster transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is indeed excessively expensive to use when there is too much congestion, skyrocketing the commission costs to execute a simple transaction or approve a smart contract.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted by the community, the domain registration phase will move to layer-2, which will become the new platform for user interactions in all respects.\n\nWith the update, a new hierarchical system is also proposed for more effective management of domini, where the holders of these resources will have access to a unique register, where they can check the subdomains and configure the resolvers.\n\nFurthermore, the transition to ENSv2 implies the improvement of l\u2019interoperabilit\u00e0 multi-chain, with the functions of ENS that will also be brought within other cryptographic ecosystems.\n\nWe still do not know the timing of this fundamental transition in the history of Ethereum Name Service, but it is likely that the migration could take place in 2025, provided the proposal passes.\n\nRegarding the news Eskender Abebe, Product and Strategy Manager at ENS Labs, reiterated how the release of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 which introduced the function of BLOB in Ethereum rollups with Dencun, was a factor of enormous importance that motivated the team to evaluate the transition to layer-2, effectively making transactions on these second-level networks cheaper. These are his words:\n\n\u201cThe release of EIP4844 has made Ethereum-based layer 2 networks much more convenient and scalable, which has been a major driving factor for the ENS proposal.\u201d\n\nAave and Etherfi also consider a proprietary layer2 network\n\nENS non sarebbe l\u2019unico top protocollo della blockchain di Ethereum a pensare ad una migrazione presso un layer-2 pi\u00f9 scalabile: dopo il recente successo del trend delle soluzioni di ridimensionamento zk-rollup e degli optimistic rollup, con il TVL di questa nicchia che ha superato i 47 miliardi di dollari, sempre pi\u00f9 entit\u00e0 puntano a lanciare la propria chain con appoggio su Ethereum.\n\nOne of these is Aave, a very famous lending protocol that should soon complete the upgrade to Aave V4 with the platform aiming to introduce a unified multi-chain liquidity layer, becoming much more efficient in all respects.\n\nThe founder of the project, Stani Kulechov, in a recent post on X informed his community that after the V4 Aave could launch its own layer-2 network expanding its DeFi ecosystem towards new horizons.\n\nWe remind you that Aave represents the third largest dapp on Ethereum after EigenLayer and Lido, with a TVL of 13 billion dollars: if it landed on an L2, it would effectively become the largest secondary network on Ethereum, even beating the industry leader Arbitrum.\n\nIt would simultaneously also be the third largest chain in the entire Defi sector, behind Tron and obviously the parent company Ethereum.\n\nWe do not know the technical details of the new product but we know that the official launch is scheduled for 2025.\n\nThis is not a drill, Aave Network is planned to come after V4. https://t.co/a43nNlT114 \u2014 Stani^ (@StaniKulechov) May 27, 2024\n\n\u201c`html\n\nAnche EtherFi, noto protocollo di restaking di ultima generazione con un TVL di 6 miliardi di dollari, ha in programma di costruire un layer-2 proprietario in futuro.\n\n\u201c`\n\nAfter achieving enormous results in the market, such as the introduction of native restaking on L2s, the launch of its own token as an airdrop, and the release of a debit card to collateralize the balance in the protocol by borrowing USDC, now EtherFi aims for the next step.\n\nEven here, the details of this step are not known, except that it could likely happen in 2025, contributing to making user transactions much faster and cheaper.\n\nThe objective for the protocol is to improve the user experience and expand its connections with the DeFi landscape, aiming to attract as many resources and liquidity as possible."
