Discover SCENE\n\nOpen interest for Ethereum futures contracts hit $15.5 billion on Tuesday following rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission was closer to approving ETH exchange-traded funds this week.\n\nThe sudden blast of optimism has fueled a rush of upward movement across markets, and CoinGlass data shows that open interest on all crypto exchanges was at a record of 4.13 million ETH\u2014surging by 32% in 24 hours.\n\nDeribit CEO Luuk Strijers told Decrypt that the trading volume was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis surge [in futures trading] reflects the heightened market activity and interest as traders and investors position themselves to capitalize on the potential approval,\u201d Strijers said.\n\nIn the derivatives market, futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specific price at a later date. They allow traders to speculate on movements in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s a marked turnaround for the second largest cryptocurrency after months of hand wringing. Until this week, it was expected by industry observers and analysts that the SEC would not approve a spot ETH exchange traded fund (ETF) by the May 23 deadline.\n\nBut yesterday, ETF analysts at Bloomberg said that they had heard Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulator would go ahead and give the green light to the funds after fund managers started updating paperwork for the potential products.\n\nThe price of ETH has rocketed as a result: ETH is currently trading at $3,752, according to CoinGecko, having shot up 19% in 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t only ETH that is doing well: almost every other coin and token is up. Bitcoin, the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency, yesterday rocketed to over $70,000 per coin. It\u2019s since dropped and is priced at $69,753.\n\nMeme coins and tokens have also surged, as have altcoins like Solana and Avalanche.\n\nLots of top asset managers have filed paperwork with the SEC to release a spot ETH ETF in the United States.\n\nIf approved, ordinary investors could get exposure to ETH by buying shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency, which is the second biggest by market cap.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Reach $5000? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "As the overall crypto market begins to show signs of strength, Ethereum, the largest altcoin, sees an overnight increase in price. The bullish resurgence takes back the psychological $3,500 mark as the underlying demand increases in tandem with the improving sentiment surrounding the approval of the Ethereum ETF.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s bull run is further fueled by the market\u2019s recovery rally, which is being supported by Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $70,000. What\u2019s the deal, then? Will the price of Ethereum surpass $5,000?\n\nHere is an overview of Ethereum:\n\nETH Price Prediction For May 2024\n\nThe Ethereum price is $3,813.68, a change of 23.79% over the past 24 hours as of 8:20 p.m. The recent price action in Ethereum left the token\u2019s market capitalization at $453.80B. So far this year, Ethereum has a change of 66.09%. The recent price jump comes along with high volume as it has surged 335% in the last 24 hours.\n\nTechnical Analysis of Ethereum\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ether\u2019s current gains are part of a falling wedge breakout.\n\nA falling wedge forms when the price moves within a descending channel with two converging trendlines. Meanwhile, as a rule of technical analysis, the pattern resolves when the price breaks above its upper trendline and rises to its peak height.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis | Source: Tradingview\n\nToday, the price surged passed the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), as it moves toward $4000, expected as the initial target of the falling wedge breakout.\n\nEther open interest, funding rate rise sharply\n\nEther\u2019s price increase coincides with a sharp increase in its open interest (OI) and funding rates.\n\nOn May 21, Ether Futures OI increased by more than $3 billion, and jumped to $14.68 billion, while the funding rate reached a one-month high of 0.567% per week.\n\nA high OI typically indicates increased investor interest and confidence in the asset, implying that traders are preparing for possible price movements.\n\nMeanwhile, a high funding rate indicates that more traders are betting on Ether\u2019s price rising (long positions) than on it falling (short positions). This suggests that traders are bullish and willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $5,000?\n\nWhile the current market conditions favor Ethereum, reaching $5,000 depends on several factors, including:\n\nOverall market trends: Continued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum.\n\nContinued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum. Regulatory developments: Approval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase.\n\nApproval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase. Ethereum-specific developments: Progress on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 could further boost investor confidence.\n\nOverall, the technical indicators and rising investor sentiment paint a bullish picture for Ethereum. However, external factors will ultimately determine whether the token can reach the $5,000 milestone."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink Are Soaring - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A potentially historic decision is benefiting Ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) surged more than 25%, rising from just $3,000 to more than $3,700 at one point. This bullish momentum is primarily driven by growing anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a development that could have profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC's shift and expedited revisions\n\nFor a long time, the approval of an Ethereum ETF seemed like a distant possibility. Many analysts and market participants believed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wouldn't greenlight such an ETF, as they believed it to be a security and not a commodity like Bitcoin (BTC -1.35%), which received its own spot ETF approval in January this year.\n\nHowever, sentiment has shifted dramatically. Rumors are swirling that the SEC has requested several applicants to expedite their revisions to their 19b-4s. These applications, which are essential for listing new ETFs, must be corrected, allowing for the final approval with an S-1 application and thereby pave the way for the ETFs to start trading.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\n\nThe prospect of an Ethereum ETF is significant for several reasons. First, it would provide investors unfamiliar or uncomfortable navigating crypto exchanges and digital wallets an easy way to invest. If approved, then investors can buy the Ethereum ETF off their preferred brokerage, just as with any other stock.\n\nYet the most important aspect of a potential approval comes in the form of institutional investors. Currently, institutional investors face several hurdles when attempting to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, including custody concerns, regulatory uncertainties, and market volatility. An ETF would alleviate many of these issues, making it easier for institutional capital to flow into the Ethereum market.\n\nWith easier access, it is expected that the deep pockets of institutional investors could cause Ethereum's price to soar. The Bitcoin ETFs were already some of the most successful ETFs ever launched, and if Ethereum follows a similar path, it could result in a significant price surge.\n\nRipple effect on other cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile the focus is primarily on Ethereum, the positive sentiment has spilled over into other cryptocurrencies. Solana (SOL -0.70%), Avalanche (AVAX -0.86%), and Chainlink (LINK -1.39%) have all seen their prices rise by more than 25% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies, often referred to as \"altcoins,\" have been subject to heightened scrutiny lately because of their similarities with Ethereum, namely their proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Many agency officials believe proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are closer to a security than to a commodity. But with a potential Ethereum ETF approval this opinion might be changing and could give a boost to other proof of stake cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalysts' predictions and timelines\n\nWhile the approval of an Ethereum ETF is not yet guaranteed, analysts currently estimate a 75% chance of approval. This optimistic outlook is based on the SEC's recent actions and the growing recognition of Ethereum's importance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the earliest the ETFs could start trading is around the end of June. Applicants will need to revise and correct their applications, a process that typically takes several weeks.\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF represents a monumental shift in the regulatory landscape, offering a more accessible and secure investment vehicle for both retail and institutional investors. While the final decision is still pending, the current sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, and the approval could mark a new era of growth and adoption for the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "As the price of ether increases, the cost of running a full solo staking node \u2014 with 32 ETH now worth $115,000 \u2014 moves further out of reach for all but the most hard core hobbyists.\n\nOne of the social goals that Oisin Kyne and Collin Myers, founders of Obol Network, care about most is enabling people that don\u2019t have that kind of capital to participate in Ethereum consensus.\n\nThe pair looks forward to the day when the number of entities and locations validating the network will rise tenfold from its current crop of single-digit thousands of operators.\n\nThat includes a fellow in a Kenyan village who, according to Kyne, participates in a distributed validator cluster via EtherFi, running his hardware off a Starlink and a generator.\n\n\u201cIt certainly feels good to have people that are staking \u2014 that have the technical ability and are really into it, but either weren\u2019t in early or don\u2019t have, you know, bags \u2014 that can actually decentralize Ethereum and quite happily do it from the middle of nowhere,\u201d Kyne told Blockworks.\n\nObol has spent the past few years proving out the technology to decentralize projects like Lido, its launch partner, and to enable more solo stakers as well as new paradigms like squad staking.\n\n\u201cWe worked with [Lido] to integrate the technology into their stack, and now we\u2019re progressively opening the code base, decentralizing the community, and in the future plan to incentivize the community and bring everyone together around this contribution based mindset,\u201d Myers told Blockworks.\n\nAs a first step, Obol has announced the \u201c1% For Decentralisation\u201d funding model for the DVT middleware provider.\n\nUnder the plan, Obol\u2019s distributed validator (DV) clusters will contribute 1% of their staking rewards \u201ctoward projects that add value and impact at the Ethereum consensus layer, including technology partners, researchers, community educators, node operators, and more,\u201d according to a blog post published Tuesday.\n\nThe initiative piggybacks off the EasyRetroPGF \u2014 or Retroactive Public Goods Funding \u2014 system pioneered by GitCoin.\n\nWhereas public good funding from the Optimism Foundation focuses on the execution layer and user adoption, \u201cthere needs to be a more concerted focus around the validator, infrastructure area, the consensus integrity, that whole side of the network,\u201d the Obol founders say.\n\nMiddleware provides an interface between Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer and software further up the modular stack.\n\n\u201cThe creation of middleware enables add-on use cases to your existing experience,\u201d Myers explained. \u201cWithout middleware, it\u2019s just a boring old validator \u2014 you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nMEV Boost is one example in wide use alongside Obol today, that enables the little guy to earn similar staking yields as large professional operators. And soon validators will be able to participate in EigenLayer Actively Validated Services (AVS) or similar offerings on top.\n\n\u201cAll of this is an extension of the validator as a world-class citizen of Web3,\u201d Myers said.\n\nEthereum is sometimes criticized for the complexity of its design, or for tolerating centralizing influences in certain areas, such as block building and the scaling of the execution layer.\n\nBut Myers feels those attacks are misplaced.\n\n\u201cFrom where I sit, two years ago we went from bad rent extraction, client centralization, a completely monolithic software stack, and now we\u2019ve moved to modular, a bit more decentralized, open source, multiple options, lots of funding, good debate \u2014 and for me that\u2019s progress,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile there is some movement in the direction of ossifying the base consensus layer, he pushes back against the notion that the roadmap is decreasing innovation at layer one. Rather, \u201cthey are just enabling it to exist elsewhere through decentralization\u2026and DVT is a living example of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cstage\u201d framework used by L2beat is a useful gauge of decentralization progress, and Osin agreed with Vitalik\u2019s commitment to push \u201clayer-2s\u201d as such to reach the Stage 1 level by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting social showing, of people being like, \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to tolerate a sidechain masquerading as an L2, unless you can permissionlessly exit back to L1,\u201d Osin said.\n\nLido is backing the new Obol funding approach, with contributor Will Shannon, calling it \u201ca fantastic approach to strengthening the resilience and decentralization of the Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
