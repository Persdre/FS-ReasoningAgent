        "content": "The PBS Foundation is opening applications for an initial $1 million in grants for research and development on Ethereum proposer-builder separation.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s pilot phase drew support from Coinbase, Consensys, Fenbushi Capital, Flashbots, Paradigm, the Uniswap Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nGrants will be disbursed by a council. The council includes representatives from Blocknative, Consensys, the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots, among others. The foundation\u2019s grant lead is Eugene Leventhal from the research group Metagov.\n\nRead more: For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck\n\nFirst proposed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, proposer-builder separation (PBS) is the concept of separating proposers \u2014 which submit transaction bundles to validators on a blockchain \u2014 and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nPBS represents an attempt at decentralization, as the combination of proposing and building gives well-heeled centralized mining pools a competitive advantage.\n\nPBS first went into effect after Ethereum\u2019s Merge to proof-of-stake. Now, the PBS Foundation aims to promote research and infrastructure to address some of the challenges the concept currently faces.\n\nNotably, MEV-boost relays have become centralized since the Merge. Relayers operate between block builders and validators on maximal extractable value (MEV) boosted transactions, selecting blocks with the highest possible fees. Roughly 90% of transactions in the last 500 epochs, or roughly two days, made use of MEV-boost. Of MEV-boost transactions in the past 24 hours, roughly 97% have been handled by five relayers, according to relayscan.\n\nBlocknative, once among those top relayers, discontinued its service in September, citing economic viability concerns. Relayers do not currently collect fees. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs a large relayer, has advocated fee structures outside of public goods funding to incentivize more relayers to join the fray.\n\nA spokesperson for the PBS Foundation said the grant funding could be used to fund relayers, with a particular emphasis on those who introduce novel designs for relaying.\n\nThe funding will also be focused on community and educational materials, data transparency on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and blocks, and research on how PBS can be improved \u2014 or even enshrined \u2014 on both the primary network and on layer-2 networks.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Ethereum developers have tentatively decided on Jan. 17, 2024, for the upcoming \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade\u2019s first testnet deployment during the latest bi-weekly dev meeting on Dec. 21.\n\nOriginally slated for the last quarter of 2023, the \u2018Dencun upgrade was pushed to 2024 due to the engineering complexities involved.\n\nTim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, noted that the date is not set in stone and could change if major issues arise. The team aims to release a blog post detailing the fork during the week of Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 giving stakeholders a week to prepare for the update.\n\nDencun upgrade timeline\n\nThe meeting set out a draft timeline for the testing phase of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nFollowing the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, 2024, developers plan to run tests on other networks \u2014 Sepolia on Jan. 31, 2024, and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nThe developers aim to deploy the changes on the mainnet by the end of February 2024 if everything goes smoothly. However, these dates are subject to change based on the results of the testnet forks.\n\nDencun will be Ethereum\u2019s first major upgrade since \u2018Shapella\u2019 earlier this year, which was a significant milestone in itself, enabling staked ether (ETH) withdrawals from the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, a major aspect of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This new process is designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data storage, a move that is expected to reduce fees for Layer 2 rollups and scale the blockchain by increasing space for \u201cblobs\u201d of data.\n\nBy improving data handling capabilities and efficiency, it aims to enhance the performance of rollups and, consequently, the overall throughput and affordability of the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cLayer 3 app-chains\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, the meeting also highlighted a collaboration between Avail and StarkWare. The partnership aims to augment data availability for appchains within the Starknet Layer 2 network. Leveraging Madara, a customizable sequencer, this initiative seeks to develop app-chains that will function as Layer 3 solutions within the Starknet ecosystem.\n\nThese Layer 3 app-chains, powered by the combined efforts of Avail and StarkWare, aim to revolutionize data availability modes, including validium and sovereign rollups. This, in turn, will help optimize transaction processing efficiency and finality, which is crucial for blockchain scalability.\n\nThe developers also touched upon Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. They reiterated their commitment to maintaining Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the space, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to meet the ever-evolving demands of the market.\n\nThe meeting also provided a platform for developers to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Ethereum. From addressing network congestion issues to enhancing user experience, the developers explored a range of topics that are critical to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and its users\u2019 needs.\n\nMentioned in this article"
