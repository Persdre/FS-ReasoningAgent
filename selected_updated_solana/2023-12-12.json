        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s Price Increase : SOL\u2019s price surged to nearly $75 recently, a peak last seen in May 2022, and currently stands at about $71.\n\n: SOL\u2019s price surged to nearly $75 recently, a peak last seen in May 2022, and currently stands at about $71. NFT Sales Volume Growth : Solana briefly outperformed Ethereum in NFT sales volume growth, with a significant 53% weekly increase.\n\n: Solana briefly outperformed Ethereum in NFT sales volume growth, with a significant 53% weekly increase. Bonk Inu\u2019s Exceptional Performance: The Solana-based memecoin, Bonk Inu, saw a 400% rise in its price, outstripping other popular memecoins.\n\nSOL Performing Better Than ETH in This Aspect\n\nThe sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2013 Solana (SOL) \u2013 has been on a tear lately, with its price soaring from the start of Q4, 2023. Last weekend, it hit almost $75 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a peak last witnessed in May 2022. In the following days, SOL slightly decreased to its current level of $71 due to the ongoing market correction.\n\nApart from experiencing a rapid price ascent, the asset also surpassed several of its rivals in terms of transaction volume and other metrics.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, Solana non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume has marked a bigger increase on a weekly basis than Ethereum. The figure with the former has reached almost $68 million, 53% higher than the observed data a week before.\n\nWhile Ethereum NFT sales volume for the past seven days stands at nearly $100 million, it actually represents a 5% drop for a week. Moreover, Solana briefly outpaced its rival on December 8 when it witnessed $16 million of such sales versus $11 million for the other blockchain protocol.\n\nSolana\u2019s BONK Stole the Show\n\nSolana might have captured some investors\u2019 attention, but its memecoin Bonk Inu (BONK) has undoubtedly taken center stage recently.\n\nThe token\u2019s price has exploded by 400% on a monthly basis, hitting an all-time high on December 9. In addition, its market capitalization currently hovers around $800 million, positioning the asset as the 81st largest in the entire crypto realm.\n\nBONK\u2019s impressive rise could be attributed to Solana\u2019s uptrend and the hype surrounding memecoins. However, some of the leading tokens of that type, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have failed to catch up with Bonk Inu\u2019s speed, registering more modest spikes as of late."

        "title": "Ethereum burns $2.5B worth of ETH since merge as supply drops to 18 month low - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data on Ultrasound Money reveals a continued shift in its economic model since the historic merge in Sept. 2022.\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply stands at 309,663 ETH, equivalent to approximately $686.2 million. This reduction reflects a deflationary trend, contrasting the previous inflationary nature where new ETH was consistently created. The cause of this shift can be traced to the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, valued at around $2.65 billion. Permanently removing tokens from circulation plays a crucial role in reducing the total supply and could enhance ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time. Further, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH, worth about $1.96 billion, Ethereum\u2019s total supply experienced a net decrease, illustrating that the rate of ETH burning continues to surpass the rate of new issuance.\n\nPresently, the total supply of Ethereum stands at the lowest point since the merge at 120,211,380 ETH, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $266.39 billion, reinforcing its significant standing in the crypto market.\n\nA look at the ETH burning leaderboard presents further insights by analyzing the leading contracts contributing to the burning of ETH. The top contributors to this activity include major dApps and services, notably Uniswap in its various iterations, Tether, and OpenSea. Uniswap\u2019s prominent position suggests a high transaction volume within the DeFi sector, with $543.8 million burned across four contracts in the top 10.\n\nThe presence of Tether indicates substantial stablecoin transactions on Ethereum\u2019s network, while OpenSea\u2019s inclusion highlights the enduring nature of NFT transactions even through the bear market. This diversity, encompassing DeFi platforms, stablecoins, NFT marketplaces, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, showcases the multifaceted utilization of Ethereum.\n\nBurned ETH Entity Value (USD) 84,006.46 Uniswap Universal Router $186,158,315.36 75,926.77 Uniswap V2 $168,253,722.32 74,739.31 ETH transfers $165,622,310.96 58,030.71 Uniswap Universal Router 2 $128,596,053.36 53,626.72 Tether $118,836,811.52 27,441.92 Uniswap V3 $60,811,294.72 26,935.76 New contracts $59,689,644.16 23,405.50 OpenSea $51,866,588.00 22,891.92 Arbitrum $50,728,494.72 22,201.66 MetaMask $49,198,878.56\n\nSource: ultrasound.money\n\nThe top 10 contracts total $1,039,762,113.68 worth of ETH burned, just under half of the total burn since the merge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value, especially when contrasted with inflationary fiat currencies. The heightened activity in decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications indicates a robust trend toward decentralized finance.\n\nInterestingly, under its current proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the Ethereum network has burned an average of 1.83 ETH/min since the merge. However, since the burn mechanic was implemented as part of the EIP-1559 upgrade in Aug. 2021, the average burn rate is almost double, 3.09 ETH/min. Yet, due to the drastic reduction in supply issuance since proof-of-work mining was removed, the total supply has steadily declined.\n\nIf Ethereum had retained its PoW mode, the supply would have reached a mammoth 124,941,176 ETH, some 4.7 million ETH more than the current level. Theoretically, at the current price of $2,228, this would have given Ethereum a market cap of $12 billion higher than current $266 billion. Importantly, due to the increased supply, this is merely academic due to the nature of supply/demand market dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, these dynamics may influence Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in various ways. Continued deflationary tendencies could lead to increased demand and potentially higher ETH prices, assuming steady or rising demand coming out of the bear market. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes or macroeconomic trends can significantly impact these dynamics, especially with continued activity from the SEC in the U.S. toward categorizing PoS tokens as securities.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s post-merge statistics signal a notable move towards a deflationary framework, underscored by high network usage, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, and the potential for heightened value due to diminishing supply. However, these trends warrant continued analysis and understanding of macroeconomic factors to comprehend their long-term impact and sustainability fully.\n\nMentioned in this article"
