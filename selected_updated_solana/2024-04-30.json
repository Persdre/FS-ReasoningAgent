        "title": "Ethereum and Altcoin Capitulation Approaching Amid \u2018One Final Push\u2019: Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are on the verge of a major market correction.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 800,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) may be making one final move to the upside before a market capitulation.\n\n\u201cIn order for confirmation of [bullishness], you would need to see ETH/Bitcoin get above its bull market support band and then start holding it as support. And if you don\u2019t see that, then I still think it\u2019s just going to be yet another lower high that everyone once again got excited about that ultimately resolved to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also says ETH and alts may be repeating a similar pattern from the last cycle when the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all altcoins minus Ethereum and stablecoins, suffered a severe correction against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, the ETH/Bitcoin capitulation occurred, it finalized after alt/Bitcoin pairs broke down.\n\nSo one thing about this bounce is that alt/Bitcoin pairs have not yet broken down. They haven\u2019t had a weekly close below their range low. So I think that you\u2019re seeing something very similar with alt/Bitcoin pairs that you saw over here [in June 2019], one final rally up to the bull market support band \u2013 it didn\u2019t even make it to the bull market support band back then \u2013 and then it came down. I think you\u2019re seeing something like that happen once again with alt/Bitcoin pairs, one final push before capitulation down to the range lows this summer\u2026\n\nI think this is the final push before the final capitulation into the summer, as we get into potential rate cuts.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Toobit\n\nNew York, NY, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the looming question on investors' minds is whether Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, can withstand the challenges presented by their upcoming halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rewards miners receive for validating transactions, has historically sparked intense speculation and debate within the crypto community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToobit, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, offers insights into the potential implications of the halving for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Despite these changes happening several years ago, the Ethereum halving is not as clean cut as the Bitcoin halving, which may make it confusing for unfamiliar users. Toobit emphasizes the importance of staying updated with these developments, as they are responsible for the shaping of Ethereum's future viability as a leading smart contract platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism promised scalability and sustainability benefits, but it also introduced uncertainties regarding its economic model and network security,\" explains Toobit's spokesperson. \"It's easy to get excited about the new ETH price with each halving event and forget about the bigger picture.

        "content": "Maocat\n\nMAOCAT is a new Ethereum cat memecoin that is quickly gaining popularity.\n\nHong Kong, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The MAOCAT team recently launched the presale phase for their cat-based memecoin, a total debut on the Ethereum blockchain. Feline crypto enthusiasts now have a golden opportunity to join this cool new project.\n\nAfter years of dog-themed memes market domination, MAOCAT wants to shake things up and give cats the spotlight they deserve. Becoming a proud MAOCAT holder is as easy as connecting a hot wallet and purchasing tokens on the presale page.\n\nA Golden Opportunity for Feline Crypto Fans\n\nThe MAOCAT's presale presents a new opportunity for feline crypto enthusiasts. The operation has already managed to sell over half of its planned tokens. This leaves an exciting prospect for investors to purchase the remaining MAOCAT tokens.\n\nIn Phase 1, the starting price of the token is $0.0015, but it will gradually increase to $0.003, phase after phase. With a total supply of 5,000,000,000 tokens, the presale allocation is 60% of this amount.\n\nIn terms of taxation structure, the MAOCAT project has a clear system in place. With a 3% marketing tax, 3% LP tax, and 2% development tax, there are no buy and sell taxes. In terms of rewards, users can benefit from staking rewards, NFT token compensation, governance participation, and transaction fee payments.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the project features four pillars within its ecosystem:\n\nAn NFT collection of 10,000 unique MAO CAT NFTs\n\nAn NFT marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nA decentralized exchange (DEX) called MAO SWAP for DeFi 2.0 solutions\n\nA gaming platform for users to enjoy and earn rewards using $MAO tokens\n\nIn this context, MAO tokens will serve as the primary utility tokens for all these ecosystems. This means that MAO will effectively be the core asset for this community.\n\nHow to Become a Proud MAOCAT Holder\n\nBuying MAO tokens is straightforward. To start, traders must have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. MetaMask is a popular option. Once the wallet is ready, users can access the MAOCAT presale platform through its official website.\n\nOnce on the platform, users must connect their wallets to enable transactions. From there, they can purchase MAOCAT tokens by selecting their desired amount and following the instructions to confirm the transaction.\n\nAs the team's 3-stage roadmap shows, this project is only getting started. In short, the team will continue to launch various features and initiatives to develop the MAOCAT ecosystem further. This includes the launch of the Mao cat game, 10,000 NFTs, and an NFT marketplace on platforms like Opensea.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout MAOCAT\n\nMAOCAT is a new Ethereum cat memecoin that is quickly gaining popularity. Thanks to its ecosystem (featuring four subprojects), MAOCAT is drawing in an increasing number of holders. After a long list of successful dog-based memecoins, the team is launching cats into the spotlight on the Ethereum network.\n\nMAOCAT offers an advanced staking program where participants can earn rewards in $MAO tokens at a dynamic rate over time. This incentivizes holders to keep their tokens and encourages new users to join in and stake their tokens.\n\nThe MAOCAT presale is ongoing and allows anyone with an ERC-20 wallet to participate. By reserving $MAO tokens through the purchase window, crypto fans can become early investors in this promising project.\n\nAnyone wishing to learn more about MAOCAT can easily refer to the project's website and whitepaper. The social pages at the bottom let users stay up-to-date on MAOCAT's news and developments.\n\nX (Twitter) | Telegram | Instagram | YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a press release and does not contain any financial advice.
