        "title": "Altcoins: Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Ethereum Exchange Reserve Plunges, Price To Recover? - CoinGape",
        "content": "In latest developments, the top 10 exchange wallets for altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and Ethereum (ETH) have seen a significant decrease in their holdings since May 27, 2024. To be specific, Shiba Inu\u2019s exchange supply has shrunk by 2.4%, Chainlink by 2.9%, and Ethereum by 8.6%.\n\nMoreover, such reductions in exchange reserves are generally interpreted as bullish indicators by traders. Hence, a potential for price recovery could be witnessed for SHIB, ETH, and LINK. Currently, all these cryptocurrencies are grappling with a downtrend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, the SHIB price was $0.00002175, up by 0.38% on Friday, June 14. This price movement places Shiba Inu at a pivotal point, encountering a significant barrier at $0.000022. If Shiba Inu can surpass this resistance, it may climb to $0.000025, with the possibility of reaching $0.00003.\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could push Shiba Inu down to $0.000021, and it might fall further to $0.00002 if market sentiment deteriorates. Whilst, technical analysis indicates that SHIB might be entering a consolidation phase. The MACD indicator reveals a convergence towards the signal line, hinting at a possible slowdown or reversal in momentum.\n\nWith the MACD line currently beneath the signal line, it signifies weak bullish momentum. Currently, the Shiba Inu RSI is at 37, suggesting a neutral market stance, as SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. However, the RSI is nearing 30, which signals a oversold condition is looming. In the aftermath of such conditions, the price generally rebounds.\n\nMoreover, the reduction in Shiba Inu supply due to decreasing exchange reserve and frequent burns could also catalyze a rebound. On the flip side, most oscillators and moving averages on the daily chart are issuing sell signals. The 50-EMA being above the 20-EMA suggests a potential downward trend.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Coin Bull Run Ahead As SHIB Burn Rate Spikes Further\n\nChainlink (LINK) Outlook\n\nAt press time, Chainlink is traded at $15.32, down by 0.90%. This decline has triggered long liquidations, which account for over 95% of total liquidations, signaling a short-term price decline. However, the diminishing exchange reserve could lead to a rebound in the long term due to a reduced supply.\n\nAs exchange supplies decrease, it often points to accumulation by investors, which can drive prices up as supply dwindles. Moreover, the Chainlink price has sustained a profit of over 14% in the last 30 days despite the recent bearish turn. Hence, it could mirror the momentum for a reversal as the LINK open interest has also surged.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Prospect Following ETF Approval\n\nAccording to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply has seen the most significant reduction among the three cryptocurrencies, dropping by 8.6%. This substantial decrease is viewed positively by bullish traders as it may indicate strong accumulation and potential for future price increases.\n\nRecently, Ethereum\u2019s market narrative is also being shaped by regulatory developments. Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe highlighted a statement from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF might be listed during the summer. This anticipation signals a final correction before a substantial price surge, according to Poppe.\n\nThe approval of Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings is expected to have a profound impact on ETH\u2019s price. It could potentially push the ETH price above $4,000 immediately after the ETF listing. Furthermore, Standard Chartered has projected that this development could even drive Ether\u2019s price to exceed $8,000 by the end of the year. Such optimistic forecasts are underpinned by the expected influx of institutional investment following the ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nAlso Read: Whale Heavily Bags SHIB, ETH, CRV, & Others, What\u2019s Next?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "In a recent budget hearing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler told senators that the US spot ether ETF approvals should be completed by the end of the summer, so where does the market see ether\u2019s price going before and after the launch?\n\nUS spot ether ETF registrations are currently being reviewed at \"a staff level\" and could be approved by the end of summer.\n\nWhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the 19b-4 forms for eight different spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the price of ether surged nearly 20% within several hours of the news.\n\nNow ETF applicants are submitting their S-1s, a registration form which needs to be greenlit by the securities regulator before the funds can start trading on exchanges. The SEC\u2019s Gensler alluded to this process being completed by the end of the summer when speaking to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday.\n\nThe registrations are being reviewed at a \u201cstaff level,\u201d Gensler said, and will still depend on issuers and how responsive they are to any comments they receive. With the ball in the court of ETF issuers, where does the market see the price of ether going before and after the launch?\n\nInvestment management firm VanEck, whose application for a spot ether ETF was one of the eight to receive approval on their 19b-4 form, recently raised their 2030 price target for ether to $22,000. But Katie Talati, head of research at crypto asset management firm Arca, said in an email to Unchained that as of late \u201cether has struggled to establish a strong narrative compared to other layer 1 solutions and the emergence of layer 2 solutions.\u201d\n\nETH\u2019s Potential Price in the Short-term (Pre-launch)\n\nShort-term, this lack of narrative could give ether a boost \u2014 though likely not as high as $22,000 \u2014 as traders were under positioned in the asset when the approval announcement hit.\n\nCoinbase Institutional\u2019s trading desk, \u201chas seen increased buying in ether following the 19b-4 approvals,\u201d said David Duong, Coinbase\u2019s head of institutional research, in an email, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been nearly as aggressive as what we saw in bitcoin before spot bitcoin ETFs launched in the US. That leads us to believe that the market is still under positioned.\u201d\n\nFor bitcoin, it was a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event because there was so much speculation in the lead up to the January approval of the bitcoin ETFs. While in the case of ether, \u201ctraders didn\u2019t sell the news\u2014they bought it,\u201d due to the surprise nature of the approvals, said Glen Goodman, author of \u201cThe Crypto Trader,\u201d in an email to Unchained.\n\nInvestors should still tread with caution, Katie Stockton\u2019s Fairlead Strategies\u2019 June 10 report states that ether has already given back some of its outperformance to bitcoin since the spot ether ETF news. The analysts foresee bitcoin continuing to outperform ether in the near term, describing their analysis of ether\u2019s weekly MACD and stochastics as neutral, adding that they \u201cwill assume a bullish bias once ether clears resistance near $3,925 on a consecutive weekly closing basis.\u201d\n\nWhere ETH Could Go Long-term (Post-launch)\n\nAfter experiencing a pullback post-ETF approval, \u201cbitcoin went on to rally 72% from $39,201 to $67,339, ultimately making a new all-time high price in March of 2024,\u201d said Teddy Fusaro, president at Bitwise, a crypto investment firm that launched a spot bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIf this were to happen, ether would have to rally more than 35% percent from its current price to reach its November 2021 all-time-high of $4,867, Fusaro said.\n\nWhile that may be plausible, Arca\u2019s Katie Talati is not convinced that spot ether ETFs will have as substantial of a long-term impact on ether\u2019s price given that institutional demand is not as high for ether as it is for bitcoin.\n\nIn a previous interview with Unchained, Ophelia Snyder, co-founder and president of crypto ETP provider 21Shares, alluded to this, saying that institutional knowledge of ether pales in comparison to that of bitcoin. 21Shares manages the 21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP (AETH) in Europe as well as a spot bitcoin ETF in the US known as ARKB,\n\nTalati also noted that \u201cthe Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which has $10 billion in assets under management (AUM), will likely also experience consistent outflows and cause daily selling pressure in the Ethereum market.\u201d\n\nA recent report from crypto research firm Kaiko shared a similar sentiment. \u201cOnce the ether ETFs launch, it is reasonable to expect selling pressure on ether from likely outflows or redemptions due to Grayscale\u2019s ETHE, which has been trading at a discount between 6% and 26% over the past three months.\u201d\n\nStill, crypto research firm K33\u2019s senior analyst Vetle Lunde in a recent report anticipated that US spot ether ETFs will attract $4 billion in net inflows in their first five months after launch. In a message to Unchained, Vetle explained that he expects roughly 20% of this $4 billion to come from institutional investors, putting their anticipated AUM at $700-800 million.\n\nWhile some question whether the absence of staking in the ether ETFs will limit investor interest in the funds due to lack of APY (Annual Percentage Yield), Lunde does not see this as an issue, writing that, \u201c99.1% of the AUM in Canadian ether ETFs are held in non-staked products, whereas 97.9% of European AUM sits in non-staked ETPs. This indicates that staking is far from a major issue among ETP investors.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission approved the trading of spot ether ETFs along with their bitcoin counterparts. Using Hong Kong\u2019s market as a point of reference, Crypto Is Macro Now author and economist Noelle Acheson wrote in a recent newsletter that, \u201cwhen/if the ether spot ETFs eventually launch, we should brace ourselves for a disappointing reception.\u201d Acheson bases this prediction on the fact that since these securities began trading in Hong Kong, ether has accounted for less than 15% of the total spot crypto ETF AUM.\n\nPranav Kanade, VanEck\u2019s digital assets alpha fund portfolio manager, shares this assumption that interest in the spot ether ETFs may not be as explosive as it was with bitcoin, writing to Unchained that \u201cthe narratives for bitcoin lined up perfectly, especially in the United States \u2026 the stars don\u2019t seem to be aligning as perfectly as they did with the bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nDespite this, Kanade said that their bullish 2030 price prediction for ether assumes that ETFs will be a catalyst for further interest into the Ethereum network and its varying applications, such as stablecoins and other tokenized financial assets. \u201cThis, in turn, will drive increasing levels of activity on Ethereum or its layer 2 solutions, resulting in a higher amount of ether being burned and a lower overall supply of ether,\u201d Kanade said."
