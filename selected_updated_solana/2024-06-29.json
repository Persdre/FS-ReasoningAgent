        "title": "Solana Up 700% Last Year, Beats Bitcoin and Ethereum Growth - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) has risen by an amazing 700% in the last year, outperforming other cryptocurrencies like as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs per the data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is currently up 702% from the previous year. During the same time, Ethereum eclipsed Bitcoin, thanks to final approvals for token-focused funds. Ethereum has grown by 51% since the beginning of the year, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 45% increase.\n\nAt the time of this writing, SOL is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, having a bullish year till now. Currently, SOL is trading at $145.6, and a year ago it was trading at $20, and at its peak in 2024, it was $200.\n\nSolana Chart\n\nBitcoin\u2019s initial run this year, aided by the launch of the first U.S. spot ETFs in January, saw it hit a new high of $73,798 by March. However, demand and price have subsequently slowed, and Bitcoin\u2019s performance is being overshadowed by increased interest in Ethereum and Solana.\n\nETF excitement is responsible for Solana\u2019s recent rise, especially when exchange-traded fund company VanEck applied for a cryptocurrency-based product.\n\nThe SOL token experienced its largest spike since late May after VanEck filed the necessary paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the new Solana ETF. The boost reached as high as 11%.\n\nThe VanEck Solana Trust is the company\u2019s newest product and the first Solana ETF to be registered in the US. This submission comes after spot Ether (ETH) ETFs were approved by the SEC for the United States on May 23, 2024."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has shown impressive growth this year, surging by almost 800% and outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over the last 12 months, the token has increased by more than 770% according to CoinMarketCap, despite its recent dip to the $141 level.\n\nAlternatively, Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown 100% and 82% in the same time frame, respectively. The development has firmly established SOL alongside both BTC and ETH as the top three cryptocurrencies in the market. That fact has led two firms to file for Spot Solana ETFs this week alone.\n\nSource: Bitcoin.com\n\nAlso Read: Solana June End Prediction: Solana Blinks To Help SOL Cross $180?\n\nSOL Beats Both Bitcoin and Ethereum in Yearly Gains So Far\n\nThroughout 2024 thus far, the US has approved two crypto-based ETFs. That is expected to grow, and Solana has emerged as a favorite to get the investment product, especially as its 800% yearly gains have outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA recent report from GSR Markets has said SOL \u201ccemented itself as a part of crypto\u2019s Big Three.\u201d Additionally, they stated that it is \u201cjust a matter of time before Solana\u201d gets its own ETF. That would place the three assets in rarified air, but looks more and more like it will become reality.\n\nSource: Decrypt\n\nAlso Read: 21Shares Officially Files for Spot Solana ETF\n\nBoth 21Shares and VanEck have filed for the Solana investment product this week. It speaks as much to Sol\u2019s potential as an investment offering, as it does to the shifting regulatory conversion in the country. Moreover, it could speak to an even greater overarching change taking place.\n\nBloomberg recently said that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s performance is starting to be overshadowed by Ether and Solana\u201d as ETF hype grows. Additionally, there is the expectation that the latter could get a much-needed boost from the investment product discussions. If it does get approved, the industry, and the token itself, should be massively helped."

        "title": "What Are Blobs? Improving Ethereum\u2019s Scalability - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOfficially introduced to the Ethereum network on March 13, 2024 in the Dencun upgrade, blobs are a new type of data storage space designed to make rollups cheaper and more efficient.\n\nThe consensus within the Ethereum community is that the best way to scale Ethereum is through rollups, also known as Layer 2s or L2\u2019s, and that the best way to scale rollups is via the introduction of blobs.\n\nBefore blobs, if Ethereum went through a period of congestion, that would also affect the price of transactions on all of its Layer 2s. The introduction of blobs removes the correlation between Ethereum congestion and the cost of transactions on Layer 2s.\n\nWhat are blobs?\n\nBlobs are a new data structure introduced to Ethereum in EIP-4844, more colloquially referred to as \u201cProto-danksharding\u201d. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal\u2014the process by which Ethereum core developers suggest improvements to Ethereum.\n\nProto-danksharding is the precursor to full-danksharding, and sets the foundation for it by introducing blobs. It does so in the same format in which they\u2019ll be used when full-danksharding is implemented, in order to simplify the transition to full-danksharding.\n\nFull-danksharding, or just Danksharding, is an upcoming Ethereum protocol update. It represents what Ethereum core devs believe will be the last step (for now) in making Ethereum a truly scalable blockchain, by making transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nProto-danksharding is a step towards implementing Danksharding\u2014it introduces concepts from Danksharding, such as blobs, to Ethereum. Starting with proto-danksharding and the introduction of blobs, instead of diving straight into full-danksharding, reduces the risk created by introducing drastic changes to a network too quickly.\n\nHow do blobs work?\n\nBefore blobs, when a Layer 2 needed to verify its transactions, it would batch up transactions, and send them to Layer 1 (Ethereum) to verify. The problem was, after the data was verified, it was still stuck on the Ethereum blockchain, taking up blockspace, forever.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis contributes to state bloat, and makes Ethereum more congested\u2014which, in turn, also made Layer 2s more congested.\n\nWith blobs, when the data is sent to the Layer 1 for verification, it\u2019s sent in a blob, short for \u201cBinary Large Object.\u201d Each blob has 4096 field elements and can hold up to 32 bytes of data per field element, which equates to around 75 MB per blob. You can think of it as a giant table of data, or\u2026 a big blob of data.\n\nBlobs improve on the previous method of verifying data in that once data has been verified from a blob, it can be deleted. This way, all the transaction data from every rollup built on top of Ethereum doesn\u2019t have to live permanently on the Ethereum blockchain, taking up valuable space.\n\nBlobs also operate using a separate blob fee market\u2014introducing \u201cblob gas\u201d. Blob gas is independent of gas on Ethereum mainnet, meaning the only things that use blob gas are blobs themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about blobs?\n\nDespite the funny names involved in Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, it\u2019s a serious improvement. Blobs help to make Ethereum less congested, and they make rollups cheaper and faster to use.\n\nThis is because the data that\u2019s verified in blobs can be deleted after use. As such, it doesn\u2019t cause state bloat on Ethereum mainnet. \u201cState bloat\u201d refers to the fact that the more data that is processed by Ethereum, the more data lives permanently on its blockchain\u2014and the more intensive maintaining that network\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d becomes.\n\nSeparating the blob gas market from the existing gas market is also a marked improvement. Because blobs have a separate gas market, congestion on Ethereum doesn\u2019t affect them. In the past, if there was a large event on Ethereum such as a highly anticipated NFT mint, the congestion caused by this event would leak onto Layer 2s and make transactions there more expensive as well. Separating blob gas markets from traditional ethereum gas markets removes the correlation between Ethereum network congestion and Layer 2 transaction costs and speed.\n\nBlobs also make Layer 2s much more profitable. Before blobs, when gas fees on them correlated with Ethereum network congestion, the cost of operation for Layer 2s, and the Dapps built on top of them, were much higher. Lowering transaction fees make it so that builders and operators are able to run complex smart contracts or products at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlobs at work\n\nLooking at onchain data from rollup.wtf, we can see that the majority of Layer 2s with the highest transactions per second are already using blobs.\n\nIn a tweet, Jesse Pollak, founder of Layer 2 network Base, revealed that after Dencun, the cost of a simple swap transaction on Base dropped from $0.31 to $0.0005.\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nHowever, it hasn't been all sunshine and rainblobs. Blobs have been slower than anticipated when it comes to actually posting transactions to Layer 1. Creating a new gas market for blobs succeeded in decoupling Ethereum congestion from rollup transaction costs, but the gas market itself needs some fine-tuning before it\u2019s everything it\u2019s been hyped up to be.\n\nIn one example in June 2024, blob transactions became more expensive than their predecessor\u2013 but that can be seen as a sign that blob adoption is still in progress, and hopefully, as L2\u2019s become more efficient at using blobs, more block builders start accepting blocks that include blobs, and blob capacity increases\u2014 the costs will go down.\n\nVitalik Buterin addressed both of these issues in a March 2023 blog post published shortly after Dencun\u2019s release. In it, Buterin cites two core areas of focus that are needed to continue scaling blobs: \u201cProgressively increasing blob capacity, eventually bringing to life the full vision of data availability sample with 16MB per slot of data space,\u201d and \u201cImproving L2s to make better use of the data space that we have.\u201d\n\nSo while blobs have seen some growing pains, they were for the most part anticipated, and solutions are underway."
