        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNearly all stablecoin transactions are tied to \u201cinorganic activity,\u201d according to payments giant Visa and enterprise blockchain data provider Allium.\n\nThe companies have launched a new data dashboard designed \u201cto remove potential distortions that can arise from inorganic activity and other artificial inflationary practices,\u201d and its adjusted figures reveal upwards of 90% of tracked transactions occur without human involvement.\n\nThe dashboard tracks Tether's eponymous USDT, Circle's USDC, Paxos's USDP, and PayPal's PYUSD. All of them are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and keep cash or cash-like (U.S. treasury bonds) reserves to back their tokens. Visa doesn't attribute the \"inorganic activity\" to any particular stablecoin, but comparing the adjusted and unadjusted figures casts a stark light on just how infrequently humans are the ones initiating stablecoin payments.\n\nFor example, Visa reports that $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed on Sunday, May 5. That's the unadjusted figure. When the data is adjusted to remove so-called inorganic activity, the number plummets to $4.6 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Visa data analysis was conducted, at least in part, in response to a Coin Metrics chart making the rounds on Twitter claiming that stablecoin were catching up with established settlement networks.\n\nIn a blog post last week, Visa's head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, argued that transactions initiated by smart contracts\u2014without any human explicitly involved\u2014aren't directly comparable to the kind of transactions handled by traditional payment processors.\n\n\"For instance, developers can create automated bot programs that perform activities such as stablecoin arbitrage, liquidity provision, and market making, among others,\" he wrote. \"These activities are vital for sustaining the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, the on-chain transactions resulting from interactions with these automated programs don't resemble settlement in the traditional sense.\"\n\nOther notable data points emerged from the analysis. According to Visa, USDC usage has experienced marked growth in the past eight months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn September 2023, USDC was used for 23% of all the stablecoin transactions analyzed by Visa. But by the end of the year, that rate of use had more than doubled, surpassing 50% of all stablecoin transactions\u2014as high as 60% in February\u2014every month since December, according to Visa."

        "content": "Michael Saylor thinks they won\u2019t launch at all, and even some fund issuers think it\u2019s unlikely this year. Meanwhile, other countries are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nThe battle to launch exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum\u2019s spot price in the U.S. is heating up \u2014 and so far, the journey looks similar to Bitcoin\u2019s long and messy road to approval.\n\nOnce again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dragging its heels on offering a definitive answer to the applications already made. A green light matters because it would allow investors to gain exposure to ETH without owning the underlying asset.\n\nGrayscale and Franklin Templeton were both due to receive a response from the SEC in April, but the regulator\u2019s now pushed their deadlines back to June.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock have had similar applications kicked into the long grass as well. VanEck and ARK Invest are due to receive a response later this month, but hopes of approval have been dwindling fast.\n\nWhy? Because there are signs that the regulator believes that Ether is a security, and not a commodity like Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: What\u2019s next for global finance?\n\nA growing dispute\n\nBack in June 2023, speaking in front of the House Financial Services Committee, SEC chair Gary Gensler had refused to say whether he believes ETH is a security.\n\nThe lack of a clear answer had spooked the crypto industry \u2014 especially considering this contradicted earlier guidance made by his predecessor Jay Clayton.\n\nAnd even earlier than that, around the time of The Merge in September 2022, Gensler had hinted that the staking process may fall under securities rules.\n\nEther\u2019s status matters because it determines which organization holds regulatory oversight in the U.S. \u2014 and if it is a security, this could cause big problems for other altcoins.\n\nConsensus recently sued the SEC and leapt to Ethereum\u2019s defense \u2014 arguing the commission\u2019s \u201cunlawful power grab threatens to undermine America\u2019s position as a leader of the next generation of the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Case for #Bitcoin on the Corporate Balance Sheet pic.twitter.com/LcZ4V2nqV0 \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) May 3, 2024\n\nSaylor\u2019s prediction\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin supporter who spearheaded efforts to add hundreds of thousands of BTC to the company\u2019s balance sheet, doesn\u2019t believe that ETFs based on ETH\u2019s spot price will ever see the light of day. Speaking at the annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, he warned:\n\n\u201cSome time this summer, it\u2019ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a cryptoasset security, not a commodity. After that, you\u2019re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano \u2014 everything down the stack \u2014 is just a cryptoasset security unregistered. None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as cryptoassets. [Bitcoin] is the one universal, consensus accepted, institutional-grade cryptoasset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d Michael Saylor\n\nOf course, you could argue that Saylor was bound to say this \u2014 especially considering that he believes BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is technically and ethically sound. Speaking at the Blockchain Economy Istanbul Summit back in July 2022, he had warned that Ether\u2019s continual upgrades \u201cintroduce new attack surfaces\u201d that undermine security and reliability.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe bigger challenge now appears to be that there\u2019s a lack of dialog between the SEC and firms hoping to bring an Ether ETF to market. As Barron\u2019s reported last month, applicants aren\u2019t being given \u201cthe critical feedback needed to finalize their products.\u201d By contrast, BTC ETF issuers had engaged in a \u201crobust back-and-forth\u201d before their funds started trading.\n\nJan van Eck, whose eponymous investment firm is awaiting a verdict from the SEC, candidly told CNBC in April that he believes the application will \u201cprobably be rejected\u201d \u2014 while Jean-Marie Mognetti from CoinShares predicted that no approvals will happen in 2024.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to be paralyzed by regulatory uncertainty, where a lack of clarity on Ether\u2019s status is leaving crypto firms exasperated, other jurisdictions are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nAlthough trading volumes were rather tepid on the first day, it remains significant that Hong Kong has now launched an ETH ETF, amid speculation this could one day open the door to investors from mainland China.\n\nAs S&P Global recently noted, funds based on Ether\u2019s spot price have already been approved in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany \u2014 with some offering additional yield by offering staking returns as well.\n\nWith ETFs in other territories now boasting billions of dollars in assets under management, the U.S. risks falling further and further behind."

        "content": "When Ethereum was conceived in 2013, little did we know that it would become the center of attraction and rally competitors in the crypto space.\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, what about gas fees? Scalability? Network? Competition? Nothing can stop an ETH Maxi from vehemently pushing the narrative of the first-ever smart contract blockchain layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn every crypto ecosystem, some undeterred believers passionately promote their native token or cryptocurrency to the masses. Nonetheless, the limitation of the currency or the presence of a better alternative; these influencers are the mainstay.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom building DeFi to establishing the fortress for Web3, to its transition to Proof of Stake, Ethereum has proven to be a blockchain flexible enough to adapt and perhaps the only true competitor to Bitcoin. Every other chain either measures itself against Ethereum, builds on top of it (as Layer 2 solutions), or claims to be the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d\u2014a classic anecdote for the crypto saga.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, ETH thought leaders will always remain steadfast. So if you\u2019re here looking for the most influential Ethereum influencers to follow and keep an eye on their updates, you\u2019ve come to the right article.\n\nWho Are Crypto Influencers?\n\nWhether you call them Maxis, Thought Leaders, or KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), this group of crypto personalities advocates for everything related to cryptocurrency and the blockchain industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir responsibilities go beyond merely owning a social media account with a substantial number of followers.

Keeping track of influencers provides a glimmer of hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum offers numerous opportunities in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. It is the foundation for other blockchains that leverage its layer to create more sustainable networks, enhancing the overall user experience. While most ETH enthusiasts are open to sharing knowledge, there are a few narcissistic territorial maxis who might be an exception.\n\nBest Ethereum Influencers to Follow on Social Media in 2024\n\nInfluencers wield their influence primarily on social media platforms. Several platforms exist where these influencers keep their followers and members of the crypto community informed about the cryptocurrency market. These platforms include:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter (X)\n\nBitcointalk\n\nReddit\n\nTelegram\n\nDiscord\n\nPodcasts\n\nTikTok\n\nYouTube channels\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong these options, Twitter (X) stands out as the most reliable and easily accessible channel. However, other platforms may require invitations or access, which can be challenging for crypto enthusiasts to obtain. Some platforms also have complex user interfaces that can be difficult to navigate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, how do you identify the Twitter accounts of these influencers? Simply go to Twitter, search for \u201ceth,\u201d and scroll through the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, be cautious\u2014you\u2019ll encounter a maze of Twitter users masquerading as influencers, promoting scam tokens, or building their social media presence for influencer marketing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo simplify your journey through the bustling Ethereum world, I\u2019ve curated an A-list of the top 10 Ethereum influencers to follow.

Just like everything else that exists, there are perks and drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand their influential materials, you must learn to differentiate what works from what doesn\u2019t.\n\nPros\n\nReliable Sources: These influencers are often the most reliable references to turn to when you encounter random news about Ethereum. They commit themselves to being the avenue through which others stay updated on recent events in the space. Spreading false information would only tarnish their reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Up to Date: When Bitcoin ETFs were under consideration by the SEC, those following BTC maximalists were continuously kept informed about the proceedings. Ethereum ETFs have also been hinted to arrive soon. Can you guess where you\u2019ll find this information? Exactly\u2014ETH maximalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Information: Influencers provide real-time updates on various aspects: market volatility, trends, legal challenges, crypto-government conflicts, recent launches, upcoming airdrops, and more. No one reports it better than these maximalists.\n\n\n\nDeep Insights and Content on Cryptocurrency: First, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) are the go-to sources for news, updates, and events. But beyond that, they analyze these developments and share market sentiments through various mediums such as social media posts, YouTube videos, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), and blogs. KOLs engage in fact-based speculations, discussions, and provide expert opinions.\n\nCons\n\nInformation Overload: Someone needs to tell influencers to cut us some slack. There are too many influencers, each sharing their individual opinions. It\u2019s overwhelming to take in and comprehend all the updates, analyses, and news that come in droves. We have too little time to make sense of it all.\n\n\n\nMisinformation: Having influence doesn\u2019t guarantee that their content is always accurate, especially for those who are not part of the Ethereum team. To avoid this, follow reputable sources like Vitalik and steer clear of influential farmers.\n\n\n\nMarket Influence and Bias: Predictions and analyses by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) can sometimes be wrong. KOLs are not supreme beings with the ability to control the market through their thoughts. Instead, they use sentiments to sway their audience. Occasionally, they spread hate or bias toward other opinions or chains, subtly influencing their followers.\n\n\n\n**False Hope:**Being bullish is fine, but delivering doses of \u2018hopium\u2019 to susceptible followers who hang on your every word goes against crypto principles. However, for many ETH maximalists, the hype should remain alive.\n\n\n\nEnd Words\n\nEthereum is the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin and the most actively engaged blockchain in the history of distributed ledgers. This prominence places the pioneer smart contract network at the center of numerous discussions within the crypto space.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing criticisms, making comparisons, and staying updated all require experts who can readily highlight and clarify complex topics. Their insights help followers make informed decisions and take enlightened steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the term \u2018influencer\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply blindly following their investment advice. While influencers play a valuable role, you should never let them entirely dictate your crypto investment decisions. There will always be digital currencies, NFTs to explore, bridges to test, and DeFi projects to consider. But don\u2019t rush into decisions solely because an influencer recommends it. Instead, make your own choices, build a solid rationale, and remember the crypto mantra: DYOR (Do Your Own Research).\n\nFAQs\n\nWho are the best ETH influencers? Vitalik Buterin and every other dedicated Ethereum supporter on social media have everyone\u2019s interests at heart. They are undoubtedly crypto influencers too.\n\n\n\nWill $ETH supersede $BTC? Crypto remains uncertain, leaving room for possibilities. However, $BTC stands strong as the pioneer of crypto, making it challenging for other cryptocurrencies to surpass it.\n\nFrom every perspective, Ethereum\u2019s goal is not to replace Bitcoin but to serve as the decentralized open-source smart contract layer for applications to build upon.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct competition between $BTC and $ETH\u2014only mutual respect (except for the maximalists who might think otherwise).\n\n\n\nWhat impact will the launch of more \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d have on Ethereum? From my viewpoint, it won\u2019t have a significant impact. Ethereum will continue to thrive. The crypto space operates as an open-source collaborative environment.\n\nEthereum will persistently evolve, while other blockchains may create forks. In the end, survival will favor those who adapt.\n\n\n\nWill the growth of other cryptocurrencies affect the future of the Ethereum Blockchain? Ethereum proudly remains the mother of smart contracts. Most ecosystems either build on it, adopt its architecture, or strive to provide better scalability. Therefore, the growth of these projects cannot undermine ETH, as it plays a crucial role in the crypto industry.\n\n\n\n"
