        "title": "Ethereum ETF Launch Date Announced by Top Analyst - U.Today",
        "content": "According to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, Ethereum exchange-traded funds are set to be launched on July 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProspective issuers have been asked to re-submit their final S-1 forms on Wednesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNotably, the launch of Ether ETFs will take place right in the middle of the Bitcoin 2024 Conference.\n\nIt is worth noting that the launch of these products could still be delayed due to last-minute issuers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier today, Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, said that he could not come up with a \"good reason\" for the SEC to further delay the launch of these products, adding that issues are ready.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, the SEC approved 19b-4 filings for various spot Ethereum ETFs back in May in what appeared to be a major U-turn. Just days before the approval, these products were widely expected to be rejected by the SEC.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the level of demand that these products will manage to attract.\n\nFor instance, banking giant JPMorgan has predicted that these products will severely underperform compared to Bitcoin ETFs. However, crypto-native firms of the likes of Gemini expect Ethereum ETFs to be moderately successful.\n\nNotably, Coinbase researchers have forecasted that the launch of Ether ETFs could be either bullish or bearish for crypto markets depending on the amount of inflows.\n\nRegardless of how successful these products are going to be, the launch of the first spot altcoin ETFs would mark a historic shift.\n\nIn the meantime, VanEck and 21Shares have already submitted Solana ETF applications. However, analysts believe that their approval is unlikely to happen this year."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs to coincide with Bitcoin Conference, potentially boosting market attention.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum ETFs are scheduled to begin trading on July 23, as reported by Bloomberg analyst.\n\nBitwise CIO projects $15 billion in inflows for Ethereum ETFs by the end of 2025.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe starting date for spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading in the US is July 23rd, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. He shared on X that the SEC is answering issuers today, asking them to return their final S-1 forms on Wednesday, July 17th.\n\n\u201cAnd then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course,\u201d he added.\n\nUpdate: Nate's instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course! https://t.co/D21FD9Qf94 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 15, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum ETF issuers filed their S-1 forms on July 8th but most of them left the fees out of their forms. According to Balchunas, this is likely a strategy from the asset managers to check how competitive the funds\u2019 fees are, especially BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form is an initial registration required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a security can be publicly traded.\n\nAs highlighted by Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart, this could mean that the Ethereum ETFs will start trading the same week as the Bitcoin Conference, set to happen in Nashville.\n\nThe launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs is a key step for crypto adoption by mainstream investors, as it solidifies the altcoin as a sound asset among institutional investors. An estimate by Bitwise CIO predicts that these investment instruments will capture $15 billion in inflows until the end of 2025, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum ETFs open the door for the approval of exchange-traded funds indexed to other crypto. VanEck and 21Shares both filed their form for the approval of the first spot Solana ETFs in the US on the last week of June."

While top market experts have exhausted their projections regarding the timeline on which the product will launch, ETFStore President Nate Geraci said he sees no reason why the product would not go live this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelcome to spot eth ETF approval week\u2026\n\n\n\nI\u2019m calling it.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t know anything specific, just can\u2019t come up w/ good reason for any further delay at this point.\n\n\n\nIssuers ready for launch. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 14, 2024\n\nAs it stands, prospective Ethereum ETF issuers have come to terms to satisfy the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by making amendments to their respective S-1 registration forms. With compromises already being recorded since spot Bitcoin ETF approval days, the market is not expecting any further delays.\n\nHowever, the concerns of many lie in what will become of the industry should the Ethereum ETF start trading. The conversation rests on its immediate impact on the market in terms of price gains.\n\nWhen the SEC approved 19b-4 filings in May, the update fueled a massive spike in the price of the coin, with a ripple effect on Bitcoin and altcoins more broadly. This rally, though short-lived, might get replayed when Ethereum ETF products start trading.\n\nThe bullish sentiment in price is already creeping in. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum and trading volume are up 4.14% and 34.43% to $3,334.51 and $13,196,383,402, respectively.\n\nBesides price impact, the launch of the Ethereum ETF effectively lifted limitations for other altcoins gunning for similar product acceptance on Wall Street. Already, there are active applications for a Solana ETF from VanEck \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060, and 21Shares has already broken the push for the product with a Bitcoin and Ethereum duopoly.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF trading and potential capital injection might confirm what crypto proponents have been projecting for a while now: fact that there is a subtle demand for mainstream, regulated crypto products."

We\u2019re eagerly awaiting their conclusion."
