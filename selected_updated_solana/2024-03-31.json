        "title": "Here\u2019s When Ethereum and Altcoins Could Start To Outrun Bitcoin, According to Analyst Jason Pizzino - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is detailing when he believes Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins could outpace Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 321,000 YouTube subscribers that the altcoin market is setting up for a massive rally \u2013 with the ETH/BTC pair as its proxy.\n\n\u201cStill seems like the market is building for those mega 37x potential returns for altcoins. [ETH/BTC] is a bit of a proxy for the altcoin pump.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pizzino, if history repeats itself and ETH/BTC behaves the same way it did the last time Bitcoin hit its 2021 cycle peak, traders can expect a breakout of the pair sometime in the coming months. Pizzino\u2019s chart indicates that it could be in May or June.\n\n\u201cThe point here is: [we had a] new Bitcoin all-time high month, the following month was down and then ETH went on a pretty significant run from there.\n\nSo if things are similar to last time, maybe this is the move down because Bitcoin is pushing to new all-time highs, it\u2019s taking the show, then you see another red month here as Bitcoin continues on, and then a reversal here for ETH.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05145 BTC ($3,616) at time of writing.\n\nPizzino goes on to say that the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) will likely go through a similar process.\n\n\u201cSame sort of thing for Solana\u2026\n\nJust looking back at the previous cycle, [Solana was a much] weaker crypto at the time, [it is] now a lot stronger than what it was back then, but you can see also with the Bitcoin new all-time high price around November (2021), it still went lower even against [the] USD at that time, but then that was the time to skyrocket, so we\u2019re in a similar sort of period now where Bitcoin\u2019s gotten into its new all-time high.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $196 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum price predictions for this week say\u2026 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum showcased a bullish market structure on the 12-hour chart.\n\nKey retracement levels have been defended thus far, but a retest can\u2019t be ruled out yet.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] continued to trade within the short-term range. They have a bullish bias on the higher timeframe price charts, and whales were accumulating both assets at a rapid pace.\n\nA recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that this accumulation could continue for some more time. Bitcoin has high amounts of liquidity close by, which could hinder attempts to break out in either direction.\n\nBitcoin saw stalled momentum and buying pressure\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement levels plotted for the rally from $50.5k to $73.7k showed that the 50% retracement level was tested as support in mid-March.\n\nIt saw a decent reaction and Bitcoin was trading at $50k at press time.\n\nYet, the RSI on the 12-hour chart was only at 57, which signaled bullish momentum but not notable strength.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow was at +0.01 and would need to climb above +0.05 to show significant capital inflow.\n\nThe market structure on the 12-hour chart was bullish. A BTC that falls below $60.7 would flip the market structure bearishly.\n\nThe liquidation levels heatmap showed a significant concentration in the $74k-$74.8k zone. To the south, the $60k-$60.7k also has an intense number of liquidation levels.\n\nCloser to current prices, the band of liquidity at $68.2k was also expected to play a role.\n\nA move above $72k is a cause for celebration for Bitcoin bulls, but expect multiple tries before prices break past the $75k region.\n\nEthereum climbs to the LTF resistance \u2014 will it break out soon?\n\nEthereum also saw its momentum stall out over the past two weeks. Its 12-hour RSI showed a reading of 54, which signaled bullishness.\n\nIts market structure was also bullish, and the 78.6% retracement level saw a good reaction from the buyers.\n\nHowever, despite the buying volume in the past ten days, the OBV could not embark on an uptrend. It has sunk almost as low as the January highs, even though the price of ETH is close to 40% higher.\n\nThis lack of demand meant Ethereum bulls could take time to catch their breath before attempting the next rally. At press time, it faced some short-term resistance at $3680.\n\nCoinalyze metrics noted the steep selling pressure in the spot markets in March. The spot CVD trended downward this month and only recently flattened out from the southward spiral.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nThe Open Interest has climbed considerably from the 17th of March. It has risen from $9 billion to $10.31 billion, while Ethereum jumped from $3.2k to $3.6k.\n\nThis outlined some bullish conviction amongst speculators in the Futures market.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market witnessed high volatility this week, evidenced by the narrow consolidation in leading digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum. The neutral candle confirmation formation with long wicks reflects no dominance from buyers or sellers toward these assets. However, a look at 4 hours shows that the ETH price shows a short sideways trend in developing a bullish reversal pattern called an inverted head and shoulder pattern.\n\nAlso Read: Surging Ethereum Whale Transactions Hint At Upcoming ETH Price Rally\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Activity Signals Confidence as Ethereum Tests $3700 Resistance\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap rebounded from its last correction in March\u2019s fourth week as price downfall halted at $3060. This horizontal level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level indicating a healthy retracement phase for Ether to recuperate its bullish momentum.\n\nFurthermore, a positive turnaround uplifted the coin\u2019s market value by 20% to challenge resistance at $3700. Amid the current market uncertainty, the ETH price is wavering below this overhead resistance to currently trade at $3530.\n\nHowever, this consolidation in the 4-hour chart revealed the formation of a bullish reversal pattern called inverted head and shoulder. This chart setup commonly spotted at market bottoms indicates a renewed buying interest among traders.\n\nMoreover, In a recent observation by crypto trader Alicharts, there\u2019s a notable rise in Ethereum whale transactions, suggesting bullish sentiment among key investors despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent price dips.\n\nThis uptick in activity from large stakeholders typically indicates a positive outlook on Ethereum\u2019s value, hinting at a possible price recovery ahead.\n\nDespite the #Ethereum price correction seen over the past few weeks, $ETH whale transactions are on the rise \u2014 a bullish indicator for future #ETH price movements! pic.twitter.com/urMBA8ofAS \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) March 29, 2024\n\nEthereum Bulls Watch for $3700 Signal to Extend Rally\n\nThe Ethereum price must breach the $3700 resistance with a 4-hour candle closing for the head and shoulder pattern to hold true. Doing so will provide buyers with suitable support to prolong its recovery trend to $4300.\n\nOn a contrary note, a breakdown below the support at $3460 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The ETH price above the key EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the near-term trend as bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope wavering around 50% indicates an uncertain market sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.
