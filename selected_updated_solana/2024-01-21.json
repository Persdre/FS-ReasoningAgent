        "content": "TL;DR\n\nCardano\u2019s whale transaction volumes and NFT sales have been notable lately.\n\nADA\u2019s price has recently underperformed compared to ETH, but experts anticipate a potential rally influenced by upcoming events and developments in the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, Cardano whales have settled an average of $13 billion in large daily transactions for the past week. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s figure stood at $5 billion.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum\u2019s $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nCardano has also made progress on the non-fungible token field, with an NFT sales volume of over $7.6 million for the last 30 days. Ethereum might be a leader with approximately $341 million, but this actually represents a 23% decline on a monthly basis.\n\nDespite the aforementioned developments, Cardano\u2019s ADA has performed worse than ETH as of late. The former currently trades at $0.50 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), or a 14% plunge on a weekly scale. ETH is hovering around $2,470 and is down 5% for the same period.\n\nHowever, some experts think ADA could be on the verge of a rally, taking into account the importance of several upcoming events.\n\nDan Gambardello (Founder of Crypto Capital Venture) outlined the Coinbase v. SEC lawsuit as a major catalyst, suggesting that a victory for the company might trigger a \u201cmega altcoin run.\u201d\n\nRecall that the regulator sued the exchange last summer, accusing it of breaching several laws and offering trading services with alleged unregistered securities such as ADA, SOL, MATIC, and more.\n\nThose curious to check other Cardano price predictions can take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "title": "Ethereum Remains the Dominant Blockchain for Developers: Report - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum continues to be the number one blockchain among crypto developers, with more than 70% of new contract codes first deployed on the network, according to the latest report by Electric Capital.\n\nAlso, there has been a spread in the distribution of developers globally, with more crypto devs living outside North America, as opposed to steady growth recorded in regions such as Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nMore Devs Involved in Multi-Chains\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s 2023 Crypto Developer Report revealed that most of the smart contract code launched on the Ethereum network is unique, while 71% of contracts are first deployed on Ethereum, making it the top blockchain choice for developers.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of multi-chain developers expanded in 2023. Based on the report, multi-chain developers grew from three percent in 2015 to 34% in 2023, signaling a growth of over 10x in eight years.\n\nIt is also no surprise to see the cross-pollination of developers across Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Such blockchains include BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and several layer 2 networks. These chains all use the same smart contract logic as Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital, cross-pollination occurs between BNB Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum, with all three chains sharing \u201cat least 30% of their multi-chain deployers with each other.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, BNB shares the largest number of multi-chain devs, with Ethereum at 39%, followed by Polygon at 36% and Arbitrum at 24%, while Avalanche is the lowest at 18%.\n\n40% of Developers Worked on Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023\n\nIn all, a fourth of all blockchain developers deploy either on Ethereum or Bitcoin, with the latter accounting for a larger number of monthly active developers at 7,864 as of December 2023, which was, however, a 25% drop from over 10,400 the previous year,\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, recorded 1,071 monthly active developers, declining 19% from 1,322 in December 2022. Most of the decline came from part-time developers and those working on multi-chains, with the report noting that developers who focused solely on Bitcoin were likely to continue working on the network.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1000 developers have supported Bitcoin since 2017. The highest number of new developers joined the network in 2022, at over 2,700.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transaction volumes skyrocketed in 2023 following the resurgence of Ordinals, only three percent of all Bitcoin developers worked on the project, while 40% were dedicated to Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling solutions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were also over 9,300 monthly active developers working on the top 200 crypto ecosystems by market capitalization as of December 2023. The figure, however, is a 31% reduction from 2022 records.\n\nTotal Number of Blockchain Devs Fell By Almost a Quarter in 2023\n\nAs noted on Electric Capital\u2019s report, monthly active developers dropped 24% to 22,411 in 2023, from 29,611 the previous year, with newcomers less than one year in crypto contributing to a majority of the losses.\n\nMost of these developers with the least tenured experience came into the industry during the bull market and tended to leave during the bear market. The number of newcomers peaked in 2022 at over 90,000 after Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to more than $69,000 and the total market capitalization at nearly $3 trillion in November 2021\n\n\u201cNewcomers who joined in 2022 are the ones who churned and are driving the overall -24% developer loss.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, those who have been in crypto for at least over a year continue to grow and contribute to the ecosystem, with 75% of codes by such developers.\n\nBlockchain developers with more than one year of experience in the industry grew 16% in 2023, while their established colleagues \u2014 people over two years in crypto \u2014 grew 52% in the last five years, reaching an all-time high.\n\nThe report also touched on developer distribution globally, stating that 74% are located outside of North America, while the US lost 14% of its developer share since 2018, controlling only 26% in 2023.\n\nBlockchain developers, however, are growing in Latin America, Western Africa, South Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe, increasing by 20% since 2018."

        "title": "Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Luna Classic (LUNC) - CoinGape",
        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market is experiencing relative stability during the weekend, following a bearish trend earlier in the week. This downturn saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fall from a high of $49,000 to $40,300, marking a 17.85% loss.\n\nThis selling pressure is largely attributed to Grayscale beginning to sell its Bitcoin holdings in response to investors offloading shares of the GBTC ETF. The outflow of $2.2 billion from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and concerns about the Bitcoin ETF being a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event have led most major cryptocurrencies into a correction phase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite this, several industry experts view the current downturn as a natural correction, necessary for the major cryptocurrencies to gather strength for future growth.\n\nOn the Bitcoin weekly time frame chart, there\u2019s a notable struggle to sustain above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, around $42,300. This effort to reclaim 50% of the lost value from the recent downtrend reflects a growing conviction among market bulls and a weakening hold by bears on the asset.\n\nWith a positive outlook for the near future, the following cryptocurrencies Ethereum(ETH), Solana(SOL), and Luna Classic (LUNC) can offer suitable pullback opportunities to traders.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Price Nearing a 22% Breakout Rally\n\nAmid the current downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recently hit a local high of $2700 before starting a correction phase this week. The price now stands at $2487, reflecting a loss of 8.35% over the past two weeks.\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that this correction is contained within two converging trendlines, forming what appears to be a pennant pattern. If this pattern proves accurate, it suggests that the current correction phase could be a consolidation period, allowing buyers to gather strength for a potential upward movement.\n\nAdding to this bullish perspective is a notable observation by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, regarding Ethereum\u2019s staking activity. On January 18th, he highlighted in a tweet that 24% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now staked, with only 11% available on exchanges. Contrary to expectations of significant unstaking post the Shapella upgrade, the staking rate continues to rise.\n\nGiven these technical and on-chain developments, the ETH price might break through the pennant\u2019s upper trendline, indicating an end to the correction phase. This breakout could potentially spark a rally of around 22%, pushing the price beyond the $3000 mark..\n\nNew Found Support Bolsters Solana (SOL) Price Rally to $125, But There\u2019s More\n\nSolana, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has displayed impressive resilience amid the broader market\u2019s downturn, holding steadily above the crucial $85 mark. This level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, signaling that buyers are maintaining a strong foothold.\n\nAs highlighted in a recent analysis by Coingape, the Solana price correction is shaping the \u2018handle\u2019 of a larger Cup-and-Handle pattern, a bullish chart formation. This suggests that the ongoing retracement could rejuvenate the bullish momentum, potentially driving the SOL price up by 35% to breach the critical neckline resistance at $125.\n\nA successful breakout from this neckline, particularly if backed by a daily candle closing above it, would be a robust indication of a trend reversal. Such a development could set the Solana price on a path towards a significant target of $255.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) Price Wavering In a Mark-or-Break Scenario\n\nThe Terra Classic (LUNC) price has been in a corrective phase since December 2023, with its price dropping from a high of $0.00028 to its current value of $0.000118, indicating a substantial 60% loss.\n\nThe coin found crucial support at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.0000102, changing its course from a downward trend to sideways. The daily chart shows that this consolidation has evolved into a symmetrical triangle pattern, typically a sign of the continuation of the existing trend.\n\nA breakdown below this triangle\u2019s lower support trendline might lead to further price declines for LUNC, potentially towards $0.0000975 and then $0.0000842. Alternatively, a rare upside break from this pattern could signal an attempt by buyers to regain bullish momentum.\n\nIf buyers manage a breakout, they could be looking at an upward rally towards resistance levels at $0.000147, followed by $0.000173, providing a much-needed boost to reverse the bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "What Are Parallelized EVMs? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, allowing multiple transactions to be executed at the same time rather than sequentially.\n\nThe blockchain landscape is constantly evolving to overcome limitations and unlock new possibilities. One of the latest innovations to address scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem is Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs).\n\nRead on to learn about parallelized EVMs and the potential impact of parallelization on Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nWhat Are Parallelized EVMs?\n\nTo understand parallelized EVMs, let\u2019s first grasp the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe EVM allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. It provides the infrastructure vital to all transactions happening on the blockchain. The growing adoption of Ether and other Ethereum-based tokens strains the EVM, leading to calls for its scaling.\n\nOne intervention that\u2019s gaining traction is parallelized EVMs.\n\nParallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency by allowing multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nImagine them as supercharged versions of their predecessor capable of handling multiple transactions together. This approach is crucial in tackling the blockchain trilemma as it significantly reduces latency, boosting transaction throughput.\n\nSome of the front runners in the PEVM adoption are the Sei network, Neon, and Monad. The Sei Network went live in August 2023, attracting roughly 29,000 active users. Neon is also active and working on integrating Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) into the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monard is yet to launch despite being production-ready.\n\nHow Do Parallelized EVMs Work?\n\nPEVMs leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve timely and scalable transactions.\n\nUnlike the typical EVMs that handle transactions back-to-back, PEVMs split transactions into smaller, independent tasks that can be tackled simultaneously. This means setting up different points for the concurrent handling of multiple trades.\n\nThere are many approaches to parallel processing, but two popular ones stand out:\n\nSharding : Imagine dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, self-contained shards, each with its own EVM. Transactions are then distributed across these shards, allowing for independent and simultaneous processing.\n\nRollups: These batch transactions off the main Ethereum chain, processing them on a separate layer, and then re-submitting them to the mainnet for verification. This significantly reduces the burden on the main Ethereum network, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Parallelized EVMs on Ethereum\n\nPEVMs can significantly reduce transaction times and fees by removing network bottlenecks, making Ethereum more user-friendly and accessible to developers and users alike.\n\nWith PEVMs paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions, Ethereum can potentially handle a much larger volume of activity. This opens the door to widespread adoption of dApps and DeFi, bringing the power of blockchain to a broader audience.\n\nThe increased processing power of PEVMs could unleash a wave of more complex and resource-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on Ethereum. Applications that might have previously been impractical on the blockchain could become feasible.\n\nAdditionally, making improvements on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet could significantly impact other Ethereum layers. L2 scaling solutions could gain more attention, leading to further development and adoption among users.\n\nPEVMs, however, also present a possible downside. The technical complexity required to implement parallelized EVMs might lead to centralization if only a few big players can implement it. They could also present backward compatibility and transition challenges to existing smart contracts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Parallelized EVMs\n\nPEVMs could hold so much promise for crypto enthusiasts. But like any technology, it could have its drawbacks too.\n\nPros\n\nReduced transaction latency: Devolving transaction handling to many units hastens their confirmation. Users will no longer have to endure lengthy completion times due to network clogging.\n\nLower transaction fees: PEVMs streamline transactions, eliminating the need to pay more for prioritized exchanges, which makes transaction fees more affordable.\n\nEnhanced Interoperability: PEVM projects such as Neon are working on bringing Ethereum dApps to Solana. Such initiatives will make it easy for users to interact with their peers on different networks without migrating to their platforms.\n\nCons\n\nIncreased complexity: Implementing and maintaining robust PEVMs can be technically demanding. As such, developers and users may face a steep learning curve.\n\nPotential security risks: Parallel processing introduces new synchronization and coordination challenges, increasing the likelihood of bugs and errors with improper implementation\n\nFinal Word\n\nParallelized EVMs are the latest attempt at achieving Ethereum scalability. By introducing parallel processing capabilities, PEVMs open the doors to various applications, from real-time financial transactions to seamless cross-chain exchanges. However, these novel projects require meticulous development and rigorous security edits to ensure stability."
