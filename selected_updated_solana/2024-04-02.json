This could lead to additional risks as these providers will try to maximize rewards by restaking multiple times to attract more users. \"We believe what matters will be the risk-adjusted rewards and not absolute rewards, but it may be difficult to have transparency on that. This could lead to additional risks as LRT DAOs are incentivized to maximally restake multiple times to remain competitive.\""

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has taken to the X social media platform to revisit his post about layer-3 scaling solutions amid intensifying debates within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin has noted that these solutions \"don't magically improve throughput,\" but they can still be used for cost saving. That said, there are more efficient ways of cutting costs compared to layer-3s, according to Buterin.\n\nIn his article, which was published a year and a half ago, Buterin singled out three main visions for layer-3s: customized functionality for different use cases, customized scaling in various forms, and weakly-trusted scaling in the form of validiums, which are significantly cheaper compared to rollup but offer better security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin acknowledged that all of these three visions were \"reasonable.\" He was skeptical of a three-layer scaling architecture with the same scaling scheme, but the Ethereum co-founder also added that a third layer could work if it has a different purpose. \"Validiums on top of rollups do make sense, even if they're not certain to be the long-term best way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nThe debate surrounding layer-3s\n\nButerin's recent comment came after some prominent community members started debating the viability of layer-3 solutions.\n\nMert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO at Helius, recently opined that L3s were basically \"centralized servers settling on other centralized servers.\" \"The audacity some of you have to call Solana centralized for YEARS just to use literal web servers settling on other centralized web servers is absolutely wild,\" he added.\n\nUniswap CEO Hayden Adams was quick to criticize him, arguing that the Solana community should refrain from posting \"arrogant takes on scaling.\""

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Stay Bullish in April? Historical Data Says Yes - CoinGape",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market entered April on a bearish note with leading digital asset Bitcoin showcasing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. The supply pressure spread across the market tumbled the top altcoins like Ethereum which recorded a 5.7% drop. This downturn breaks the support of week-long consolidation, indicating coin holders may witness a prolonged correction.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Price Prediction: BTC Sheds 2%, ADA & DOGE Drop 5% Amid Pre-Halving Uncertainty\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Faces Key Support Challenge Amid Emerging Bearish Pattern\n\nAmid the recent market consolidation, the Ethereum price wavered in a narrow range between the horizontal level of $3675 and $3445. The price rejection from both sides indicated a clear dominance from bulls and bears toward the asset.\n\nHowever, a deeper analysis of the 4-hour time frame chart showcased the price developing a bearish reversal pattern called double top. The chart setup is commonly spotted at the market top, bolstering a notable correction in the near future.\n\nThus, with an intraday loss of 5.77%, the ETH price gave a bearish breakdown from the neckline support of $3444. Sustaining this breakdown will intensify supply pressure and plunge the altcoin to $3250 or $3057, coinciding with the 38.2% and 50% retracement levels respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Skywards Proposes To Add Ethena\u2019s sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nEthereum Eyes $4500 Target in April Amid Historical Bullish Trends\n\nLooking at the historical data, Ethereum has shown predominantly positive behavior in April, with high returns in five out of the eight years listed. Notable surges in 2017 (+67.77%), 2018 (+70.29%), and 2020 (+55.04%) highlight this pattern, contributing to an impressive average April return of +23.66%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are exceptions, like in 2016 and 2022, when there were significant declines.\n\nAnyhow, if we consider the average return for Ethereum in April, the buyers may drive the asset to a high of $4500 by the end of the month.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBB Indicator: The converging bands of the Bollinger band indicator reflect increasing volatility in this asset.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) lines reflects an active correction trend in play.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price falls for a second consecutive day as bears ignite $91.91 million of liquidated positions.\n\nPast gains during the year\u2019s second quarter can be a positive amid uncertainty in SEC's Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin explains key steps for \"The Purge\" on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nDaily digest market movers: liquidations, historical Q2 gains, and The Purge\n\nEthereum's chances of seeing a significant price boost face uncertainty as the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to show any positive sign of approving applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. As a result, much of its price movements in the past months have largely been due to its high correlation with Bitcoin rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin shed almost 6% of its value, triggering similar losses in Ethereum, which has seen more than a 6.7% decline. Losses in the two largest cryptocurrencies saw over $500.6 million liquidated from the entire crypto market in the past 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $7.48 million. The total ETH liquidations sit at $91.91 million, with long positions accounting for $75.1 million.\n\nHowever, historical records show Ethereum may still have a positive second quarter despite the downbeat start. A chart by crypto analyst @ali_charts on X shows Ethereum's Q2 results have always been positive except in 2022, when it recorded a 67.34% loss. According to the charts, ETH's Q2 historical performance has an average of 66.59% and a median of 15.29% in gains.\n\nEthereum returns in Q2 chart\n\nAlthough, he also noted that the \"high probability\" of the SEC delaying approval for a spot Ethereum ETF can cause \"turbulence in the market.\" On the contrary, a green light from the SEC would give Ethereum more institutional backing and exposure to a large number of retail traders, which may cause a rally in its price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided insights that indicate long-term progress for the cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. On Monday, he highlighted in a blog post that a lesser-known Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the EIP-6780, was introduced during the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. He mentioned that EIP-6780 is a huge part of what he terms \"The Purge.\"\n\nThe Purge would help \"slim down Ethereum and clear technical debt,\" said Buterin. In essence, it would shift workload from the main chain, reducing the computational and technical resources of running an Ethereum node while boosting decentralization and security in the process, Buterin said.\n\nIn other news, Vitalik Buterin reposted on Tuesday a former blog post he wrote squashing Layer 3s that serve the same purpose as L2s. He mentioned that L3s only make sense if they serve a different scaling purpose from an L2.\n\nAlso read: Vitalik Buterin announces next step in simplifying Ethereum protocol, ushers in the Purge\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH could fall below $3,000\n\nIn an analysis on Monday, @ali_charts said in an X post that Ethereum could crash to $2,800 if it breached the $3,400 support level. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,362.1. However, another X user noted a strong historical bidding at the $3,200-$3,000 area.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis aligns with earlier predictions by FXStreet analyst Akash Girimath, who stated that Ethereum's price could sweep the range low at $3,054 if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity run."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Prediction: Bitcoin $110,000, Ethereum $6,000 and O2T $100 Before Q4 2024 - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "Dubai, UAE, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As we navigate through the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, the horizon is bright with predictions of substantial growth for leading tokens. Among these, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the innovative newcomer Option2Trade (O2T) are set to experience remarkable surges in their value. With industry experts forecasting Bitcoin to hit $110,000, Ethereum to reach $6,000, and O2T to skyrocket to $100 before the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation. This article delves into the factors behind these bold predictions and what they mean for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Trailblazer's Trajectory to $110,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) , the original cryptocurrency, has always been a bellwether for the market. Its journey from a novel idea to a global financial phenomenon is nothing short of spectacular. The prediction of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $110,000 is rooted in its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Institutional investment, the halving events that reduce the supply of Bitcoin over time, and increasing global economic uncertainties all contribute to its bullish outlook. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to position itself as digital gold, its trajectory towards $110,000 seems not only plausible but inevitable.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Setting the Stage for $6,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) has carved its niche as the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, contributing significantly to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), promises improved scalability, security, and sustainability. These enhancements, coupled with the ongoing development within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, provide a solid foundation for ETH to climb to $6,000. As more developers and enterprises adopt its technology, Ethereum's influence and value are expected to soar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): The Dark Horse Racing to $100\n\nOption2Trade (O2T) emerges as the dark horse in the crypto race, with predictions placing its value at an astonishing $100 before Q4 2024. This A.I-driven trading platform distinguishes itself by democratizing access to sophisticated trading strategies and market insights, traditionally reserved for the realm of high-frequency trading firms and hedge funds. By leveraging artificial intelligence, O2T can analyze market data in real-time, predict trends, and execute trades with precision, offering an unprecedented advantage to individual investors. The potential of A.I in transforming the trading landscape, combined with O2T's innovative approach, sets the stage for its meteoric rise to $100.\n\nDriving Factors Behind the Predictions\n\nTechnological Advancements: For all three cryptocurrencies, continuous technological innovation is a key driver of their predicted price increases. BTC's enhancements in scalability, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) transition to Ethereum 2.0, and O2T's application of A.I in trading are pivotal developments.\n\nAdoption and Integration: The growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by institutions and their integration into traditional finance, along with O2T's potential to attract a new demographic of traders, contribute significantly to their bullish forecasts.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Sentiment: The cyclical nature of the crypto market, historical trends, and current investor sentiment play crucial roles in shaping these price predictions. The anticipation of increased demand against a backdrop of limited supply, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) , underpins these optimistic valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is poised for significant growth, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Option2Trade (O2T) leading the charge. As we look towards Q4 2024, the predictions of BTC reaching $110,000, Ethereum (ETH) climbing to $6,000, and O2T soaring to $100 reflect not just speculative optimism but a belief in the fundamental value and potential of these digital assets. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming months present an unparalleled opportunity to be part of a financial revolution that continues to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale:\n\n\n\nUse promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonus\n\nVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\n\n\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\n\n\nhttps://t.me/O2TOfficial\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
