        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are watching the performance of major coins like Ethereum (ETH) and their potential impact on the broader market. One coin that is in the spotlight is Shiba Inu (SHIB). With Ethereum\u2019s price on the rise, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: how high can Shiba Inu go when Ethereum hits $20,000?\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Current Market Performance\n\nIn recent days, SHIB has gained momentum, reaching a low of $0.00002369 and a high of $0.00002577 in the past 24 hours. Currently, SHIB is trading with an 8% surge in its overall performance during this period.\n\nAlso read: Can Solana (SOL) Breach $260 And Hit New ATH in June?\n\nHowever, the meme coin has been down by 10.3% in the last seven days. Despite this temporary setback, SHIB enthusiasts remain confident in the coin\u2019s prospects in the current bull market.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Potential Value with Ethereum at $20,000\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is trading at $3,813, reflecting 30-day gains exceeding 20.3%. For ETH to reach the $20,000 threshold, it would need to increase by 427%.\n\nIf Shiba Inu were to mirror Ethereum\u2019s growth and achieve a 427% increase from its current price, its value could skyrocket to $0.0001282. This price level would be a new all-time high for Shiba Inu, breaching its previous ATH of $0.00008845.\n\nAlso read: Ripple: How Many XRP You Need To Make $5 Million If Price Hits $2?\n\nThe Correlation Between Ethereum and SHIB\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock stats, SHIB has a 69% correlation with the price of ETH, indicating that there is a 69% chance that SHIB will follow ETH if it rises to $20,000.\n\nThis strong correlation suggests that Shiba Inu\u2019s price is heavily influenced by the performance of Ethereum, and a significant surge in ETH\u2019s value could have a profound impact on SHIB\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Poised to Hit $0.0001 in June, Says Leading Analyst"

        "content": "Ethereum price has been in consolidation for the past few weeks as the market prepares for an S-1 application approval. Ethereum price is currently trading at $3,787, a 0.6% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin broke above $70,000 once more after more than a month of trending below this crucial level and continues its journey to try and break an all-time high.\n\nETH/BTC Price Analysis: Ethereum Price Succumbs to Bitcoin Rally, Can ETH Bounce Back?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH price against Bitcoin witnessed some downward pressure as Bitcoin bulls pushed its price above $70,000 for the first time in the last 30 days. The majority of cryptocurrencies shed some value against BTC, and Ethereum was not left out.\n\nThe price of Ethereum broke downward from the consolidation zone and is headed toward the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around 0.052 BTC. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, this retracement level may act as a zone of support a bounce back higher toward the 27% Fibonacci extension level around 0.06 BTC.\n\nOn the way up, ETH price may encounter resistance around 0.057 BTC, and $0.058 BTC. Conversely, the support structure around 0.052 BTC may prevent the price of ETH from falling lower.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price just broke out of a descending triangle in a classic textbook breakout and retest pattern. BTC price may move higher, with a profit target for this kind of setup anywhere around $74,000. This would establish a new all-time high price for the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin price may find some overhead resistance around $72,200 and $74,000, but on the flip side, a key support level around $67,000 may help keep the price up.\n\nETH/BTC Price Future Outlook\n\nAs the Ethereum community awaits S-1 application approval, the Bitcoin community continues to spearhead mass adoption for the number one crypto. El Salvador, the \u2018Bitcoin State\u2019 now owns 5,660 BTC worth over $402 million, and is still accumulating.\n\nMoreover, the University of Austin, a private Texas institution, will now accept Bitcoin for tuition and create a long-term Bitcoin fund.\n\nMeanwhile, liquid staking and restaking on Ethereum is only gearing up, and much more liquidity is about to hit the ecosystem, a phenomenon that could pump the price of Ethereum even higher. When including liquid staking, Ethereum mainnet TVL came within 2% of its ATH recently\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto community is optimistic about an S-1 Form approval because BlackRock submitted it. The firm has a clean history of only wins when it comes to ETF applications and the Ethereum community is banking on this to pump ETH price to $10,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.
