        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more \u2018Cypherpunk\u2019 hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "ZkSync, a layer-2 blockchain developed by provider Matter Labs and focused on scalability and privacy, has surpassed the Ethereum mainnet for the first time in terms of number of transactions executed.\n\nIn the last 30 days, Zksync has recorded a total of 34.7 million transactions compared to Ethereum\u2019s 34.2 million.\n\nThis is mainly due to the new trend of inscriptions, which after targeting the Bitcoin network, is now expanding within the EVM chains sector.\n\nWe will see if the attention on this type of digital products will remain high even in 2024.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nZkSync, a privacy and scalability-focused rollup, outperforms the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the trend of inscriptions\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup ZkSync, which focuses its efforts on optimizing scalability and privacy, has managed to outperform the Ethereum blockchain, which it relies on as a second-layer solution.\n\nIn the last 30 days, according to L2Beat data, there have been a total of 34.7 million transactions on ZkSync, while on its main network there have been 34.2 million transactions, resulting in a positive difference of approximately half a million transactions.\n\nWith this record, L2 ranks first in the EVM network ranking that has recently recorded the most tx, ahead of competitors Arbitrum, Optimism, DyDx v3, Base, and ImmutableX.\n\n\n\nThese data are justified by the recent introduction and diffusion of \u201cinscriptions\u201d, which is a metadata registration feature originating from Bitcoin, on all networks that support the Ethereum virtual machine, including the vast Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nRegistrations allow you to obtain alternative NFT to the classic resources generated through smart contracts, adding information such as text, images, videos, and even additional code within the ID of a transaction, all without losing the advantages of privacy and security.\n\nThis, although it may seem more cumbersome and sometimes even obsolete, allows you to save fees when it comes to including complex data within a smart contract and therefore is preferred by developers and users.\n\nThe data from L2Beat shows that the zkSync blockchain recorded its largest increase in monthly transactions on December 16th.\n\nIt was then that the synchronization registration was launched on the network and accounted for 4.6 million out of the 5.3 million transactions on that day alone, according to Dune\u2019s data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nIt is rare for an L2 network to surpass its main network in on-chain metrics, but given the interest and development that has been revolving within the Ethereum rollup sector lately, and the increasingly captivating narrative of inscriptions, it is possible that in the future these opportunities will become more frequent.\n\nThe ZkSync Cryptographic Ecosystem\n\nThis is not the first time that the layer-2 blockchain Zksync has made headlines, having become the protagonist of several records in the last year, thanks above all to a growing cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup solution was launched in March and has immediately succeeded in scaling the Ethereum mainnet, without compromising the security and privacy of the infrastructure.\n\nIn a short time, it has established itself as one of the leading players in the EVM chain sector, reaching a significantly high Total Value Locked.\n\nSpecifically, as of today ZkSync has a TVL of 581 million dollars, second only to Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s optimistic rollup versions, which have locked values exceeding one billion dollars, and to competitors Metis and Base.\n\nIt is not excluded that the cryptographic solution of Matter Labs will be able to further climb the rankings in the coming months, reaching the top 3 of the most used L2s in the world, especially if a gas token is launched to support its growth.\n\nLooking closer at the composition of this blockchain, we see that the protocols that have contributed the most to its growth are mostly DEX, which allow on-chain cryptocurrency exchange through an AMM (Automated Market Maker) platform.\n\nAmong these, the favorites of DeFi users have been ZKSwap, SyncSwap, Mute.io, Maverick, Velocore, Space.Fi, IziSwap, Pancakeswap, and ZkSwap Finance.\n\nOverall, DEXs on Zksync encompass the majority of TVL managed on the network, channeled into a multitude of decentralized pools that allow for the free exchange of cryptographic resources.\n\nThe category that has had the most impact on the success of ZkSync is the Lending platforms such as Reactor Fusion, Zero Lend, and ZkLend.\n\nFinally, we find decentralized applications for derivative trading such as Derivio, Holdstation, Satori, Rollup Finance, and Fulcrom.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to consider the boost of on-chain activities that has been given thanks to the narrative of crypto airdrops, which have encouraged Ethereum rollup users to prefer this blockchain precisely because of the possibility of a reward for its early adopters.\n\nWith $458 million raised in funding from external investors, Zksync promises to carry out one of the largest airdrops in the history of the blockchain world.\n\nThis factor, together with the new trend of inscriptions, could bring the L2 network to another level, where imagination still cannot reach."
