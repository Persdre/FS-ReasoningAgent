        "content": "Sun 23 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nAnalysts from Pantera Capital, Franklin Bi, Cosmo Jiang, and Eric Wallach, have recently presented Solana as a real threat to Ethereum. Thanks to its monolithic architecture, Solana is on the verge of establishing itself as a leading blockchain, capable of capturing a significant share of the market dominated by Ethereum.\n\nSolana: The \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d Activated\n\nSolana positions itself as a serious \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d, thanks to a monolithic architecture that recalls the integrated approach of Apple with macOS.\n\nAccording to Pantera Capital, this design gives Solana notable advantages: a seamless user experience, accelerated innovation, and enhanced security.\n\nThese characteristics make Solana particularly attractive to developers, the cornerstone of any blockchain\u2019s success.\n\nThe NFT deposit platform DRiP, for example, benefits from Solana\u2019s capabilities to send millions of NFTs at reduced fees, demonstrating the network\u2019s technological superiority.\n\nPantera also highlights the versatility of Solana, issuer of the SOL crypto, capable of supporting various use cases challenging to implement on modular blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nProjects such as Hivemapper and Phoenix show how Solana\u2019s monolithic architecture allows for the development of innovative applications.\n\nAdditionally, Franklin Templeton had already highlighted Solana\u2019s advanced technology, describing it as ideal for the next waves of crypto adoption.\n\nAs a result, Solana is emerging as a major player ready to reshape the landscape of blockchain and crypto.\n\nGrowth of Solana: The Numbers Speak for Themselves\n\nThe rise of Solana is not limited to technological promises. Solana\u2019s fundamentals show impressive growth, consolidating the bullish argument.\n\nThe number of unique active addresses on the network has increased from 14,000 in October 2020 to nearly 1.34 million recently. At the same time, Solana\u2019s priority fees have exploded, reaching a historic high of over $60 million in March 2024, signaling growing demand.\n\nThe trading volume on Solana\u2019s decentralized platforms and the record number of crypto launches bolster this momentum. Solana has even established itself as the preferred platform for retail crypto investors and meme traders, surpassing Ethereum in NFT volume.\n\nThese indicators show that Solana is not just a theoretical competitor but an expanding player ready to capture a significant share of the crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

While Bitcoin shows signs of weakness with substantial capital outflows from US-based ETFs, Ethereum demonstrates impressive stability. This dynamic could well herald a major turning point for the altcoin market.\n\nEthereum stands out for its resilience\n\nAs the crypto market undergoes a bearish phase, Ethereum stands out with notable resilience.

Similarly, Bitcoin ETFs face massive outflows. Conversely, Ethereum appears to be gaining renewed confidence, potentially setting the stage for a rise in altcoins.\n\nAn imminent rise in altcoins\n\nAccording to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum\u2019s resilience could herald a new era for altcoins. The renowned analyst highlights that the ETH/BTC pair, which has recently shown signs of strength, could trigger a significant rise in altcoins after more than two and a half years of a downtrend. Van de Poppe believes that as long as the ETH/BTC pair holds above the key level of 0.05, a trend reversal is possible. This analysis is based on on-chain data revealing increased accumulation of Ethereum by whales, contrasting with Bitcoin liquidations. This technical signal indicates that Ethereum\u2019s crypto price could climb exponentially against the US dollar, driving positive dynamics for the entire altcoin market.\n\nInstitutional interest in cryptos other than Bitcoin continues to grow, as evidenced by the imminent launch of Solana\u2019s exchange-traded product (ETP) in Canada. This trend reflects a diversification of institutional investment portfolios, once largely dominated by Bitcoin, towards alternative cryptos with attractive growth prospects.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance, measured in terms of relative market share, is also poised for a major reversal. This outlook could favor a rotation of investor liquidity towards altcoins and thus amplify their performance. towards altcoins and amplify their performance.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
