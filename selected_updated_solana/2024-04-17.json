        "content": "In a surprising shift within the cryptocurrency investment landscape, former Goldman Sachs executive and macro guru Raoul Pal has revealed a substantial reallocation of his digital asset portfolio, favoring Solana SOL/USD over other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Pal, during a conversation on the Bankless YouTube channel, disclosed that roughly 80% of his crypto investments are now in Solana, The Daily Hodl reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe macroeconomic expert has replaced his Ethereum holdings with high-end art NFTs and has also invested in Exponential Age Asset Management, a digital assets-focused fund. \"I am 80% SOL. All of my ETH is now NFTs (non-fungible tokens), I have been buying high-end art NFTs.\n\n\u201cAnd I have 1% in stupid s**t like dogwifhat, Dogecoin and Bonk. Got all of those. But that's 1%\u2026 just to be clear I've got like in all of memecoins and everything else, 1% of my portfolio. I am 80% Solana.\"\n\nHe justified his heavy investment in Solana by referring to the Solana/Ethereum chart\u2019s performance in 2022, which led him to go \u201call in\u201d on Solana, paralleling his earlier decision to invest heavily in Ethereum in September 2020.\n\nSee Also: Will Bitcoin Slump To $20K Amid Increasing Middle East Tensions? Peter Schiff Doesn\u2019t Rule Out Possibilit\n\nWhy It Matters: Pal\u2019s strategic shift to Solana comes at a time when the cryptocurrency is making significant updates to address network issues. on Monday, Solana launched a mainnet beta update to manage network congestion, which was partly due to the high demand for Solana block space from soaring meme coin transactions.\n\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency market has seen a growing interest in meme coins, as highlighted by researcher TradeTheFlow. His thesis suggests that meme coins reflect a societal shift towards high-risk, high-reward investment strategies and are not just a passing trend.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum ecosystem has faced skepticism from some market participants. A Bitcoin trader and advocate, Fred Krueger, expressed a pessimistic outlook for Ethereum, indicating that it might be losing its market position.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Markets Tumble Following Iran\u2019s Drone Attack Against Israel, Investor Warns Of Continued Selloff\n\nImage via Shutterstock"

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Just Go Buy Ethereum Or Bitcoin Instead Of Marathon Digital: 'Let's Not Fool Around' - Benzinga",
        "content": "In a recent episode of \u201cMad Money,\u201d host Jim Cramer advised against investing in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. MARA and instead recommended Bitcoin BTC/USD or Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: Cramer, in his \u201cLightning Round\u201d segment, discouraged viewers from purchasing Marathon Digital, a company involved in Bitcoin mining, reported CNBC. He suggested that investors consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as alternatives.\n\n\"If you want to own Marathon Digital, just go buy either Ethereum or buy Bitcoin, ok. Let's not fool around,\" Cramer said.\n\nMarathon Digital\u2019s stock has experienced a tumultuous period, with its value dropping by over 20% in the past month. This decline is attributed to the overall volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSee Also: NFLX, AMC,UAL, WISA, TSLA: Top Trending Stocks Today\n\nWhy It Matters: Cramer\u2019s advice aligns with the current state of the crypto market. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s $62,000 support level. Failure to maintain this level could shift focus to the next significant demand area, approximately $51,500. Conversely, a climb back above $66,250 could significantly boost the chances of a resurgence in the market.\n\nDespite concerns about the crypto market, Wall Street experts remain confident in the bull market\u2018s continuation. They cite a robust U.S. economy and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) as key drivers.\n\nOn the broader market front, Cramer has also outlined potential factors that could lead to further market decline, advising investors to be cautious about their buying and selling decisions. His recent advice regarding Marathon Digital is in line with his cautious approach to the current market conditions.\n\nPrice Action: While Marathon Digital Holdings closed at $14.63 on Wednesday, marking a modest 0.21% increase, the stock has experienced a significant decline of 36.20% year to date. In contrast, Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,562, showing a 0.48% increase in the last 24 hours and a notable 39.37% gain year to date. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading at $3,000, with a 0.61% increase in the past 24 hours and a solid 27.54% gain year to date, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Macro Guru Raoul Pal Says 80% Of His Crypto Investment Is In This Ethereum Rival: \u2018And I Have 1% In Stupid S**t Like Dogwifhat, Dogecoin And Bonk\u2019\n\nImage Via Shutterstock"

        "title": "Furrever Token Foreseen to Deliver ROI Comparable to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)'s Success in 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The markets have been bleeding out over the past couple of days, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a 2% dip in their prices. However, amidst this downturn, Furrever Token (FURR) has emerged as a bright spot, surpassing the significant milestone of $800,000 during its sixth presale stage. This contrast highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where while some major players face temporary setbacks, newer projects like FURR demonstrate resilience and potential for growth.\n\nBitcoin Faces Geopolitical Headwinds Amidst Price Volatility: Dipped 3.4% Since Yesterday\n\nBitcoin's recent attempt at recovery was abruptly halted yesterday afternoon following renewed geopolitical risks, causing the digital asset to turn downwards once again. The largest cryptocurrency witnessed a 3.4% decline, retracing its gains from the previous day and closing around the $63,400 mark. Today, Bitcoin briefly dipped to the $61,000 range before bouncing back to the $63,000 zone with the opening of the European session. Amidst continued volatile movements in the Bitcoin market, significant liquidations persist in futures crypto trading, with $274 million worth of positions closed in the past 24 hours, 200 million of which were long positions, indicating investors' maintained optimism despite the downward trend.\n\nExternally-driven news dominates the Bitcoin market, with a brief upward movement towards $66,000 seen after the Hong Kong news yesterday, but this positive development was short-lived. However, investors are keeping a close eye on the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 20th, anticipating its potential impact on Bitcoin's supply dynamics and market sentiment.\n\nEthereum Faces Crucial Support Levels Amid Market Turmoil\n\nAmidst a widespread selloff in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) faces scrutiny as its price dips by 2% to approximately $3,059, according to coinmarketcap.com. With attention turning to critical support levels, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a pivotal zone between $2,000 and $2,430, where 9.37 million addresses collectively hold nearly 53 million ETH. Martinez's analysis underscores the significance of this range in determining Ethereum's price direction amidst market volatility.\n\nDespite the downturn, optimism persists within the crypto community, buoyed by recent regulatory approvals such as Hong Kong's green light for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Moreover, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event adds intrigue, although concerns over short-term volatility linger. As investors navigate uncertain terrain, Martinez's insights offer valuable guidance, emphasizing the importance of monitoring market dynamics and expert analyses.\n\nAmidst the price dip, Ethereum's one-day trading volume remains near the flatline at $22.42 billion, with the ETH price down 7.48% over the last 24 hours and nearly 16% over the last seven days. The Ethereum Futures Open Interest has also declined by 6.01% to $10.91 billion, indicating ongoing market turbulence.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): Riding the Wave of Market Downturn with Resilience\n\nDespite the broader market downturn, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out as a beacon of resilience, navigating the choppy waters of the crypto landscape with unwavering momentum. Surpassing the significant milestone of $800,000 during its sixth presale stage, FURR demonstrates a remarkable ability to thrive amidst market volatility. This success can be attributed to the project's unique value proposition, centered around infusing the crypto space with an irresistible dose of cuteness.

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a turbulent weekend for the financial markets, cryptocurrencies felt the strain of geopolitical tensions, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token ( FURR ) each navigating the upheaval in distinctive ways. Bitcoin showed resilience despite significant losses, Ethereum struggled to maintain key support levels amidst declining prices, and Furrever Token capitalized on the volatile market environment, boosting its presale figures significantly as investors looked for promising opportunities in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving.\n\nDespite a Dip Over the Weekend, Bitcoin's (BTC) Market Dominance Reaches a New High Since April 2021\n\nThis past weekend saw a downturn in asset values as traders adjusted their portfolios in response to conflicts in the Middle East. By late Saturday, it appeared that most assets had reached their lowest points.\n\nOver the weekend, while the stock market was closed and unable to react to the escalation involving an Iranian drone targeting Israel, the cryptocurrency market was active and responsive.\n\nThe general trend saw a decrease in asset prices as traders reevaluated their positions and reduced exposure to higher-risk investments. Bitcoin, despite being the least affected among major cryptocurrencies, dropped from a high of over $70,000 on Friday to just above $63,000 by the end of Saturday, marking an 11.6% decrease.\n\nBitcoin's resilience was notable compared to other cryptocurrencies. Coinglass reported that long liquidations on centralized exchanges totaled over $757 million on Saturday, with Bitcoin accounting for $261 million of those liquidations.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are considered less risky compared to more speculative ones such as Dogecoin, which experienced nearly a 30% drop from its peak on Friday to its trough on Saturday.\n\nThere was a modest recovery across most assets after hitting what seemed to be a floor late on Saturday. Theoretically, Bitcoin could have seen a surge during this turmoil, as it is often considered a \"safe haven,\" akin to gold. Recently, gold has seen significant gains due to the Middle East conflict, potentially benefiting Bitcoin, frequently dubbed \"digital gold.\"\n\nHowever, with the stock market closed, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin had to absorb the full impact of the market's reaction. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin still emerged as a top performer.\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin's market dominance\u2014its market cap's proportion relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap\u2014rose to 52.86% on Sunday, marking the highest point since April 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis increase in dominance comes after a low in February when Bitcoin's dominance fell to 43% due to a surge in altcoins, representing the smallest share since March 2023. This reversal underscores Bitcoin's renewed strength in the market, achieving its most substantial market share in three years.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Remains Above the $3,000 Support Level\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently faced challenges as its price has seen a decline of 21% between April 9 and April 14, reaching a 50-day low. Despite recovering some losses, Ether continues to struggle, especially after failing to break through the $3,200 resistance on April 14. Currently trading at $3,066, Ether has experienced a daily decrease of 1.46%. This ongoing instability raises concerns about the sustainability of its $3,000 support level.\n\nIn the derivatives market, there is a notable shift in sentiment among professional traders, indicating a decrease in risk appetite. This sentiment is reflected in the ETH options market, where the delta skew metric has reached its highest bearish level in over two months, suggesting a growing demand for downside protection.\n\nAmidst this market uncertainty, there is cautious optimism regarding the approval of a spot Ether ETF in May, although analysts remain mixed due to the conflicting signals from on-chain and derivatives data. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out the low likelihood of ETF approval given the lack of critical feedback from the SEC during recent meetings.\n\nComparatively, Ether's downturn has been more pronounced than other major cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX), but less so than that of Solana (SOL). It should be noted that Ethereum's network total value locked (TVL) has surged to its highest in 13 months on April 15, reaching 16.4 million ETH, which is a 14.8% increase month-over-month.\n\nDespite these challenges, the anticipation of a decision on the spot Ether ETF in May could still provide a positive impact on Ether's price and on-chain activity. However, the increasing risk aversion among professional traders, as evidenced on April 16, suggests that the potential for further price corrections below $2,900 should not be overlooked.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR)\u2019s Presale Raises Over $800,000 as Bitcoin Halving Approaches\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is distinguishing itself as a strong contender, demonstrated by an impressive presale that has already exceeded $800,000. As the crypto community braces for the Bitcoin halving, FURR is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increased interest and investment that typically accompany this event.\n\nOffering a compelling entry at just $0.000564 per token, Furrever Token has attracted a wide array of investors, drawn by the potential for significant returns. This vibrant investment interest is bolstered by FURR's dynamic community, which includes over 4,100 active members on its Telegram channel, providing robust support and fostering lively discussions that enhance the token\u2019s market presence.\n\nAs the market anticipates the Bitcoin halving, Furrever Token is not just riding the wave but actively preparing to leverage this period of heightened activity. The team behind FURR is pushing forward with strategic partnerships and innovative features aimed at boosting the token's adoption and enhancing its value. These efforts are designed to align FURR\u2019s trajectory with the broader market dynamics expected post-halving, ensuring that the token remains appealing to both new and existing investors.\n\nWith its strong presale performance, active community engagement, and strategic market initiatives, Furrever Token is poised for significant growth.
