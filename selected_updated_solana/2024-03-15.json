        "content": "While Ethereum developers inch closer to shipping Dencun, some experts are unconvinced the upgrade will deliver on its promises.\n\nDays before Dencun is scheduled to deploy on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, two industry veterans offered differing opinions regarding the impact of this much-anticipated upgrade amid skyrocketing Ether (ETH) prices.\n\nThe hype and crypto market euphoria pushed ETH to another two-year high, as the crypto crossed $4,000 for the first time since late 2021, at the peak of the previous bull cycle.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum hits $4k amid bullish surge, market awaits Dencun upgrade boost\n\nCore DAO, Wormhole experts on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade\n\nEthereum developers have said that Dencun will implement expanded data availability for layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, allowing for improved transaction capacity at lower gas fees.\n\nCore DAO initial contributor Rich Rines said in a statement received by crypto.news that the focus on Ethereum L2 may harbor unexpected issues around liquidity and on-chain fragmentation.\n\nWhile this should enable higher TPS on the network as a whole, questions remain whether this is a long-term fix. Over-reliance on Layer 2s could lead to fractured ecosystems and liquidity, as activity trends away from the base layer. Additionally, Layer 2s may involve more trust assumptions and can have sub-optimal influence on the base layer if transactions and fees are increasingly taken off the base chain. Rich Rines, Core DAO initial contributor\n\nRines noted that observers must closely monitor Dencun\u2019s progress after deployment, which is expected by March 13 barring unforeseen delays. The Core DAO contributor also said questions may arise about whether the upgrade\u2019s objective was the correct goal in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO Robinson Burkey views Dencun optimistically and expects the upgrade to herald a massive increase in cross-chain asset transfers.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is undeniably a positive development for the crypto space. This upgrade will really enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and security, which bodes well for defi and overall interoperability. This will result in cheaper and easier asset movement and more affordable transactions on Ethereum. Robinson Burkey, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO,\n\nBurkey opined that the Dencun upgrade will bolster defi usage, accessibility, and dynamism as cheaper fees should incentivize greater on-chain participation in crypto\u2019s largest decentralized ecosystem."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpland, a crypto game built around real-world locations, announced Friday that it has launched the first wave of its \"Share and Build\" airdrop series. It's aimed at rewarding community members and newcomers alike for engaging with the Upland platform before its Ethereum token goes live.\n\nThe first chapter will let users earn Sparklet tokens\u2014Upland's existing in-game utility token used to construct buildings and create content\u2014through social media activities and in-app missions over a three-week period.\n\nUsers can connect their Twitter (aka X) accounts and earn points by engaging with Upland and Sparklet content on the social media platform. Those points will then be converted to Sparklet tokens within the Upland game. The Twitter-centric airdrop farming campaign recalls similar pushes around the Portal and BlockGames tokens.\n\nLast November, the EOS-based Upland announced that it planned to launch an Ethereum token that\u2019s tied to its in-game Sparklet token. That whitepaper describing Upland\u2019s plans was put to a community vote, with 87% of users voting in approval of the proposal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe token tradability event (TTE) will follow the airdrop campaign, letting users convert their in-game Sparklet currency into a tradeable Ethereum token.\n\n\"We're excited to launch the 'Share and Build' airdrop series as we are getting ready for the Sparklet event. This initiative aligns perfectly with our vision of fostering a thriving Web3 ecosystem and rewarding passionate players,\" said Dirk Lueth, co-founder and co-CEO of Upland, in a release.\n\nThis first wave of the airdrop campaign offers 10 different reward levels, with users' engagement levels and social stats on Twitter determining their point multipliers. Users of select, as-yet-unrevealed Upland partners will also receive \"point boosts\" to help them earn more.\n\nAdditionally, by completing each forthcoming airdrop chapter, participants will be rewarded a distinct Block Explorer NFT that serves as a game piece within Upland. Collecting five such rewards unlocks an exclusive NFT for use within the Upland game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpland began life in 2019 as a property-trading game, with digital versions of real life properties tokenized and sold within the game. It has since expanded into a more robust metaverse experience with vehicles, events, and other gameplay opportunities. Upland raised $7 million in a Series A extension round last November.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI. Edited and fact-checked by Andrew Hayward."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Drops 7.8% A Day After Dencun Upgrade, What\u2019s the Next Support? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Following the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has encountered significant selling pressure. As of the latest update, the Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 7.8%, trading at $3,669 with a market capitalization of nearly $450 billion. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has surged by 45% to $32.29 billion\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Levels to Watch Ahead\n\nThe Ethereum price faced resistance at the $4,000 level and initiated a downward correction, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s movement. ETH dipped below crucial support levels at $3,920 and $3,850, signaling a short-term bearish trend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt briefly dropped below the $3,680 support area, reaching a low of $3,625 before consolidating losses. Currently, a significant bearish trend line is forming with resistance around $3,850. The primary resistance levels are near $3,850 and the trend line, close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent swing high at $4,083 to the low of $3,625.\n\nIf the Ethereum (ETH) price surpasses the $3,880 resistance, it may regain bullish momentum, aiming for the $4,000 level. Conversely, failure to break above $3,850 could lead to further downside movement. Initial support is at $3,680, followed by a major support zone near $3,600, with a potential downside target at $3,500. A decisive break below $3,500 might trigger a decline toward $3,350.\n\nPopular crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto explained that the range of $3600-$3700 for Ethereum is likely to attract significant buying interest in the short term.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic uncovered a substantial transaction involving $12 million worth of Ether by the Lazarus Group. This transfer was facilitated through Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer. Despite being subject to sanctions, the North Korean hacker organization has resumed its use of this platform.\n\nThe funds are traced back to a cyber-attack on HTX and the Heco Bridge in November, orchestrated by the Lazarus group. This attack resulted in significant losses amounting to $100 million for the affected platforms.\n\nETH Gas Fee Drops Under $10\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain data provider, the current scenario of Ethereum surpassing a $4,000 market value differs from October and November 2021. Today, the network\u2019s transaction costs are significantly lower, standing at less than 1/6th of the previous levels. With gas fees averaging $9.35, this improvement can be attributed in part to the enhancements in network fees following the transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low ETH Can Go if $3.5K Fails to Hold Selling Pressure (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently breached a significant resistance level, crossing the psychological milestone of $4K and achieving a new high for the year.\n\nHowever, this breakthrough was met with resistance, leading to a noticeable correction. The question that arises now is whether this correction is merely a temporary setback or the beginning of a broader reversal in the bullish trend.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, evident in a strong and sudden upward surge that surpassed the critical resistance at $4K. This surge reflects heightened interest from market participants in Ethereum, resulting in increased volatility.\n\nHowever, after briefly surpassing the crucial $4K resistance level, the price encountered intensified selling pressure, likely due to profit-taking among participants, leading to a significant decline toward the substantial support zone of around $3.5K. It seems likely that the market will find support in this region and initiate a fresh rally.\n\nHowever, in the event of a continued corrective retracement, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to find support around key levels within the Fibonacci retracement, specifically between the 0.5 ($3,181) and 0.618 ($2,966) levels.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nFurther examination of the 4-hour chart confirms the presence of buyers in the Ethereum market, propelling the price to its highest level since April 2022. This surge, accompanied by increased market volatility, demonstrates significant buying interest aimed at surpassing the previous all-time high of $4.8K.\n\nHowever, following the breakthrough above the critical $4K resistance level, the price faced rejection, leading to a sharp decline aiming for the key support zones around $3.5K and $3.3K. Additionally, an expanding bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a notable market correction.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that healthy bullish markets often experience periods of consolidation correction, allowing the asset to rest and rebuild demand. Therefore, it seems likely that the price will find support in the medium term, continuing its overall upward trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has surged rapidly in recent weeks, briefly surpassing its previous all-time high of $4,000. This surge has attracted numerous speculators to the market, driving up buying pressure and instilling confidence among investors.\n\nThe accompanying chart illustrates the open interest, a valuable metric for assessing sentiment in the futures market. Open interest quantifies the number of outstanding perpetual futures contracts across various crypto exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the open interest has soared alongside the recent bullish trend, reaching unprecedented levels. This surge indicates the intensity of both long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, resulting in an overheated environment.\n\nWhile elevated open interest is typical in a robust bull market, it can also contribute to heightened volatility and unexpected market corrections. As such, it\u2019s prudent for investors to carefully manage their risk in the short term."
