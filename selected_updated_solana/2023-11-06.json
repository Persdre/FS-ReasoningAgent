        "title": "Transient Storage: Ethereum's Game-Changing Feature - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Imagine a blockchain that operates swiftly, with each transaction costing less yet doing more. That\u2019s the promise Transient Storage holds for Ethereum. This fresh feature is garnering attention for its potential to cut transaction costs while enabling more complex operations drastically.\n\nThat\u2019s the promise Transient Storage holds for Ethereum, introduced through EIP-1153.\n\nDive in as we unravel Transient Storage, its mechanism, and its significance in the blockchain community! \ud83c\udf10\n\nWhat is Transient Storage?\n\nTransient Storage is a temporary data storage area within Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine (EVM). Unlike permanent storage, which retains data indefinitely, Transient Storage preserves data only during the transaction\u2019s execution. It operates with two new opcodes, TLOAD (0x5c) and TSTORE (0x5d), facilitating temporary storage operations and making transactions cheaper and faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Existing Data Storage:\n\n\n\n\n\nStack: Holds temporary data during a transaction, operating on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Storage: A place for persistent data storage on the blockchain. Memory: A volatile storage area cleared after a transaction for temporary data storage. Calldata: Accompanies a function call, temporary and erased post-transaction.\n\nWhy Transient Storage Matters?\n\nTransient Storage brings a cost-effective solution. It substantially lowers transaction costs, making blockchain interactions more affordable. This novel concept reduces expenses and enables more intricate operations and better communication between smart contracts and external entities.\n\nTransient Storage offers a way to store data temporarily during a transaction, helping to cut down on gas costs significantly. This is especially useful in cases like contract deployments and rollups, where temporary data handling is needed. It is like having a cost-effective temporary workspace that gets cleared out once the work is done.\n\n\n\n\n\nClear Examples and Use Cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-entrancy Guards: Transient Storage can cut the cost of re-entrancy guards by over 90%, a significant reduction in gas fees. ERC20 Approvals: It enables single-transaction approvals, boosting security and user experience. Data Communication: Functions within smart contracts can securely and economically communicate data using Transient Storage. KYC verification: The user\u2019s document can be temporarily stored, verified, and then erased post-verification, all within a single, cost-effective transaction.\n\nState Change Costs with SSTORE Operation:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first diagram depicts Persistent Storage, with an \u201cSSTORE\u201d operation incurring a gas cost of 5000 for setting a variable and 2900 for resetting it, reflecting the expense of permanent state changes on the blockchain.\n\nState Change Efficiency with TSTORE Operation:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second diagram highlights Transient Storage, where \u201cTSTORE\u201d operations cost only 100 gas each for setting and resetting a variable, showcasing the gas efficiency of transient, non-permanent state modifications.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransient Storage is a big step forward for Ethereum, making transactions cheaper and easier. It lowers the cost, making it affordable to run more complex operations and interact securely.\n\nThis new feature saves gas and money and opens doors to new possibilities in how we use blockchain. Transient Storage is indeed a valuable addition to the Ethereum community, pushing us towards a more user-friendly and cost-effective blockchain experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of Ethereum looks promising, with innovations like Transient Storage paving the way! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more insights on Ethereum development, visit:\n\nConnect with me on:\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Weekly Highlights: Bitcoin & Ethereum Show Resilience, Altcoins Soar - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market had an upbeat week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing resilience around key resistance levels. Altcoins, in particular, had a remarkable week, with significant gains that suggest further growth in the near future.\n\nIn the top 20 cryptocurrencies, some altcoins stood out as the week\u2019s biggest gainers. Leading the pack was Solana (SOL), followed closely by XRP and Cardano (ADA), securing the third position with impressive growth.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nSolana (SOL) made an impressive mark with a 23% surge in the past week, reaching a peak of $46.33. Currently trading at $40.28, SOL has shown robust performance, even though it experienced a 3.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nXRP also made waves with a remarkable 22% gain over the past week. Currently trading at $0.6788, it demonstrated noteworthy performance, with a 10% increase in the last 24 hours and a 138.64% surge in trading volume.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nCardano (ADA) gained significant attention with a more than 16% weekly increase, currently trading at $0.3435, and a 55.63% rise in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nOther popular altcoins such as Chainlink (LINK), TON, and Polygon (MATIC) also saw gains in their weekly charts, with LINK up by 12%, TON by 10%, and MATIC showing a 10% increase, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nDespite a fairly neutral weekend in terms of trading sentiment, recent data from Santiment suggests that sentiment has turned bearish once more. Notably, previous instances of higher ratios of negative keywords coincided with rising prices for Bitcoin and other market caps.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIntoTheBlock highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s open interest in perpetual swaps relative to its market cap (OI/MC) is near its yearly lows. This indicates that the recent price surge has been driven by spot volumes rather than derivatives-based leverage, suggesting a more organic demand.\n\nA crypto analyst noted some bearish signals in Bitcoin\u2019s weekly analysis, such as a bearish cross on the daily MACD and a minor bearish divergence on the daily RSI. However, these signals are not a cause for concern, as the base case suggests a brief pause under $36,000.\n\n$BTC WEEKLY CLOSE ANALYSIS \ud83e\uddd0\n\n\n\nLet me knock out some quick SLIGHT bearish signals first, and then we will get to the weekly closing chart and commentary (emphasis on slightly).\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38While not shown, we did finally get a bearish cross on the DAILY MACD. I want to stress that our\u2026 pic.twitter.com/IVqeBW5R9p \u2014 JT \u271d\ufe0f (@JTheretohelp1) November 6, 2023\n\nOn the positive side, the weekly analysis reveals bullish strength with the Weekly Stoch/RSI above 80 and a Bull Cross on the Vortex Indicator, a key trend indicator for BTC. The price remains above key moving averages, and the resistance at $36,000 and support levels at $31,800 and $30,500 are highlighted. Breaking through the $48,000 resistance could pave the way for a new all-time high for Bitcoin, indicating an overall positive trend.\n\nFurthermore, Santiment pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s rise above $1,800 was accompanied by the largest number of new addresses created since October 7th. If the long-term trend of network growth continues and exchange supplies continue to drop, Ethereum (ETH) has a strong case for crossing $2,000 once again.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIntoTheBlock noted that Ethereum\u2019s settled volume reached a 6-month peak, with over $213 billion transacted on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet last week. Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base contributed an additional $16 billion to this impressive volume.\n\nEthereum's settled volume hits a 6-month peak!\n\nLast week, over $213B was transacted on Ethereum's mainnet, with layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base contributing an additional $16B. \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 4, 2023\n\nAs of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is currently trading at $34,914.86, with a 2% increase over the past seven days and a 0.96% increase in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,877.05, showing a 0.47% increase in the past 24 hours and a 5.58% gain over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Strategy For Capital Preservation: Insights From MicroStrategy CEO"

        "content": "Bitcoin price uptrend may be exhausted for the short term, as the $35,500 level pressures BTC.\n\nEthereum price at crossroads below $1,935 mean threshold represents a make-or-break moment for the largest altcoin by market capitalization.\n\nRipple price\u2019s bullish momentum continues to build, but the supply barrier ahead may pose a challenge with $0.800 likely to hold.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below $35,500 for almost two weeks now, being static, with analysts attributing the slow-down in pace to the absence of ETF-related news. With its Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also come to a halt, facing critical barriers that will determine the next move.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains\n\nBitcoin price marks time below $35,954\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is marking time below the $35,954 level after a steady 40% climb that began in mid-September. Exchanging hands for $35,091 as of press time, the rally seems exhausted, with the price showing reluctance around the $35,500 level. The bulls are likely to take a breather as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position shows BTC is massively overbought.\n\nWith this outlook, it is likely that Bitcoin price could correct soon, likely for the short term, before a continuation of the primary trend. Likely targets in a downward directional bias include the $32,000 psychological level, a critical juncture having capped the upside potential for the king of cryptocurrencies since May 2022 when the Terra (UST) ecosystem fell off a cliff.\n\nThe RSI deviated from the northbound move, flattening to show complacency as buying pressure continues to weaken. This observation favors the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined investors join the bull\u2019s camp, Bitcoin price could continue north, breaking past the $35,954 resistance level with a breakout objective above the $40,000 psychological level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate for BTC to test the supply zone extending from $44,321 to $47,122, with the $48,000 handle presenting the next logical target, a level last seen in March 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Holders of $600 billion worth of BTC are asking for Bitcoin price to rally not by 15% but by 96%\n\nEthereum price on collision with $1,035 mean threshold\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s 22% uptrend that started on October 13 has the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization confronting a crucial barrier \u2013 the $1,935 mean threshold of a supply zone extending from $1,861 to $2,004.\n\nIf Ethereum price records a daily candlestick close above the $1,935 midline, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend, setting the tone for a successful foray above the $2,000 psychological level, with $2,029 as the next logical target.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA rejection from the $1,935 level could send Ethereum price spiraling south, potentially slipping below the $1,800 psychological level and testing the $1,748 support. Such a move would denote an 8% drop below current prices.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum net exchange deposits hits five-month peak with almost 130,000 ETH flowing to exchanges\n\nRipple price eyes 10% more gains\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues northbound, with robust higher highs and higher lows surpassing key barricades. Despite XRP being massively overbought, the primary trajectory of the RSI is still northbound, showing that momentum is still rising.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ripple price test the supply zone extending from $0.7771 to $0.8199. For a confirmed uptrend, the price must break and close above the $0.8000 psychological level, with the move likely to catalyze an extension to the $0.9000 psychological level, 25% above the current price.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with XRP being massively overbought, it is likely that the supply zone will hold as a resistance order block. The ensuing rejection could see Ripple price pull south, slipping through the $0.6968 support level and testing the $0.6242 support with bulls seeking rejuvenation. Another evaluation will be required at this point to determine the next step for XRP, considering the prevailing bullish outlook in the broader market.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"

        "title": "Smart Contract Optimization: How to Use Less Gas in Ethereum - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "It is well known that most transactions on Ethereum require a fee to ensure that the network is spam-resistant and doesn\u2019t get stuck in an endless loop of calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gas fee is the amount of gas required to complete the transaction multiplied by the cost per unit of gas. The fee is paid whether the transaction succeeds or fails. As of November 2023, gas costs about 10 gwei. Although 1 gwei is now equivalent to about US$0.000002, we need to understand that this is just one unit, and you have to pay tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of gas to complete transactions, which will be a more tangible amount. That is why we need to keep optimization in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs developers, we cannot influence the price of gas, so we need to focus on the units of gas consumed by the code to reduce it as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the optimizations, developing on Ethereum is different from developing Web 2.0 applications because we have to give up familiar patterns, such as splitting into small functions, for ease of testing. In this article, I will provide several examples, for each of which I will give an optimized and unoptimized smart contract with the amount of gas consumed.\n\nOptimizations and operation codes\n\nThere are two main approaches to optimization:\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing the cost of deployment (minimizing the size of the smart contract and the cost of executing the constructor)\n\nOptimizing each function call\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to check is that the smart contract does not contain unnecessary and unused code, as deployment is compiled to bytecode, and the more of it there is, the more expensive deployment will be.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some expensive gas operation codes in EVM:\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE/CREATE2 \u2013 Deploys a smart contract (32,000 gas)\n\nSSTORE \u2013 Stores the value in memory (20,000 gas if the slot has not been accessed, 2,900 otherwise)\n\nBALANCE (address(this).balance) \u2013 (2,600 gas if not previously accessed)\n\n\n\n\n\nA complete list of all the codes for the different forks can be found here: https://www.evm.codes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing each function call is a better strategy because the smart contract is deployed once.\n\nTips\n\nDo not initialize variables with default values\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a variable is not initialized, the compiler assumes that it has a default value: 0 for uint , \u201c\u201d for string , false for bool , 0x(0) for address . So, initializing with default values is a waste of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize variables\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidity stores variables in cells of 32 bytes. If a variable is smaller than a cell, it is packed with another variable, but such variables must be declared side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not truncate variables\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen declaring a single variable, it makes sense to use uint256 , because otherwise, the variable has to be truncated, which takes a bit more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse static values\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases where there is an option to pre-calculate static values, it is better to use it, even if it is hardcoded. For instance, in the example below, you need to call two functions that increase the gas consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse constant variables\n\n\n\n\n\nFor variables that will be constants, just one immutable keyword will save a lot of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not declare temporary variables\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may seem harmless to introduce an extra variable that is stored in memory rather than on the blockchain, but adding an intermediate variable requires more gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse mappings instead of arrays\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not always possible, but where possible, arrays should be avoided as they are more expensive to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer a fixed-length array to a dynamic one\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you cannot avoid using arrays. Dynamic arrays are more expensive than fixed-length arrays because you have to change the array length when using the push and pop functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the data type you need in the array\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat applies to variables does not apply to arrays. If you specify the required type, the engine will pack the data in the correct way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not create many functions that call each other\n\n\n\n\n\nIn any other language, the smaller the function, the better it is for debugging and testing, but things are not the same in Solidity. It is also desirable to minimize function calls to third-party smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid multiple changes to state variables\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a variable in the blockchain whose value needs to be changed multiple times, it is better to create a temporary variable and write the final value to the blockchain after the loop is executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize gas by removing unnecessary variables\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum offers gas refunds for deleting variables. Using the delete keyword with a variable name will return 15,000 gas but no more than half of the transaction value.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse selfdestruct() to compensate for gas\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting a contract without the option to restore will return 24,000 gas but no more than half of the transaction value.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Solidity Gas Optimizer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in optimizer allows you to adjust the value of iterations depending on your optimization goals. A lower value should be set to minimize deployment costs, and a higher value should be set to optimize runtime costs. Below is the configuration file for the Solidity Optimizer with Hardhat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nAt compile time, contract code is converted to byte code for EVM, and transaction codes have a cost depending on the Ethereum fork. Despite initiatives to reduce the cost of gas (in particular, the introduction of variable size blocks in the London update, which changed the way fees are calculated), as developers, we need to optimize both the deployment and function calls in smart contracts to save money on deployment and execution."
