        "content": "Grayscale: Ethereum\u2019s Rally Mainly Due to Dencun Upgrade, Not Spot ETFs\n\nWhile the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has been cited as a reason for Ethereum's recent price increase, Grayscale Investments offers a different perspective. In a recent report, the asset manager suggests the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, 2024, is the true driver behind the surge.\n\nGrayscale analyst William Ogden Moore argues that the market anticipates the upgrade's ability to improve transaction throughput and cost reduction, making Ethereum more competitive with faster blockchains like Solana. While bullish on Ethereum, the report acknowledges the cryptocurrency's underperformance compared to its sector in 2023, particularly against Solana's impressive 900% growth.\n\nThis bullish stance from Grayscale might be influenced by their ongoing efforts to convert their Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. With spot Bitcoin ETFs already approved, some predict similar approval for the Ethereum equivalent by May 2024.\n\nBeyond Dencun and potential ETF approval, Grayscale also highlights \"net deflationary supply\" and \"network revenue generation\" as factors contributing to Ethereum's future. Additionally, the report emphasizes Ethereum's potential to recapture lost ground in the smart contract application market. They believe that by becoming more competitive in throughput and cost, Ethereum can attract applications requiring high levels of security and censorship resistance, such as stablecoins and tokenized financial assets."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nDigital assets like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have evolved to become more than mere currencies; they are now platforms for decentralized applications. This evolution has blurred the lines between traditional means of exchange and digital assets. However, some people believe they can still be used as means of exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike regular money, cryptocurrencies possess traits such as programmability, interoperability and self-executing smart contracts. They are not just used for buying and selling goods but also for creating decentralized financial systems and other applications.\n\nEthereum has long been the leader in the smart contract platform space. However, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender, with both networks now operating on proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.\n\nThis shift to PoS for Ethereum, known as Ethereum 2.0, marks a significant transition toward a more energy-efficient and scalable network. Solana, on the other hand, was built on PoS from the ground up, focusing on high throughput and low transaction costs, which has attracted a substantial user base and developer community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparing Ethereum and Solana, one must look beyond just the monetary value. Both networks provide a foundation for building decentralized applications (dApps), but they approach scalability and transaction speed differently. Ethereum's transition to PoS aims to address its scalability issues, whereas Solana has been marketed as a \"high-performance blockchain,\" capable of handling many more transactions per second from the outset.\n\nThe SOLETH charts reflect Solana's poor performance against Ethereum, indicating a strong preference of Ethereum among investors, likely after the most recent outage on the Solana network. Ethereum's larger ecosystem and longer track record provide it with a more substantial market capitalization and a broader range of dApps."

        "content": "One of the hottest debates in crypto right now is about Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) vs. Solana (CRYPTO: SOL). While the former remains the reigning champion of blockchain development, Solana is building considerable momentum to unseat Ethereum.\n\nDoes Solana have what it takes? Or will Ethereum cement itself as the home of decentralized development?\n\nThe answer is not straightforward, and there are several gray areas to consider. Let's look closer at the state of affairs between Solana and Ethereum to determine which cryptocurrency is a better investment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA little background first\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 changed crypto forever. Its novel smart contracts meant developers could build blockchain-based applications, essentially making Ethereum the first programmable cryptocurrency. With this new functionality, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, yield farming, and many other aspects of today's decentralized finance (DeFi) economy could all be built.\n\nLike any technology, subsequent iterations eventually came along. Enter Solana. Given the title \"Ethereum killer,\" Solana arrived in 2019 and offered developers similar smart-contract capabilities, except with the added benefit of blazing speeds and low fees. As two of Ethereum's primary pinch points, Solana has become one of Ethereum's most formidable challengers.\n\nSolana starts to expand as Ethereum lags\n\nOver the past year, Solana experienced significant growth. After losing more than 95% of its value and falling to just $9 at the depths of the \"crypto winter,\" Solana has since rebounded to more than $100 today. This resurgence is likely fueled by growing momentum in the broader crypto market, as well as its flourishing ecosystem. A quick look at key metrics such as active addresses, total transactions, and total volume on the blockchain reveals that they are all near record levels and hint at a bright future for Solana, especially in this new bull market.\n\nThen there's Ethereum. While Solana has taken center stage, the original smart-contract blockchain has more or less watched from the sidelines. As Solana jumped more than 900% in 2023, Ethereum notched a modest 90% gain. Furthermore, while its blockchain remains one of the busiest in all of crypto, it has not seen an increase as impressive as Solana's. By most accounts, it looks like Solana is closing the lead that Ethereum has enjoyed over the last few years.\n\nEthereum's not standing still\n\nSolana's run over the past year has been nothing short of remarkable. But here's the harsh reality. There's still considerable room separating it from Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Ethereum's total market cap is more than $340 billion. Solana's is just $45 billion. Then there's DeFi. Currently, nearly 60% of the total value within the DeFi economy calls Ethereum home. Solana makes up only 2.7%.\n\nIs it true that Solana is faster and cheaper to use? Absolutely. But this increased throughput isn't without trade-offs. To provide such capabilities, Solana's design makes known sacrifices in decentralization and security -- two crucial factors to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs of last count, Ethereum has roughly 900,000 validators around the world. Solana comes in with around 2,000. In addition, Solana has become notorious for network outages. Over the last three years, Solana's blockchain has gone offline six times, with the most recent occurring in early February 2024. Ethereum's blockchain has never had such a lapse.\n\nThe shiny features that Solana touts will likely fade with time. It often falls on deaf ears, but Ethereum is not a finished product. With the most developers of any blockchain (and five times more than Solana), Ethereum is constantly improving and boasts an impressive roadmap outlining future upgrades that will make the blockchain more capable, faster, and cheaper to use.\n\nTake the Dencun upgrade as an example. Slated for implementation next month, Dencun will introduce new mechanisms that will enable Ethereum to process transactions through its expansive Layer 2 ecosystem at a much cheaper rate. Some estimates project that Dencun will reduce pesky gas fees by up to 10 times.\n\nBuilding a strategic portfolio\n\nNo blockchain is perfect, but some are closer than others. The case for an investment in Solana would be that it's still in its early days and has more room to grow. But with Ethereum, the investment thesis is abundantly more apparent. It still holds a stranglehold on DeFi. It has the most developers. It has a proven track record of functionality and is one of the most secure and decentralized blockchains in the world.\n\nI own both Solana and Ethereum. There are plenty of reasons to believe that Solana's network could keep growing, but it makes up a smaller portion of my portfolio as there is considerably more risk involved. Conversely, I have much more confidence in Ethereum over the long haul, so it receives greater allocation. For investors, the choice comes down to whether they prefer the new kid on the block or the seasoned veteran who has done this a time or two.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 20, 2024\n\nRJ Fulton has positions in Ethereum and Solana.
