        "title": "U.S. regulators shun spot Ethereum ETFs: What about ETH\u2019s price? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Expectations for an Ethereum spot ETF has gotten significantly low in the community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market performance continues to lag behind the majority of its peers.\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s SEC is known for playing power games with the cryptocurrency industry, like taking their time to approve any kind of application for crypto products.\n\nThey eased up a bit this year with the approval of eleven spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF, when?\n\nNow, all eyes have turned to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate sibling, Ethereum [ETH]. Applications have been filed quite some time ago for what the community sees as Gensler\u2019s only preferred crypto to have its own spot ETF.\n\nNone has been approved, and the SEC has been noticeably quiet about it all. Just a few days ago, Grayscale withdrew their application for the ETH ETF., and didn\u2019t reveal their reasons for it either.\n\nThe lack of engagement from the SEC with applications from ETF issuers plus Grayscale\u2019s withdrawal have fueled speculation in the community that approval is not on the horizon.\n\nThis sentiment is mirrored in the market, with outflows totaling $14 million last week, according to data by CoinShares.\n\nFurthermore, ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, removing plans to engage in staking.\n\nIn the latest filing, submitted on Friday, the previous clause that allowed 21Shares to stake a portion of the fund\u2019s assets through third-party providers was omitted.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that this update could be an attempt to refine the application based on possible feedback from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/\n\nHowever, there have been no official statements.\n\nBalchunas also proposed that this amendment might be a strategy to minimize the details the SEC could use to potentially deny the application.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market movements\n\nTurning our attention to Ethereum\u2019s market, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world is not having a good time at the moment.\n\nThough all the other cryptos in the top ten have seen modest rises in the past twenty-four hours, Ether hardly budged. At press time, it is still way below its critical support level of $3,000.\n\nData from Santiment reveals that there is a lot of bearishness among Ethereum traders.\n\nTrading volumes have gone down, liquidations are low, but not because investors are staying put, but likely because they\u2019re bored.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn\u2019t made any kind of major price movements this year. And the bulls are now unimpressed.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at the ETH/USDt pair on TradingView and discovered extreme volatility with multiple ups and downs.\n\nThe highest peak approaches the $3,340 level, indicating strong buying interest, while the lowest nears $2,840, where selling pressure intensifies.\n\nThe price repeatedly tested support around $2,900 this past month, as indicated by multiple touches on this line but without actually breaking it, showing resilience at this level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nRecently, the price shows a slight upward movement around $2,968, suggesting a tentative recovery or consolidation phase. But still, it failed. Ethereum was worth $2,958 at press time.\n\nGiven this context, the short-term prediction for Ethereum would lean towards a continuation of bearish trends."

        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, U.K., May 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency is a growing interest for the world's financial institutions and massive investment establishments. Digital finance is no longer just about testing the waters and gaining a broader presence on online portfolios, they are an everyday reality for the majority of the world\u2019s individuals and businesses.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the digital asset class has evolved into a global phenomenon. What started as an experimental concept has now become a burgeoning industry, with a market capitalization surpassing trillions of dollars. The proliferation of cryptocurrencies has sparked a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, offering decentralized solutions and disrupting conventional models of banking and commerce.\n\nCryptocurrency and the Mass Institutional Adoption\n\nIn recent years, the industry has witnessed a significant uptick in institutional adoption, signaling a seismic shift in mainstream acceptance. Institutions, ranging from hedge funds to multinational corporations, are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles and store of value.\n\nThis mass institutional adoption is driven by several factors, including growing confidence in the technology, hedging against inflationary pressures, and diversification of investment portfolios. Moreover, regulatory clarity and enhanced infrastructure have bolstered both institutional and individual confidence, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network have seen a surge in value this year, driven by recent developments in the financial sector.\n\nIn a notable move, some of Wall Street's biggest banks are collaborating with Visa and Mastercard to experiment with tokenizing their assets. This initiative, predicted by Citi analysts to grow into a $5 trillion market by 2030, involves banks like JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, alongside Visa, Mastercard, and Swift. This could mean a significant step toward mass institutional adoption.\n\nTokenization of assets is considered the \"next generation for markets\" by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who has embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the past year. BlackRock has quietly begun the second stage of its plan for a crypto-based \"revolution in financial markets\" by launching a tokenized private equity fund. Sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in digital currencies, with potential trading activity expected in the coming months, according to BlackRock executives.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin: Leading the Way\n\n\n\nAt the forefront of this cryptocurrency revolution stands Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency that ignited the spark of decentralization. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, becoming synonymous with the concept of digital gold. With its finite supply, decentralized nature, and immutable ledger, Bitcoin has emerged as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nIn March 2024 Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching around $73,000 per BTC, boosting the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies to approximately $2.5 trillion. Analysts speculate that former U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve could trigger a massive price boom for Bitcoin.\n\nBlockDAG Network: A Promising Contender\n\nAmong the emerging contenders in the cryptocurrency space, BlockDAG Network has garnered attention for its innovative approach to blockchain scalability and efficiency and real-world use. Leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG Network aims to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional blockchain architectures, offering high throughput and low latency solutions for decentralized applications. With recent funding of up to $25 million and a growing community of supporters, BlockDAG Network is poised to challenge existing digital projects and reshape the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum: The Surge in Value\n\nAnother key player in the cryptocurrency market experiencing a surge in value is Ethereum, the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, has witnessed a remarkable rally, driven by the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to attract developers, investors, and users, cementing its position as a fundamental pillar of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the mass institutional adoption of cryptocurrency represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of finance, with Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum leading the charge. As institutional investors flock to digital assets, this 2024 cryptocurrency market stands poised for unprecedented growth and innovation. While challenges and regulatory hurdles remain, the trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption points towards a future where decentralized finance becomes the cornerstone of global finance.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
