        "title": "DeeStream Attracts Major Investments from Bitcoin & Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have cooled down substantially since hitting $73,000 and $4,000, respectively, with a good number of holders taking solid profits. That makes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales flush with capital to throw around for the next bull run. One of the hottest investment opportunities that has been receiving major inflows is DeeStream (DST). DeeStream\u2019s presale is being tipped as the next 50x opportunity, and a good number of early adopters have been Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales. Here\u2019s why.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin (BTC) Cools Down as Investors Consolidate\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reached an all time high of $73,737 earlier this month; however, since then, a massive spate of sell offs ultimately cooled off the rally. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $60,000 a couple of times since, but has bounced back pretty well each time it did. As of March 28th, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $70,766, still keeping a majority of holders in profit as the token enters a consolidation phase. Other Bitcoin (BTC) holders, meanwhile, are rotating profits into DeeStream (DST) to extract even bigger gains in the next bull cycle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Follows Suit After Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum (ETH), trading at $3,552 as of March 28th, is up 2.38% as of press time from the last 7 days after bottoming out at $3,302.25. Nevertheless, Ethereum (ETH) has been in an uptrend over the past 2 weeks, trading at a small increase. Ethereum (ETH) has retraced in a major way since hitting $4,000 earlier this month. Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) traders are taking profits and reallocating them into DeeStream (DST).\n\nDeeStream (DST) Presale Stage 2 Debuts Amid Major Intrigue\n\nThe world is welcoming the first and only blockchain based streaming powerhouse looking to disrupt the live streaming industry with its unique decentralized approach to the format. DeeStream (DST) platform brings together streaming and blockchain technologies seamlessly, creating a streaming platform on par with the robust functionality and intuitive UX of YouTube and TikTok but without their centralization problems.\n\nThis completely decentralized Web3 platform uses blockchain to greatly improve the streaming experience. DeeStream (DST) creates an inclusive, secure, and community driven space that encourages communication between streamers and their audience creating a strictly better decentralized alternative to YouTube.\n\nIt is no surprise why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are joining the DeeStream (DST) presale with tokens available at just $0.055. Crypto fans are eagerly buying in, eager to invest in this innovative platform. With over 16,500 registered users and over 3,100 presale investors (and counting), these numbers are likely to grow as DST continues to gain attention in the crypto market.\n\nMany investors are eager to participate in DeeStream\u2019s (DST) revenue sharing model. By holding DST tokens, investors receive a share of the platform\u2019s profits based on their holdings. Users and investors also receive daily rewards by completing various tasks.\n\nThe advantages of DeeStream (DST) are unparalleled in the crypto and streaming communities. Investors recognize the potential value of DST and even anticipate it becoming a top tier cryptocurrency. Users value DST for giving them more control while helping their streaming communities thrive.\n\nFind out more about DeeStream\u2019s (DST) presale by visiting the website here.\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "content": "From strong bitcoin ETF inflows to anticipation of next month's bitcoin halving event, major cryptocurrencies continued their multimonth run higher this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied this week amid multiple potential catalysts including strong net inflows into bitcoin ETFs, notable new registration filings for spot Ether ETFs, and an anticipated \"bitcoin halving\" event in early April.\n\nWhen all was said and done as of the close of Friday's regular session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.01%) was up 9.7% on the week, while Ethereum (ETH -2.25%) had gained 5.1%. So-called memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE -6.36%) and Shiba Inu (SHIB -8.22%) also soared 41.2% and 16.5%, respectively, this week.\n\nOn Bitcoin ETF inflows, new spot ETH ETF filings\n\nThe price of Bitcoin eclipsed $71,000 several times this week -- a week after falling below $63,000 -- before settling to trade around $69,500 as of this writing. The world's most prominent cryptocurrency was bolstered in part by huge net inflows into bitcoin ETFs exceeding $243.4 million on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB 1.50%) singlehandedly registered net inflows of $200.7 million, becoming the third bitcoin ETF to cross the $200 million mark since the the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 13 bitcoin ETFs back in January.\n\nBitcoin, for its part, has enjoyed an incredible rally dating back to October 2023, which came after months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nFor perspective, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage -- as opposed to requiring investors to set up separate crypto trading accounts with a crypto-specific firm. So ETFs are a much more accessible medium for anyone who wants to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. The SEC's approvals have stood out vote of confidence from a government agency in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment option.\n\nSome investors have also speculated more recently that Etherium ETF approvals could be on the way in the coming months, further bolstering crypto investment options for retail traders. On Wednesday, Fidelity Investments filed a Form S-1 Registration statement for its own spot ETH ETF. Asset Management firm Bitwise followed suit with its own registration statement filing for a similar spot Ether ETF on Thursday.\n\nOn the bitcoin halving event\n\nMeanwhile, crypto investors are eagerly awaiting a so-called bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April -- the fourth such event in bitcoin's history, with previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 -- where bitcoin miners' reward for solving complex transactions is effectively cut in half to limit the rate at which new bitcoin are introduced into the system until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Bitcoin's price has previously skyrocketed following each of the first three bitcoin halving events, so investors have naturally speculated a similar rally could occur next month.\n\nThe halving event is similar in some ways to a stock split, where a company may reduce its per-share price but commensurately increase the number of shares issued. Splits are a zero-sum event, of course, considering the value of the underlying business remains the same. But many retail investors tend to believe the lower post-split stock price is more attractive. Multiple cryptocurrency market pundits have argued that this halving event should further spur adoption of bitcoin while also limiting supply -- effectively keeping the price of bitcoin high.\n\n\"The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term,\" Azteco Chief Marketing Officer David Bailey wrote this week. \"As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.\"\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that the price of bitcoin will rally on the heels of this halving in the near term. But it's hardly surprising to see crypto traders embracing the positivity leading up to the event."
