        "title": "The ether is breaking records: Ethereum's crypto soaring to historic highs! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 07 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nEther (ETH), the second most popular cryptocurrency in the market, is drawing investors\u2019 attention due to its exceptional performance. Like bitcoin (BTC), which it follows, it has reached an all-time high price of $3,800. Here\u2019s how analysts explain this surge in power.\n\nThe reasons behind the surge of Ethereum\u2019s native crypto\n\nLike the price of bitcoin, ether has shown a remarkable surge in power. A dynamic that has recently taken the crypto to a valuation of $3,800. An absolutely historic record.\n\nWhile the question arises as to how the asset managed such a performance, Michael Van Pope, a well-known analyst in the crypto industry, gave his opinion on the matter. According to his view, ether\u2019s breakthrough is due to two factors.\n\nThe first is linked to expectations around Dencun. This is an upgrade that Ethereum is expected to undergo soon. An update that should address many of the platform\u2019s challenges in terms of transaction fees, scalability, and attractiveness.\n\nThe second factor behind the rise of ether comes from speculation about the potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF. An option that should improve the accessibility of institutional investors to this crypto, similar to what is observed with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEthereum Hits $3,800: Dencun Upgrade and ETF Hype Propel Surgehttps://t.co/JBS63Upqo3 \u2014 John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) March 7, 2024 Factors behind the rise of ether according to Michael Van Pope\n\nA surge that\u2019s just beginning?\n\nAnalyzing the dynamics of ether, Michael Van Pope highlights Ethereum\u2019s certain robustness relative to resistance levels. Moreover, the crypto seems to show a relatively stable behavior compared to bitcoin.\n\nThus, according to the analyst, ether is demonstrating remarkable resilience. It manages to progress in a more consistent manner. This suggests that it is in a solid position compared to bitcoin and the challenges of the crypto market in general.\n\nBased on this observation, he believes Ethereum is ready to achieve significant new gains in the coming weeks and months. These would also be driven by the Dencun upgrade and the possible approval of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nIn essence, Michael Van Pope\u2019s projection is not new. In early February, he had notably anticipated a market explosion around Ethereum, driven not only by the two arguments previously mentioned but also by a reallocation of profits from BTC to ETH.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ripple CEO Predicts Setback For US SEC In Ethereum Case, Similar To XRP | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH) has transformed into an intriguing case within the entire cryptocurrency landscape, with several experts predicting possible outcomes regarding the dispute.\n\nRipple CEO Warns US SEC\u2019s Inevitable Defeat Against Ethereum\n\nAs the battle wages on, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, has revealed his optimistic insights on the case, while sharing a daring prediction in favor of the Ethereum ecosystem. His positive insights came in light of reports that the SEC is attempting to classify Ethereum \u201cas a security\u201d through its legal dispute with the digital asset.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse has predicted that the US regulatory watchdog is most likely to \u201close its war against Ethereum\u201d \u2013 the second largest cryptocurrency asset. According to Garlinghouse, the Commission\u2019s several \u201cattempts to include the cryptocurrency industry in legal battles have resulted in severe court losses\u201d over time.\n\nAs a result, the agency is now \u201clagging behind its foreign counterparts\u201d and \u201ccompeting with other regulators\u201d such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe Ripple CEO then posed a question, \u201cWhen would the SEC realize that it would not be able to continue fighting to categorize Ethereum as a security, as it did with XRP?\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that Coinbase submitted self-certifications with the CFTC on March 7, which could pave the way for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), if the CTFC has no complaints against it.\n\nConsequently, the SEC\u2019s prospects of overturning the \u201cProgrammatic Sales of XRP\u201d ruling might be impacted by the categorization of these aforementioned tokens as commodities by the CFTC. This could be one of the reasons why the SEC could be fighting the CFTC.\n\nRipple\u2019s Partial Victories Against The SEC\n\nRipple first secured a partial win in its lawsuit with the agency when Judge Analisa Torres declared in July last year that programmatic sales of XRP do not meet the requirements of the third prong of the Howey Test. Also, three months later, the SEC\u2019s request for an interlocutory appeal against the programmatic sales order was denied by the US Judge.\n\nDue to the order, the SEC will be unable to file an appeal until the conclusion of the ongoing SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. It is believed that the resolution of this dispute may have a profound impact on the US regulatory landscape and the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole.\n\nThe long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC began in 2020 when the Commission accused Ripple of selling XRP to US investors as an unregistered security. However, the lengthy battle is slowly approaching its climax as the grand trial is scheduled to take place by April 23.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Nearly $200 million in ETH burned as Ethereum gears up for Dencun upgrade - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum worth $190 million was burned during the past week, effectively reducing the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Cancun-Deneb upgrade is scheduled to occur on March 13.\n\nWhales are accumulating the altcoin while retail investors and small-wallet holders appear to be taking profits following Ether\u2019s rally.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has increased sharply in the past week as investors appear to be pricing in the positive effects of the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the possibility that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves this year exchange-traded funds that track Ether. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that almost $200 million in ETH were burned in the past week, another indicator of further price gains as it reduces the circulating supply of the altcoin.\n\nEthereum holders are anticipating the two catalysts that are likely to drive ETH price rally this cycle. The upcoming Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Hard Fork and the SEC\u2019s decision on the Spot Ethereum ETF are the two catalysts for the altcoin.\n\nEthereum price is $3,790 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price beats crypto market bloodbath nearly a week away from Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum price gains could be triggered by these catalysts\n\nEthereum price rally to the psychologically important $4,000 target and beyond could be catalyzed by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, an important technical improvement that resolves the scalability aspect of the so-called \u201cBlockchain Trilemma\u201d.\n\nThe Blockchain Trilemma is the trade-off between three important aspects: security, scalability and decentralization. Ethereum has prioritized decentralization and security, meaning that the scalability aspect can be improved with upgrades and Hard Forks to the blockchain.\n\nFind out more about why the Dencun upgrade is important and how it could reduce the transaction costs for Layer 2 chains, in this post.\n\nLooking at on-chain data, some indicators also signal upside momentum for Ethereum. The altcoin\u2019s circulating supply, which plays a role in gauging the asset\u2019s selling pressure, is declining. According to data from Ultrasound.money, $190 million worth of ETH was removed from the circulating supply by token burn.\n\nEther burned in the past week. Source: ultrasound.money\n\nAn analysis of the different cohorts of investors holding ETH, the so-called supply distribution, also signals the possibility of further price gains. While retail and small-wallet holders (those with 10 to 10,000 ETH) have shed their holdings and likely taken profits since the beginning of March, large-wallet investors are adding ETH to their holdings. Typically, whale accumulation has been a bullish sign for the asset and has preceded Ethereum price rally, as seen in the chart below.\n\n\n\nEthereum Supply Distribution. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum Network Realized Profit/Loss. Source: Santiment\n\nETH holders are also awaiting the SEC\u2019s decision about the potential approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF. The US regulator has several applications on the table, and the deadline to decide about them is May 23. Ethereum traders believe that an approval could usher institutional capital inflow and catalyze gains in ETH, as it has happened with Bitcoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price is $3,790, up nearly 13% in the past week."

        "title": "Two-thirds of EVM smart contract deployments in 2024 are from Optimism: Report - Blockworks",
        "content": "A Flipside Crypto report shows that over 637 million Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts have been deployed across seven layer-2 blockchains since January 2022.\n\nEVM-compatible smart contracts refer to software that the computing state of the Ethereum blockchain can understand.\n\nWith scaling solutions becoming more efficient and accessible, fewer EVM contracts are directly deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. With the Dencun update around the corner \u2014 which will introduce blob transactions and other infrastructure upgrades \u2014 this trend is likely to accelerate.\n\n\u201cWith layer-2s able to only publish critical data to ETH layer-1, the costs for interacting with layer-2s should significantly decrease. This enables much more creativity in protocol development, a much easier experience for users to have complex transactions abstracted away from them and ultimately lowers the costs for layer-2s to interoperate with each other,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at Flipside Crypto told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs debate future of account abstraction\n\nLeading this movement today is Optimism, an Ethereum optimistic rollup layer-2, which currently stands out as the most popular blockchain for deployments, accounting for over two-thirds (~70%) of the total EVM smart contract deployments so far this year. According to Flipside Crypto, the chain has seen over 28.8 million EVM deployments since Jan.1.\n\nHowever, for non-EVM smart contracts, Polygon and BNB smart chains (BSC) remain the most popular deployment chains. On Sept. 6 of last year, BSC saw 5.3 million contracts deployed, the most deployments seen on a chain ever, though this number quickly trailed off around Sept. 13.\n\nDeFi contracts on the rise\n\nDeFi smart contracts have been the most popular for developers across all chains this year, accounting for roughly 34.7% of all deployments that can be \u201ccategorized.\u201d This number is roughly 11.2% higher than in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBy contracts, NFT smart contracts, which drove the bull market between 2021 and 2022, have become less popular over time. Deployments decreased from 18.6% to 8.2% in the same period.\n\nRead more: Stellar sparks smart contract upgrade \u2014 and it\u2019s not an EVM\n\nMercado notes that this can be interpreted as both positive and negative.\n\n\u201cThe positive argument is that the space is finding product market fit, there\u2019s more tokens than ever and new primitives that enable lending, borrowing, options, perpetuals, oracles for more assets than ever,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nHe adds, \u201cthe somewhat negative argument is that given more money [is] flowing to more blockspace, fragmentation of liquidity is forcing more (arguably unproductive) activity: bridging and swapping for arbitrage as opposed to individuals\u2019 specific desire to be on a chain or have a token.\u201d\n\nMercado acknowledges both sides of the argument but notes his bias towards the space evolving faster than it is fragmenting.\n\nRead more: zkLink\u2019s Nexus wants to solve liquidity fragmentation between ZK ecosystems\n\n\u201cOther\u201d smart contracts\n\nUncategorized smart contracts, or those classified as \u201cother\u201d by Flipside Crypto, are by far the most commonly deployed smart contracts. They make up 93.8% of all smart contracts deployed across the observed chains.\n\nThis number is significantly higher than it was in 2022, where these smart contracts made up an estimated 37% of deployed contracts. It\u2019s also a little higher than in 2023, where these smart contracts made up around 86% of all deployments.\n\n\u201cWhile it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from this wide-ranging category, this figure, coupled with the growing proportion of dapps across all chains, suggests more experimentation and diversification at the protocol level,\u201d Flipside Crypto wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
