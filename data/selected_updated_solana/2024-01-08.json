        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Shares 4 Financial Tips - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin offers four financial tips to help new and seasoned investors mitigate risks amid massive volatility in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum boss shared the tips after famous blogger Alexander Voigt highlighted how diversification strategy helped Microsoft founder Bill Gate to build his net worth.\n\nHow Microsoft Founder Boosts Portfolio Using Diversification Strategy\n\nVoigt noted that when Gates became friends with prominent American businessman Warren Buffett, he sold most of his Microsoft shares. According to Voigt, the move helped Gates to diversify his portfolio and acquire other stocks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result of the decision, the Microsoft founder built his fortune to $138 billion. Voigt emphasized that Gates would have been worth only $1.33 billion if he did not diversify his portfolio.\n\nEthereum Founder Reacts, Offers 4 Financial Tips\n\nReacting, Buterin characterized Voigt\u2019s financial tip as awful. However, he offered four tips, which he described as \u201cactual financial advice.\u201d\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum founder first recognized the importance of diversification. Diversifying one\u2019s portfolio cannot be overemphasized, as it helps mitigate risks. Spreading your investment across various assets would ensure that the negative performance of one asset does not entirely affect your portfolio.\n\nSecondly, Buterin pointed out the importance of saving. He recommended that people should accumulate sufficient funds to the point where they can cover multiple years of expenses. It bears mentioning that there is no guarantee in investing, given the recent economic downturn that has wreaked havoc on most financial markets. Hence, saving more could help shield one from the problems associated with investing.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor the third point, Buterin encouraged investors to be boring with most of their portfolios. The concept of being boring with one\u2019s portfolio suggests that people should opt for low-cost and low-risk assets. Here, Buterin recommends that people be prudent with investing instead of committing their funds to high-risk assets.\n\nLastly, the Ethereum founder warned against using high leverage when investing in the futures markets. Specifically, he cautioned against using over 2X leverage. This advice is necessary, especially in crypto trading, where volatility is rife. Recall that following a 7% dip in Bitcoin price last week, over $655 million worth of long positions were liquidated. The majority of long traders who got liquidated were mainly those who used high leverages.\n\nButerin\u2019s financial tips are suitable for both new and seasoned crypto investors. They serve as a reminder, urging people to be prudent as they seek to bolster their portfolio."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Eruption Past $3k Imminent? Investors Unpack Vitalik \u2018s Bull Run Tips - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory for the past few months. The cryptocurrency value has soared from under $2,000 to $2,400, indicating a positive trend. However, the current market displays mixed sentiments about its future direction. The digital currency has been fluctuating within a defined range, showing signs of both strength and uncertainty.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price value has impressively hit $2,270, marking a 0.78% increase in just 24 hours. This rise suggests a positive market mood. The trading volume, according to data by CoinMarketCap, has also seen an 84% jump in the same period, reaching $509 million. With a market capitalization of $10 billion, Ethereum ranks second among cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum faces a consolidation phase, especially under the $2,400 mark. The leading smart contracts token has been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400 in the past week, with bears and bulls struggling. In the past year, Ether experienced a significant increase of over 79%, demonstrating resilience and optimism as bullish sentiment prevails despite occasional minor dips.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Investment Tips for Ethereum Enthusiasts\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared some investment wisdom. This came after a noted blogger, Alexander Voigt, discussed how diversification aided Bill Gates in wealth accumulation. Buterin, however, termed Voigt\u2019s advice as subpar and offered his own financial guidelines.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s tips are simple yet profound. He emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that a varied portfolio can reduce risk. He advises investors to save enough to cover multiple years of expenses, stressing the value of financial safety and freedom. Buterin also recommends keeping the bulk of one\u2019s portfolio in stable investments and strongly advises against using more than 2x leverage.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly relevant for both new and seasoned investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Adhering to such prudent strategies could potentially pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s price to surge past the $3,000 mark. If the bullish trend persists, this milestone could soon be within reach.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Supporting a Bullish Outlook\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price movement adds another layer of optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around the 50 mark, suggesting a balance in market momentum. On a 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased since breaking above the 200-day moving average and exiting a major descending channel. This bullish trend is visually evident through the formation of three four-hour green candlesticks.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has overtaken the signal line, indicating a positive market outlook. The rising histogram supports this bullish sentiment. The 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on an upward curve, and the 50-day MA crossing over the 200-day MA reaffirms the bullish market sentiment. The Chaikin money flow indicator is also in the positive region at 0.04, indicating a bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC could approve the world's first spot Bitcoin ETF later this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 0.01%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA -1.31%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."
