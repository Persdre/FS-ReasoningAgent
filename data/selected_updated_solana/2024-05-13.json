        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has calmed down considerably in the past 24 hours, halting the bearish assault and finding some consolidation in the process.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is trading at around $61K on Sunday morning, while Ethereum is now firmly below the pivotal $3K level.\n\nAre the Bitcoin Bulls Regrouping?\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a sudden correction, dropping below $61K and losing around 3.5% in a single day.\n\nThis seemingly had to do with a statement from a representative of the US Federal Reserve, who said that it may be too early to think about rate cuts.\n\nThe market has calmed down since then, and it seems that the worst is behind us.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets. Start receiving this recap, for free, every day: Invalid email address Your privacy is guranteed. Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nThe bulls even attempted a recovery, but it was quickly halted at around $61.4K when sellers stepped in and pushed the price to $61K, where it currently trades.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that despite the recent declines, the Fear and Greed index is still pointing out that the market is in a state of \u201cgreed.\u201d\n\nAltcoins Consolidate, Ethereum Below $3K\n\nNone of the major altcoins by means of total market capitalization has recovered from the crash the other day, but at least they are consolidating and charting ever so slight gains, as seen in the heatmap below.\n\nEven though the market seems to be completely painted in green, that\u2019s just the 24-hour heatmap. On a seven-day scale, most of the cryptocurrencies are trading in the red.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum is now consolidating below the critical psychological level of $3K, and it\u2019s very interesting to see if the buyers will be able to reclaim it soon.\n\nMeanwhile, today\u2019s best performers are Immutable (IMX) \u2013 up 4.7%, and Ribbon Finance (RBN) \u2013 up 3.3%.\n\nOn the other hand, the cryptocurrencies that performed the worst are Zebec Protocol (ZBC) \u2013 down 7.8%, and Kaspa (KAS) \u2013 down 4.8%."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Still a Millionaire-Maker Crypto? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, focus on future growth potential, not historical track record.\n\nSince its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH 0.10%) has skyrocketed in price from just $0.31 to $3,000 today. That's a nearly 10,000-fold return on your investment! If you had invested just a few hundred dollars in Ethereum a decade ago, you'd likely be a millionaire today.\n\nBut does Ethereum still have the power to make you a millionaire? While it's hard to argue with Ethereum's historical track record, things get a bit dicier when you consider its future prospects.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nWhen Ethereum launched back in 2015, it stood alone as the only smart contract blockchain platform. And, as such, it had an incredible first-mover advantage. Arguably, it was not until 2020, when blockchain upstart Solana (SOL -1.47%) appeared, that Ethereum saw its first legitimate rival.\n\nTo put that into perspective, imagine if your favorite Silicon Valley tech company had an incredible five-year head start on the competition. After that time period, it would probably appear to have an insurmountable lead when it comes to market share, intellectual property, and customer lock-in. Quite frankly, it would look unstoppable.\n\nThat's why I think Ethereum's ability to replicate its historical track record is limited at best. There's simply too much competition now, and Ethereum is no longer the only major Layer-1 blockchain. Check for yourself -- three of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap are direct Ethereum rivals. That type of competition simply did not exist back in 2015.\n\nIncremental vs. disruptive innovation\n\nMoreover, I've soured a bit on Ethereum's endless blockchain upgrades. Yes, the 2022 blockchain upgrade known as The Merge was impressive. People have compared that technical feat to changing the engine of an airplane while in mid-flight. The Merge resulted in a total transformation of Ethereum. In the process, Ethereum became faster, cheaper to use, and more efficient in processing transactions.\n\nHowever, Ethereum originally promised us 1 million transactions per second, and we're nowhere close to that. Of even more concern, Ethereum now relies on a complicated mix of Layer 2 blockchains for scalability and functionality. The core Ethereum blockchain (i.e., the Layer 1) just isn't fast or efficient enough to handle current transaction volumes. So, we have several more upgrade cycles to go, each filled with new tweaks and upgrades.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with incremental innovation, of course. But there's a big difference between incremental innovation and truly disruptive innovation. And that's what has me concerned about Ethereum -- we may have witnessed the end of disruptive innovation with The Merge. And that's going to open up the door for fast, nimble competitors to challenge Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC and regulatory risk\n\nFinally, there's the pesky little matter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ever since The Merge, the SEC hasn't quite made up its mind about whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security. When Ethereum converted into a proof-of-stake blockchain as part of The Merge, it changed the way that people interact with the blockchain, with possible regulatory consequences.\n\nFor example, the process of staking crypto could be interpreted by some as \"the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\" According to the SEC, that would make Ethereum a security.\n\nThis might sound incredibly wonky from a legal perspective, but it matters for investors. There are some Bitcoin maximalists delighting right now in Ethereum's potential regulatory quandary, and there is a very real risk that the SEC could deem Ethereum to be a security. If that happens, all bets are off. I don't think it would pose an existential risk for Ethereum, but it would certainly scare away a lot of investors.\n\nThe myth of the 1,000x crypto\n\nIf you have $1,000 to invest in crypto today, you would need a 1,000-fold return on your investment to become a millionaire. So, let's reframe the original question of Ethereum being a millionaire-maker crypto in the following way: Can Ethereum increase 1,000 times in value from its current price of $3,000?\n\nThat would suggest a stratospherically high $3 million price tag for a single Ethereum coin sometime in the near future. Given Ethereum's circulating supply of 120 million coins, that would imply a total market cap of $360 trillion! By comparison, the total market cap of the S&P 500 these days is about $50 trillion.\n\nAt the end of the day, investing based only on past performance is like driving a car by only looking in the rearview mirror. So stop focusing so much on Ethereum's historical track record, and focus more on how it's going to create value in the future."

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Will Reach $5,000 by the End of 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Ethereum is going to hit a new all-time high of $5,000 in 2025, here's what needs to happen.\n\nIt's been a strange year for Ethereum (ETH 0.02%). The world's second-largest crypto exploded out of the gate early, soaring from $2,200 in January to $4,000 by mid-March. It looked like Ethereum was easily going to reach the $5,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut that's not what happened. Ethereum fell in value after hitting its high-water mark of $4,000, and now sits right at the $3,000 level. The good news, though, is that there are two key catalysts that could help Ethereum reach the $5,000 level by the end of 2025.\n\nThe arrival of altcoin season\n\nFirst and most importantly, there's the arrival of \"altcoin season.\" This refers to the period of the crypto bull market cycle when lesser-known altcoins explode in value. This typically happens during the early stages of a Bitcoin halving cycle, when investors start to diversify their holdings in search of higher returns.\n\nConsider what happened during the previous altcoin season, which lined up nicely with the start of the previous Bitcoin halving cycle in May 2020. On the date of the halving, Ethereum was trading under $200. One year later, it was trading for $3,800. It eventually went on to hit an all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that this same pattern will happen again in 2024, it's clear that investors are starting to look around for other places to invest their money beyond just Bitcoin. Thus far, meme coins and AI crypto tokens have gotten all the attention, but the time could be coming soon for larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe other big factor would be SEC approval of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) similar to the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. Admittedly, these spot Ethereum ETFs would likely not see the same types of inflows as the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, but the influx of new money would still be significant. And that new influx of money would presumably help to push the price of Ethereum higher over the next 18 months.\n\nAs in the case of the Bitcoin ETFs, there are a number of influential Wall Street players fighting to make them a reality. These include the likes of Ark Invest and BlackRock, both of which now have extraordinarily successful spot Bitcoin ETFs. Approval for these new spot Ethereum ETFs was supposed to come in May, but it now looks like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will push off approval for these ETFs until the end of the summer.\n\nThe impact of these new spot Ethereum ETFs could be huge. Arguably, the primary reason why Ethereum soared in price from $2,200 to $4,000 earlier this year was the expectation that the new spot Ethereum ETFs were coming soon. Wall Street got a bit ahead of itself, and was already starting to price in their impact. So, it's not out of the range of possibility that Ethereum could soar from its current price of $3,000 to $4,000 once these new investment products are approved.\n\nBeware the SEC\n\nThe only problem, of course, is that there's something about Ethereum that the SEC does not like. Ever since Ethereum transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain in September 2022 as part of The Merge, the SEC has been looking for reasons to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nRecently, the concerns about potential SEC oversight have returned, and that has had a chilling effect on Ethereum's price. That's why I don't think Ethereum will reach the $5,000 mark this year -- investors need to have absolute clarity about regulatory risk before Ethereum can skyrocket in price.\n\nThe good news here is that the regulatory climate appears to be shifting in Washington, D.C., in favor of pro-crypto legislation. And some lawmakers have spoken out publicly about the potential overreach of the SEC and the need to change crypto's regulatory framework after the 2024 election.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nThe future price trajectory of Ethereum will depend, to a considerable degree, on the price trajectory of Bitcoin. If you assume that Bitcoin can hit a price of $150,000 by the end of 2025, as many crypto investors now do, then Ethereum has the potential to soar in value to $7,500.\n\nUsing just a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, it's easy to see why this is possible. A $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin implies a $3 trillion market cap. If you then multiply that figure by 0.3 (which is the ratio of Ethereum's current market cap to Bitcoin's current market cap), you arrive at a market cap figure of $900 billion for Ethereum by the end of 2025. Given Ethereum's circulating coin supply of 120 million, that implies a price of $7,500.\n\nSo, while $5,000 might sound at first like a pie-in-the-sky price forecast, it's really not. In fact, it's a bit conservative. As long as the SEC doesn't get involved, Ethereum has a real chance to hit $5,000 by the end of 2025."

This sudden decrease has sparked widespread speculation among traders and analysts. Many believe that large-volume institutional actions, coupled with the temporary closure of the BTC ETF market, might have driven the drop.\n\nDespite this recent dip, market experts like Rekt Capital remain optimistic, suggesting that the end of this challenging \"danger zone\" could be in sight. Historically, such periods have been marked by sharp downturns followed by eventual stabilizations.

This large-scale transaction has intensified concerns over Ethereum's future price direction. Market indicators are not promising, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a decrease in investor interest and key averages indicating a bearish outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Ethereum's substantial trading volume of $10.1 billion over the last 24 hours, the price has declined by 4.07%, fluctuating between $2,935.95 and $2,894.15. Analysts have pinpointed the $3,017 level as a crucial resistance point; surpassing this could potentially shift the momentum to a bullish trend and help Ethereum break out of its current descending channel pattern.\n\nHowever, several factors are complicating this outlook. The cryptocurrency has been in a descending channel since mid-March, and the delayed approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added to the bearish sentiment. Moreover, the recent Dencun hard fork, which was intended to enhance Ethereum's scalability, did not have the expected positive impact on its price, leading to further speculation about its effectiveness and future impact on Ethereum's market performance.\n\nThese developments paint a complex picture for Ethereum as it navigates through ongoing market challenges and investor scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Attract Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors\n\nThe Furrever Token (FURR) has introduced an exciting $20,000 competition, targeting holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to diversify into its presale phase, which prominently features cat-themed imagery and an engaging, playful ecosystem. Operating on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token is currently offering 65% of its approximately 9 billion token supply to early investors, signaling a strong start with over $1 million raised in just two months.\n\nAs the presale progresses, Furrever Token continues to captivate the community's interest, with its current price set at a modest $0.000648.
