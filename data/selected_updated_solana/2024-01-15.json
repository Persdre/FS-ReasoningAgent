        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says Ethereum (ETH) is setting up for a sizeable rally after successfully completing a long consolidation phase.\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto analyst known as Pentoshi tells his 742,000 followers on the social media platform X that he believes Ethereum is on its way to the $3,500 range, the upper level of a range he sees ETH trading in.\n\n\u201cETH.\n\nWent to the mid-range of the new range we are in.\n\nYear-long consolidation into mid.\n\nExpect the higher range sometime Q1 early Q2.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,511.\n\nPentoshi is also keeping an eye on ETH\u2019s biggest rival, Solana (SOL). According to the popular analyst, SOL, which had a dramatic run in the latter part of 2023, needs to consolidate for some time before making any new moves.\n\nHe pinpoints the $70 level as potential support for Solana.\n\n\u201cSOL.\n\nThink this is just going to take time to play out. So far following squiggly [line]. While there is support just below here where it bounced from, think there has to be at least 30 days of consolidation somewhere. Even if we don\u2019t see that $70 area.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading for $95.49 at time of writing.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, Pentoshi says that the recent approval of the spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a huge win for the crypto markets.\n\n\u201cDay one volume record already broken on the BTC ETF. What [does it] mean?\n\nAnd what does it mean for other digital currencies?\n\nWill give a few hints:\n\n1. Others in line for ETF\n\n2. This is a great advertisement for the space. A ton of new eyes and entrants will come as a result\n\n3.

        "title": "Ethereum Rival Records Nearly 2,000% Growth in Unique Active Wallets Last Year: DappRadar - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Crypto intelligence platform DappRadar says user activity on one Ethereum (ETH) challenger exploded in 2023 as decentralized applications (DApps) saw remarkable growth during the period.\n\nAccording to DappRadar\u2019s yearly industry report, smart contract platform Near (NEAR) recorded 302,000 new unique active wallets (UAWs) last year, marking a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 1,902%, the most out of any chain.\n\nEnterprise-grade blockchain Klaytn (KLAY) and layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) rank next to Near as the networks with the highest UAW increase gain with 73,000 new UAWs, representing a 1,099% increase, and 88,000 UAWs, a 624% increase, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn terms of chain performance, Near, Klaytn, and Arbitrum were the top gainers in UAW percentage increase. They had also a good performance looking with their token, as Near had an increase of 200% since the beginning of the year, Klaytn a 20% and Arbitrum a 32% increase since its launch in March 2023.\u201d\n\nConversely, DappRadar says Ethereum rival Solana (SOL) recorded only 65,000 new UAWs in 2023, a 76% drop on a year-over-year basis. Web3-focused blockchain Hive (HIVE) saw 77,000 new UAWs, representing a 68% drop, as per the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana experienced a rough start of the year, influenced by its association with the FTX fallout. However, the Solana ecosystem saw an impressive recovery during the last months of 2023. Hive, primarily hosting the trading card game Splinterlands, also had a difficult year, missing financial targets and reporting significant losses.\u201d\n\nOverall, DappRadar says the DApp industry had a good run in 2023 with a 124% YoY increase in UAWs and ending the year with an average of 4.2 million daily UAWs.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, the DApp industry surpassed all expectations, and reinforced the notion that it\u2019s an enduring and evolving part of the global financial and technological landscape.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The Terra Luna Classic community looks beyond the typical chain developments to a more diverse approach by enabling Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) support on the chain. It will help the community-led Terra Classic chain to become compliant with new and emerging technologies, introducing many advantages.\n\nInterestingly, the EVM support will allow Terra Luna Classic to use the Solidity programming language, mostly used on EVM chains.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTerra Luna Classic EVM Functionality\n\nProposal 11978 \u201cInvestigate EVM Functionality\u201d is under voting on the Station wallet and has already surpassed the pass threshold. The EVM will expand Terra Luna Classic use cases by bringing the programmability and composability of the EVM and sovereignty and interoperability of the Cosmos.\n\nThe proposal has received over 62% votes in favor, with 29 validators supporting the proposal. The deadline for voting is January 17.\n\n\u201cTerra Classic will have the potential to become compliant with new and emerging technologies like Optimistic transactions, where Terra Classic does not need to send direct security information on each transaction, and Rollups, which allow significantly more transactions to be processed at once, dramatically increasing the processing power of Terra Classic,\u201d said ClanMudhorn of Terrarium validator.\n\nEVM support on Terra Classic presents a strategic move toward interoperability and adoption of widely-used blockchain development standards. This can attract projects such as Curve DAO, Uniswap, ChainLink, Hedera, and others.\n\nMoreover, the limitations of inter-blockchain communication (IBC) on EVM will provide added advantage to Terra Luna Classic. The proposal outlines potential approaches, emphasizing a cautious and governance-driven decision-making process.\n\nRead More: Judge Denies Terra & Do Kwon\u2019s Request For Reconsidering Court Ruling\n\nLUNC and USTC Price Momentum Fades\n\nLUNC price jumps over 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000127. The 24-hour high and low are $0.000118 and $0.000126, respectively. Moreover, trading volume has increased by 40% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.\n\nMeanwhile, USTC price trades at $0.027, up over 10% in a week.
