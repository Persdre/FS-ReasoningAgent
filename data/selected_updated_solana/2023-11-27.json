        "title": "Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin Wants to Redesign the Network - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "One of the most important figures in the digital asset sector, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared his intention to redesign the entire network. Indeed, Buterin spoke in Turkey where he discussed plans that would bring widespread changes to users across the network.\n\nMoreover, Buterin had outlined an overall strategy that he would seek to employ for those changes. Specifically, they would target an enhancement to the staking of ETH, and performance issues that have occurred regarding addresses. The latter has notably been an issue for the network in years past.\n\nSource: CoinDesk\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Says He Hasn\u2019t Sold Ethereum (EHT) Since 2018\n\nButerin Seeking to Implement Widespread Changes to Ethereum\n\nWithin the mainstream perception of digital assets, two tokens reign supreme. Specifically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have become staples for the industry. Subsequently, those connected to the assets have become some of its most important entities. Now, one of those individuals is set to bring forth massive changes to one network.\n\nSpeaking at Devconnect in Turkey, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delved into his plans to redesign the network. Specifically, Wu Blockchain reported that the changes to the platform are connected to staking and performance concerns. Ultimately, any issues would have widespread changes in the user experience.\n\nVitalik Buterin stated at the Devconnect in Turkey that he plans to redesign Ethereum staking and solve problems affecting performance. He recognizes the UTXO payment model and hopes to integrate private mempools, ERC-4337, code pre-compilation, ZK-EVMs and liquid staking in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 27, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Founder Discusses ETH Staking Changes\n\nThe plans Buterin is seeking to set in motion include the integration of private mempools and ERC-4337. Indeed, the former would bring about greater security and privacy to the operating network. This would be done through the authorization of transactions without the intentions being displayed to the public mempool. therefore, they would be far less a target of potential exploits.\n\nSubseuqnlety, ERC-4337 is related to account abstraction, and giving users more control over their own accounts. Therefore, things like multisig wallets become far easier to implement, and far more secure for users. Altogether, these plans are geared toward pushing the network forward and encouraging the protection of users across its operations."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's cofounder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an ambitious redesign for the Ethereum network, which, if implemented, could have profound implications for users and developers. Speaking at Devconnect in Turkey, Buterin outlined a strategy to enhance Ethereum staking and address performance issues that have been persistent thorns in the network's side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin's vision includes integrating private mempools and ERC-4337. Private mempools could offer users enhanced privacy and security by allowing them to conduct transactions without exposing their intentions to the public mempool where miners could see and potentially exploit them. ERC-4337 refers to account abstraction, allowing users to have more sophisticated control over their accounts, with operations like multisig wallets becoming easier to implement and more secure.\n\nCode precompilation is another feature Buterin is keen on integrating. This could potentially increase the efficiency of smart contract deployment, making them quicker and cheaper to execute by preprocessing some elements of the code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiquid staking, a process that allows stakers to liquify staked (or locked) assets, is a feature Buterin wants to see improved. He has expressed concerns over the centralization of liquid staking solutions, which could be a risk for the network if too much control is in the hands of a few entities like Lido Finance. Decentralizing this aspect could democratize the staking process, giving more users the chance to participate without relinquishing liquidity.\n\nThe redesign Buterin proposes would likely make Ethereum more scalable, secure and efficient. These changes could lower the barriers to entry for new users and developers, fostering a more inclusive and robust ecosystem. The exact impact on Ethereum's price and the broader crypto market is speculative, but typically, improvements that address fundamental issues and enhance usability bode well for the network's value and adoption."

Discover SCENE\n\nMagic Eden sees a crypto future that spans multiple blockchains\u2014and is launching its crypto wallet browser extension in closed beta to support that aim, the firm behind the NFT marketplace announced Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a multi-chain world for NFTs,\u201d Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu told Decrypt in an interview.\n\n\u201cUp until today, for a user to really experience all the different products and features and great content that we have on every chain, they effectively have to download three wallets,\u201d Lu said of the current challenges plaguing the wallet space that have led to user fragmentation on Magic Eden.\n\nThe marketplace\u2019s crypto wallet is launching for the Google Chrome browser first, but a Safari browser version and mobile app are also in the works. The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors. Beta version is now live and only available to a small group of early testers! Want to give it a try?

For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Step Aside Bitcoin and Ether, GameStop Memes Is the Crypto You Can't Afford To Miss - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Learn about the tempting financial potential that GameStop Memes offers in the middle of the rising Bitcoin and Ether Option activity.\n\nOpportunities emerge from the most unlikely tales in the world of cryptocurrencies. The growth of GameStop Memes (GSM), a coin inspired by the legendary Wall Street Memes narrative, is one such story that has enthralled the crypto market. As the notional open interest of active Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts on Deribit reaches a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, now is the time to look into why GameStop Memes is a great investment opportunity in today's crypto scene.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Drive The Scene\n\nBefore we get into GameStop Memes, it's important to understand the context in which this crypto gem is set. The notionally open interest in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts has skyrocketed, according to Deribit, a large cryptocurrency exchange. As reported by Swiss-based Laevitas, this sum has already reached a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, virtually matching the peak set in November 2021, when Bitcoin was selling at an eye-popping $66,000.\n\nIt's worth noting that the current open interest in these contracts substantially outnumbers that of November 2021. With nearly twice the number of outstanding contracts, it's not just a triumph for Deribit, but also a strong indication of the cryptocurrency market's expansion and increased interest in options.\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the show's main attraction - GameStop Memes. It all started in early 2021, when retail traders banded together to support GameStop, defying Wall Street's hegemony. This game-changing campaign demonstrated to the globe that the masses could, in fact, take on the financial system. GameStop Memes sprang from this maelstrom of events.\n\nGameStop Memes is here to carry on the tradition, representing the original GameStop movement's spirit of rebellion, solidarity, and humour. This token is about more than simply investing; it's about making a commitment to the future, about democratising finance and offering tools for financial empowerment and education.\n\nThe unique strategy of GameStop Memes distinguishes it in the enormous ocean of cryptocurrencies. It combines memes with finance to make investing more approachable and pleasurable. So, what makes GameStop Memes such an appealing investment potential in today's crypto environment? Let's look more closely:\n\nA Tribute To GameStop\n\nGameStop Memes celebrates the legendary GameStop movement. It is a sign of opposition to traditional structures that frequently exclude individuals. This homage keeps the communal spirit alive and well.\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nUnlike many cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes places the community at the centre of its operations. It seeks to unite people all around the world with a common objective to democratise finances and provide resources for financial empowerment and education.\n\nSecure And Transparent\n\nIn the crypto realm, transparency and security are crucial. GameStop Memes achieves both by providing a safe environment for its users while retaining operational openness. This degree of confidence is priceless in the crypto world.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics\n\nGameStop Memes aren't only about making money in the near run. Its revolutionary tokenomics are intended to assure long-term involvement and stability. This emphasis on sustainability distinguishes it from many other speculative coins on the market.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nGameStop Memes offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger, something that celebrates the strength of the community and the lighter side of finance. While notional open interest in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on Deribit continues to rise, GameStop Memes serves as a timely reminder that the unexpected may frequently produce the most substantial returns in the crypto realm. Don't miss out on this revolutionary adventure, invest in GameStop Memes and become a part of the movement that is redefining financial rules.\n\nGameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Back in 2009, Bitcoin was the only blockchain. Fast-forward 15 years and add tens of billions of dollars of investor cash, and now there are thousands of them.\n\nWith so many different blockchains out there, knowing how to compare them and across what metrics is essential for investors and users alike.\n\nThis article explores how to use DefiLlama to compare blockchains and why doing so matters.\n\nHow to compare blockchains\n\nDefiLlama harvests public data to keep tabs on the inflows and outflows of money across hundreds of blockchains.\n\nTo access it, go to the DefiLlama website and click the Compare Chains tab under the DeFi dashboards section.\n\nUsers can pit blockchains against each other and compare them across several metrics, like total value locked, fees and revenue, active users, and transaction count.\n\nTotal Value Locked\n\nIn the context of blockchains, TVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency that is deposited into smart contracts on a particular blockchain.\n\nA higher blockchain TVL is usually a reflection of its popularity with investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHowever, TVL can sometimes be misleading.\n\nFor example, Ethereum\u2019s TVL is much higher than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 even though Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is triple that of Ethereum.\n\nThe higher TVL is down to Ethereum\u2019s greater support for smart contracts. DeFi protocols built using complex smart contracts, such as decentralised exchanges and lending protocols, have attracted tens of billions of dollars of deposits.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s TVL is minuscule because of its limited support for smart contracts.\n\nThe total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain is tiny compared to Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nFees and revenue\n\nWhile TVL is still a great way to gauge a blockchain\u2019s popularity at a glance, looking at other metrics within the Compare Chains dashboard can help create a more complete comparison.\n\nComparing the fees and revenue two blockchains create can yield insights into not only user activity, but also how financially sustainable they are.\n\nLet\u2019s use DefiLlama to compare Ethereum and Optimism.\n\nHere we can see a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees go back to the network as revenue \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case these fees are burned. On Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 network, a much smaller proportion of its fees are kept as revenue.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum layer 2, makes less revenue than the blockchain it is built on top of. (DefiLlama)\n\nThat is because Optimism has to pay the Ethereum network it is built on top of to confirm transactions. The majority of transaction fees Optimism charges users are paid to Ethereum, while Optimism keeps what\u2019s left.\n\nEven so, Optimism, along with other Ethereum layer 2 networks, produce millions of dollars of revenue each month.\n\nActive users and transactions\n\nThe Active Users and Transactions metrics are powerful in and of themselves. But when combined they can reveal deeper insights into the behaviour of the users on different blockchains.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s compare the active users on Polygon and Ethereum. On DefiLlama, the active users metric is synonymous with active wallet addresses.\n\nPolygon, a blockchain with lower transaction fees, has more active addresses than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nAs we can see in the example, Polygon has a little over 60,000 more active addresses than Ethereum does.\n\nNext, let\u2019s compare transactions.\n\nPolygon also processes many more transactions than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nHere we can see Polygon processes almost three times the number of transactions Ethereum does.\n\nNow, let\u2019s combine these two comparisons.\n\nBy dividing daily transactions by daily active addresses on Nov. 15, we find that each Polygon address made an average of 7.7 transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, however, each address only made an average of 3.5 transactions.\n\nSo, what might be behind this difference? Well, Ethereum transaction fees are much higher than those on Polygon, which could be one influence.\n\nBut be careful when comparing transactions \u2014 not all blockchains allow for a fair comparison.\n\nFor example, Solana\u2019s transaction count is much higher than any other blockchain DefiLlama lists. Is this because Solana users are just more active? Maybe not.\n\nIt\u2019s actually because around 85% of all Solana transactions are from validators communicating with each other every time the network creates a new block. Such transactions happen automatically to keep the blockchain running.\n\nWhy are blockchains different from each other?\n\nAside from popularity and marketing, there are fundamental differences between blockchains based on what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nA lot of what makes a specific blockchain unique can be boiled down to its approach to solving the so-called blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma posits that blockchains want to achieve sufficient security, scalability and decentralisation, but can only ever solve any two at the same time by sacrificing the third.\n\nIn the context of blockchains, security, scalability and decentralisation are defined as follows:\n\nSecurity. Some blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated.\n\nSome blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated. Scalability. Some blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic.\n\nSome blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic. Decentralisation. Some blockchains are more decentralised than others. In more decentralised networks, control and consensus rests in the hands of the community; in less decentralised networks, a smaller group of people call the shots.\n\nA fast blockchain that can process lots of transactions at once might have to sacrifice decentralisation to achieve those high speeds. Conversely, some blockchains sacrifice speed and transaction throughput to maintain higher security.\n\nDecentralisation, though, is what sets blockchains apart from other payment networks. Truly decentralised networks minimise centralised weak points and are more resistant to censorship. The most decentralised blockchains are public blockchains, like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, some networks, known as private blockchains, happily forsake decentralisation for speed and security. These networks, such as the ConsenSys Quorum or Sygnum\u2019s Desygnate, are invite-only.\n\nPrivate blockchains\u2019 security and speed is top-notch, but only for a select group of users. There are usually just a handful of companies that validate and view transactions.\n\nNext steps\n\nCompare active users and transactions across different blockchains and find out which ones have the most active users.\n\nInvestigate different approaches to the blockchain trilemma and read about those who claim to have solved the problem."
