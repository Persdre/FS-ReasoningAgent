        "content": "The cryptocurrency market wraps up a dynamic week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding steady after a significant drop in inflation. Despite the resilience of the market leaders, the spotlight was on altcoins, particularly Kaspa (KSP), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), showcasing notable gains and hinting at potential growth in the near future.\n\nAltcoins Take Center Stage\n\nKaspa (KSP) emerged as the week\u2019s star performer, experiencing an impressive 64% surge, reaching a peak of $0.1519. As of the latest data, KSP is trading at $0.1379, maintaining robust performance despite a slight 2.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nRender (RNDR) followed closely behind, boasting a 50% gain over the week. Currently trading at $3.58, RNDR displays a marginal 3.46% increase in price, accompanied by a 42.49% decrease in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) captured attention with a weekly increase exceeding 30%, now trading at $2.18.

AVAX showed a 24% increase, IMX rose by 22%, and MNT exhibited a 10% uptick, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum remained stable after a notable drop in inflation from a 40-year high last June, currently standing at 3.2%, slightly above the Fed\u2019s target, according to the CPI report. Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase, trading just below its annual peak at approximately $38,000 earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge marks its most robust four-week performance since January, witnessing a remarkable 42% increase from just under $17,000 to nearly $24,000.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to rise above the $37,000 mark, riding high on the news of the Argentine presidential election win of Bitcoin-friendly Javier Milei. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, cashed in on a boost caused due to Fidelity seeking Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) and climbed above the $2,000 mark. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.41 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 1.75 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $37,175.82, registering a 24-hour jump of 1.80 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

To maintain this positive momentum, Bitcoin will need to clear the resistance at the $37,800 mark or risk finding support around $36,500. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Near Procol (NEAR) has marked a substantial 17 percent price increase over the past week, thanks to its partnership with the South Korean platform Zep for metaverse game development. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading around the $2,000 threshold.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate \u2014 Javier Milei \u2014 won the elections in Argentina. On this account, BTC (+2.2 percent) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37,200 levels. Analysts predict support to range between $33,000 to $34,500 with resistance at $38,000. On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF. Joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, the entry of such financial giants in embracing crypto provides positive signals for the sector.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cDogecoin soared dramatically following a groundbreaking partnership with SpaceX, propelling its value to unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, Bitcoin faces market fluctuations, prompting reflection and comparisons to its 2021 performance. Tether strategically invests $500 million in Bitcoin mining, signalling a deliberate expansion and diversification within the stablecoin sector.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. Overall, while favouring bullish trends above $36,400, the market remains cautious, with immediate resistance and support key for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap crossed the 1.4-trillion dollar mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. ETH breached the $2,000 mark per piece due to the euphoria around the Blackrock spot Ethereum ETF application. BTC crossed the $37,000 mark over the weekend and the market is expected to ride the ETF wave in the coming weeks owing to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, both BTC and ETH showed strength, each gaining more than 2.5 percent. This unexpected resilience during the usually quiet weekends might be because of the positive news about Javier Milei, a supporter of Bitcoin, winning the presidential election in Argentina. He sees Bitcoin as a way to return money to the private sector. Looking at the technical side, BTC has consistently bounced back from an important incline trendline support and the 20EMA Daily. Currently, it's trading a bit above $37,300, aiming for the next resistance at $38,000. As for ETH, it's sitting around the Support and resistance flip level of $2,011.
