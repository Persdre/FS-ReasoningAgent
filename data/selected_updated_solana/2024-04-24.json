        "title": "Ethereum Price Jumps As TRON Founder Justin Sun Accumulates 15K ETH, What\u2019s Next? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by global market cap, appears to have ignited a torrent of optimism among crypto market traders and investors globally today, April 24. As ETH\u2019s price action illustrated a considerable rebound, followed by heightened whale activity orbiting the token, the eternal Solana rival garnered noteworthy investor attention today, with crypto market participants speculating about the token\u2019s price action ahead.\n\nNotably, TRON founder Justin Sun, a prominent figure within the crypto realm, continued accumulating staggering amounts of ETH, per today\u2019s on-chain data. Meanwhile, whale activity surrounding the token has been burgeoning over the past few days, with bullish sentiments swirling around ETH. Here\u2019s a closer look at why Ethereum curates market optimism with whales buying the token despite its sideways trading over the past few days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Accumulations Note A Spike, Fuels Market Optimism\n\nAccording to Lookonchain\u2019s insights, a blockchain data analytics platform, the Justin Sun-linked wallet 0x4359 withdrew 15,389 ETH, worth $49.78 million, from Binance today, April 24, nabbing global attention. This massive accumulation by Sun underscored a heightened sense of confidence in the asset\u2019s future, birthing immediate bullish sentiments for the ETH price trajectory ahead.\n\nIntriguingly, CoinGape Media spotlighted a plethora of ETH whale accumulations yesterday, weighing in on the token\u2019s optimistic take on the market. Per the report, Justin Sun invested a staggering $1 billion in Ethereum yesterday, further anchoring the TRON founder\u2019s confidence in the asset. This, coupled with the rising Ethereum whale accumulations, paints a highly bullish outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price action ahead.\n\nAlso read: Crypto News: FTC Votes to Ban Noncompete Agreements in Employment Contracts\n\nEthereum Price Jumps\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum token\u2019s price has been noted to have gained 1.67% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,242. The ETH market cap sprung 1.58%, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume upswing of 2.16%, amassing slight optimism on the token.\n\nThis price rebound showcased by ETH primarily aligns with the colossal accumulations recorded in the past few days, as mentioned above. However, derivatives data for the token signals reduced investor interest and market activity for the token, underscoring a potential downtrend for Ethereum in the market as of press time. Coinglass revealed a 0.39% dip in the token\u2019s open interest, accompanied by a derivatives volume fall of 2.88%.\n\nThis painted an uncertain scenario surrounding ETH\u2019s price action ahead, as bulls or bears may take over the token at any moment in the future. Nonetheless, with post-BTC halving optimism, further accompanied by significant whale accumulations, crypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token, hoping to see a rising price action ahead.\n\nAlso Read: Block Inc Successfully Wraps Up Bitcoin Mining Chip Development\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "What Is Xai? The Rising Ethereum Layer-3 Gaming Network on Arbitrum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new gaming blockchain has entered the lobby in 2024: Xai.\n\n\u201cXai is built to enable open trade in the next generation of video games,\u201d the official site says. In its quest to do so, the network aims to reduce fees, offer account abstraction to hide some of those pesky blockchain elements, and empower game creators in the process.\n\nThe layer-3 blockchain is developed in part by Offchain Labs, the original creator and primary developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum network that Xai is built on top of. And Xai is getting help from game developer Ex Populus, which will deploy the first games planned to launch on the network in collaboration with the Xai Foundation.\n\nBut what does this really mean? We\u2019ve rounded up all you need to know.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Xai?\n\nMany crypto users are familiar with the concept of layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling networks built on top of them, but Xai brands itself as a layer-3 network. This is because it\u2019s built atop Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum.\n\nIn practicality, this means that Xai keeps Arbitrum\u2019s core functionalities the same while tweaking certain aspects of the network for a more targeted experience intended for a specific use case. While Arbitrum is a general layer-2 scaling solution that can be tapped for all kinds of apps, Xai specifically caters to the needs of gamers and game developers alike.\n\nFor example, Xai offers account abstraction\u2014meaning it\u2019ll hide confusing parts from users\u2014when it comes to the blockchain wallet and account experience. The network also provides developers with increased gas and contract limits.\n\nMost notably, the Xai site says that it \u201cintroduces parallel processing and advancements for enhanced scalability, efficiency, and cost reduction.\u201d That\u2019s on top of Arbitrum\u2019s existing layer-2 approach, which handles transactions away from the Ethereum mainnet to do so at a lower cost and greater volume via its optimistic rollup tech.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy reducing fees and increasing transaction times, Xai aims to create a smoother gaming experience while embracing the unique elements that make blockchain gaming what it is\u2014such as true ownership of unique, in-game items, as well as tokenized economies.\n\n\u201cThe cheaper and faster we can make things,\u201d Ex Populus co-founder and CEO Tobias Batton told Decrypt, \u201cthe better experience we can provide users.\u201d\n\nWhat is the XAI token?\n\nKicking off 2024 with a bang, 125 million XAI tokens (5% of the token supply) were airdropped to gamers, according to the Xai Foundation. The airdrop\u2019s total value was nearly $70 million at launch, growing to $140 million less than a week later.\n\nThe XAI token\u2019s primary purpose is to be used as the gas fee token on the layer-3 blockchain. But there are also potential benefits, as XAI tokens can be exchanged for esXAI (or escrowed XAI) tokens and staked to earn interest-like rewards.\n\nOnce you have staked your esXAI tokens, you're able to participate in staking pools. Coming in Q4 2024, you\u2019ll also be able to participate in governance as well as gain \u201cexclusive access\u201d to special events and assets associated with projects on the Xai blockchain.\n\nWhich games are building on Xai?\n\nAll of this technical stuff is great, but a gaming network is ultimately defined by the games on it. After all, no one would buy a PS5 if it had no games. So which games are being built on Xai?\n\nWith Ex Populus as a key partner, the developer has committed its suite of games to the layer-3 network. Currently, we know two of the games that are in development by Ex Populus: rogue-lite auto-battler Final Form, and hover car action shooter LAMOverse. But the studio\u2019s website also states that an open-world experience is currently in pre-production, with details still to be announced.\n\nOutside of this partnership, early this year it was announced that Crypto Unicorns and its related NFT games will migrate from Ethereum sidechain network Polygon to Xai. Crypto Unicorns NFTs have generated $35 million of trading volume. The switch was motivated primarily due to \u201cchallenges\u201d that arose when operating a game on Polygon, the team told Decrypt, namely in the form of network gas fee spikes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter that, a prominent indie gaming curator called The MIX, or The Media Indie Exchange, said that it plans to launch over 100 games on Xai before the end of 2024. While what games will be launched on the network is yet to be confirmed, Xai said that \u201cmany\u201d of the games are already on Steam and will be reworked to benefit from blockchain tech.\n\nThis means that it's likely that currently Web2 games are going to get Web3 functionality using Xai, which The MIX suggests will bear a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to how Valve allows players to buy and sell Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in-game items.\n\nMost recently, Reboot, the crypto gaming protocol powering Pixel Vault\u2019s flagship game BattlePlan, announced an alliance with the Xai Foundation to migrate the game to the network. Sometime this quarter, BattlePlan will move one layer deeper from Arbitrum Nova to Xai in an attempt to \u201cenhance player experience.\u201d\n\nHow staking works on Xai\n\nAs an incentive to keep users on the network and reward them for supporting its consensus model, Xai began rolling out staking across two waves.\n\nVersion one allowed owners of Sentry Nodes\u2014which are responsible for monitoring and flagging blocks on the Xai network\u2014to stake up to 25,000 esXAI they hold. Then, in April, version two was rolled out, which opened the gates to any holder of esXAI.\n\nNow, staking pools can be created by Sentry Key holders\u2014the NFT is used to operate a Sentry Node to support the network\u2014and then anyone can stake esXAI in the pools that have been created. Pool operators can determine the distribution of pooled network rewards, specifying the percentages allocated to themselves, Sentry Key-holding stakers, and standard esXAI stakers.\n\nXai also introduced a tier system where the higher the tier of a staking pool, based on the amount of esXAI staked, the greater the reward multiplier for the staked Sentry Keys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, if 500,000 esXAI is staked, then the Sentry Key will see a 3x reward multiplier. This starts at \"bronze\" with no bonus reward, but climbs all the way up to \"diamond,\" which has a 6x reward multiplier.\n\nThe future\n\nXai is like an onion: It has layers. As a layer-3 blockchain, it attempts to improve on the layers that came before it to optimize the gaming experience. Peel back more layers and you find a robust token and staking system with governance in layers to come.\n\nOf course, the one layer that\u2019s still a bit thin as of this writing concerns the actual games themselves build on top of the network. But based on the announcements thus far, it appears those games are coming.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
