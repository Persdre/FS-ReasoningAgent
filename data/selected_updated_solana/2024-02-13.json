        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that Ethereum (ETH) is now in an uptrend after a lengthy period of accumulation.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 206,500 followers on the social media platform X that ETH has convincingly broken out of a trading range after retesting the lower $2,000 level several times in the past few months.\n\n\u201cWake up honey, bear market accumulation is over.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,670 at time of writing, up more than 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader thinks there is a price correlation between ETH-rivals Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) and is expressing bullish sentiment on both tokens.\n\n\u201cIf SOL pumps, AVAX will follow.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s surge past $50,000 catalyzed a broader market upswing, propelling numerous large-cap alternative digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others to significant gains.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlate, Ethereum saw a 7% uptick, reaching $2,661, while SOL surged 8% to hit $114. Among the top 10 digital assets, Avalanche\u2019s AVAX spiked 6% to $41, Cardano\u2019s ADA rose by 3.74% to $0.5574, while BNB Coin (BNB) and Ripple\u2019s XRP experienced more modest gains, each climbing by less than 3%.\n\nMarket analysts attribute this bullish trend to the buzz surrounding the multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, noted that inflows into these ETFs have remained robust more than a month after their launch.\n\n\u201cYesterday saw a net inflow of 9,870 BTC, pushing the net U.S. spot ETF flow since launch to 72,312 BTC. The new nine now hold 228,000 BTC,\u201d Lunde added.\n\nDuring the past day, BTC\u2019s price crossed the $50,000 threshold for the first time since late 2021. The top crypto\u2019s value has risen 4.2% to $50,146 as of press time, extending a positive run that had seen it gain 16% over the past week.\n\n$184 million in liquidation\n\nThe broader crypto market rally resulted in a significant liquidation totaling over $184 million from more than 56,000 traders, according to Coinglass data.\n\nShort traders, or speculators betting against price increases, bore losses amounting to $134 million, while long traders betting on price increases lost approximately $50 million.\n\nAcross assets, Bitcoin led the liquidation charts with a total loss of $69.80 million. Short Bitcoin traders accounted for $55.04 million in losses, while long traders lost $14.76 million. Ethereum followed closely, contributing $39.85 million to the overall liquidation.\n\nOther assets like Solana, LINK, and ORDI also experienced liquidations of $10.14 million, $5.93 million, and $4.81 million, respectively.\n\nAcross exchanges, Binance witnessed the highest proportion of liquidations at 43.13%, totaling $79.42 million. Other platforms like OKX and ByBit recorded liquidations of $58.29 million and $18.73 million, respectively.\n\nNotably, the most significant liquidation order occurred on Bitmex for LINKUSD, amounting to $3.14 million.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) Price on the Verge of a $3,000 Rally ? - crypto.news",
        "content": "On Feb. 12, Ethereum (ETH) price peaked at $2,633, just shy of its 2024 top, while Bitcoin (BTC) raced above the $50,000 for the first time since 2022.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) attracted the media attention after breaking the $50,000 barrier on Feb. 12, but Ethereum bulls are making strategic moves to stage a similar breakout.\n\nWill ETH price reclaim $3,000 in the coming days?\n\nEthereum derivative traders have intensified bullish bets\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin price action have been closely correlated for many years. This has sparked optimism that BTC hitting the $50,000 milestone on Feb. 12 could open the doors to ETH making a similar bullish upswing.\n\nIn the ETH derivatives markets, there has been an noticeable increase in the spate at which speculative traders are placing leveraged bullish bets.\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s funding rate represents the aggregate percentage of fees paid by perpetual futures traders to keep their positions open.\n\nThe chart below, shows the ETH funding rate rose to 0.4% on Feb. 13, signaling that speculative traders are placing more leveraged bets on an imminent ETH price upswing.\n\nNotably this is its highest in more than 40-days dating back Jan. 8, when investors were piling on bullish positions ahead of the Bitcoin spot ETF verdict.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Funding Rate vs Price Source: CryptoQuant\n\nConcisely put, rising values of positive funding rates indicates that long position holders are showing paying increased fees to short traders, in anticipation that an imminent price upswing will yield outsized profits.\n\nETH is trading just below the $2,660 mark, at the time of writing on Feb. 13. Hence, this surge in ETH funding rates right after BTC crossing the $50,000 milestone indicates an overwhelming bullish outlook that an Ethereum price rally toward $3,000 could soon follow.\n\nUS whales are ramping their ETH purchases\n\nUS-based corporate entities have further intensified efforts to score an ETH spot ETF approval in H1 2024. On Feb. 12, Frank Templeton became the latest asset manager to file ETH derivative applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIt appears that the institutional participants are backing up their optimism with rapid ETH purchases in the spot markets. Cryptoquant\u2019s Coinbase Premium index tracks the intra-day difference in Ethereum prices quoted on Coinbase Pro exchange and Binance.\n\nAs depicted below, Ethereum Coinbase Premium index stood at 0.04 on Feb. 13 and has been trending in positive values since Feb. 8. And during that\n\nEthereum (ETH) Binance vs. Coinbase Premium index | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nThis critical metric is based on the premise that Binance dominates the retail trading market, the majority of Coinbase pro clientele is dominated by US-based corporates and high-networth investors looking to trade within a more regulated environment.\n\nHence, positive values of the Coinbase Premium index means that ETH quoted prices on Coinbase have been consistently higher than Binance, indicating that the whales\u2019 buying pressure on Coinbase Pro has exceeded retail activity on Binance.\n\nThis pattern has often appeared in the build up to major ETH price rallies. Unsurprisingly, ETH price has gained 11% since the whales dialed up the buying pressure on Feb. 8.\n\nCombined with the dominant bullish sentiment among the speculative traders, this unusual buying trend observed among the whales could send ETH price to its next milestone target at $3,000.\n\nETH price forecast: $3,000 target in focus\n\nIn summary, speculative traders showing optimism with rising funding rates and the buying pressure from US-based whales have put ETH price on an upward trajectory.\n\nAnd based on the historical patterns associated with these bullish metrics, Ethereum price is likely to make another leg-up toward the $3,000 area.\n\nHowever, the bulls face major roadblock at the $2,750 range. IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money data shows that, 878,100 addresses had acquired 671,830 ETH at the average price of $2,760.\n\nIf the bulls can scale this initial resistance level, it could generate momentum to push for $3,000 target as predicted.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, February 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the flip side, ETH price could enter a negative trend if the bears can force a downswing below $2,000. But this scenario seems unlikely in the short-term. The chart above shows that 3 million holders acquire 6.2 million ETH at the average price of $2,300. If those holders defend their position ETH will like a solid short-term support around the $2,350 level."

It still has a smaller market capitalization than Bitcoin, giving it much more upside potential in terms of its valuation multiple. Additionally, Ethereum has recently become deflationary due to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and token burning. The token\u2019s current annualized deflation rate sits around 2%, meaning existing Ethereum tokens become more scarce over time.\n\nBut what truly gives Ethereum an edge over Bitcoin as an investment is its role as the dominant smart contract-enabled blockchain network. Ethereum is the foundation for most decentralized applications and Web 3.0 use cases, from NFTs to DeFi. It is spearheading innovation in the blockchain space, while Bitcoin remains primarily a store of value commodity.\n\nFor these reasons, Ethereum has beaten Bitcoin\u2019s performance in every bull market cycle. I expect this trend to continue in the next bull market, as more developers build on Ethereum and more investors recognize its network effects over other chains.
