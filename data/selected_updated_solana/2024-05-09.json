        "title": "Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020 - Unchained",
        "content": "The low price of transacting is a result of the flight of activity away from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its layer 2 networks, particularly following the Dencun upgrade that occurred in March.\n\nThe average cost of a transaction on Ethereum is at its lowest level since Jan. 2020 (one gwei represents one-billionth of one ether and is the unit of ETH used to measure gas prices). The decline reflects the movement of activity from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its expansive array of Layer 2 solutions.\n\nMoreover, the release of the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced fees for those layer 2 networks, has only intensified this trend of lower transaction costs. Gas prices on Ethereum have decreased about 92% from about 63 gwei on March 12, the day before the upgrade, to around 5 gwei at presstime, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan and analytics investment platform Ycharts shows.\n\nAccording to layer 2 watchdog platform L2Beat, the number of active and upcoming L2 projects collectively stands at 95. Over the past several months, users have significantly increased the amount of crypto assets they\u2019ve bridged over to various layer 2 scaling rollups. And of the L2s, the top ones by total value locked\u2014namely, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base \u2013 have seen a spike in active daily addresses, signs of increasing user activity.\n\nRead More: Vitalik\u2019s New EIP-7702 Draws Early Support; Could Be Included in Ethereum\u2019s Next Hard Fork Upgrade\n\n\u201cWe can certainly see a trend upwards on EVM compatible chains of daily active addresses, which means users are going to cheaper alternatives. Looking at bridge data also confirms this, as bridge activity across Layer 2s has increased from ~$170mn per week to ~$300mn per week,\u201d Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Artemis, said in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has seen over $3 billion in net outflows of ETH over the past three months, per Artemis, with the majority of the flows going to L2s such as Arbitrum, zkSync, Base, Starknet, and Optimism.\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum\u2019s transaction costs is \u201ca reflection of the constant evolution of blockchain. Initially Ethereum served as the universal layer for all apps, from decentralized exchanges, to games, to trading memecoins, wrote Justin, CEO of decentralized perpetual futures platform Vest Exchange, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cHowever, with the advent of Layer 2 solutions and app chains, builders and users (and MEV bots) are realizing that there are tailored ecosystems for specific use cases. In return, we also see Ethereum to be transitioning moreso as a foundational security layer and for supporting more \u2018passive\u2019 protocols such as lending and LSTs.\u201d\n\nEthereum Post-Dencun Upgrade\n\nDencun, the most recent Ethereum hard fork that brought several codebase changes, went live on mainnet on March 13.\n\nWhile the number of transactions has remained stable at just over one million per day, the amount of fees paid by end users of Ethereum has plummeted since Dencun, per Artemis.\n\nWith less overall transaction fees, the amount of ETH burned has gone down as well. According to Ethereum analytics platform Ultra Sound Money, the amount of ETH issued in the past thirty days is more than the amount of ETH burned, one outcome of the Dencun upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe new supply of ETH is now growing at the fastest daily rate since the Merge as fees burned plummeted as a consequence of the Dencun upgrade,\u201d analysts at blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant wrote in a report published on Wednesday.\n\nThe price of ETH reached a multi-year high of $4,000 on the day of Dencun, but has since dropped roughly 25% to around $3,015 at the time of publication, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s \u2018ultrasound\u2019 money narrative is at risk after the Dencun upgrade, said CryptoQuant.\n\nEthereum's EIP-7702 would address concerns raised about the previous EIP-3074.\n\nEthereum's recent price action suggests it may be gathering momentum for a bullish run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action on Wednesday shows it could be gathering momentum for a rally as a recent report from CryptoQuant reveals its ultrasound money narrative is at risk. Also, the number one altcoin's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and co-authors have published Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702 as an alternative to EIP-3074.\n\nRead more: Ethereum resume sideways move as Grayscale files to withdraw Ethereum futures ETF application with the SEC\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ultrasound money, EIP-7702, Ethereum Foundation\n\nEthereum is set to see interesting updates on its blockchain following recent developments. Here are key market movers for the top altcoin:\n\nA recent report by CryptoQuant highlights that Ethereum is becoming inflationary following the Dencun upgrade in March. After the Merge that saw Ethereum transitioning from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, the network began burning gas fees at a significant rate that saw a significant reduction in the growth of ETH's circulating supply.\n\nHowever, since the Dencun upgrade, when the introduction of \"blobs\" reduced Ethereum's network activity to boost its scalability and reduce user fees, the amount of gas fees burned has reduced significantly.\n\n\"Before the Dencun upgrade, the higher network activity on Ethereum meant higher fees burned and hence less ether supply. However, after the Dencun upgrade, the total amount of fees burned has decoupled from the network activity,\" noted CryptoQuant. As a result, this puts ETH's 'ultrasound' money narrative at risk since its circulating supply would begin increasing over time.\n\n\"We conclude that, at the current rate of network activity, Ethereum will not be deflationary again, and the narrative of 'ultrasound' money has probably died or would need much higher network activity to come back to life,\" said CryptoQuant.\n\nFurthermore, following several concerns raised about EIP-3074, which was considered for inclusion in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and co-authors Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett proposed EIP-7702 as an alternative.\n\n3074 = upgrade for normal \"EOA\" wallets to give some smart wallet functionality\n\n4337 = standard for smart contract wallets\n\n\n\n3074 was slated for inclusion, v likely worried the long term implications of\n\n1) compatibility btwn 3074 and 4337 wallets\n\n2) 3074 breaking in a future\u2026 \u2014 hayden.eth (@haydenzadams) May 7, 2024\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that would allow externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act as smart contracts during a transaction. Like EIP-3074, the new proposal would enable better ways to abstract gas fees, batch transactions, and improve the user experience. However, it goes further by improving compatibility with the ERC-4337 standard for smart contract wallets \u2014 an issue with EIP-3074 \u2014 and being more future-proof.\n\nSome crypto community members have speculated that EIP-7702 would replace EIP-3074 in the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade. One X user commented, \"I think it would probably make more sense to include in Pectra than 3074.\"\n\nFireblocks' VP of Technology Arik Galansky also commented on the proposal saying, \"It's a long while since Ethereum introduced changes that are user-oriented rather than scaling-oriented and this one is right on point.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, EIP-3074 sent the AA world into shambles.\n\n\n\nInitially it looked like it's synergetic with ERC-4337, since they do different things. One enables EOA migration, another enables decentralized mempools.\n\n\n\nHowever, the nitty gritty details looked suboptimal: it's hard\u2026 \u2014 Ivo e/acc (@Ivshti) May 7, 2024\n\nAlso read: Ethereum traders show uncertainty, SEC delays decision on Invesco's ETH ETF application\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation appeared to be dumping ETH again on Wednesday following a transfer of 1,000 ETH worth $3 million to middle multisig address 0xbc9, according to data from Spot On Chain.\n\nThis transfer is the latest action in a larger trend where the Ethereum Foundation has sold 1,766 ETH for 4.81 million DAI stablecoin at ~$2,725 since the beginning of 2024. The ETH sales, done in small batches through the same middle multisig address 0xbc9, often coincide with brief Ethereum price declines, noted Spot On Chain.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could be gathering momentum for a bullish run\n\nThe market remained quiet on Wednesday as Ethereum continued trading around the $3,000 mark. Despite the calm market, ETH derivatives volume in May has risen higher \u2014 close to 60% \u2014 than that of Bitcoin, according to QCP.\n\nRead more: Ethereum could see a brief rally despite Michael Saylor's jab at ETH ETFs\n\nThe reason for the increase may be the market pricing in volatility over the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision on Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application on May 23, noted QCP. This also explains why the market is slightly tilted toward a downward movement as many expect the SEC to deny spot ETH ETF applications.\n\nWhile current price action indicates ETH may continue a horizontal movement in upcoming weeks, historical data suggests the largest altcoin could be gathering momentum for a bullish run. Considering ETH has remained in the $2,852 to $3,300 range for nearly a month, it could attempt a sustained breakout above the upper level of the range if it sees a slight bullish trigger.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOnchain data also shows most whales have been accumulating ETH around this range in anticipation of a price rally. A bearish event could see it break below the lower level of the range briefly, presenting a buying opportunity.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,013 on Wednesday, May 8, down 0.7% on the day."

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR) each present distinct scenarios, from SHIB's long-term aspirations to hit a significant price milestone, Ethereum's ongoing technological enhancements amid regulatory scrutiny, to Furrever Token's engaging community-driven initiatives. These developments highlight the varying strategies and market dynamics that investors and enthusiasts can navigate.\n\nShiba Inu's Road to $0.001: A Millionaire Maker for the Patient Investor\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), the cryptocurrency that captured the hearts of many young investors, continues to hold the community's attention despite its fluctuating market performance. Originating as a favorite among retail investors, SHIB has created significant wealth for its early backers, with some even reaching millionaire status. Although the token is currently far from its all-time high of $0.00008616 achieved in October 2021, the undying optimism among its supporters envisions a milestone price of $0.001 per SHIB.\n\nTo become a millionaire at this ambitious target price, an investor would need to hold approximately one billion SHIB tokens, currently valued at about $23,972. This significant number reflects not only the potential high reward but also the substantial risk associated with such an investment in the volatile crypto market.\n\nPredictions on when SHIB might reach the $0.001 mark vary, with forecasts suggesting a timeline between 2033 and 2040. Such a long horizon necessitates patience and enduring confidence in Shiba Inu\u2019s market strategy and broader adoption. The primary challenge facing SHIB is its massive circulating supply of 589 trillion coins, which poses a substantial barrier to significant price increases. Achieving a price of $0.001 with such a vast number of tokens would result in an unrealistically large market capitalization, not seen in current crypto valuations.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the SHIB development team is actively working on new mechanisms to reduce the token supply dramatically. Rumors suggest that these new initiatives could potentially burn trillions of tokens annually, accelerating SHIB\u2019s journey towards the $0.001 goal if successfully implemented. This strategy not only aims to enhance SHIB\u2019s value but also aligns with the community's long-term vision of reducing supply to create scarcity, thereby driving up the token's price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those betting on SHIB, the path to becoming a millionaire is intertwined with the token\u2019s ability to overcome its supply challenges and achieve unprecedented growth in the coming years.

However, signals of an upcoming rally are emerging, driven by significant improvements in its blockchain technology and speculative market movements.\n\nThe new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, developed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin and his team, is at the forefront of these developments. This proposal aims to innovate how externally owned accounts (EOAs) operate by allowing them to temporarily take on smart contract functionalities. This change is set to enhance the user experience significantly by simplifying gas fee processes, enabling transaction batching, and ensuring greater compatibility with the ERC-4337 smart contract wallet standard. These updates emphasize a shift toward making user-focused enhancements rather than purely technical scaling solutions, reaffirming Ethereum's commitment to its community of users.\n\nMoreover, the market is on edge as it awaits the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision regarding the Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application, expected on May 23. This decision is anticipated to cause volatility, with the community and investors closely watching for any potential impact on Ethereum's market position. Although current sentiments tend towards caution, historical trends and recent significant buying activities by large investors, commonly referred to as 'whales', suggest that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a significant upward movement.

This strategy not only aims to enhance SHIB\u2019s value but also aligns with the community's long-term vision of reducing supply to create scarcity, thereby driving up the token's price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those betting on SHIB, the path to becoming a millionaire is intertwined with the token\u2019s ability to overcome its supply challenges and achieve unprecedented growth in the coming years. This journey requires both a belief in the token\u2019s potential and the fortitude to withstand the ups and downs of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Positioned for Uptrend Amid Regulatory Developments and Technical Enhancements\n\nEthereum, a leading cryptocurrency, is showing potential for growth amidst a flurry of technical and regulatory developments. On a recent trading day, Ethereum's price was slightly down by 0.7%, trading around $3,013. However, signals of an upcoming rally are emerging, driven by significant improvements in its blockchain technology and speculative market movements.\n\nThe new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, developed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin and his team, is at the forefront of these developments. This proposal aims to innovate how externally owned accounts (EOAs) operate by allowing them to temporarily take on smart contract functionalities. This change is set to enhance the user experience significantly by simplifying gas fee processes, enabling transaction batching, and ensuring greater compatibility with the ERC-4337 smart contract wallet standard. These updates emphasize a shift toward making user-focused enhancements rather than purely technical scaling solutions, reaffirming Ethereum's commitment to its community of users.\n\nMoreover, the market is on edge as it awaits the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision regarding the Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application, expected on May 23. This decision is anticipated to cause volatility, with the community and investors closely watching for any potential impact on Ethereum's market position. Although current sentiments tend towards caution, historical trends and recent significant buying activities by large investors, commonly referred to as 'whales', suggest that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a significant upward movement. Should the market receive even slight bullish signals, Ethereum might break through the upper levels of its current price range, presenting a valuable buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nFurrever Token Stimulates Market Activity with $20,000 Competition Following Impressive Presale\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is gaining notable traction within the cryptocurrency sector by not only achieving over $1.1 million during its presale but also by initiating a lucrative buying competition.
