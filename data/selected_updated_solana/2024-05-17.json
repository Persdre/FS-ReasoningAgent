        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs crypto emerges as an increasingly partisan issue in the 2024 presidential election\u2014what with Donald Trump making overtures to the industry, and President Joe Biden threatening to kill legislation intended to protect it\u2014American crypto companies have begun feverishly spending to aid the campaigns of pro-crypto candidates across the country.\n\nIndustry mainstays like Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ripple Labs have already dedicated tens of millions of dollars to influencing key Senate and House races this year. Meanwhile, crypto leaders have begun openly embracing Trump in a manner unthinkable four years ago.\n\nBut amid the crypto industry\u2019s rise as a force in American election fundraising, one of the country\u2019s most valuable crypto firms has opted to stay out of partisan politics altogether.\n\nConsensys, the $7 billion Ethereum software giant, has notably refrained from backing crypto-friendly candidates in the 2024 election. To the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Joe Lubin, this is a deliberate choice intended to ensure the crypto industry\u2019s long-term success (disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPolitically, we've liked to remain neutral,\u201d Lubin told Decrypt. \u201cIt doesn't make sense for us to choose one broken party over another.\u201d\n\nRelying on one political party or faction to support crypto is not as sustainable a long-term strategy as solidifying the industry\u2019s legality via the judiciary, the Ethereum co-creator believes.\n\n\u201cThe way through all of this, the way that we land\u2026 is to rely on the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Consensys filed a preemptive lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that the regulator has no legal authority to classify ETH as a security\u2014a position it has secretly held for over a year, the suit revealed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit with the SEC is a good platform for us to help people understand the benefits of the technology,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cI don't think we need to be politically partisan or make political donations in order to be a very clear and loud voice on this topic.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, though, that the entrepreneur has eschewed politics altogether\u2014far from it. Lubin says that Consensys regularly has closed-door conversations with politicians and regulators about the importance of crypto to America\u2019s future.\n\nWhat\u2019s key, though, is that those conversations are aimed at creating broad\u2014forgive the pun\u2014consensus around crypto.\n\n\u201cWe may not be visible,\u201d Lubin said of Consensys\u2019 political machinations, \"but we are certainly doing things.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Maocat\n\nMAOCAT is a project that seeks to contribute to changing the memecoin crypto niche.\n\nHong Kong, May 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The MAOCAT project has officially stated its strategy to become the next big thing in Ethereum-based memecoins. With unique features like fixed staking, launchpad, and NFT marketplace, MAOCAT aims to offer a diverse ecosystem for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nAfter years of dog domination in the memecoin world, cats finally get to shine with MAOCAT's promising growth potential. The ongoing presale is just the beginning of this ambitious project, with more developments and features to come.\n\nHow This Team Plans to Launch the Next Big Ethereum-based Memecoin\n\nThe project's team believes MAOCAT could be the next big Ethereum-based memecoin to explode in popularity and value. Some hints of its potential already exist, such as the outstanding success of its current presale.\n\nAt the time of this writing, MAOCAT had already sold over 60% of its pre-sale allocation. Considering how fast the team reached this threshold, the growth indicates a high demand for this project.\n\nThe team's roadmap is divided into different phases. Specifically, Stage 1 includes:\n\nThe launch of MAOCAT.\n\nStaking opportunities for $MAO.\n\nThe creation of various social media accounts to connect with the community.\n\nIn Stage 2, users can claim their $MAO tokens and see them listed on exchanges. Additionally, the team aims to expand its presence on bigger and better exchanges while working on game development. The team is also excited to reach the milestone of having 10,000 holders of $MAO.\n\nFinally, Stage 3 will see the launch of the highly anticipated MAOCAT game and 10,000 NFTs. These unique NFTs will go live on the popular OpenSea platform and an NFT marketplace created by MAOCAT.\n\nThe Growing Ecosystem of MAOCAT: From SWAP to Launchpad to NFTs\n\nThere are four elements that make up the exciting and rapidly expanding ecosystem of MAOCAT. These elements include the MAO CAT NFT collection, an NFT Marketplace on ETH, MAO SWAP (DeFi 2.0), and MAO GAME.\n\nThe upcoming NFT marketplace will be a platform where users can buy and sell their unique MAO CAT NFTs. With NFTs' growing popularity, MAOCAT aims to provide its users with a seamless and secure marketplace experience.\n\nThe NFT collection will find its home in this marketplace. This feature will offer NFT holders a range of rarity tiers and unique benefits. Whether owning a rare or legendary MAO CAT NFT, users have multiple ways to be part of this exclusive community.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ecosystem also includes MAO SWAP, a DeFi 2.0 platform allowing efficient and flexible trading through its innovative liquidity mechanism. With MAO SWAP, users can farm and stake their tokens to earn a fixed APR and other rewards.\n\nLastly, the upcoming MAO GAME will offer an interactive gaming experience with collectible NFTs as in-game assets. This particular mix of features goes beyond the typical memecoin project and focuses on token utility. The $MAO token lets users access all ecosystem elements and join various events, creating a great experience for MAOCAT supporters.\n\nAbout MAOCAT\n\nAt its core, MAOCAT is a project that seeks to contribute to changing the memecoin crypto niche. This sector is often entirely about dogs, which can surprise many, considering how popular cats are on the internet.\n\nBeyond the cat-based project, there's a rather large ecosystem in place for the MAOCAT community. This ecosystem will offer its users a range of benefits and opportunities, such as staking, trading, NFTs, and gaming.\n\nMAOCAT is gaining popularity and has already sold over 60% of its pre-sale allocation. In more practical terms, early investors bought over $300,000 worth of tokens in this phase.\n\nThe team behind MAOCAT has a clear roadmap for bringing this project to its full potential. The project's website is a great source for learning about MAOCAT's features and progress.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough, with analysts predicting it could soon reach the $5,000 mark. Amid these developments, a new and captivating player, Furrever Token, is emerging as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Combining the charm of cat-themed content with blockchain technology, Furrever Token offers a unique investment opportunity with the promise of astronomical returns. As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture headlines, don't overlook the irresistible appeal and innovative potential of Furrever Token\u2014the next big thing in cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Surges 2%: Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs Skyrocket\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at around $65,738.46, experiencing a nearly 2% increase since yesterday. Over the past week, more than 600 firms have disclosed substantial investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their 13F filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAccording to the filing data, professional investment firms have reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Major players include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, UBS, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada, and hedge funds like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors.\n\nMillennium Management leads the pack with $1.9 billion invested across various Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).

Nate Geraci of ETF Store believes rejection is unlikely, citing past ETH futures ETF approvals and staking option removals. However, some speculate denial due to ongoing Ethereum security classification investigations.\n\nSEC scrutiny began in April 2023, yet ETH futures ETFs were approved in September, highlighting regulatory complexity. Ethereum now aims to surpass $3,000, facing resistance at $3,103 and $3,161.
