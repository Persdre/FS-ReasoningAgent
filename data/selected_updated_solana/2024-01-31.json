        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRON, the native token of the Ethereum-based Ronin Network, continued its recent ascent Wednesday as it popped to a nearly two-year high price of $2.89, according to data from CoinGecko. It\u2019s up 5% on the day and 57% over the past 30 days.\n\nRonin, an Ethereum sidechain designed for crypto games, has seen a recent rise in users and increased momentum tied in part to the success of Pixels, a social farming game that migrated from fellow Ethereum scaler Polygon last fall. The game\u2019s play-to-airdrop campaign, which will reward top players with PIXEL tokens, helped fuel a surge in Ronin users.\n\nHowever, the latest RON pump came after a couple of notable events in the world of Axie Infinity, the NFT-based monster-battling game developer Sky Mavis originally built Ronin to support back in 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sky Mavis launched its seventh in-game competitive season in Axie Infinity Origins. Dubbed \u201cEpic Era,\u201d Season 7 will serve up 18,900 AXS and over 13.7 million SLP in reward tokens, collectively valued at about $175,000 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis axie just sold for 105 ETH ($245,843.85) \ud83e\udd2f King Durendal has a new owner.

Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Zirlin tweeted that the particular Agamogenesis Axie NFTs originally sold for 6 ETH in 2018, back when that sum would\u2019ve been worth approximately $3,300.\n\nAxie Infinity saw skyrocketing success in 2021, generating billions of dollars\u2019 worth of NFT trading volume as the game attracted millions of active players.\n\nHowever, the game\u2019s play-to-earn economy began struggling in early 2022 and the Ronin network\u2019s bridge to Ethereum was hacked for $622 million. Sky Mavis eventually repaid affected Ronin users and has since continued to evolve the Axie ecosystem, gradually onboarding more third-party game studios to the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin lost its U.S. dollar-peg after an exploit on cross-chain protocol Abracadabra.money\u2019s cauldrons on Ethereum.\n\nThe Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin lost its U.S. dollar-peg after an exploit on cross-chain protocol Abracadabra.money\u2019s cauldrons on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized crypto lending platform Abracadabra.money was hit by an exploit on Tuesday, resulting in a $6.5 million loss to the protocol.\n\nThe exploit was flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield, which noted that the attacker funded the exploit with 1 ETH from Tornado Cash.\n\nMagic Internet Money (MIM), the stablecoin tied to the protocol flash crashed to $0.76 after the exploit. At the time of writing, the stablecoin was still trading below its U.S. dollar-peg at around $0.98.\n\nThe attacker managed to trick certain Abracadabra\u2019s isolated lending pools on Ethereum, called \u201ccauldrons,\u201d and used a nested series of smart contracts to loop the Abracadabra Degenbox\u2019s \u201cborrow\u201d and \u201crepay\u201d functions, according to analysis from Arkham.\n\nThe hacker swapped $7M of MIM for a total of $6.3M in ETH, incurring around 10% slippage when they dumped it on Curve. They\u2019re now holding the ETH in two addresses: 0x40d5FFA20fC0dF6bE4D9991938dAa54E6919c714 ($4.15M ETH)\n\n0xbD12D6054827ae3fc6D23B1aCf47736691b52Fd3 ($2.16M ETH) pic.twitter.com/s3ovPoWZBX \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) January 30, 2024\n\nMeanwhile blockchain security firm CertiK noted on X that early indications pointed to a \u201crounding error\u201d being the root cause of the exploit.\n\nThe MIM team acknowledged the exploit and said the protocol\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was attempting to stabilize the price of the stablecoin of MIM through a buyback and burn program, likely explaining why MIM is now trading closer to its peg.\n\nAround 10 hours later, however, the team issued an update urging users to revoke all approvals to the smart contract to prevent a loss of funds.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MIM__Spcll/status/1752444391061430403\n\nMIM has lost its peg before, fluctuating to a low of $0.95 after the collapse of FTX in November 2022, given that FTX\u2019s native token FTT was the largest collateral token backing the stablecoin. MIM also destabilized after the collapse of the Terra ecosystem earlier that year."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJupiter\u2019s massive JUP token airdrop claim began Wednesday, and volume on the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator soared to new heights in the process.\n\nAccording to data from both CoinGecko and Jupiter itself, the platform has racked up more than $1.2 billion worth of daily trading volume over the past 24 hours. That makes it top among all crypto DEXes, beating typical leader Uniswap V3 on Ethereum with $854 million (per CoinGecko). Note that the tally does not include Uniswap volume on other chains.\n\nJupiter\u2019s 24-hour rolling tally also appears to be an all-time record for the protocol, which has recently seen surging demand. Another data source, DeFi Llama, shows that Jupiter\u2019s single calendar-day volume record is just above $1 billion on December 14, 2023.\n\nToday\u2019s traders won\u2019t get anything from the initial JUP airdrop, which serves up 1 billion tokens for earlier Jupiter users to claim. Jupiter took a snapshot of eligible wallets in November and said that about 955,000 wallets could claim tokens during the drop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to be optimistic: Jupiter has allocated another 3 billion tokens, 30% of the total token supply, for future airdrops to reward newer users. The timing for the next airdrop has not yet been announced, however, and amid the buzz of claim day and the sizable drops landing in Solana wallets, traders are eager to start racking up activity on the platform.\n\nJupiter opened up the claim at 10 a.m. ET and the coin started with a market price of about $0.42, according to data from Birdeye. JUP quickly popped over 70% to a price above $0.72, as Decrypt reported earlier, but it has since calmed to a current price below $0.67.\n\nEven with the sinking price late Wednesday, JUP commands a market cap of about $914 million based on the current circulating supply, and the token has generated over $500 million in trading volume in less than nine hours.\n\nAccording to a Dune dashboard that tracks public blockchain data, eligible wallets have already claimed about 566 million JUP tokens out of the initial 1 billion JUP airdrop allocation. Nearly 392,000 unique wallet addresses have claimed tokens so far, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL itself has fallen about 6% on the day to the current price of around $97, according to CoinGecko, after bouncing up and down since the JUP drop.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Jupiter Volume Surpasses Uniswap: Is Solana Taking Over Ethereum As King Of DeFi? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Data from CoinGeko shows that Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter recently surpassed Ethereum\u2019s foremost DEX Uniswap in an important metric. This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum\u2019s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nJupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume\n\nAccording to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter\u2019s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.\n\nThis airdrop caused a splurge of new money into the Solana ecosystem and Jupiter in particular. While that may be the case, it also highlights a new trend that looks to be developing in the crypto ecosystem. This is in reference to the fact that the Solana network has been going toe-to-toe with Ethereum as of late.\n\nData from DeFiLlama shows that beyond Jupiter\u2019s dominance, SOL is actually matching Ethereum\u2019s numbers. In the last 24 hours, Solana recorded a trading volume of $704 million to Ethereum\u2019s $741 million.\n\nIn December 2023, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 7-day DEX volume for the first time in history. Data from the Block shows that Solana also outperformed Ethereum in terms of non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume during that same period.\n\nSOL price at $97 | Source: SOL price at $97 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSolana To Overtake Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has long been known as the network housing the foremost decentralized applications (dApps) and has continued to dominate the DeFi landscape. However, that could change soon enough if Solana\u2019s runs become constant. This is more interesting, considering that Solana has always been referred to as the \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nThe SOL network is already known to have an edge over Ethereum, considering that the former is faster and more cost-effective than the latter. Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have also continued to pose major concerns for users, and this cannot be sustained if mainstream adoption of DEXs is to be achieved.\n\nMoreover, it has become evident that more liquidity is flowing into Solana, something that could entice more DeFi users into the ecosystem. It is worth mentioning that the WEN airdrop was just the tip of the iceberg, as the JUP, Jupiter\u2019s native token, airdrop is set to take place on January 31.\n\nThe highly-anticipated airdrop is expected to drive considerable attention and trading activity towards Jupiter and Solana. For one, those eligible for the airdrop are likely to diversify their funds across the SOL ecosystem. Meanwhile, those who missed out on this airdrop are likely to look farm other DeFi projects on Solana in hopes that they will be eligible once these projects in question roll out their native tokens.\n\nFeatured image from Quora, chart from Tradingview.com"

Based on the minutes, there may be no rate cuts until such a time when the Fed has greater confidence that inflation is moving toward its 2% target.\n\nComing into the event, however, Bitcoin price ticked up nearly 3% with technical indicators favoring the upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the 50 mean level, while the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are flashing green. These show growing momentum in favor of bulls.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Bitcoin price flip the $43,750 hurdle into support and then extend above it to $48,000. In a highly bullish case, BTC could make its way to the $50,000 psychological level, 15% above current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from $43,750 could see Bitcoin price retract to the $40,726 support.

The RSI, is below the 50 midline, while both the AO and MACD remain in negative territory, bolstering the case for the bears.\n\nA rejection from the lower boundary of the channel could see Ethereum price fall past the $2,200 level and the 100-day SMA at $2,177 to test the supply zone that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,059 and $2,118. Breaking below its midline at $2,091 would confirm the continuation of the pullback\u2019s potential for going as low as the $2,000 psychological level. To invalidate the bullish thesis, the price must record a candlestick close below $1,935.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if more bulls show resolve, Ethereum price could venture into the supply zone, flipping $2,388 into support. In a highly bullish case, the gains could send ETH past $2,717 range high to record a higher high above $2,800.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: $2,500 in sight as bullish metrics steer ETH back into the channel\n\nRipple price dips after hacking incident\n\nRipple (XRP) price has dipped into the daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.4927 and $0.5111. Breaking and closing below its midline at $0.5040 could see XRP price extend the fall to the support floor at $0.4746.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, enhanced buyer activity among bulls could send Ripple price north past multiple obstacles to overcome resistance due to the falling trendline.
