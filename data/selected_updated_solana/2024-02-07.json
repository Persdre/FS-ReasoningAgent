        "title": "What is Ethereum fragmentation? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution is marked by the adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s), designed to alleviate the network\u2019s congestion and high transaction fees.\n\nL2s operate on top of Ethereum (Layer 1 or L1), processing transactions more efficiently before finalizing them on the main chain. However, this has led to a new challenge: each L2 functions in its isolated environment, creating silos that hinder interoperability\u2014a state we refer to as fragmentation.\n\nWhat is Universal Synchronous Composability (USC)?\n\nThe core issue with fragmentation is the loss of \u201cuniversal synchronous composability\u201d (USC), a feature allowing different applications to interact with each other seamlessly in real time. Imagine Ethereum as a bustling city where roads (L2s) connect buildings (applications).\n\nFragmentation is akin to having roads that don\u2019t interconnect, forcing you to take a long detour to move from one building to another.\n\nThe proposed solution, \u201cshared sequencing,\u201d is like establishing a city-wide transit system that links all roads, enabling direct travel routes between any two points without detours.\n\nTo further simplify, consider shared sequencing as the internet of Ethereum. Just as the internet allows different computers to communicate directly regardless of their physical location, shared sequencing enables different L2s to interact seamlessly. This system removes barriers, allowing for immediate transactions across the network, akin to sending an email from one side of the world to the other in seconds.\n\nTechnical Explanation of Shared Sequencing\n\nShared sequencing coordinates the order of transactions across all L2 solutions on Ethereum. It uses a centralized mechanism to sequence transactions identically across different L2s without requiring major infrastructure changes.\n\nShared sequencing leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing data availability capabilities. It proposes adding functionality for L2 solutions to sequence transactions in a unified manner. By sequencing transactions in the same order everywhere, shared sequencing enables instant interactions between L2s across Ethereum.\n\nPotential Use Cases for Shared Sequencing\n\nAdopting shared sequencing could revolutionize Ethereum. It would enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs by enabling seamless communication between L2 solutions. This would eliminate the need for complex bridging between L2s.\n\nShared sequencing could enable more robust decentralized applications (dApps) and services that integrate across L2s. This would improve user experience and accessibility. By restoring composability across L2 solutions, shared sequencing would strengthen Ethereum\u2019s network effects and dominance as a platform for blockchain applications.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey through fragmentation may resemble a challenging phase of growth, the horizon holds promise for a unified and efficient ecosystem. Shared sequencing represents a leap towards realizing this vision, offering a roadmap to re-establish Ethereum\u2019s composability and network effects.\n\nAs we look to the future, continued innovation and collaboration within the Ethereum community will be pivotal in overcoming current limitations and unlocking the platform\u2019s full potential. Through these efforts, Ethereum can evolve into a more interconnected and powerful platform, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications."

This will guarantee data availability and will also be much more affordable than calldata.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs consider \u2018existential\u2019 upgrade to the EVM\n\nData availability in blockchain refers to the process of storing data for a set period of time to ensure that all network participants will be able to access and retrieve it so that they can challenge whether or not the data is accurate.\n\nRollups only need this data to be available once and for a set period to give honest participants enough time to construct the rollup state and verify its accuracy.\n\n\u201cWhile Ethereum has rightfully suffered from criticism over fees and processing times, the\n\nDencun concepts of proto-danksharding and \u201cdata blobs\u201d have the mission to address and overcome those,\u201d Angelov said.\n\nHe notes that should the upgrade on mainnet be successful, Ethereum will be able to manage data throughput and network costs much more efficiently, giving it a competitive advantage over other layer-1 solutions.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it is the ability to onboard new protocols into a much freer-flowing environment and move capital at lower costs that will ultimately enhance cryptocurrency adoption by delivering a more economically feasible, highly-scalable on-chain solution,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "SEC may be forced to declare Ethereum a security after controversial new launch - Fortune",
        "content": "Prometheum plans to announce on Wednesday the launch of custodial services for Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $280 billion market cap is second only to Bitcoin\u2019s. The move may be part of a larger strategy by the crypto firm to get regulators to identify Ether as a security\u2014a position widely unpopular among industry peers.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has avoided taking a position on Ethereum\u2019s legal status even while declaring more than a dozen other popular cryptocurrencies to be securities. The latest gambit by New York\u2013based Prometheum, which claims it has discovered a compliant path for crypto within existing laws, could force the agency\u2019s hand.\n\nLegal experts have told Fortune that Prometheum\u2019s plan to launch its custodial service may compel the SEC to resolve the long-running Ethereum question. If the agency does indeed proclaim Ether to be a security, Prometheum could be in a pole position when it launches its planned trading platform next quarter\u2014even as the rest of the industry insists crypto can\u2019t be viable without new laws.\n\nA controversial new player\n\nLongtime crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken offer trading platforms in the U.S., allowing users to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. While many of the firms have been around for more than a decade, they still operate outside the regulatory framework of the existing financial system, which has led lawmakers to propose new rules for the industry.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has stepped up enforcement after the disastrous collapse of FTX, has said existing rules are sufficient and filed lawsuits against exchanges for failing to register with the agency. In response, companies like Coinbase have argued that the existing rules are outdated.\n\nWhile much of the U.S. crypto industry has sided with Coinbase, Prometheum has taken a different\u2014and contentious\u2014approach.\n\nFounded by two brothers, Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum received regulatory approval in 2021 to operate an alternative trading platform\u2014similar to a stock exchange\u2014where users can buy and sell different securities. The company went on to gain widespread attention in mid-2023 when it announced a first-of-its-kind approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014an industry oversight body that\u2019s independent of the SEC\u2014to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. The SEC first created the designation in 2021, but no other firm has succeeded in obtaining a license, though others, including Robinhood, have tried.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claim to have found a compliant path for crypto trading immediately drew condemnation from legal figures in the crypto industry, who argued that even if the SEC and FINRA approved Prometheum\u2019s structure, it would not have any assets available for trading. That is because, skeptics argue, the SEC has jurisdiction over securities, while cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ether are more like oil or gold\u2014assets that don\u2019t fit the legal definition of a security and so can\u2019t be registered.\n\nThe Kaplan brothers, in contrast, agree with the SEC\u2019s assessment that most cryptocurrencies are securities. They argue that Prometheum will be able to list different crypto assets as securities under an exemption called Rule 144, which is used to trade restricted stocks, and that they can use blockchain data to determine whether the assets have been in circulation for more than a year\u2014a key factor for the exemption. As an alternative trading system (or ATS), Prometheum will not have to work directly with the issuers but instead can choose which assets to list.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claims have not only riled the crypto industry but Republican lawmakers, who have argued that Gensler had propped up the little-known firm to further his own regulatory agenda. In a June appearance on CNBC, for instance, Gensler touted Prometheum\u2019s registration as a special purpose broker-dealer as an example of a compliant path for the industry. And last June, the company received a prized invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto despite having virtually no presence in the industry.\n\nThe debate over Prometheum\u2019s proposal has until now been theoretical, but Wednesday\u2019s announcement of Ether custodial services, which are slated to launch by late March for institutional clients, means the company is on the cusp of becoming the first crypto exchange to compliantly offer assets like Ether for trading.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with the crypto industry,\u201d Benjamin Kaplan said in an interview with Fortune. \u201cOur goal is not to destroy, it\u2019s not to harm, it\u2019s not to undermine\u2014it\u2019s to help build.\u201d\n\n\u2018Move the ball forward\u2019\n\nIn the traditional world of stock markets, the various steps that make up a trade are divided among different firms. For instance, a retail trader visits a broker like Fidelity to buy a share of Apple stock, leading Fidelity to turn to a broker-dealer like Citadel Securities to fill the order. Next, a firm called the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, figures out who owes what in all the trades the broker has made that day\u2014a process known as clearing.\n\nAt this point, another DTCC subsidiary called the Depository Trust Company steps in to oversee the funds and securities moving from one party to another\u2014a process called settlement. Finally, an institution\u2014either the original broker or a firm like State Street or BNY Mellon\u2014serves as the custodian, meaning it holds the actual securities on behalf of the investors.\n\nOne of the reasons for separating these various functions is to prevent conflicts of interest. If Citadel, for example, was serving as both an exchange and a broker-dealer, it could digest customer trade information and front-run orders. Separating brokers into distinct entities also prevents markets from having a single point of failure, as happened with FTX.\n\nJames Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown focused on financial regulation, told Fortune that much of the separation is also historical\u2014a convention that the crypto industry is seeking to disrupt with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nFirms like Coinbase offer clearing, settling, custody, and trading services under one roof, an arrangement that provided partial fodder for the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against the exchange. The agency\u2019s primary complaint, though, was that Coinbase and others had not registered with the SEC to offer any of these services\u2014even as it sold what the agency deemed to be securities.\n\nPrometheum, meanwhile, believes it has found a way to sell crypto without triggering any of these objections from the SEC, in part by dividing itself into two entities.\n\nOne, the alternative trading system, is a member of FINRA and registered with the SEC, and will provide a front-end platform for investors to buy and sell crypto assets. The other entity, Prometheum Capital, is the company that received the special purpose broker-dealer license and a final go-ahead from FINRA in January to offer the clearing, settling, and custody services necessary to complete the trades.\n\nThe upshot is that, while firms like Coinbase have been battling with the SEC, Prometheum has been getting approvals from FINRA, which is nominally independent of the agency but also works closely with the SEC and is ultimately subject to its oversight. It is also notable that, while other firms have applied to receive the special purpose broker-dealer license\u2014the one created by the SEC in 2021 and issued by FINRA\u2014Prometheum is the only one to receive it.\n\nNow, Prometheum\u2019s custodial services for Ether announcement suggests the company is on track to offer the popular cryptocurrency for trading to institutional investors later this spring. More consequentially, by offering custodial services for Ether, Prometheum is claiming that Ether is a security\u2014a critical question that the SEC has yet to decide on\u2014and doing so as a FINRA- and SEC-regulated business.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to custody before you trade,\u201d Aaron Kaplan told Fortune. \u201cThis is hopefully going to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a gamble\u2019\n\nFortune spoke with four lawyers and academics with expertise in digital asset regulation who agreed that Prometheum\u2019s custody launch could lead the SEC to finally rule on Ethereum\u2019s legal status, especially because Prometheum prominently displays its registered status with the two organizations on its website\u2014a decision that Boston University lecturer Mark Williams described as \u201cmarketing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d Williams told Fortune. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s part of their business strategy to force the hand of the SEC.\u201d\n\nWilliam Brannan, vice chair of the crypto practice at Lowenstein Sandler, said that Prometheum would be creating \u201cunnecessary controversy\u201d by announcing Ether as the first asset it would custody, given the SEC\u2019s reluctance to take a stance on it.\n\nEven though Prometheum\u2019s primary regulator is FINRA, which operates separately from the SEC, Brannan said FINRA likely would be working with the SEC on the question of Prometheum\u2019s launch of Ether custodial services, owing to the decision\u2019s magnitude.\n\n\u201cMy hunch would be that, particularly for these types of issues, FINRA is in very close contact and consultation with the SEC, and would likely be liaising with them and seeking to get some clarification on their position,\u201d Brannan told Fortune.\n\nAccording to a company spokesperson, since Prometheum received the special purpose broker-dealer license from FINRA, it doesn\u2019t require further approval to make assets available for custody, but it has informed FINRA of its plans to offer services for ETH.\n\nSpokespersons from FINRA and the SEC both declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nIf the SEC took action to stop the offering, it would likely come after Prometheum launched its custodial services for Ether. Still, Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg and a former SEC enforcement attorney, said that he does not expect the SEC to block Prometheum\u2019s approach given Gensler\u2019s stated desire to find a company that can operate under the SEC\u2019s preferred guardrails. \u201cThe SEC, given their position on crypto being a security, wants successful registrants in the marketplace that are complying with federal securities laws and supporting their position,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThe question remains whether Prometheum can draw investor interest\u2014and whether its approach will survive subsequent SEC administrations. The Kaplan brothers argue that creating a compliant approach will drive institutional participation in the crypto industry, although they haven\u2019t specified if the trading platform has potential clients lined up. Williams expressed skepticism that Prometheum would pull off its bold move. \u201cThey\u2019re not market-tested, so I would just have some caution in regard to their ability,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nBut even if Prometheum can\u2019t drum up demand, or running the operation proves too expensive, a successful launch could upend the industry\u2019s argument that crypto is incompatible with existing securities laws. And that clarity, Brannan said, wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of value,\u201d he told Fortune, \u201cin just knowing exactly what the rules of the road are.\u201d"
