        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been on the rise over the last few months, breaking through resistance levels one by one. Yet, the cryptocurrency might have reached a potential turning point.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the market has been acting very bullish since breaking the 200-day moving average to the upside. It has been making consistently higher highs and lows, with the Relative Strength Index showing values above 50% the whole time.\n\nYet, the $2,700 resistance level decisively rejected the price to the downside last week. The market is currently consolidating below the mentioned level. Meanwhile, considering the availability of several support levels, investors can still be optimistic about the short-term trend.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chat paints a more clear picture of the recent price action. The cryptocurrency has been forming a falling wedge pattern since failing to break above the $2,700 resistance area.\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge can result in a retest of the $2,700 level, while a breakdown would be catastrophic, as the price could drop toward the $2,100 level in no time.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rates\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has been gaining momentum on the upside, market participants have become more optimistic that ETH will eventually make a new all-time high this year. Yet, too much optimism might be a worrying factor.\n\nThis chart presents the funding rates, one of the key metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Positive values indicate that buyers are more aggressive on aggregate, while negative values demonstrate that short sellers are executing their orders more aggressively.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, it is evident that the funding rates have been very positive for a while, showing values comparable to what was previously seen during the $69K all-time high range. As a result, the probability of a long liquidation cascade is very high at the moment. These potential liquidations could lead to a significant drop in the coming weeks."

But ideally, a great signal to watch that would imply continued long-term growth would be a breach below 75% of their supplies in profit once again.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "What you'll learn Most of the $370 million liquidity outflow from Ethereum via Wormhole in the last month has gone to Sui and Solana.\n\nOutflows are possibly driven by memecoin and airdrop speculation.\n\nSui\u2019s TVL has spiked 10-fold since October.\n\nSui and Solana have sucked a lot of liquidity from Ethereum over the past month.\n\nThat\u2019s according to data from crypto bridge protocol Wormhole that shows $370 million in liquidity has moved from Ethereum to other blockchains, with almost 90% going to Sui and Solana.\n\nWormhole\u2019s operations head Dan Reecer told DL News that part of the appeal can be explained by Sui\u2019s incentive programme within its ecosystem that is \u201cdriving a lot of DeFi activity.\u201d\n\nAs for Solana\u2019s popularity, he said it may be \u201crelated to people looking to earn points on different apps after seeing the recent community rewards from apps like Jito.\u201d\n\nSui and Solana dominate Ethereum bridge withdrawals via Wormhole (Wormholescan)\n\nLiquidity rotation\n\nCrypto liquidity rotators are known for keeping in touch with the latest \u201cmeta,\u201d or trend, to position themselves for possible rewards. They do so by quickly shifting liquidity to avenues likely to offer rewards for user deposits.\n\nOne of the recent metas is \u201cpoints\u201d \u2014 a system for acknowledging user participation in DeFi protocols that may qualify them for future airdrops.\n\nNFT marketplace giant Blur popularised the points airdrop system and used it to great effect in capturing significant market share from OpenSea, the previous dominant player.\n\nNow, the trend has spread across platforms, protocols, and blockchains, becoming even more commonplace on Solana.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nSeveral Solana DeFi protocols including Kamino, MarginFi, Parcl, and Solend, have announced points systems of their own.\n\nSui TVL has surged 10-fold in the last three months\n\nSui announced a $50 million incentive programme in October. Such programmes are used to attract interest from developers and investors by funding grants for the former and user rewards for the latter.\n\nSince the programme\u2019s announcement, Sui\u2019s total value locked, a measure of investor deposits, has risen 10-fold to $320 million, DefiLlama data shows.\n\nSolend, Solana\u2019s biggest DeFi lending app with $160 million in deposits, may further boost Sui\u2019s total value following its expansion to Sui.\n\nDespite the significant transfer of liquidity from Ethereum to both Solana and Sui, their combined TVL of $1.65 billion still falls far short of Ethereum\u2019s $32.6 billion.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.
