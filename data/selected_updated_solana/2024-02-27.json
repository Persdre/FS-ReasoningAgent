The activation will take place at 13:55 UTC, or 8:55 am ET.\n\nAccording to a post on X from Galaxy\u2019s Christine Kim, March 13 was the expected date for the activation, though the exact timestamp was unknown.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nStakers will need to update their beacon nodes and validator clients to be compatible with the upgrade.\n\nAs of Feb. 22, according to Kim, \u201call client teams, except Lodestar, have released final software versions for the Dencun upgrade.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun is now live on the Holesky testnet\n\nThe upgrade was run successfully on the Hole\u0161ky testnet earlier this month. It previously ran on the Goerli and Sepolia testnets.\n\nThe upgrade will introduce proto-danksharding to the Ethereum blockchain. Rollups, under EIP-4844, can add \u201cblobs\u201d of data on a beacon node.\n\n\u201cThe data in these blobs is not accessible to the EVM and is automatically deleted after a fixed time period (1-3 months). This means rollups can send their data much more cheaply and pass the savings on to end users in the form of cheaper transactions,\u201d a post on the Ethereum Org\u2019s website said in early January.\n\nThe name Dencun, the Ethereum Foundation post added, comes from a combination of star and Devcon city names. Specifically, Dencun is the combination of Deneb \u2014 a star \u2014 and Devcon 3 location Cancun.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied on Tuesday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies jumped amid speculation for another extended rally ahead of the first Ether ETFs.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday amid news of growing crypto adoption and speculation surrounding the timing of the first spot Ethereum-centric exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals.\n\nWhen all was said and done during today's regular trading session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -0.09%) was up 4.5%, Ethereum (ETH -0.78%) had gained 1.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.96%) climbed 12.2%.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs approved, are Ether ETFs next?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin climbed above $57,000 today for the first time since December 2021, apparently bolstered by record inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Around $2.5 billion flowed into digital asset investment products last week, according to data from crypto research firm CoinShares, with Bitcoin funds responsible for 99% of those inflows. That influx of capital followed a historic decision last month by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to simultaneously approve the first 13 applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThose approvals, of course, were the culmination of months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August that prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. That inaction put the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its Bitcoin ETF approval process.\n\nFor several weeks leading up to the SEC's multiple thumbs up, many opportunistic traders capitalized on a broad crypto rally while noting that ETFs are a much more accessible medium for investors hoping to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage, in contrast to the previous need for investors to set up separate crypto accounts or wallets with a crypto-specific broker. The approvals also stand tall as a de facto vote of confidence from a government agency in crypto ETFs as a legitimate investment medium.\n\nStill, it's worth noting that after a multi-month rally that began in October, major cryptocurrencies initially pulled back following the official launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs six weeks ago.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm CryptoQuant, however, the capital influx stemming from spot crypto ETFs -- including a potential Ether ETF next -- has the potential to increase the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization by a total of more than $1 trillion over the long term.\n\nTo that end, crypto traders have now turned their eyes toward the date of May 23, 2024 -- which is the final deadline for the SEC to approve (or deny) spot Ether ETF applications from multiple investment management companies including VanEck and Ark's 21Shares.\n\nWhat's next for crypto investors?\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that spot Ether ETFs will be approved in May. But given the similarity of the assets and the precedent set by the dozens of now-live Bitcoin ETFs, the likelihood of an SEC denial seems extraordinarily low with the proverbial crypto ETF floodgates already opened.\n\nBut with the May 23 deadline now less than three months away, analysts at both Bloomberg and Standard Chartered have mused in recent weeks that anticipation of the first Ether ETFs could spark a similar extended rally to what we saw leading up to the first Bitcoin ETF approvals. Considering the Bitcoin ETF hype cycle appeared to spark its own rally around three months prior to those approvals, it's no surprise we're now seeing increased speculation surrounding the potential Ether ETF approval timeline.\n\n\"The Ether spot [ETF] is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot for sure,\" mused Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas last month. \"It's gonna go wherever it goes -- it's basically like on a 15-foot rope following it.\"\n\nIn the end, keep in mind these hype-based gains could be fickle over the short term. But there's obviously multiple billions of very real dollars each week flowing into crypto assets as the world steadily appears to be accepting it as a valid place to park capital. If that keeps happening, it will be no surprise to see the prices of major cryptocurrencies continue to rise accordingly."

        "title": "4 Crypto Stocks to Watch in the 2024 Ethereum Institutional Rally - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum (ETH), has started 2024 on a great note. While Bitcoin (BTC), too, has been fast off the blocks, rising 20% year to date, ETH has risen 33%. Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nThe network has, over the past year, completed the Shanghai Upgrade. The upgrade has ensured that it shifts its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Under the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nThis has led to far stricter trading, and ETH supply has remained stagnant as a result. Also, the amount of Ether locked up has risen significantly, with ETH held on exchanges at an all-time low of 11%.\n\nHowever, per Bybit Research, the biggest boost has come from the new institutional investments. Institutions are over-allocating their portfolio to ETH compared to BTC. This is in contrast to the retail crypto market, where investors lean on Bitcoin.\n\nMajor players like Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, which already had Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are among firms that have submitted applications for an ether ETF. In fact, demand has gone up over the past few weeks, with market participants expecting a probable ether spot ETF approval by May of this year. ETH is currently trading above $3200, and the next earmarked resistance level is $3500.\n\nSo, with Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.
