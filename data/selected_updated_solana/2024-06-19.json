        "content": "Ether\u2019s value surged past US$3,500 as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wrapped up its investigation on Ethereum.\n\nThe conclusion of the SEC\u2019s investigation, which did not result in any charges related to Ethereum\u2019s sales as securities, has been met with enthusiasm from investors and the Ethereum community.\n\nThis development comes after Consensys, an Ethereum developer, contested the SEC\u2019s regulatory stance, advocating for Ethereum\u2019s classification as a commodity.\n\nConsensys\u2019 legal challenge, initiated in April 2024, sought to limit the SEC\u2019s regulatory reach over Ethereum and to obtain a judicial declaration affirming its commodity status.\n\nThe culmination of this legal battle, combined with public and political support, prompted a favorable outcome from the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division on June 18.\n\nThe resolution of the SEC\u2019s scrutiny lifts a major uncertainty that had been casting a shadow over Ethereum, potentially impacting its classification and market demand.\n\nThe announcement of the investigation\u2019s end was met with an immediate response in the market, with Ethereum\u2019s trading price climbing to $3,586, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe SEC approved a series of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last month, paving the way for their trading on the stock market.\n\nAnnounced on May 23, this decision came amidst legislative efforts to define the regulatory roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the crypto industry, with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act still pending in the Senate."

        "title": "Ethereum gets huge win as SEC closes investigation into securities sale allegations - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, determining that sales of ETH are not securities transactions. The decision comes after a letter from Consensys on June 7, seeking clarity following the May approvals of ETH ETFs, which were based on ETH being classified as a commodity. Consensys stated,\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nEthereum rose over 4% overnight following the news, pulling the rest of the crypto market with it as many projects positive over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is the notable exception, down 0.74% according to CryptoSlate data as of press time.\n\nConsensys announced this development as a significant victory for Ethereum developers and the broader industry. The closure of the investigation signifies a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community, providing a reprieve from potential regulatory actions that could have categorized ETH as a security. The SEC\u2019s decision aligns with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) stance, which has consistently classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nDespite this positive outcome, Consensys continues its legal battle against the SEC to secure further regulatory clarity. The company argues that the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions against blockchain developers and technology providers have been overly aggressive and unlawful. Consensys\u2019s lawsuit also seeks a declaration that offering user interface software like MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate securities laws.\n\nAs Consensys emphasized, the legal fight is not just about Ethereum but about safeguarding the future of blockchain innovation in the United States. The SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum had posed a risk to adopting and developing blockchain technologies, with potential negative implications for US leadership in this sector. By challenging the SEC\u2019s authority, Consensys aims to prevent what it describes as an unlawful power grab that could hinder technological advancements and economic opportunities.\n\nThe resolution of the Ethereum investigation marks a critical juncture, but Consensys insists that the broader regulatory environment still requires significant reform. The company\u2019s lawsuit highlights the need for clear guidelines that support innovation while ensuring compliance with existing laws. As the blockchain industry evolves, resolving these regulatory issues will be crucial in determining the pace and direction of technological progress.\n\nAccording to Consensys, fighting for regulatory clarity is essential to ensuring blockchain technology continues growing and contributing to the economy. The company\u2019s actions reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for balanced regulation that fosters innovation without stifling growth.\n\nIndustry participants and regulators alike will closely watch the outcome of Consensys\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. The case highlights the tensions between regulatory oversight and technological innovation, a dynamic that will shape the future of blockchain technology and its applications.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "SEC drops investigation into Ethereum studio Consensys - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum fans can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its investigation into the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nEthereum development studio Consensys shared the news on X overnight.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0,\u201d the company posted.\n\n\u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIndications of an SEC probe into Ethereum and entities supporting the protocol circulated in March, when Fortune reported the agency was investigating three unnamed related companies for potential securities violations.\n\nConsensys then sued the SEC one month later, alleging regulatory overreach. The suit claimed chairman Gary Gensler sought to grab power over the crypto space, using legal maneuvers that would force ETH into a security definition following its switch to proof of stake in September 2022.\n\nPart of those filings disclosed that Consensys had received a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating the agency\u2019s intent to sue. The Fort Worth firm, which owns popular web3 infrastructure including crypto wallet MetaMask and API provider Infura, was founded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.\n\nWhile the SEC probe was expected to be dropped following approval of a suite of spot ether ETFs last month, the formal notice puts to bed one of crypto\u2019s primary existential threats, at least for now.\n\nFormer SEC chair Jay Clayton had initially backed SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman\u2019s notion that ether was no longer a security in 2019, as there was no central entity in control of the cryptocurrency at the time. No official statement had been given by the agency, however, and Gensler had seemingly been walking back those thoughts ever since.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Alexander Grieve, government affairs lead at venture capital firm Paradigm, tweeted a copy of the SEC\u2019s letter to Consensys. It reads:\n\n\u201cWe write to provide notice that we have concluded the investigation in the [matter of Ethereum 2.0]\u2026. based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc. with respect to this investigation.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe letter added that the notice was given under guidelines in the Securities Act which state that it \u201cmust in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nAll good news for Consensys but other legal threats still loom over crypto. So far, there\u2019s no word of the SEC\u2019s Uniswap probe being dropped, although a lawsuit has not yet been filed.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
