        "content": "A widely followed analyst and trader is offering his forecast on three crypto assets.\n\nStarting with the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap, the analyst pseudonymously known as Inmortal tells his 209,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) could replicate its rival Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) explosive rally from early 2020 to late 2021 and skyrocket by similar multiples.\n\nEthereum went up from the low of a price of just under $90 reached in March of 2020 to an all-time high price of just below $5,000 which was recorded in November of 2021.\n\nFrom the current price, Solana could go up by approximately 182% from the current level, according to Inmortal. If the fifth-largest crypto asset were to reach Inmortal\u2019s peak-of-the-cycle target, Solana would have recorded a 60x gain from the December of 2022 low.\n\n\u201cPrevious cycle ETH went from $80 to $4,800.\n\nThis cycle SOL will go from $8 to $480.\u201d\n\nTurning to Floki (FLOKI), Inmortal says that the memecoin is undergoing vertical accumulation, a situation where the price of an asset range-trades while gradually inching upwards.\n\nBased on the pseudonymous analyst\u2019s chart, it appears that Inmortal is suggesting that FLOKI could fall significantly after breaking above the all-time high of slightly under $0.00034 before going on to rally in a parabolic move.\n\nFLOKI is trading at $0.000247 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is the blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). According to the pseudonymous analyst, LINK could be preparing for the second wave of a rally.\n\nBased on Inmortal\u2019s chart, it appears that the analyst sees LINK rallying by around 68% from the current level to a price of $32.\n\nChainlink is trading at $19 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.\n\nAlexander Grieve @AlexanderGrieve The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N\n\nFollowing the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nA part of the letter read:\n\nRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of the Ethereum token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry continues to display a significant fluctuation in the chart, suggesting an increased price action in the market. Further, the market leader, Bitcoin price, has successfully claimed a new all-time high of over $73,000, highlighting a positive outlook for the market in the coming time.\n\nOn the other hand, the altcoin leader, the Ethereum token, had successfully crossed the $4,000 market during the previous week, following which it experienced a significant correction in valuation. Further, the XRP token has displayed a similar trend, indicating increased volatility in the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC):\n\nThe Bitcoin price traded in a closed range between $50,540 and $52,853 for a brief period. As the volatility in the market increased, the bulls jumped 24.53% within three days, following which the price faced rejection at $64,287. After trading sideways for a while, the bulls regained momentum and jumped 11.03% before facing rejection at $68,296.\n\nThe bulls then lost momentum and tested their low of $61,025, but the bulls quickly regained momentum and leveled all their losses. Following this, the bulls constantly traded under a bullish influence and recorded a new ATH of above $73,000. Since then, the price has been trading under a bearish influence.\n\nTradingView: BTC/USDT\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a decline in the red histogram, indicating a decrease in the bearish influence in the crypto space. Further, the averages show a high possibility of a bullish convergence, suggesting a bullish price action for the BTC price in the coming time.\n\nIf the market holds the price above the support level of $68,296, the bulls will regain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $73,844 during the coming week. Conversely, if the bulls fail to regain momentum, the price will lose momentum and fall to test its lower support level of $64,287.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nThe ETH price traded in a closed range between $2,609 and $2,883 for over a week, after which the bulls gained enough momentum to break out of the resistance level, where the price displayed a neutral trend for the next few days.

Moreover, the averages show a flatline, suggesting uncertainty in the future price action of the coin in the market.\n\nIf the market pushes the price above the resistance level of $3,733, the bulls will regain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $4,200.
