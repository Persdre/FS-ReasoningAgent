Explain the Neon M and Deb bridge integration to me like I'm Five Neon Em is like translator from Ethereum language to Solana language and the bridge. It's a distraught that connects all assets and allow you to move assets from Ethereum to Solana board. What's the most exciting development in DFI? So since you for sure, you own your assets and second from development perspective, you can experiment with all types of financial instruments on how to work with it without any regulations. How did you get into crypto when I heard about philosophy and ideas of web tree space? And it was for me like continue moving from banking and security to crypto and security like a tokens. What's the biggest challenge facing developers right now, interoperability between all protocols and standards?"

        "content": "A Solana-based (SOL) decentralized rendering altcoin is trading sideways despite the news that the top US crypto exchange platform would be adding support for it.\n\nIn a new announcement, Coinbase says that it\u2019s going to be listing Render (RENDER), a decentralized altcoin that allows users to share their unused GPU (graphics processing unit) power to render graphics and visual effects for other projects as a means of earning rewards.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will add support for Render on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported.\u201d\n\nThe digital asset had a lukewarm response to the listing, as it is trading for $4.91 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease over the last 24 hours.\n\nRender used to be an Ethereum-based (ETH) token, but it switched over to Solana in late 2023. According to Jules Urbach, the project\u2019s founder, the move greatly enhanced the utility of the protocol.\n\nSays Urbach,\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it will be supporting both the Solana and Ethereum versions of the asset, noting that the tokens have slightly different names across blockchains.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will support trading of the Render token on both Ethereum and Solana networks. Render on the Ethereum network will retain the ticker RNDR while Render on Solana will have the ticker RENDER and will be named Render (Solana) on our trading platform.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Genesis Global has been approved by the bankruptcy court to sell around 35 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision during a court hearing held in White Plains, New York.\n\nThis approval authorizes Genesis to monetize its holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust.\n\nGenesis to Sell its GBTC Shares\n\nIn addition to the $1.3 billion in GBTC shares, Genesis intends to sell over 11 million shares in two Grayscale Ethereum Trusts, with a combined value exceeding $200 million, as detailed in a court filing dated February 2.\n\nThis will result in a total of approximately $1.6 billion shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) combined.\n\nHowever, Genesis\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, attempted to delay the proposed sale until after the bankruptcy court decides on the subsidiary\u2019s debt repayment plan, which is scheduled for later this month. DCG expressed concerns that premature Grayscale share sales could depress prices, minimizing potential recoveries for Genesis creditors.\n\nJeffrey Saferstein, representing DCG, also emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid the rapid unloading of shares. Additionally, DCG sought the right to seek input on selling Grayscale shares.\n\nDespite these objections, Judge Sean Lane ruled in favor of Genesis, asserting the company\u2019s right to determine the strategic sale of its assets. He emphasized that the sales would be conducted over time with the assistance of a broker to prevent any rapid unloading of shares, which could adversely affect prices.\n\nLane justified his decision by highlighting the \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d of Genesis and its creditors in crypto, suggesting that they are well-equipped to maximize the value of the Grayscale shares.\n\nSEC and NY Attorney General Settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Genesis is moving forward with its liquidation plan, which entails shutting down the company and repaying customers in cash or cryptocurrency, depending on the nature of their deposits.\n\nThe company has reached settlements with the U.S. SEC and New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month, resolving their objections to its bankruptcy plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlements, the SEC will be paid a $21 million fine if Genesis has any surplus funds after repaying customers. Furthermore, any funds recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings will be used by the New York Attorney General to assist creditors allegedly defrauded by Genesis."

        "content": "Thu 15 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nIn the particularly booming crypto market landscape lately, making a relevant choice between positioning on Bitcoin or Ethereum can be quite the dilemma. These two crypto ecosystems are the leaders of the crypto market. But they are distinctly different in terms of their functionalities and advantages. Understanding this divergence can be crucial for your crypto investment choices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the safest crypto investment over Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is often nicknamed the \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its longevity and its increasing value over time. It is now widely regarded as a store of value and a hedge against often rampant inflation.\n\nMoreover, its simplicity and history make it an appealing choice for cautious, or even wary, investors. On this point, it stands out significantly from Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum firm.\n\nThe latter offers a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just limited to being a simple cryptocurrency.\n\nThanks to its flexibility, this platform paves the way to new prospects in various sectors such as finance and logistics, among others. This leads some to say that Ethereum represents decentralized innovation where Bitcoin is a safe investment choice. However, this doesn\u2019t always settle the question of choosing between these two crypto platforms.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum: how to make the choice?\n\nThe choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly depends on your investment goals and your risk tolerance as an investor. Generally, Bitcoin is a good option if you\u2019re looking to preserve value, due to its stability and reputation as a safe asset.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for growth opportunities, Ethereum might be particularly attractive because of its potential for innovation and its diversity of applications. This characteristic makes it an undisputed solution in terms of application development, due to its structure that\u2019s especially suitable for deploying dApps in a relevant way.\n\nEither way, these two crypto platforms share one common factor. As with the majority of cryptocurrencies, they are subject to high volatility and face uncertain regulations in many regions around the world. Even though Bitcoin features a more established technology while Ethereum is constantly evolving with regular updates.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum will depend on your investor profile and your long-term goals. Hence the need to do your own research beforehand to take into account your particularities in terms of crypto investment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
