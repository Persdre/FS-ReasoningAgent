        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet thought to belong to former U.S. President Donald Trump recently moved millions in crypto earned from sales of non-fungible tokens, according to reports from Arkham Intelligence on Dec. 27.\n\nArkham noted that Trump\u2019s wallet began to send his ETH holdings to Coinbase three weeks ago and has moved 1,075 ETH, worth $2.4 million, to the exchange. Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "On Dec. 26, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said, \u201cEthereum is going to make a lot of new millionaires in 2024.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that those with a lot of ETH, purchased at much lower prices and staked, will do well in the next bull market. But those getting into the market now, with the asset trading over $2,000, are not going to make it big unless they have a lot to invest.\n\nThe big returns will be made trading Ethereum layer-2 assets, he said.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nEthereum to $15,000\n\nLark highlighted a number of current and upcoming layer-2 listings, such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. \u201cNew listings can make money, especially in the short term,\u201d he said.\n\nNewly launched tokens often exhibit pump-and-dump patterns as airdrop hunters offload them quickly. However, there have been several that have begun up trending soon after when they get listed on larger exchanges.\n\nFor the Ethereum hodlers, things could still be good in 2024. He compared gains for ETH from previous cycles and made a prediction for the next bull cycle in 2024 and 2025.\n\nNow that the asset has broken out from its resistance zone at $2,150, \u201cit\u2019s going to do big things.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum makes similar gains to the last cycle high, or even slightly less, \u201cthat will get us up to around $15,000 per coin.\u201d\n\nThis is on a hypothetical 200% gain from the previous high, which was around $4,880 in November 2021.\n\nFor those buying now, there is a potential 500-600% gain, he said, which is a \u201crelatively low-risk bet for crypto.\u201d\n\nEthereum is very strong fundamentally despite the lack of love recently from the crypto community.\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nCrypto markets are in retreat this Wednesday in Asia. As a result, ETH prices dropped 2% on the day in a fall to $2,223 at the time of writing.\n\nMoreover, the asset has now declined 6.8% from its 2023 high of $2,385 on Dec. 9. There is solid support at the $2,150 area where it could be heading next as markets continue to cool.\n\nThere is little doubt that the asset will perform well in the next bull cycle, but at the moment, the Ethereum engines are spluttering a little."

        "content": "Ethereum price looks poised for a continuation of the uptrend, with several technical indicators favoring the upside.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price is likely to face a correction after a multi-month period of SOL being massively overbought.\n\nETH could rise almost 7% to hit $2,500 amid rising momentum and a possible pending buy signal.\n\nA break and close below the critical support at $2,147 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks poised for a shine after a prolonged contention against its peer in the Layer 1 space, Solana (SOL). This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
