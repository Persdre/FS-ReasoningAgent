The benchmark S&P 500 rally recently hit a new all-time high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing profitability\n\nAccording to recent data provided by IntoTheBlock, 94% of Ethereum holders are making money at the current price, with only 6% at breakeven and none in the loss zone.\n\nAn in-depth look at Ethereum\u2019s global in/out of the money indicates that a majority of addresses (94.3%) are \"in the money,\" meaning they would profit if they sold their holdings at the current price. Interestingly, there are no addresses \"out of the money\" at present, and 5.70% are \"at the money,\" hovering around the break-even point.\n\nThis data indicates that the Ethereum market is currently experiencing a bullish phase, with most investors sitting on potential gains.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of addresses bought at various price points further displays the market's optimism, especially for those who invested when prices ranged between $3,381.23 and $4,579.78.\n\nEther's market dynamics\n\nThe price correlation with Bitcoin stands strong at 0.97, highlighting the interconnected nature of the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe holders\u2019 composition by time held shows a stable investment pattern, with 75% holding for more than a year, 21% between one month and a year, and a mere 4% for less than a month.\n\nIn terms of transaction demographics, there is an almost equal split between the West (51%) and the East (49%), with transaction volumes exceeding $58.49 billion over the past week alone, reflecting robust market activity."

        "title": "How Much Will the Dencun Upgrade Really Reduce Ethereum Layer 2 Fees By? - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is scheduled for next week and is set to reduce fees on layer 2s by at least 10 times, if not more.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is set to dramatically reduce fees on layer 2s when it rolls out next week.\n\nIn less than a week\u2019s time, fees on Ethereum layer 2 networks are set to be reduced dramatically, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade.\n\nScheduled for March 13, Dencun is the next major upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s ambitious multi-year roadmap to reduce transaction fees, increase security, and future proof the network. At the heart of Ethereum\u2019s scaling plan are layer 2 solutions, which help reduce the load on the network.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade includes a highly-anticipated improvement protocol EIP-4844, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d that benefits layer 2 rollups that bundle together transactions and post them as a single piece of data to Ethereum.\n\nAfter the upgrade, instead of rollups needing to use calldata to post transactions to Ethereum, which is costly and makes up around 90% of the gas fees required to post bundled transactions, layer 2s will now be able to use a highly optimized and much cheaper transaction type called \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nOn X last Saturday, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin noted that 125kb of calldata costs around 0.06 ether ($231.27), while users on the prediction market Polymarket expect the gas price of an equivalent-sized blob to be 0.001 ether ($3.93), which is a cost saving of around 60 times.\n\nPolymarket is predicting that blobs (~125 kB) will cost ~0.001 ETH. Today, 125 kB calldata costs ~30 gwei per gas * 16 gas per byte * 125000 gas ~= 0.06 ETH And if you think polymarket's guess that blobs will be 60x cheaper is over-optimistic, you can use the market to hedge! pic.twitter.com/vUwJInNhCP \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 3, 2024\n\nAll Bets Are Off\n\nAround 36% of users betting on the topic on Polymarket believe a blob will cost less than 0.0001 ether ($0.39), while 33% think it will be between 0.0001 ether ($0.39) and 0.001 ether ($3.93).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty wide range of views, even on the prediction markets, as to how big the reduction will be,\u201d said Ed Felten, co-founder and chief scientist at Offchain Labs, the research and development firm behind Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum.\n\nThe lack of historical pricing for blob gas, which is the gas consumed by transactions that make use of blobs, makes it difficult to predict with certainty how much an average transaction will cost, said Luke Nolan, Ethereum research associate at digital asset investment manager CoinShares. He points out that even the layer 2 rollup Optimism uses Polymarket\u2019s predictions as a midpoint estimate within its saving calculator.\n\nPredicting the price can be a dangerous exercise, said Nicolas Liochon, founder of Linea, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain bootstrapped by Consensys. The real price will vary based on demand, he said. At the price levels predicted by users on the Polymarket, many external actors may want to use this blob space and, more broadly, activity on rollups is increasing dramatically, he added, which are both factors that could influence the fee reduction.\n\nConservative Estimates\n\nCoinshares\u2019 Nolan agrees that transaction fees are unlikely to be sustained at a level of 60 times cheaper than in the current system if demand is high for blobs. As a conservative estimate, it\u2019s more likely transaction fees will be reduced by 15 to 20 times, he added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good likelihood it will be a 10 times or more reduction, but I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on that,\u201d Felten said. \u201cIt could easily be less.\u201d\n\nSeveral layer 2s are predicting a reduction factor in fees closer to six to 10 times, which was stated at various ETHDenver panels, said Toni Mateos, co-founder and chief technology officer at LAOS network, which is a layer 1 blockchain deployed as a parachain within Polkadot.\n\nRead More: Top Takeaways From ETHDenver\n\nAverage layer 2 gas fees have ranged from $0.15 to $0.60 this year, according to a blog post from Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. He also estimates that costs will be cut by at least 10 times, thanks to the introduction of blobs.\n\nOn Base, the new Ethereum layer 2 from crypto exchange Coinbase, transaction fees are expected to decline from double-digit to single-digit cents, said Roberto Bayardo, a core developer at Base.\n\n\u201cFee reductions will vary depending on how aggressively the layer 2 chains take advantage of blob data,\u201d Bayardo said. \u201cWe expect Optimistic rollups, like Base, to benefit the most, since they can aggressively compress transaction data stored in blobs, and otherwise have minimal layer 1 gas costs.\u201d\n\nFor Morph, an Ethereum scaling solution that looks to combine the strengths of Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge technology, its aim is to have as many layer 2 transactions as possible in a blob to share this cost. Test results show a range of 50% to 90% improvement in costs under different transactions-per-seconds and optimization methods, said Ender Lu, chief technology officer at Morph.\n\n\u201cThe cost of one blob remains fixed, regardless of whether it is fully utilized,\u201d Lu said. \u201cFor example, whether you put 100 or 1,000 transactions into one blob, the gas cost remains the same.\u201d\n\nLayer 2s with high activity levels will have an advantage, said Linea\u2019s Liochon. Chains which can delay posting to maximally fill blobs to capacity will see the greatest cost reductions, while lower traffic chains may not have this flexibility, Bayardo said.\n\nEthereum Layer 2s that don\u2019t use Ethereum for data availability, such as side chains or Plasma chains, won\u2019t derive significant benefits from this upgrade, Lu said.\n\nA Waiting Game\n\nThere\u2019s also a whole series of unknowns that will only be fully understood once the upgrade is rolled out and people\u2019s behaviors adapt, Offchain Labs\u2019 Felten said.\n\nDifferent layer 2s will have different policies around how they will pass any cost savings from fee reductions to users, LAOS Network\u2019s Mateos said.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 fees don\u2019t necessarily correlate directly with submission costs to the layer 1,\u201d Mateos said. \u201cThis fact varies by layer 2, some of which subsidize part of their costs to gain traction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether block builders, which are validators that construct blocks on the network, will require tips to include blobs and whether those costs will get passed back to the users, Felten said. And there\u2019s also uncertainty around how much traffic will come to rollups as a result of the fee reductions and to what extent increased traffic pushes prices back up, he added.\n\n\u201cAfter the upgrade, it\u2019s important to not think after 12 or 24 hours that we know what the future will be,\u201d Felten said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take longer than that to really learn the full impact of it.\u201d\n\nStill one thing remains certain, and that is that blobs are going to be much cheaper than calldata, Coinshares\u2019 Nolan said.\n\n\u201cEven a big uptick in this blob gas price means that it will always be cheaper to use blobs as opposed to calldata, no matter how much pent up demand there is,\u201d he said."
