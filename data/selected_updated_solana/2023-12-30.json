        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin talked about the blockchain\u2019s future in his recent blog.\n\nUsage of network remained high, however, its price saw a correction.\n\nEven though multiple altcoins have followed suit after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] rally, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price has not seen much growth in the recent past.\n\nDespite this developments have ensued on the network with founder Vitalik committed to the vision of Ethereum.\n\nHas Ethereum lost its Cypherpunk?\n\nIn a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Vitalik Buterin outlined a promising future for the network, driven by significant developments across various fronts.\n\nHe stated that scalability solutions, such as rollups, are addressing Ethereum\u2019s historical scalability challenges, allowing for more efficient transaction processing. Second-generation privacy solutions, including projects like Railway and Nocturne, are enhancing user confidentiality.\n\nHe also mentioned the concept of account abstraction is gaining traction, enabling users to interact with smart contracts without the need for native cryptocurrency holdings, making Ethereum more accessible.\n\nProgress in the development of light clients is reducing resource requirements and increasing network accessibility. Zero knowledge proofs, once considered a distant technology, are becoming more developer-friendly, offering enhanced privacy and verification capabilities.\n\nThe blog post also emphasizes a return to core values within the crypto community, including open global participation, decentralization, and a cooperative mindset.\n\nThese updates collectively aim to address scalability concerns, reduce transaction fees, and bolster privacy and security.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum may experience improved efficiency, making it more appealing to a wider user base and enabling a broader array of applications.\n\nHowever, the success of these changes depends on community adoption and effective implementation.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nComing to the state of the protocol, it was seen that the gas usage on the network has remained consistent. This meant activity on the network was high.\n\nHowever, the number of NFT trades occurring on the Ethereum network has fallen.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis could have a negative impact on Ethereum in the future as NFT trades make up a large amount of the overall activity on the network.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,361.39 and its price had fallen by -1.21% in the last 24 hours. Only time will tell whether Vitalik\u2019s long term vision will help ETH\u2019s price see further growth."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale has recently made a huge purchase of 25,674 ETH; however, this action could backfire if the price of ETH falls below a specific threshold, triggering a liquidation event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom all indications, it appears that the whale obtained the said ETH from MakerDAO. This decentralized lending platform allows users to mint stablecoins (DAI) by locking up their crypto assets as collateral.\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,257, the smart money will be in danger of liquidation.\n\n\n\nThe healthy ratio on #Maker is as low as 1.03.\n\n\n\nThe smart money once again spent 61M $DAI to buy 25,674 $ETH, and then sold 5,851 $ETH for 14M $DAI, making ~$99K.https://t.co/yGkFI6qpnj pic.twitter.com/VRmstUCngE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 29, 2023\n\nLookonchain reports that the whale had spent 61 million DAI to buy 25,674 ETH; however, the whale shortly after sold 5,851 ETH out of this stash for a value of 14 million DAI, of which they made a profit of $99,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the whale had made some profits from this strategy, they also faced the risk of liquidation. If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "title": "The Year Of Ethereum: ETH Long-Term Holder Percentage Surpasses BTC - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The percentage of long-term ETH holders has skyrocketed this year to surpass Bitcoin for the second time ever. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has done pretty well in its percentage of long-term holders this year, with over 70% of investors currently holding on to their assets for more than a year, a new milestone for the blockchain.\n\nETH Long-Term Holders Now Top BTC\n\nEthereum\u2019s price activity has largely underperformed this year when compared to Bitcoin. But this isn\u2019t surprising, as Bitcoin has led the entire industry in bullish metrics and investor confidence this year. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggest more Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH for the long haul, hopefully with the belief that it will continue to rise substantially in value over time.\n\nLong-term holders are investors who refuse to sell their crypto even during times of market volatility and price depreciation. They are particularly important in maintaining the overall health of any blockchain, as they help to provide stability and reduce price volatility.\n\nHistory has shown Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin as regards this metric only once before. It\u2019s important to note that the last time this happened, ETH would go on to lead in this metric over the subsequent months.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, In/Out of the Money metric by IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin leading Ethereum in terms of profitability. At the time of writing, 82.25% of all BTC addresses are making money at the current price, compared to 76.10% of ETH addresses.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high profitability can be linked to a huge number of early Bitcoins assumed to be lost forever. As a result, the percentage of holders who bought at the current price metric puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $1.6 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAround 63% of ETH addresses who bought around the current price of $1,948 and $2,641 are still in profit compared to BTC\u2019s 52% of addresses that bought between $35,729 and $48,402.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $2,285 and is up by 91% this year. However, the asset\u2019s price has largely underperformed in comparison to major altcoins like Solana and Cardano, who are currently up by 925% and 145% respectively this year.\n\nInterestingly, this hasn\u2019t stopped bullish predictions from coming in regarding Ethereum. One of these is a prediction from BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, who estimated an astounding $5,000 price for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Raoul Pau also looked at price history to predict ETH outperforming BTC becoming a key macro trend of 2024. The first step in achieving this would be to break above the $2,380 price level.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026 I think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nFeatured image from Pexels"

        "content": "What\u2019s Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Surge\n\nSolana Flipped Ethereum in Google Search Interest\n\nGoogle searches for the term \"Solana\" surpassed \"Ethereum\" for the first time in 2023, indicating growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nFrom December 17 to 23, Solana's search interest score reached 56, while Ethereum's was 50. Google Trends data suggests that Solana's search interest is set to peak during the week of December 24 to 30, with a score of 100.\n\nUsers searching for Solana also showed interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk (BONK) is the leading Solana memecoin that reached a peak market cap of $1.9 billion after being listed on Binance and Coinbase, while Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, after surpassing Magic Eden in trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s DEX Volumes and NFT Sales Surpassed Ethereum\u2019s\n\nOn December 23, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and non-fungible token (NFT) sales.\n\nDEX volume on Solana surged to over $10 billion, surpassing Ethereum's $8.8 billion for that week. Meanwhile, Solana also processed $109 million in NFT sales in that week, eclipsing Ethereum by $30 million.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is leading in terms of DEX volumes, with $10.12 billion compared to Solana\u2019s $8.71 billion. However, Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume is still ahead of Ethereum\u2019s, although Bitcoin is leading due to the recent Ordinals frenzy.\n\nThe current frenzy on Solana is partly driven by memecoins, particularly BONK, which has skyrocketed by 300% in December and has a market cap of over $1 billion. Another Solana-based memecoin, Dogwifhat, has also gained 428% in the past week.\n\nSolana Flipped BNB in Market Cap Momentarily\n\nOn December 22, Solana surged by 18% to overtake BNB (BNB), propelling it to 4th place in terms of market capitalization. SOL traded at a market cap of $41.9 billion, surpassing BNB, which had a market cap of $41.8 billion.\n\nThis surge came after SOL overtook XRP in market cap on December 21. However, BNB has since regained its position after gaining over 17% in the past week. BNB is currently trading at a market cap of $47.8 million, compared to SOL\u2019s market cap of $43.7 million.\n\nSOL gained over 71% in the past month, outperforming many large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, which has only gained 12.4%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reason Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana's recent price surge can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\nIncreased User Activity\n\nActive addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% in the last three months, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s in mid-November. This suggests an exceptional increase in retail activity, with crypto users likely migrating to Solana for its lower transaction costs, increased speculative activity, airdrop farming and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirdrops and Memecoins Caused Surge in DEX Volume\n\nRecent airdrops on Solana, particularly the Jito (JTO) airdrop worth five figures, have resulted in more users flocking to other Solana-based protocols in hopes of securing a future airdrop. Furthermore, memecoins trading craze, led by the Bonk memecoin, have boosted speculative user activity, causing the DEX volume on Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s for a week. Other memecoins on Solana, like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Silly Dragon (SILLY), also saw millions in daily volume on-chain, contributing to the rise in DEX volumes.\n\nInstitutional Capital Flows Into Solana\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nSolana-based investment funds attracted $156 million in institutional inflows as of December 16, making it the crypto asset with the highest inflows behind only Bitcoin, suggesting robust institutional interest in Solana."

Currently it appears to be the largest tectonic plate covering the Blockchain sphere and you have to be fully prepared.\n\nEvery crypto and DeFi enthusiast knows what difficulties he might face during blockchain project development: strict regulation, a public opinion upon the entire industry, lack of assets security. However, let\u2019s ask ourselves a question: What stands above all of it? Uncertain future of Digital Finance? Hardly. Dependency on the Bitcoin rate? Partly yes, but recent cases show that it's not always the main factor.. Another thing came across my mind because I work a lot on the promotion of crypto and DeFi projects.\n\n(bait for ethereum lovers)\n\nI used two old Nvidia GPUs to make over 1000$ in a month using the Livepeer network, built on Ethereum, to perform video mining.\n\nStory of how I tried to become a cyborg, but with a geeky twist\n\nOR: Decentralized Exploitation, a cautionary tail about Blockchain.\n\nNothing lasts forever, but the current crop of economic \u201cisms\u201d all believe that national economies must and can grow ad infinitum.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency in the world is implementing a network upgrade, which completely changes its value proposition as a financial asset.\n\nWhen investing into cryptocurrency you want to look for projects that will make the biggest changes within an industry.

All the code is available in github or as an npm package.\n\nI have been searching for a web browser to naturally block advertisement on websites. Often, advertisements can contain trackers and sometimes even malware. Have you ever had a conversation with someone and next thing you know you see an advertisement for the thing you were talking about? Maybe it\u2019s confirmation bias, maybe it\u2019s that you are so predictable from your browser habits that the big data algorithms detect what your next move will be. The above situations are, of course, hypothetical; however, what if we didn\u2019t need to think about pesky advertisements? What would feed us suggestions for our next purchase? I digress\u2026\n\nHuge changes for Ethereum are on the horizon. We have Eth2, EIP 1559, and Layer 2 scaling. Here, we explore how they influence ETH tokenomics and price.\n\nWhat do Finance guys do?

Here's how we did it\n\nLearning a new technology can certainly be overwhelming, especially when you\u2019re a developer who already has a lot on your plate. But when it comes to looking out for the future of your career, even the busiest of developers should understand how important it is to stay current with the newest developer trends. Blockchains have, quite simply, revolutionized many spaces thanks to the implementation of dApps. But can blockchains stay at the forefront of revolutionizing technology if it becomes stagnant? Blockchain primitives will have a huge impact on the ever-changing development of distributed ledger technology, and it will all boil down to one thing: protocols.\n\nPublic blockchains involve active participants (miners, validators, node operators etc.) to contribute towards the common goal of strengthening the network and confirming transactions through some sort of distributed consensus algorithm.\n\nWith the rising popularity of cryptocurrency, the rise of a new generation of crypto-lovers has also fueled the growth of a new beast: non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe way the world interacts with visual art is changing.

This is partly because Chainlink is not a general purpose cryptocurrency but rather a programmable token focus on one of the biggest use cases for decentralized applications(DApps): integration.\n\nEverything you need to know about Option Protocols in DeFi\n\nNFT journey on Ethereum began (Yr 2015) much early than the birth of Cryptopunks. It was not until late 2017 with the launch of Cryptokitties that created public awareness around NFTs and excitement on its future prospects. The entire scope of Cryptokitties gameplay revolve arounds collecting, breeding, and auctioning kitties.\n\nThis article talks about a new token standard that can be used to deploy bonds on the ethereum blockchain. Known as ERC-3475.\n\nThe roaring popularity of blockchain technology owes a great deal to the brilliance of smart contracts. Conceptualized by computer scientist Nick Szabo in 1994, a smart contract can be considered to be a set of instructions (usually in the form of a computer program) which automatically execute when the terms of a \u2018contract\u2019 are fulfilled.\n\nIt always seems impossible until it\u2019s done. \u2014 Nelson Mandela\n\nCryptocurrencies, although the best assets of the financial world, have since inception in 2009 seen their fair share of volatility-related issues.

In fact, it is the first real-time strategy game running on Ethereum in existence.\n\nEthereum development, while still very nascent in feel, has come a long way. When I started developing Solidity smart contracts and Ethereum dapps in 2017, Truffle and Web3.js were the industry standard. These are great tools and I have tons of respect for the people that built them. However, anyone who has used them has dealt with bugs and sometimes poor developer experience. There are a few new tools out there that have clearly been inspired by these first sets of tools and made the developer process much better.\n\nI hope you enjoyed your bear market baptism.\n\nThe world witnessed some of the massive DeFi hacks in 2021 on some of the most renowned protocols like bZx, Cheese Bank, Harvest Finance, Value Defi, etc.\n\nRandom numbers in Solidity for Ethereum using the Niguez Randomity Engine\n\nThis article will guide you through running ETH2.0 Beacon Node with Lighthouse client on MacOS if you have barely to 0 experiences with Terminal command lines and you want to spin off Lighthouse Beacon node and join the validator pool on ETH2.0 Beacon chain with Lighthouse client.

Guess, what? Each of them claims to be the \u201cnext-big-thing\u201d, still they are just a broken iteration of one other.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language. It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThe mother of DeFi is Etheurem, but the true DeFi platform the world needs now is Bitcoin-based, which follows the original idea of Satoshi Nakomoto.\n\nIn this post we'll look at 10 affordable NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\ntldr; Below is a hefty and yet still somehow high-level overview of Ethereum. The roughly 5-year-old project has emerged as one of the most exciting and proven projects in the cryptocurrency space while somehow still encompassing the most risk and arguably, upside of any crypto-project. This dichotomy has allowed Ethereum to act as a sort of magic mirror for those in the industry. Fanboys and detractors alike can look into the project and see what they want to see: the 2nd-most successful crypto-project with product-market fit and an army of developers behind it or a nascent, experimental Frankenstein so complicated it would make Rube Goldberg blush.\n\nImage Credit: UnsplashThe endless possibilities of cryptocurrencies have seen a lot of businesses show interest in the token economy and the overall blockchain space.\n\nMost of the applications on Ethereum are micro-financial ones where the price per ticket ranges from $100 \u2014 $1000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply is becoming scarce while demand is rising. Here's what you need to know.\n\nHow the Internet Computer promises to serve as a decentralized, scalable layer for Web3 and blockchain-based gaming.\n\nThe future is now, it's 2020 and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are experiencing a Cambrian explosion.\n\nTypically in an enterprise, you have top-down hierarchies as the mechanism of control. Let's look at a quick example of how a DAO works differently in action.\n\nImagine you\u2019re building a startup, except at this startup, there is a clear sense of organization without humans organizing other humans. It all runs organically, and it's generative in nature, meaning it evolves, innovates and experiences high growth from within.\n\nLeaderless leadership!\n\nHow is such a way of working together achieved?\n\nThrough active participation from interested parties who share common values, missions and objectives. People-driven autonomous organizations happen mostly through voting on decisions that are proposed by other community members.\n\nYou can propose, vote and discuss decisions as a team without having to have a singular authority to report to. Resulting in new ideas being seeded and proposed from within the organization to solve mission-critical challenges that the DAO is facing.\n\nIt's really a synthesis of innovation and ambition, it's great!\n\nWith that said there are certainly some balanced benefits and drawbacks about this model that we should explore.\n\nFor the moment DAOs function in a fairly binary nature, you vote on proposals that you or others have submitted, typically these votes take place on blockchains by signing a transaction with your crypto wallet. That means the current state of DAOs is experiencing the highest growth in the blockchain industry. So whilst DAOs are now, they might be somewhat gravitating around the future of money.\n\nHowever crypto-centric it is right now, it is definitely laying out an exceptional framework that any organization type could be built upon. We are seeing many other non-crypto DAOs emerge too, using platforms like Aragon to create a DAO in minutes on the blockchain. This is achieved by creating a Governance Token on the Ethereum blockchain. When users hold these Governance Tokens they can vote on proposals put forward to the community.\n\nThese communities can even have treasuries where the DAO can organize their finances. For example, members that hold these Governance Tokens can suggest making a payment, creating a vote inside the community so it can be approved or denied collectively.\n\nThere are many lessons to learn about how to coordinate large groups of self-interested people.\n\nI recently wrote an article, \"Failure shows us the way\", where I outlined my thesis on how I think we can even coordinate groups who don't explicitly share the same values, they instead just share the same mission. It's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds with the DAOs that are experimenting right now.\n\nWhy are DAOs exploding right now?\n\nBasically there is an entire unstoppable movement happening because of projects offering up a Governance Token as a bonus to those who are using some Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nI've heard many stories from folks achieving incredible results in less than 5 days. For example, \"With YFI I earned like $3.5k on $24k\", one community member shared with me.\n\nThat example is a 14.58% increase in capital in just five days, no wonder it's getting attention.\n\nWait, how are people making money from these Governance Tokens?\n\nIn the DeFi world, there is a new meme known as Yield Farming \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf3e its technical name is Liquidity Mining.\n\nThis is where a user deposits crypto stablecoins like USDC, DAI & USDT to earn a reasonably safe and secure return, which lately seems to be roughly 8% APY. As well as this, these DeFi applications which have newly formed their own DAOs to oversee their protocols, are rewarding users with Governance Tokens when they have funds deposited into their various DeFi products.\n\nThis has added rocket fuel to the DeFi community, with an explosive $3 Billion USD flowing into projects in just the last couple of weeks. This doesn't stop here either, there are many more DAO innovations that will be made known during this wave of Governance Tokens. One example is Referral Yield Farming, where you can earn Governance Tokens for referring people to DeFi platforms without having to deposit any funds of your own.\n\nArt101 announced a Vitalik Buterin NFT collection 'Based Vitalik'\n\nThere is no doubt that the crypto space is growing at a very rapid pace, but no one can ignore the scams that are prevalent in this ecosystem. If we just go back a few years, more than 80 percent of the ICOs were identified as outright scams in a study conducted by the ICO advisory firm Statis Group.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin is the most well-known name in the Ethereum space, the birth of Ethereum was a collaborative effort, as were later developments like ERC-20. Fabian Vogelsteller is one-such early Ethereum developer and thought leader on blockchain technology. He has built many Ethereum user and developer-facing projects including the Ethereum Mist browser, the Ethereum Wallet and web3.js - the Ethereum\u2019s space most used JavaScript library.\n\nTogether with Vitalik Buterin, he proposed the ERC20 token standard, which initiated the world ICO wave and redefined investment and crowd ownership as we know it. Today Fabian is leading the concept, design, and development of the LUKSO Blockchain.\n\nPolkadot is a radically different approach to blockchain scaling. But have solutions like Binance Smart Chain already made it unnecessary?\n\nDue to a clogged network, Ethereum just got an expansion \u2014 but at what cost? Here's everything you need to know about the ethereum gas limit debate.\n\nThe other day I got myself in a situation where I needed to communicate with the Ethereum network using python in an environment where getting web3.py to work seemed pretty much impossible. Since I still needed to talk to the network, I resorted to using the JSON-RPC API provided by Ethereum, which all web3 libraries are built on top of. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty interesting! So, let\u2019s get started!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for a while, then you\u2019ve surely heard the phrase \u201cwe just need a killer app\u201d to get crypto into the mainstream. Now, as you\u2019ve most likely also noticed, many of the current decentralized applications that are out there have great ideas backing them \u2014 perhaps even revolutionary ones \u2014 so why aren\u2019t any of these dApps achieving widespread use? Why aren\u2019t they, or one of them, the \u201ckiller app\u201d that we need? I certainly don\u2019t think the gambling dApps topping the daily usage tracking charts would constitute such an app.\n\nCompanies can determine whether they should invest in blockchain by focusing on specific use cases and their market position.\n\n\u201cI need a no-code platform to build my own web3 product!\u201d Is that you? If so, discover the right tool for the job from creators of a no-code web3 platform.\n\nBlockchain is a part of a trustless digital solution.\n\nBlockchains depend heavily on network effects, i.e. the notion that networks such as telecommunication services, the Internet, or social networks become more valuable when their number of users grows. This is why ecosystem building is one of the main factors that drives the value of a Layer 1 blockchain enterprise. Here is a comparison of how different blockchain projects handle this.\n\nzkEVM is said to be the crown jewel of Ethereum scaling schemes.

Many influencers were posting about this one, casually, as they\u2019d about any other.\n\nWhen launching an NFT collection, marketing strategy is the key driver of success.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been around for many years - in almost ten years Bitcoin came a long way from digital money for geeks and a token for drug dealers to a billion-dollar asset.\n\nHere's how to create your own NFT contracts without needing to have any prior experience with programming using no-code tools available to the public.\n\nCentralized exchanges remain one of the black boxes of the crypto landscape. Despite being a gateway into the world of decentralized finance, centralized exchanges are very\u2026well\u2026centralized in nature and hide many of its intrinsic mechanics from the scrutiny of public blockchains. Not surprisingly, ten years after the creation of Bitcoin, the internal architecture of centralized exchanges remains a mystery to even the top experts in the crypto market.\n\nPhoto by Cl\u00e1udio Luiz Castro on Unsplash\n\nCentralized exchanges are, arguably, one of the most challenging components to analyze in the crypto-asset markets. While the behavior of many actors in the crypto space is transparently recorded in distributed ledgers, centralized exchanges still operate largely off-chain only publishing subset of the activity to the corresponding blockchains. Without a doubt, centralized exchanges introduce a level of opacity that challenges even the most sophisticated analytic techniques. And yet, the analysis of the behavior of centralized exchanges can yield many interesting benefits for crypto investors and traders. Imagine that you are able to effectively track large crypto transfers between exchanges that can anticipate a large position on a specific crypto asset. All that, however, requires understanding the underlying patterns in centralized exchanges.\n\nThe global healthcare crisis caused by COVID-19 has severely impacted the financial markets. From stocks to commodities, industries are in disarray.\n\nCryptographically, the brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all.\n\nThis article is about a Web3 company called YellowCard that has a crypto exchange app platform for bitcoin, ethereum and others, based for the African market.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss Grim Reaper's crypto story, the reason for his anonymity, crypto mining, EIP 1559, and more.\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed a dramatic slowdown in the Ethereum network, you\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s happening \u2013 and why it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse.\n\nSometimes the EOS platform is advertised as an ecosystem that doesn't require any fees for making transactions. Technically, it is true. However, if you try to make an EOS transaction you will eventually find out that you need to put some of your EOS coins on hold.\n\nDecentralized fundraising and the ability to raise money \u201cindependently\u201d from VCs and funds has always been a deeply rooted ideal in the crypto sphere.\n\nDeFi or decentralized finance is a growing sector in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space that defines an ecosystem of decentralized applications providing financial services with no governing authority.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make a DAO! Anyone can make their own DAO with Aragon or DAOstack, or just by forking Molloch. Even better, you can use an augmented bonding curve to fund your DAO, thanks to the amazing work by the Commons Stack folks, and there you have it! A fully-functioning DAO with just a few days of work!\n\nAfter the global economic crisis of 2008, the question of trust in the modern international financial system arose globally. The answer to this request was the emergence of the first decentralized Internet system \u2014 Bitcoin, which from \u201cdecentralized\u201d money turned into a valuable financial asset by 2020.\n\nI guess the first question is, Why? Why should an internet community become a DAO?\n\nAll but the simplest of Ethereum applications are composed of several smart contracts. This is because of a hard limit of 24KB in any deployed contract, and because your sanity will slip away as the complexity of a smart contract grows.\n\nCentralized crypto exchanges are the most important black box of the crypto ecosystem. We all use them, we have a love-hate relationship with them, and we understand very little about their internal behavior. At IntoTheBlock, we have been heads down working on a series of machine learning models that help us better understand the internal of crypto exchanges. Recently, we presented some of our initial findings at a highly oversubscribed webinar and I thought it would be elaborate further in some of the ideas discussed there.\n\nThe following are not my beliefs, but a compilation of notes from conversations I had with a self-described Bitcoin \u201cmutant\u201d, named Edan Yago, contributor to Sovryn. Letting him ramble on about Bitcoin resulted in mesmerizing, mythical, and fascinating ruminations about Bitcoin\u2019s destiny. So for one, I myself believe in Bitcoin as a digital store of value. It is a huge chunk of my portfolio, and I believe it will outlast 99% of the cryptocurrencies we have today. There is no better symbol of scarcity and hard money in crypto to date. However, I feel just about the same level of admiration for Ethereum, as it is opening up so many use cases through DeFi and DAOs. I am putting my biases aside to explain a very rare (and what I find fascinating) point of view. I present you Part 1 of The Hero\u2019s Journey of Bitcoin:\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s called Vyper, not Viper.\n\nThe go-to blockchain for decentralized finance is still Ethereum (ETH). It has the great advantage of being a first mover, so plenty of investors are already aware of ETH and its use cases. ETH tokens also played a role in the tokensale bonanza of 2017 and 2018, and are now becoming highly active again in their new role as the backbone of the DeFi market.\n\nAbout the writer\n\nMoney is a social tool to achieve cooperation among a group of people. Through history, the form of money has evolved from collectibles to coinage to currency issued by fiat. Money often reflects the values or politics of the communities that issue and use them.\n\nA list of basic blockchain terms every beginner should know.\n\nAre NFTs really harmful to the ecosystem? Read on to know more about the this statement, which is dismissed by facts, stats, and numbers.\n\nSmart Contracts are immutable, transparent, secure, and decentralized. Follow this example to learn how to write them with the programming language solidity.\n\nWe have all heard stories of crypto traders losing over 50% within weeks or even days. This is what happens when amateurs do not know how to control risk. Options when used correctly can help you combat crypto market volatility and even profit from it. I am going to share 3 strategies that professionals use daily.\n\nI am going to show the function of reading Ethereum Smart Contract by Elixir&Rust in this article\n\nHow Ethereum\u2019s composability created the most innovative ecosystem to date.\n\nGoogle, Internet Stocks and Ethereum\n\nSignificant Changes Coming to Ethereum\n\nDecentraland, Gods Unchained, and Cryptodads are among the best Ethereum NFT projects to follow in 2022.\n\nToday's most popular and promising practical application of blockchain technology is the payment field.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum is a general-purpose blockchain that is more suited to describing business logic, through advanced scripts, also known as smart contracts. Ethereum was designed with a broader vision, as adecentralized or world computer that attempts to marry the power of the blockchain, as a trust machine, with a Turing-complete contract engine. Although Ethereum borrows many ideas that were initially introduced by bitcoin, there are many divergences between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine and smart contracts are key elements of Ethereum, and constitute its main attraction. In Ethereum, smart contracts represent a piece of code written in a high-level language(Solidity, LLL, Viper) and stored as bytecode in the blockchain, in order to run reliably in a stack-based virtual machine (Ethereum Virtual Machine), in each node, once invoked. The interactions with smart contract functions happen through transactions on the blockchain network, with their payloads being executed in the Ethereum virtual machine, and the shared blockchain state being updated accordingly.\n\nblockchains offer the simplest means of keeping self-audited immutable records without having to use any third party service.\n\nMany of us have come to know about decentralized finance (DeFi) and have faced this sector with many doubts, understanding its potential, especially given the interests and the APR and APY it provides to those who interact with the various protocols.\n\nThe #creatoreconomy is changing quickly with the influence of #NFT #Crypto and #blockchain.\n\nThe two latest thrilling things in the Ethereum ecosystem are NFT and DeFi. Until 2020, these \"Money LEGOs\" were quite isolated from each other but became the arena of many new projects, innovations, and volume records. And I'm sure that there's more room to grow and blend.\n\nNowadays, binary options trading has transformed into one of the most popular financial products of the Internet era.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s first and dominant smart contract platform, has the largest dapp ecosystem with more than a million deployed smart contracts and hundreds of millions of dollars in monthly transactions\n\nThree example configurations for the new OpenZeppelin access control contract.\n\nEthereum's native crypto asset Ether will increase from $3,077 to $32,468 in the next five years, representing a 10.6x ROI.\n\nDemystifying the EVM Through Interactive Puzzles - A Walkthrough.\n\nThe State of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Job Market in 2019-2020\n\nBuilding a custom authentication flow using Amazon Cognito and MetaMask\n\nSupply elasticity is a property of money that allows the supply to expand and contract on an as-needed basis in order to meet demand. Well established monies like gold, as well as modern age cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, do not have this property.\n\nThe whole fintech industry is built around the interactions of various institutions. Fintech products can be as advanced and complex as you want them to be; they can solve essential problems for their customers, but in the end, the focal point is always some bank happily sitting on money. Thus, centralized finances are the banks and their subsidiaries. Many things in fintech are controlled by bureaucrats and most fintech apps function only because they are allowed to.\n\nThank you for checking out the 271 most read stories about Ethereum on HackerNoon.\n\nVisit the /Learn Repo to find the most read stories about any technology."
