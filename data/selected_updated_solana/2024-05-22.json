        "content": "A lot of excitement and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts are predicting that if this approval happens, Ether could surge as high as $6,600.\n\nThe estimations come from analysts at the research firm, Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. They pointed out that a 75% increase in value occurred in the weeks that followed the SEC\u2019s approval of comparable Bitcoin WTFs in January.\n\nEthereum surged past $6,600 on speculation of SEC approval for ETFs, with a 22% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 4.5% rise. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped to $3,694. Its previous record was $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nIn research released on Tuesday, Chhugani and Sapra stated, \u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH.\u201d Two prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analysts created a stir on Monday when they increased the likelihood that an ETH ETF will be approved from 25% to 75%.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, said they revised their forecast for the ETF in response to rumors that the SEC was talking to exchanges more frequently. As previous, analysts have expressed it appears that the US\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is at a standstill.\n\nPotential SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs could take two steps: first, the ETF would need to be approved in theory, but the products wouldn\u2019t actually be sold in the market until after that. Observers of the market have interpreted this distinction favorably.\n\nConfusion has spread throughout the market as a result of the uncertainties surrounding ETF clearance, especially on prediction sites like Polymarket where users have staked $8 million on the result. Existing bets may become more complex if a two-step approval process is implemented.\n\nDuring these changes, Bitcoin has increased by 4.5% and passed over $70,000 in the last day, while Ethereum has gained 22% to $3,790. With ramifications for other applicants as well, the market is eager to see the SEC\u2019s ruling on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal."

        "content": "Ethereum's price nears all-time high as ETF decision fuels market optimism.\n\nShare this article\n\nTomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement \u201cis happening,\u201d despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.\n\nJames Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s case was different. \u201cIn that instance, though, everything came together \u2013 ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly \u2013 and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,\u201d he shares.\n\nAlthough Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC\u2019s movement after the funds\u2019 approval. \u201cIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.\u201d\n\nRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. \u201cIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins\u2019 growth,\u201d added Lienkha.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was \u201ca sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.\u201d As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute \u2013 implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.\n\nMarko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH \u201cwell beyond its previous all-time high.\u201d Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.\n\nWhat if\u2026?\n\nDespite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn\u2019t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.\n\nNevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange\u2019s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.\n\n\u201cWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,\u201d Jurina added.\n\nMoreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. \u201cEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.\u201d\n\nEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a \u2018layered\u2019 scenario, which could end in a \u201chard rejection\u201d or a \u201csoft rejection.\u201d A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.\n\n\u201cThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,\u201d Bitfinex analysts concluded."
