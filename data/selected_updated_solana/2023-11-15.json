        "title": "Is ETH About to Crash Below $2K? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nBuyers in the Ethereum market have recently driven the price into a strong uptrend, reaching a critical resistance level at $2K. However, encountering a significant hurdle around this crucial mark, there exists the potential for a temporary consolidation correction phase in the coming days.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart reveals substantial support around the crucial region, comprising the static support at $1,500 and the lower boundary of the wedge pattern. This support fueled a significant surge, indicating strong buying momentum, with buyers targeting the critical $2K resistance zone.\n\nDespite reaching this key level, aligned with the wedge\u2019s upper boundary, Ethereum faced rejection, leading to a slight retracement towards the broken 200-day moving average at $1,783.\n\nConsidering the significance of the resistance at $2K and the associated wedge pattern\u2019s upper boundary, a temporary continuation of the ongoing retracement followed by consolidation around the broken moving averages is highly likely. If the price completes a pullback to the broken moving averages, buyers may re-enter the market, aiming once again for the substantial $2K level.\n\n\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the intensified buying pressure around the $1,5K support region propelled Ethereum toward the substantial $2K resistance. This upward movement demonstrated significant bullish momentum, reflecting the buyers\u2019 dominance in the market.\n\nHowever, the $2K region represents a crucial psychological resistance, posing challenges for buyers to push the price higher. Notably, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggested insufficient buying pressure, leading to a reversal and slight corrections.\n\nAdditionally, a recognizable double-top pattern around this pivotal resistance confirmed the presence of sellers in the short term.\n\nGiven the existing market dynamics, there is a high likelihood of an extended consolidation correction phase in the short term. This implies that the market might continue its retracement before definitively determining its next course of action. In this scenario, the support range between the 0.5 and 61.8 levels of the Fibonacci retracement ($1,839 \u2013 $1,769) is expected to be the next level of interest for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nThe futures market has been a significant influencer of Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics, making it imperative for the current uptrend to sustain favorable conditions in this market.\n\nIllustrated in the chart is the 30-day moving average of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell ratio, a crucial metric for gauging sentiment in the futures market. During a period of substantial price increase in Ethereum, the taker buy-sell ratio exhibited a robust uptrend, signaling strong buying interest. However, a recent reversal in the metric\u2019s trend has led to a downtrend, dipping below the threshold of 1. This reversal indicates that sellers are now executing more aggressive orders in the aggregate, potentially to realize profits or to take short positions.\n\nSignificantly, this shift in the metric aligns with the recent market rejection and its struggle to move higher. The confluence of these events suggests a potential for a short-term retracement in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nShould the taker buy-sell ratio resume an upward trajectory, surpassing the 1 threshold, it would indicate a revival of bullish sentiment in the short term, potentially supporting the continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a failure of the metric to exhibit upward movement would raise concerns about the sustainability of any bullish momentum."

        "content": "Chainwire Nocturne Launches on Mainnet to Bring Private Accounts to Ethereum Chainwire \u00b7 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more \u203a\n\nNEW YORK, United States, November 15th, 2023, Chainwire \u2013 Nocturne, a protocol enabling on-chain private accounts, today announced the successful deployment of Nocturne v1 to Ethereum mainnet. This marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more private and accessible Ethereum. For the first time, users will have a compatible and easy-to-use product resembling a private onchain account.\n\nNocturne v1 is a step towards compatible onchain privacy that functions simply as another account rather than a distinct tool or ecosystem. Users will find transacting with Nocturne similar to using a smart contract wallet, with the added benefit of privacy. Nocturne v1 is currently out-of-the-box compatible with any DeFi protocol that represents state via output tokens (e.g. Uniswap swap tokens, Aave aTokens, Compound cTokens, etc). There are plans to later extend this compatibility to arbitrary protocols.\n\n\u201cWith Nocturne v1\u2019s launch, we\u2019re moving away from the notion of a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019 Privacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201d said Luke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world. This is more than a product; it\u2019s a commitment to making Etherereum more accessible and enabling secure and private money over the internet.\u201d\n\nNocturne is built on the belief that privacy on public blockchains will only become mainstream if it\u2019s seamlessly integrated with the existing user experience. Nocturne\u2019s objective is straightforward: to create private user accounts on L1/L2 that are fully compatible with existing Ethereum accounts. To read more about private accounts, please see Nocturne\u2019s recent blog post.\n\nPrivacy: The Keystone for Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThough DeFi and other onchain activities have surged in popularity, privacy concerns have prevented broader acceptance and use of crypto as money. Recognizing that the typical user may be uneasy with the idea of their financial dealings being public, and that institutions demand confidentiality for their transactions, Nocturne addresses these critical barriers head-on. Privacy isn\u2019t just a feature\u2014it\u2019s foundational to the broader adoption of crypto.\n\nNocturne\u2019s Future Vision\n\nAs they continue building new versions, Nocturne\u2019s long-term vision is to make the experience so seamless that by default, every Ethereum user automatically has a private account which mirrors their public account. In short, a seamless parallel account layer for privacy.\n\nNocturne\u2019s plans for achieving its longer-term vision include:\n\nTransition to a more permissionless protocol by migrating to proof of innocence, as described by Vitalik and Ameen Solemani in the Practical Privacy & Compliance paper.\n\nBring Nocturne accounts closer to usable as general wallets by extending Nocturne\u2019s protocol compatibility to arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nImprove the compatibility of Nocturne accounts with EOAs and smart accounts through a scheme that allows for public wallet authorization to be leveraged within Nocturne for security.\n\nHow To Access\n\nNocturne v1 is live and can be accessed through a dedicated private vault UI, allowing users to discreetly manage their assets. The current UI capabilities include deposits, transfers to new burner addresses, and private swaps and staking. To get started, visit app.nocturne.xyz.\n\nAbout Nocturne Labs\n\nNocturne Labs is a forward-thinking blockchain technology company committed to addressing the most critical privacy and user experience challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. With a pioneering protocol for private accounts, Nocturne enables users to transact safely with built-in privacy. This marks a substantial stride in advancing the usability of public blockchains. Backed by notable investors such as Bain Capital Crypto, Polychain Capital, Bankless, and Vitalik, Nocturne is led by a team of experienced developers dedicated to enabling a more secure and accessible Ethereum.
