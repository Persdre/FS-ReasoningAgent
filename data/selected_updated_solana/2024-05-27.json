        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Future Outlook - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The analysis of the price of Ethereum (ETH) is a recent and central topic in the world of cryptocurrencies, with experts actively discussing the future market dynamics.\n\nRecent developments have captured the attention of investors: the possibility that the price of Ethereum reaches 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs and the future implications of the approvals of spot Ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum: short-term price outlook and the analysis of the impact of the ETF\n\nArthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, has suggested that the price of Ethereum could reach 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs. This prediction is based on a combination of technical and fundamental factors. In particular, Cheong highlights the growing adoption of Ethereum in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, which are driving the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous improvement of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, such as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d upgrade, promises to solve scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. These developments could further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nL\u2019approvazione degli ETF spot Ether da parte della SEC statunitense rappresenta una svolta significativa per il mercato delle criptovalute. Secondo esperti come Bill Hughes di Consensys, questa mossa \u00e8 un\u2019ammissione implicita che Ethereum \u00e8 considerato un bene commodity.\n\nThe adoption of ETF on Ethereum could make the cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors, increasing liquidity and stabilizing prices.\n\nEric Balchunas, analista di Bloomberg, prevede che il lancio degli ETF su Ethereum seguir\u00e0 uno schema simile a quello degli ETF su Bitcoin, con una competizione intensa tra gli emittenti. Tuttavia, Balchunas nota che gli ETF su Ethereum potrebbero generare un volume inferiore rispetto a quelli su Bitcoin, stimando una raccolta totale di circa 1-2 miliardi di dollari nelle prime settimane.\n\nMatthew Sigel di VanEck, uno degli emittenti di ETF, highlights the importance of presenting Ethereum as an asset with intrinsic value, especially to tech and equity investors.\n\nSigel believes that many of these investors are not yet aware of the potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nGlobal competition and regulatory outlook\n\nYat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, observes that the approval of ETFs on Ethereum in the United States could stimulate other jurisdictions to follow suit.\n\nCountries like the Regno Unito, Singapore, Giappone, and Emirati Arabi Uniti might be incentivized to introduce their own crypto-based ETFs to avoid falling behind in the global competition.\n\nSiu emphasizes that this competition could lead to interesting developments and a change in sentiment in the United States towards greater acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTuttavia, la trasparenza delle normative rimane una preoccupazione, come evidenziato da Hughes, che critica la SEC per la mancanza di chiarezza sulle implicazioni delle sue decisioni.\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price and its future prospects are influenced by a series of interconnected factors. The forecast of a short-term price increase up to 4,500 dollars reflects the optimism about the growing adoption and technological improvements of Ethereum.\n\nAt the same time, the approval of Ethereum ETFs could represent a breakthrough for traditional investors\u2019 accessibility to the cryptocurrency market, further stabilizing the price.\n\nThe global competition for the introduction of cryptocurrency ETFs and regulatory developments will continue to play a crucial role in determining the future of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and market observers will need to closely monitor these developments to adapt their investment strategies in a rapidly changing environment."

        "title": "How Green Is Ethereum? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum's update in September 2022 was called the Merge. Developers integrated the long-anticipated transition to proof-of-stake in this update (among other issues) significantly reducing the blockchain's energy requirement. The new Ethereum chain, which was called Ethereum 2.0 until the Ethereum Foundation requested that it not be, reduced energy use and promised faster transactions and lower gas fees. Read on to discover how green Ethereum is and learn about its plans that may be even more environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum blockchain upgrade was called the Merge.\n\nThe upgrade enhanced the network and reduced energy consumption.\n\nIts proof-of-stake validation mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work mechanisms.\n\nGas fees fell after the Merge (not because of it), but they aren't as low as from 2017 to 2020.\n\nThe Merge set the stage for further scalability enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nEthereum and Energy Use\n\nEthereum is a software platform that is open to anyone. It is commonly associated with ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency that is bought and sold by investors. Ethereum can be used by anyone for different reasons, including banking and finance, network and application building, and peer-to-peer financial networking without the need for middlemen.\n\nEthereum was created in 2013 and launched two years later by Vitalik Buterin. It is among the most well-known names in the cryptocurrency markets, coming in as the second-largest by market capitalization after Bitcoin. As of May 27, 2024, Ethereum's market cap was $466.67 billion. But, Ethereum mining is no longer possible after the move from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-stake reduced the blockchain's energy use by more than 99%.\n\nPoS differs from PoW in that it is not a network-wide competitive process of encrypting information through a hashing algorithm. PoS still uses a hashing algorithm and verifies transactions through a consensus layer, but the validators are randomly chosen by the network based on the amount of ether they have staked. Staking means offering ether as collateral to become a network validator so the participant can earn ether rewards.\n\nSelecting one semi-trusted validator to hash the information in a block and verify it uses far less energy than a competition. So, Ethereum is much more green in terms of energy consumption than it used to be.\n\nWere Ethereum Gas Fees Reduced?\n\nTransaction fees rose on the Ethereum network in 2020 because of increased network activity. At the time, the transactions of originators who offered the most in fees were placed in front of those who paid less. This created a fee war of sorts, with users trying to get their transactions validated quicker and miners charging more for prime validation spots.\n\nAn earlier attempt to fix rising costs tried to remove the transaction auction mentality from the network by imposing a base fee and a priority fee. The priority fee is similar to a tip to validators for them to choose to process one transaction instead of another. This was ineffective at lowering transaction fees because users still increased their tips to get transactions approved faster.\n\nEthereum is on its way to becoming a greener blockchain and network. Future upgrades are expected to make it more efficient, scalable, and less costly.\n\n\n\nEthereum Transaction Speeds\n\nThe Merge, which was an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain to a different version set the stage for future upgrades. Many people called the upgrade Ethereum 2.0, It was the most significant update to the system. Although it didn't improve transaction speeds at the time or even a few years later, future upgrades will introduce improvements in network speed and scalability.\n\nIs Ethereum Green?\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the blockchain and network consume 0.0026 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr). This translates to the equivalent of 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Compare this to Bitcoin's 149 TWh/yr and global data centers' 190 TWh/yr. Ethereum also consumes less energy than video gaming in the U.S. (34 TWh/yr) and less than Google (19 TWh/yr).\n\nThe University of Cambridge's Judge Business School researched the energy sources for the Ethereum network after the Merge. According to its findings, 48% of Ethereum's energy comes from sustainable sources like wind power, nuclear power, and other renewables. The remaining 52% is powered by natural gas (30%), coal (19%), and oil (3%).\n\nAccording to similar reports, Ethereum is greener than it was before switching to PoS. However, there are many more upgrades planned that have the potential to make it even more efficient and eco-friendly.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight new spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May 2024. Trading will take place on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX. There is no initial trading date as of yet, as the SEC is still working on final approvals. The move follows the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January 2024\u2014three years after Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched.\n\nThe Green Future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum has plans for upgrades to bring a new concept to the blockchain, which is expected to allow it to scale and increase transaction processing speeds. In March 2024, the Dencun Upgrade was released.\n\nThis upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, a process where second-layer rollup providers can send Binary Objects (also known as blobs) to the Ethereum main chain. Blobs are much cheaper to send than rollups, so transaction fees are expected to drop when full danksharding is released.\n\nThe full upgrade to danksharding is expected to allow Ethereum to scale up to more than 100,000 transactions per second and be cheaper, both of which will contribute to its greenness.\n\nFuture upgrades will address issues regarding:\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nDecentralization\n\nProtocol risks from Maximal Extractable Value\n\nBlock verification\n\nComputational costs\n\nMaximal Extractable Value is the maximum amount of value a validator or miner can get from a block in excess of the block reward and usual fees.\n\nThe lesser the blockchain costs, the more decentralized it becomes and the more efficient it will be. However, there are concerns whether decentralized applications built on Ethereum will consume more energy. Ethereum has positioned itself as the platform of choice for Web3 development.\n\nWeb3 is a concept of restructuring the backend of the internet, where control of people's information, data, and digital creations are returned to them. Many steps must be taken and hurdles overcome before blockchain technology can be used to create the new internet infrastructure conceived by developers.\n\nIf Ethereum is the platform used to create applications for this emerging and in-development restructuring, its eco-friendlier network might not be as environmentally friendly. However, it could be even more so\u2014there is no way to tell.\n\n\n\nDoes Ethereum Use Energy? Yes, Ethereum uses energy. It is a blockchain, a distributed ledger secured by cryptography, which requires energy to run and use.\n\nIs Ethereum Environmentally Friendly? Ethereum's carbon footprint is much less than it was before September 2022 but it still uses energy. Nearly half of its network is located in developed areas that use sustainable energy sources. About 30% of the remaining half is powered by natural gas, 10% by coal, and 3% by oil.\n\nHow Much Energy Did Ethereum Use Before the Merge? According to data from the University of Cambridge's Sustainability Index, Ethereum used about 21.41 THh of electricity per year and released 10.26 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor Ethereum, the evolution to a better-performing, more accessible network has begun. Continued updates promise to cut back on emissions and make the network more energy-efficient while improving speeds and cutting transaction costs. However, Ethereum has much ground to cover to get to the levels of efficiency it wants, both in speed and environmental friendliness."
