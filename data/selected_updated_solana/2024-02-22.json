        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2s About To Take Off, Says Coin Bureau\u2019s Guy Turner \u2013 Here Are His Top Picks - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 projects.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Turner tells the 2.41 million channel subscribers that ETH\u2019s Dencun update may cause layer-2 projects to go on massive rallies and he names his top four picks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, which is expected to roll out in March, aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and data availability on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nSays Turner,\n\n\u201cAs the Dencun upgrade draws near, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s are about to take off.\u201d\n\nFirst up, the trader says that Arbitrum (ARB) could maintain its upward momentum.\n\n\u201cARB recently hit an all-time high of $2.40 on the 12th of January, and hasn\u2019t really shown many signs of slowing down either in large part due to the anticipated effects of Dencun. This is because Dencun\u2019s impact on layer-2 transaction speeds and costs will likely see more and more people adopting Arbitrum as an even cheaper way of interacting with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is trading for $1.83 at time of writing, down 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says Optimism (OP) has a lot of upward potential due to its aim to build a \u201csuperchain\u201d ecosystem that promotes collaboration across multiple layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\n\u201cOne of the first entrants to the \u2018superchain\u2019 ecosystem was none other than Coinbase\u2019s very own layer-2 solution, Base\u2026\n\nThis superchain could quickly become a reality after Dencun.\u201d\n\nOptimism is trading for $3.68 at time of writing, down more than 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAnother scaling solution on the trader\u2019s radar is Immutable X (IMX), which he believes could become more popular in the GameFi industry.\n\n\u201cImmutable could see a rapid acceleration in blockchain gaming development as network efficiency is supercharged. With Immutable being positioned as a big player in the GameFi narrative, many more gaming developers will be turning their attention to the best environment to launch their products in, and Immutable will be a top contender in that regard.\u201d\n\nImmutable is trading for $3.33 at time of writing, down more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Polygon (MATIC) could rise in value due to its own planned network upgrade called Polygon 2.0.\n\n\u201cMATIC hit an all-time high of $2.92 on the 27th of December 2021. At the time of shooting, it\u2019s still at 66% down from this price point. However, this could all change with 2.0.\u201d\n\nMATIC is trading for $0.93, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency universe witnessed quite the bustle today, February 22, following a slump in crypto prices, per data by CoinMarketCap. As the global market cap took a hit, plunging 1.62% to the $1.95 trillion mark, a bearish sentiment appears to be prevailing within the broader crypto market. Prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana collectively witnessed a price slump today. This appears to come due to the massive crypto market liquidation witnessed yesterday, per CoinGape Media\u2019s report. However, sentiment for bolstered prices looms over the crypto horizon even though Fed\u2019s stance on unchanged rates prevails. The crypto market appears to have witnessed the prior mentioned liquidation aligning with this.\n\nMajor Crypto Prices Today\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bitcoin price continued its downward movement post-liquidation today, falling 1.28% in the past 24 hours. The current BTC price rests at $51,411, with a market cap of $1.009 trillion. Meanwhile, the token also witnessed a substantial drop in its 24-hour trading volume, falling 9.45% and reaching $29.25 billion.

        "title": "Is Ethereum Fulfilling Its Potential as an Incredible Disruptor? 3 Reasons I'm Bearish - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This innovative crypto gets a lot of attention, but investors need to ask pressing questions.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.92%) was born from the perceived limitations to adding functionality to Bitcoin. Launched in July 2015, Ethereum has skyrocketed nearly 93,000% in value since its public release, even though it remains more than 40% off its peak price.\n\nIs the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a current market cap of about $350 billion, fulfilling its potential as an incredible disruptor? I'm not so sure. Here are three reasons I'm bearish on Ethereum.\n\nHuge promise\n\nLet's first try to understand why there's so much hype surrounding Ethereum and its long-term potential. Thanks to the blockchain network having functionality for smart contracts, many bulls believe that Ethereum can disrupt numerous industries, particularly those that depend on expensive intermediaries, by giving power and value back to the users.\n\nIn other words, smart contracts can automate a lot of functions that are slow and cumbersome, and that might not add much value. The end result, as many hope, is a better and cheaper user experience.\n\nViewed in this light, it might be encouraging to see Ethereum's complex roadmap. With scalability, security, and sustainably as the top priorities, the network's developer community has laid out different sets of upgrades to accomplish certain milestones. The latest event, known as The Merge, changed Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, significantly reducing its energy usage.\n\nViewed as the world's decentralized computer, Ethereum's ultimate goal is to change the entire structure of the economy, mainly as it relates to how individuals can have greater control in an internet-enabled world.\n\nReasons to be skeptical\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Ethereum's promise. There are more than 250 million unique wallet addresses. It has the most total value locked by far of any other crypto, which measures the amount of assets locked in a specific DeFi protocol. And sure, there are thousands of decentralized applications.\n\nBut I view things with a critical perspective. I think Ethereum is still primarily used as a tool for financial speculation, not actual utility. Even if spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds get approved, it proves that investors only want price exposure, instead of using Ethereum tokens in some dApp setting.\n\nAnd are dApps really better than services provided by well-known businesses? Marketplace and platform-like businesses, such as Meta Platforms, PayPal, Uber, and Airbnb, have billions of users combined who find value in what they have to offer. They work just fine as is.\n\nAnother reason I'm bearish is that I view Ethereum as another venture start-up, which defeats the entire purpose of crypto aiming to be decentralized and give power to the people. There are still a few head developers, most notably Vitalik Buterin, who have outsized influence on the direction of the network. And these founders stand to gain the most financially should things work out as planned.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said that Bitcoin is the only crypto that's a commodity, and that others are essentially securities. This supports the argument that Ethereum is just another profit-seeking enterprise.\n\nAnd the last bear case rests on the belief that Ethereum is a solution looking for a problem. In fact, this is probably true for nearly all cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nAll of the focus and discussion centered on the complex technicalities of the underlying network sound exciting. However, one really has to question if more and more people will engage further with Ethereum and use its dApps in the future. I'm not confident in this outcome.\n\nIt might make some bullish Ethereum supporters uncomfortable to challenge their beliefs about the cryptocurrency. But I think healthy criticality is necessary to set realistic expectations about its future."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Reach $4,000 In March On 4 Factors Including Spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January turned the spotlight on Ethereum price, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Investors believe Ethereum has a high probability of receiving a spot ETF, especially with several proposals already with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDespite the growing optimism, ETH clawed back some of the gains it accrued earlier this week, falling from slightly above $3,000 to $2,900. The pullback came upon increased volatility in the market, with Bitcoin (BTC) rejecting $53,000 for a sweep at $50,500.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBesides Ethereum, other altcoins such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also pulled back to gather more liquidity. This could account for the modest price gains in the market on Thursday.\n\nEthereum price is one of the most uniquely placed projects, considering its standing as the second-largest crypto, the largest smart contracts platform, and its upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nThis article looks at these factors and more to determine the role they are likely to play in ETH\u2019s recovery journey in the short term.\n\n1. The Dencun Upgrade Scheduled For March\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comprised of two separate upgrades \u201cDeneb\u201d and \u201cCancun,\u201d is a major improvement for the Ethereum network that will increase its scalability and efficiency when implemented.\n\nIt will introduce proto-danksharding, a feature that will reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, which are faster and cheaper than the main chain. The upgrade has been tested on three testnets: Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.\n\nWith the final launch expected in March 2024, Ethereum price is already showing signs of an incoming rally. The token surged to highs slightly above $3,000 this week, backing positive sentiment.\n\n2. The Spot ETF\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been referred to as a major development for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to validating Bitcoin as a global mature asset, ETFs allow traditional investors who are not interested in the complexities of crypto to get exposure to BTC.\n\nMoreover, the move opened the door to fresh speculation regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Two years after the approval of Bitcoin futures ETF, Ethereum got its futures ETF. Experts say that the wait could be much short-term for the spot ETF.\n\nLike Bitcoin the hype surrounding the ETF could be a major catalyst for Ethereum price in the coming months.\n\nRecommended: Ethereum Price Rally Gains Momentum for $4000, Here Why?\n\n3. Staking\n\nValidators in the Ethereum ecosystem are required to stake at least 32 ETH. This condition significantly reduces the circulating supply. Ether becoming a PoS network through the Merge in 2022 allowed investors to freely stake and withdraw liquidity.\n\nContrary to expectations, the transition to PoS made staking even more attractive to investors, who have so far locked in $46.65 billion worth of ETH in smart contracts, according to Defi Llama.\n\nUnlike 2022 and 2023 when Ethereum experienced a persistent drop in staked assets, 2024 is looking positive, implying that investors have a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAn increase in staking translates to reduced sell-side pressure. Holders stake tokens they do not intend to sell in the near future, expecting the price will rise with time.\n\n4. Ethereum Price Dons Bullish Technical Structure\n\nDespite the correction from $3,000, Ethereum still holds above key indicators like the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Besides, support at $2,900 stopped the decline on Wednesday, realigning ETH with the upward trajectory.\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that dips are profitable. So until support at $2,800 flips, traders may want to consider buying ETH and in the process contributing to the momentum targeting $4,000 in March or before Bitcoin halving. The Ichimoku Cloud also affirms Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade: Which Layer-2 Platforms Will Benefit the Most? - CoinGape",
        "content": "As investors keep a close watch on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, attention is currently directed towards the imminent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Scheduled for March 13, this upcoming enhancement is anticipated to wield significant influence, potentially bolstering various players within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring the potential ripple effects, let\u2019s delve into how the Ethereum Dencun upgrade stands to benefit other Layer-2 platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum Dencum Upgrade\n\nGet ready for the \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade, set to roll out on March 13, marking a significant hard fork update aimed at boosting the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and user-friendliness. As part of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap initiative, dubbed \u2018The Surge,\u2019 this upgrade is a pivotal step forward in scalability enhancements.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can expect from the Dencun upgrade:\n\nEIP-4844: Boost scalability.\n\nEIP-1153: Cutting down on-chain data storage expenses.\n\nEIP-4788: Elevating security and functionality.\n\nEIP-5656: Fine-tuning EVM performance\n\nEIP-6780: Improving network security.\n\nThe standout feature in Dencun is the implementation of Proto-Danksharding. With EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), a new transaction type called \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 is introduced, reducing transaction costs for both L2 users and ramping up Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher explains that the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will reduce transaction fees on Layer-2 platforms by a considerable magnitude. The analyst also emphasizes the increased commercial viability for dApp developers and users. This shift will position L2s as more appealing options compared to alternative L1s, offering a positive catalyst across various sectors such as DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and on-chain trading.\n\nLayer-2 Platforms That Benefit From Dencun Upgrade\n\nAlthough several Layer-2 platforms will benefit from the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, Miles Deutscher shares his coveted list of those platforms that he thinks will benefit the most.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Deutscher noted that $MATIC currently finds itself in a compelling position. It\u2019s on the verge of rebranding to POL. Despite lagging behind other L2s, there\u2019s been notable investment in implementing zk technology. Considering these factors, Deutscher believes $MATIC could emerge as a strong performer in the weeks or months ahead. Arbitrum: Arbitrum\u2019s metrics remain impressive, solidifying its position as a preferred chain for launching new dApps. Maintaining its status as the top L2 in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Arbitrum also boasts transaction volume that outpaces other L2 solutions. Optimism: Optimism ranks as the second-largest L2 by Total Value Locked (TVL), closely following Arbitrum, and it has demonstrated robustness in transaction processing. Recently, the platform unveiled its fourth airdrop, which is expected to reignite interest and activity within the ecosystem. COTI Network: COTI has unveiled V2, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution focused on privacy, featuring the introduction of \u2018Garbled Circuits.\u2019 This innovative technology offers an efficient method for maintaining privacy, marking the blockchain\u2019s maiden implementation of such a feature. Mantle: Mantle is currently among the rapidly expanding Layer 2 solutions. With over $1.5 billion worth of ETH staked as mETH (Mantle Staked ETH), it ranks as the third-largest LSD (Layer 2 Staked Deposit) after Lido and RocketPool. Moreover, mETH stakers can anticipate some promising airdrops in the near future. Metis: Metis is experiencing a wave of favorable developments that are propelling its growth forward. Notable among these is the establishment of the 4.6 million $METIS Ecosystem Fund, signaling a significant injection of $400 million into the ecosystem. Additionally, the upcoming launch of the decentralized sequencer alpha mainnet in March promises to further enhance the platform\u2019s capabilities and usability. Moreover, the implementation of the LSB (Liquid Staking Blitz) campaign is poised to bolster participation and engagement within the Metis community.\n\nMiles Duestscher stated that he\u2019s keeping a close watch on other Layer-2 Networks such as Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.
