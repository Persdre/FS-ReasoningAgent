        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now soliciting feedback from the public on BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF proposal, according to a recent filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act,\" the regulatory agency said in the filing .\n\nThose who want to weigh in on the matter can provide electronic comments via the SEC's internet comment form or via an email. The agency is also accepting paper comments.\n\nThe public will be allowed to leave comments during a 21-day period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC also called for comments on spot Ether ETF applications from Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise. Back then, ETF analyst James Seyffart opined that \"nothing\" in the filing signaled that anything had changed for Ethereum ETFs. He noted that silence from the regulator \"wasn't a good thing\" for approval odds.\n\nFor now, the consensus appears to be that the SEC is not going to approve a slew of spot Ethereum ETF applications in May despite approving a slew of applications earlier this year. The regulator has refrained from engaging with ETF issuers on this matter.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , the SEC recently postponed its decision on the spot Ethereum ETF proposal submitted by prominent investment firm Franklin Templeton.\n\nAt the same time, British banking giant Standard Chartered is convinced that the Ethereum price could reach the pie-in-the-sky price target of $8,000 by the end of the year despite predicting that Ether ETF will not be launched in May."

        "title": "Ethereum continues hinting at rally following reduced long liquidations - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum's price often takes a downward shift after FTX and Alameda sells ETH.\n\nTraders expect a price rise in ETH following reduced long liquidations and normalizing risk reversals.\n\nEthereum needs increased trading volume to break past key resistance levels.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has continued showing signs of a potential rally on Tuesday as most coins in the crypto market are also posting gains. This comes amid speculation of a potential decline following FTX ETH sales and normalizing ETH risk reversals.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows signs of a potential rally as suspected Justin Sun wallet buys heavily\n\nDaily digest market movers: FTX sale, normalized risk reversals, active wallet increase\n\nEthereum's latest price movement is hinting at a potential rally. Here are key market movers driving the second-largest cryptocurrency:\n\nSince March 1, FTX and Alameda Research have deposited 20,350 ETH at strategic points right before a price dip, according to Spot On Chain. This insight comes as FTX and Alameda deposited 4,500 ETH worth $14.4 million to Binance and Coinbase at $3,207 on Tuesday. Investors may need to observe if ETH will take a downturn as in previous times. Other investors may be using FTX's move as a sell signal, hence the consistent price drop after the firm's ETH sales.\n\n\n\nWith ETH's recent price recovery, long traders are looking to gain control as long liquidations have slowed down significantly on Tuesday compared to the past two weeks, according to data from Coinglass. Short liquidations are increasing, with over $13.45 million liquidated, while long liquidations sit at $7.4 million in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nETH risk reversals have also normalized above -4%, from -12% one week ago, indicating traders are beginning to expect a price improvement, according to QCP Capital. As a result, \"improving speculative sentiment could see short covering and a resumption of leveraged longs,\" said QCP.\n\nRead more: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nMeanwhile, Bankless podcast co-host Ryan Sean Adams pointed out the increasing number of active wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem, which has grown to over 10 million weekly active wallets. He speculated that the Ethereum ecosystem can now increase user growth by 10x to 100 million in this bull run.\n\n\n\nThe US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has also delayed its response to Franklin Ethereum ETFs, a series of the Franklin Ethereum Trust. The latest spot Ethereum ETF decision delay follows a series of timeline delays the regulator has given to other applicants.\n\nTechnical analysis: Ethereum needs increased volume to break past key resistance\n\nEthereum's recent price movement is teasing that a potential rally is on the horizon as it's attempting to break the upper side of the $2,852 and $3,300 key range. But it must first move past the $3,279 resistance to confirm.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nHowever, declining trading volume amid the price increase is a concern. While bulls appear to have taken the wheels again, the reduced trading volume indicates low commitment and uncertainty. ETH could quickly push forward to break past the $3,300 key level if increased volume accompanies the rising bullish sentiment.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nSuch a move will see ETH filling the liquidity void of April 13 and aiming for the next resistance of $3,406 formed on April 7. This resistance may prove easy to break past if trading volume increases. However, if volume fails to increase, ETH may fall back to the $3,056 support of March 20.\n\nAdditionally, with the halving behind us, Bitcoin's dominance over ETH may reduce in the long term, leaving room for the largest altcoin to craft its own path.\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,232, up 1.3% on the day at the time of writing."

        "title": "3 Reasons Why I Sold Ethereum and Never Looked Back - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The coin's potential has been very slow to materialize.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided to offload the vast majority of my Ethereum (ETH -1.13%) tokens after holding and accumulating them over the last few years. I don't expect to buy more anytime soon, even if the price drops to attractive levels.\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. The coin's price surpassed the target level in my investing plan\n\nThe biggest reason I decided to sell nearly all of my Ethereum was that its price was above the level that I had identified as my sell point.\n\nI first started to accumulate Ethereum in mid-2020. Per my initial investing plan, I did not set a price target for a sale at the time, opting instead to reassess the issue after roughly three years had elapsed. I continued to dollar-cost average (DCA) and build up my position through roughly the middle of 2023, after which I set a firmer target and stopped buying more.\n\nI resolved to think strongly about selling after the price hit somewhere above $3,000 per token, a level the coin had surpassed in at least three of the periods I'd held it, as shown in this chart:\n\nWhen the coin broke through that price level this year, it was only a matter of time. It's entirely possible that my sale will mean that I'll be missing out on the coin's future growth. But because of the next reason we'll discuss, I won't be losing any sleep over it.\n\n2. Transaction fees were too high, and not improving by enough over time\n\nTransaction fees, known as gas fees, are perennially high on the Ethereum chain. To transact, you'll need to cough up anywhere from $5 to $80 or more, depending on the day. And despite many repeated promises from the chain's developers regarding a permanent decline of gas fees, they have remained stubbornly and painfully high for years on end.\n\nI don't day trade in and out of my cryptocurrencies, so it might seem as though it's hyperbole to complain about the infrequent transaction costs associated with building up a position. But remember, my strategy was to dollar-cost average. Making a series of purchases entailed paying gas fees on the order of $600 in total -- way too much given the relatively small size of my position and my investments.\n\nWhat's more, the thing I kept noticing again and again over the years of my holding was that the high fees were discouraging my friends from buying Ethereum as an investment or trying to use it to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Noticeable commission costs are practically extinct for most retail investors trading stocks, so the expectation that people often have is that the same will be true in cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter a while, I stopped touting the coin as an investment because I wanted to avoid the subsequent conversations about how high the gas fees were. Ultimately I recognized that behavior in myself, and it was an unambiguous sign that it was time to sell.\n\n3. It's in the uncanny valley of cryptocurrencies\n\nThe final reason that I sold Ethereum is that it is presently in a bit of an uncanny valley.\n\nIf you're not familiar, the uncanny valley is a phenomenon in which a person's reaction to a humanoid robot is warm when the robot does not appear to be very human at all, warm when the robot appears to be fully human, but ice-cold or otherwise negative when the robot appears to be nearly human-like, but is overtly not an actual human.\n\nEthereum has a number of popular meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, a blockchain intended largely for fun or outright gambling rather than investing in serious projects and fostering frontier financial technologies. At the same time, it has a handful of rather esoteric cryptocurrency utility projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), much like you'd expect from a chain devoted to hardcore technology development, financial engineering, or methodical new experiments in corporate governance.\n\nYet its high transaction costs make meme coin investing exceptionally painful. Likewise, the same source of friction is a massive drag on for-profit projects, which tend to have a higher need to transact on demand, meaning that they can't wait for fees to decline.\n\nFor other purposes, like minting and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or creating smart contracts, there are plenty of solutions on the chain to choose from. But many of the marketplaces, exchanges, and tools on Ethereum have only rudimentary feature sets or sketchy credentials.\n\nOf course, the Ethereum blockchain itself can't fully control which projects use it or how well they work.\n\nBut for a chain's native token to be a good investment relative to other options, it helps if there's a critical mass of users within at least one (large) community that's loyal to where their projects are deployed. And for this chain, the various frictions are an impediment to that critical mass continuing to build, so I don't regret selling."
