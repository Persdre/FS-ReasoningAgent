        "title": "SEC considered Ethereum unregistered security for at least a year: FOX Business - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum's legal status is questioned amid SEC's intensifying scrutiny.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been operating under the belief that Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto, is an unregistered security. This perspective has been held for at least a year, FOX Business reported on Monday, citing recent court filings.\n\nThe filings emerged from a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys last week, which is challenging the SEC\u2019s attempt to classify Ethereum as a security. Consensys\u2019 legal action follows a Wells Notice from the SEC, which signaled the agency\u2019s intention to sue the firm for not complying with federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to FOX Business, the documents reveal that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, under the direction of Gurbir Grewal, initiated a formal investigation into Ethereum\u2019s status as a security in March 2023. This investigation, referred to as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation, aims to explore transactions and activities related to Ethereum dating back to at least 2018.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told FOX Business that the SEC sent multiple document requests and subpoenas to firms associated with Ethereum, including Consensys. MetaMask\u2019s parent company reportedly received four subpoenas from the SEC and a Wells Notice.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s current position appears to contradict previous guidance from 2018 when then-Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC Bill Hinman stated that Ethereum was not considered a security due to its decentralized nature. Comparatively, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission later classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nConsensys\u2019 legal action against the SEC aims for the court to resolve the dispute over Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, a case that could have wide-reaching implications for the crypto industry, akin to previous cases against major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and $59,005 as it establishes $65,600 as weekly resistance.\n\nEthereum price could confirm a falling wedge pattern with a 25% run above $3,406 at breakout point.\n\nRipple price defends $0.5000 but overhanging bearish activity will keep XRP holders\u2019 vision for $0.6000 a hopium pipe dream.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has recorded lower highs over the past seven days, with a similar outlook witnessed among altcoins. Meanwhile, while altcoins display a rather disturbing outlook amid a broader market bleed, there could be some relief soon as fundamentals show:\n\nA massive cool off in euphoria and sentiment\n\nA cool-off phase allows the market to correct itself, stabilize, and establish a more sustainable growth trajectory.\n\nA healthy outlook in funding rates\n\nHealthy funding rates indicate a well-functioning and balanced market ecosystem, promoting stability, reducing the risk of manipulation, and fostering confidence among market participants.\n\nOverleveraged short positions are waiting to get liquidated\n\nWhile the initial liquidation of overleveraged short positions may lead to short-term volatility, the eventual impact can often be positive for the price of an asset.\n\nRead More: Week Ahead: Bitcoin could surprise investors this week\n\nBitcoin price forms a $5,000 range\n\nAfter successive weekly closes below $65,600, and with the bulls defending against a dip below $60,000, Bitcoin price has established a $5,000 macro market range. The odds hint at a further decline given the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is subdued below the mean level of 50 and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator continues to post red histograms in negative territory.\n\nIf seller momentum increases and Bitcoin price dips into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and the intra-day low of March 5 at $59,005, the downtrend could continue with bulls waiting to buy BTC just above the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if history repeats, Bitcoin price could move in the opposite direction as the DXY Compare indicator. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, however, the bulls must haul BTC above $72,000 because plenty of bearish activity awaits BTC price near the $70,000 threshold.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: Will BTC ignore major macro market developments this week?\n\nEthereum price could rally 25%, pending confirmation\n\nEthereum price is trading with a bearish bias, but not for long as the price action since March 12 has consolidated into a descending wedge pattern. The execution of this bullish reversal technical formation will happen after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline on the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the heath of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to wind around the mean level of 50, while the AO indicator shows growing bullish sentiment displayed by the green histograms that draw toward positive territory.\n\nThe higher highs seen on the RSI chart since mid-April relative to the lower highs in ETH price also support the bullish thesis, suggesting a bullish divergence. If the RSI flips above the mean level, it would tilt the odds further in favor of a bullish breakout.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bears have their way and book profits for the nearly 10% gains made since Ethereum price bounced from the $2,900 support, the market would see a correction. A candlestick close below $2,900 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum fees drops to lowest level since October, ETH sustains above $3,200\n\nRipple price suffers the weight of overhanging bearish pressure\n\nRipple downside potential remains very much alive with bearish activity waiting to descend on XRP price once it lifts. This is seen with the multiple spikes on the volume profile (grey) in the one-day chart below. The RSI is also declining steadily, showing falling momentum.\n\nThis, coupled with the red histogram bars that remain in negative territory reinforce the bearish outlook. If the $0.5000 psychological support is lost, Ripple price could drop all the way to the $0.4500 threshold, or in a dire case, extend the fall to the bottom of the market range at $0.4188, nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP bulls show up, Ripple price could recover. For the bearish thesis to be invalidated, however, the price must record a candlestick close above $0.6500. This is because massive bearish activity awaits the payments token in the area surrounding $0.6000 as XRP bears wait to cash in.\n\nAlso Read: XRP slides to $0.50 as ETHgate controversy resurfaces, Ripple CTO debates impact on litigation"

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum : Will Solana Take Over Ethereum By End of 2024 ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Amid crypto market crash following Bitcoin halving, Solana and Ethereum show different levels of performance. Solana\u2019s annual increase of 480.53% contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s decrease of 66.68%. During the previous week, Solana had a drop of 12.05%, whereas Ethereum had a smaller decrease of 1.06%. This article will analyze their most recent market performance, evaluating their potential paths in the current crypto environment and examining if Solana is positioned to surpass Ethereum.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Current Price Market Performance\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the continuous battle between Solana and Ethereum, the market performance illustrates two powerful entities maneuvering through the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Solana\u2019s native token SOL is currently at $135.08, showing a 4.50% decrease in value in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, taking a broader perspective reveals a more detailed story, with SOL undergoing a 12.05% decrease in the week and a significant 27.45% drop in the month.\n\nEven with some temporary obstacles, the token has seen a remarkable increase of 480.53% in the last year, showing its ability to bounce back and remain popular among investors.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum, along with its famous token ETH, holds a higher value of $3,164.16. However, similar to its opposite, it is dealing with recent changes, showing a 3.84% drop during the day. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s overall trend indicates a more stable path, with only a 1.06% drop in the week and a 10.75% decrease in the month.\n\nSignificantly, ETH has shown a 66.68% decline in value in the last year, highlighting the difficulties encountered in the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nDigging further, Solana\u2019s market capitalization of $6.4 billion places it in the 5th position among cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. On the flip side, Ethereum boasts a market cap of $386.2 billion, establishing itself as the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEven though they have different market capitalizations, both platforms show strong trading activity, with Solana seeing $1.98 billion in 24-hour volume and Ethereum reporting $13.5 billion.\n\nAnalyzing price movements, Solana\u2019s recent changes had it moving between $133.96 and $143.78 in a day, whereas Ethereum traded within the range of $3,152.95 to $3,351.18. Both tokens reflect their highest values in the past, with Solana reaching $260.06 two years ago, showing a decline of 48.24%, and Ethereum peaking at $4,891.70, currently experiencing a decrease of 35.54%.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, operating as an open-source blockchain system with its own digital currency called Ether (ETH). Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum allows for the execution of Decentralized Smart Contracts. The project was funded through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to the official launch of the blockchain in 2015.\n\nEthereum aims to be the global hub for decentralized applications (Dapps), enabling programmers to create and run software without censorship or downtime. The concept of \u201csmart contracts\u201d was pioneered by Ethereum, with co-founder Gavin Wood envisioning it as \u201cone computer for the entire planet.\u201d Recent upgrades like the London Hard Fork and the Dencun Upgrade have brought scaling efficiencies and lower transaction costs to the platform.\n\nWhat Is Solana?\n\nThe Solana project, initiated in 2017 and formally launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation, is an open-source platform leveraging blockchain technology for cost-effective DeFi solutions with a focus on speed. Its protocol supports DApp development through smart contract deployment on its blockchain, aiming to enhance scalability with a mix of PoH and PoS consensus mechanisms.\n\nWith SOL crypto priced at $104.69 on March 2, 2022, and reaching an ATH of $260.06 on November 6, 2021, Solana\u2019s efficient model enables swift payment verification at low costs, providing a USP in the crypto industry. The innovative hybrid consensus ensures accessibility for all traders, aligning with the Foundation\u2019s goal of broadening decentralized finance access.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Key Features\n\nSolana\u2019s unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, combined with Proof-of-Stake validation, allows it to process significantly more transactions per second than Ethereum. The platform provides each node with its clock and decision-making ability. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm protects the system from disruptions, ensuring overall functionality. Solana supports multiple smart contracts running simultaneously, enhancing platform efficiency and versatility within its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum features smart contracts encoded into code for self-execution, enabling the creation of decentralized applications on its blockchain. Its native crypto is used for transactions and rewarding miners. With a Turing-complete virtual machine, Ethereum executes smart contracts for various applications and allows for the formation of DAOs, governed by code and consensus.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Latest News\n\nA potential spot Ethereum ETF could be on the horizon now that spot Bitcoin ETFs are no longer the focus, expected in May. Nevertheless, the schedule for this has not been determined yet, as the SEC has remained silent about the matter.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade was successfully launched on the mainnet on March 13, 2024, following its deployment on all the Ethereum testnets. This is a significant advancement in the Ethereum network and a crucial step towards Ethereum 2.0.\n\nOn the other hand Solana received the Crypto of the Year award for its SOL token from CoinMarketCap, recognizing its growth and resilience. This milestone showcases its success among other notable projects in the industry.\n\nFurthermore, Solana-focused devshop Anza has released an update to fix the intermittent congestion issues and expects a sound recovery in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nConclusion: Will Solana Overtake Ethereum?\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum are significant players in the world of cryptocurrency. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, continues to advance with upgrades like the Dencun Upgrade. Meanwhile, Solana has quickly gained recognition, even winning the Crypto of the Year award. The question remains whether Solana will surpass Ethereum by 2024. Solana\u2019s scalability and capabilities make it a strong competitor, but Ethereum\u2019s established environment and continuous updates suggest it will maintain its dominance. The competition between Solana and Ethereum is expected to continue as new technologies, market factors, and regulations evolve."
