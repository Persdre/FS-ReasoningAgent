        "content": "After a major run last year, Solana has struggled to sustain its previous momentum. According to market analyst, Matthew Hyland, SOL will probably underperform compared to Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. Based on indicators and market dynamics, Hyland predicts a challenging path for SOL to break new all-time highs against BTC, mirroring ETH\u2019s performance in the previous cycle.\n\nIMO SOL probably underperforms BTC and ETH going forward I could be wrong about this, but I think the idea of SOL breaking to new ATHs against BTC is similar to ETH last cycle, which it did not happen SOL had a major run; I was VERY VOCAL buying between $16-$25 last year so I don\u2019t hate it by any means and still think it has upside in USD but I don\u2019t think it is likely it will run away and outperform BTC and ETH going forward\n\nSolana's Battle Against Bitcoin and Ethereum: Expert Analysis 3\n\nDespite the challenges of outperforming the two leading crypto assets, Solana is known for its high speed and low transaction costs, attracting developers and projects. It has positioned itself as a potential \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d aiming to resolve scalability issues that plague the ETH chain. Having said that, Ethereum\u2019s transition to ETH 2.0, which promises scalability and energy efficiency, could overshadow SOL\u2019s advantages.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class in several nations and its potential to serve as a hedge against inflation bolster its long-term prospects.\n\nSolana\u2019s Downward Trend and Future Potential\n\nWhile Solana has undoubtedly emerged as a competing rival and has upside potential in USD, its capacity to outshine BTC and ETH remains uncertain. Investors should keep a close eye on market developments and be cautious about betting SOL to lead the altcoins in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nOn the price front, SOL\u2019s price has been on a downward trend in the last week. On June 15th, the price was trading close to $168. At press time, the price is around $127.50, reflecting a decrease of roughly 23.36%.\n\nNevertheless, Solana is a popular platform for decentralized applications [dApps] due to its fast transaction times and low fees. If dApps become more widely used, it could drive up the demand for Solana and increase its price."

        "content": "Episode 665\n\nThe SEC won\u2019t pursue enforcement against Ethereum 2.0, but why? How much of a role did politics play? And where does that leave staking and court cases involving companies such as Consensys and Coinbase?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nLast week, Consensys revealed that the SEC had concluded an investigation into Ethereum 2.0, referring to when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one.\n\nIn this episode, Laura Brookover, senior counsel & head of litigation and investigations at Consensys, and Sam Enzer, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, explore the implications of this decision on Ether\u2019s status as a commodity versus a security, and why the SEC dropped the pursuit, including whether the shifting political winds played a role. For instance, how much of the decision was influenced by the ETH ETF approvals, Democrats crossing party lines to vote for FIT21 and the repeal of SAB 121, and/or SEC crypto enforcement chief David Hirsch\u2019s resignation?\n\nIn this discussion, they also explained why the closure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that staking, or restaking, is safe from the SEC. Plus, what\u2019s the impact of this closure on the other big crypto cases, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Uniswap, and Ripple?\n\nShow highlights:\n\nHow Consensys managed to get the SEC to reveal that it had concluded its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, and the significance of that move\n\nThe SEC\u2019s possible reasoning behind investigating Ethereum after it had switched to proof of stake\n\nHow uncommon is it for the SEC to send a letter concluding an investigation like the one into Ethereum\n\nWhether recent events around crypto as an election issue, the ETH ETF approvals, votes for FIT21 and the repeal of SAB121, and David Hirsch\u2019s resignation, might be connected to the decision to close this investigation\n\nWhether the Biden administration has shifted its stance on crypto and whether Gensler should remain as chair\n\nHow the SEC might still go after staking\n\nWhether restaking, such as pioneered by EigenLayer, is safe from regulatory actions\n\nWhy the SEC might be pursuing different judgments in various jurisdictions for MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet\n\nWhat crucial evidence from the closed Ethereum 2.0 investigation could strengthen Coinbase\u2019s defense in its ongoing lawsuit\n\nWhy the SEC\u2019s aggressive stance on various crypto enforcement actions seems to remain unchanged despite closing the Ethereum 2.0 investigation\n\nWhy Sam and Laura believe Solana should not be considered a security, despite the SEC naming it as such in various crypto cases\n\nHow the SEC\u2019s argument about an \u201cecosystem\u201d is nonsensical, according to Laura Brookover\n\nWhat the implications of the closed investigation are for the cases of Kraken and Ripple\n\nWhat Sam and Laura B. are watching out for in terms of regulation and ongoing legal cases\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you to our sponsors!\n\nGuests:\n\nLinks\n\nEthereum \u2018Survives the SEC\u2019\n\nConsensys lawsuit against the SEC\n\nEther ETFs\n\nLatest on other SEC enforcement actions"

        "title": "Cega Shark Bull vaults on Ethereum and Arbitrum combine stability with high returns - Blockworks",
        "content": "The promise of guaranteed high yields with downside protection is often a red flag when navigating a sea of DeFi app marketing speak.\n\nYields are often exaggerated while risks get buried. It\u2019s easy to promote sky-high APRs when you print your own token to fund temporary incentives.\n\nIn the offchain financial world, however, there is such a wild beast emerging from the depths: Shark Fin notes.\n\nDeFi app Cega Finance, a leader in exotic options and structured financial products, launched an onchain version on Ethereum and Arbitrum today.\n\nA Shark Fin is a type of structured financial product that offers a unique risk-reward profile. These notes provide investors with enhanced returns if the price of the underlying asset stays within a predetermined range. The name derives from the shape of the payoff diagram, which resembles a shark\u2019s fin.\n\nSource: Cega.fi\n\nThe potential returns sharply increase to a peak if the asset\u2019s price remains within the range, and then level off or decline if the price moves beyond the specified threshold. This structure allows investors to benefit from stable market conditions while protecting against significant downside risk.\n\nCega\u2019s launch provides conservative investors an onchain version with crypto as the underlying assets.\n\nExpansion from Solana to Ethereum\n\nCega debuted its first four vaults on Solana almost exactly two years ago, but branched out to Ethereum in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRead more: Solana options protocol Cega comes to Ethereum\n\nThe decision to launch on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was always part of Cega\u2019s roadmap, but the collapse of FTX in November 2022 prompted Cega to expedite its plans, according to co-founder Winston Zhang.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we couldn\u2019t wait, and we wanted to continue growing,\u201d Zhang told Blockworks.\n\nInitially, the team considered expanding crosschain via LayerZero or Wormhole, but ultimately decided to hire a new team of Solidity developers to rebuild on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhile that was a little bit slower, it provides the best affordance for safety and security because we\u2019re able to control the smart contracts design ourselves and not rely on a third party,\u201d Zhang explained.\n\nThis transition, which took three to six months, was particularly a response to demand from large-scale investors like DAOs, funds and high-net-worth individuals who prefer the stability of Ethereum.\n\nThe decision to add Arbitrum was driven by its strong DeFi community and significant TVL, making it an ideal target audience for Cega\u2019s products. Arbitrum\u2019s growth, fueled by platforms like GMX, aligns well with Cega\u2019s offerings, which appeals to trading aficionados and derivatives enthusiasts.\n\nIt\u2019s not a migration \u2014 Cega maintains a presence on Solana with thousands of users, and the product will continue to be developed there.\n\n\u201cWe are having conversations about what it means to reprioritize the Solana ecosystem and how to think about product parity for some of the new products that we\u2019ve launched on Arbitrum and [Ethereum] mainnet,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nMaking complex products accessible\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Cega faces is how to simplify complex financial products for their non-professional users. They made a conscious effort to create intuitive visualizations and straightforward documentation to avoid overwhelming users with technical jargon.\n\nTypically reserved for accredited investors in traditional finance, the goal is to make this class of investment tools accessible to everyone, regardless of investment size.\n\n\u201cThe products that we\u2019re building are ultimately derivatives products, but they add a number of benefits for the end user that they can\u2019t get from existing [perpetual futures] platforms or vanilla options platforms,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nThe new \u201cShark Bull\u201d vaults target users who might typically have capital on lending platforms like Aave, and want to increase their stablecoin yield without taking directional risk to crypto markets.\n\nThese vaults offer 100% principal protection with a guaranteed yield of 12.7%, and the potential for up to 30% returns under certain circumstances by combining lending and options strategies.\n\nStablecoins\u2019 lending yield forms the baseline return, while a portion of the yield is used to purchase out-of-the-money (OTM) call options on crypto assets \u2014 the \u201cbull\u201d component, driving the high bonus payouts if prices rise.\n\nThe lending counterparties in this case are not smart contracts but major crypto market makers, so this introduces some credit risk. Cega facilitates these loans but is not a custodian, and manages the risk through stringent legal agreements and ongoing credit monitoring provided by Credora.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin lenders have a new regulation-friendly option for yield\n\nCega, based in Singapore, emphasizes compliance with global regulations. These days, that requires geofencing the US-based customers.\n\nDecentralization plans\n\nThe company raised a total of $9.3 million from notable investors including Dragonfly and Pantera, and does not yet have a token.\n\nZhang said his team deliberately avoided participating in the points incentivization game popular over the past year, preferring to focus on providing real sustainable yield.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually really proud of that,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nEven without incentives, the platform has about $16.6 million in TVL currently, and about $404 million in cumulative trading volume.\n\nLooking ahead, Cega does plan to launch a token while maintaining its core values of responsibility and prudence, Zhang said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many protocols in crypto and in DeFi that just aren\u2019t built on real foundations,\u201d he said, citing the project\u2019s published values.\n\n\u201cThere just have been way too many examples in the ecosystem of carelessness, and lack of responsibility, and that is not us.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
