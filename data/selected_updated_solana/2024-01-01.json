        "content": "Mon 01 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the roadmap and vision for the network in 2024. In a series of posts, he detailed the 6 main components that will shape Ethereum this year. Here\u2019s an overview of the strategic directions for the network\u2019s development in 2024.\n\nSingle-slot finality at the heart of technical improvements\n\nOne of the key points of the roadmap is the development of single-slot finality (SSF). This mechanism aims to reinforce the irreversibility of blocks on Ethereum. The SSF allows for locking in changes in a block, except in the case of a major attack.\n\nFor Buterin, the SSF seems to be the ideal solution to address the current weaknesses of proof of stake. By consolidating irreversibility, it would greatly improve the resilience and security of the consensus. Therefore, the SSF appears as the cornerstone of the upcoming technical efforts.\n\nBack to the cypherpunk roots of the initial vision\n\nButerin also recalled his original vision for Ethereum, rooted in the cypherpunk legacy. He wanted it to be a kind of \u201cdecentralized hard drive\u201d using cryptography. But this aspect has faded since 2017 with the rise of financial features.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, recent innovations like rollups or ZK-Snarks could help reconnect with the cypherpunk values. Thus, returning Ethereum\u2019s technological and liberating dimension is part of the goals for 2024.\n\nOther pillars of Ethereum\u2019s development in 2024\n\nAside from single-slot finality and a return to a more cypherpunk vision, Buterin has outlined several other key directions for the ongoing development of Ethereum in 2024 in his roadmap:\n\nImproving scalability through rollups and sharding\n\nStrengthening the decentralization of validation nodes\n\nOptimizing user experience to attract more developers\n\nContinuing with security updates and protocol upgrades\n\nIncorporating innovations from recent academic research\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make Ethereum a reference blockchain, combining security, decentralization, high processing capacity, privacy, and innovation capacity. An extremely ambitious program that will require cutting-edge technical advancements in the years to come.\n\nThrough this roadmap, Vitalik Buterin sketches the contours of a more technically proficient Ethereum that remains true to its cypherpunk roots. Realizing this ambitious vision will involve innovations like single-slot finality. The plan for 2024 offers a fascinating glimpse into the developments to come for Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "The latest Ethereum All Core Developers meeting finally put some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nWith the caveat that it\u2019s only \u201cif no major issues arise,\u201d Ethereum devs are eyeing the following dates for forking Ethereum\u2019s public testnets:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation.\n\nThey also discussed what comes next \u2014 the as-yet-un-nicknamed Prague/Electra upgrade. The Ethereum community is considering whether to focus on a large core feature \u2014 which could take a year of work \u2014 or structure the upgrade around multiple smaller improvements, which could be feasible for late 2024.\n\nA decision will come in the new year, but for now, here are some of the improvements to watch in 2024 in the wake of Dencun:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)\n\nThis is the big kahuna among Dencun EIPs, which were the focus of many news stories in 2023.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nThe upgrade \u201cwill reduce the cost of data availability across all layer-2s,\u201d StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson told Blockworks. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that Starknet is very much anticipating so that users can have lower costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at the \u201cforefront\u201d of what Lucas Henning, chief technology officer of Web3 wallet developer Suku, calls \u201ca year of groundbreaking improvements for Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201c[EIP-4844 is] a transformational enhancement\u201d that will slash rollups gas fees \u201cby up to 100x,\u201d Henning told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nAccount abstraction comes into its own\n\nAlso at the top of Henning\u2019s mind are improvements taking advantage of account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900.\n\nERCs are a subset of EIPs focusing specifically on token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem. They define rules for token implementations to ensure interoperability. Unlike some EIPs that modify the core protocol, ERCs typically don\u2019t require a hard fork.\n\nERC-4337 went live in March and the concept of account abstraction \u201cwill play a pivotal role as the most significant changes for the end-user,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is set to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with wallets, making gasless transactions the standard and secure social logins the new norm, fundamentally reshaping the Ethereum user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and contract accounts controlled by their code. Account abstraction blurs this distinction, allowing users to create accounts that behave more like smart contracts.\n\nIt can enhance both user experience and security, and allows for more complex account logic, such as multisig wallets or social recovery of lost keys.\n\nERC-6900, introduced the concept of \u201cdelegated transactions.\u201d This standard, which also did not require changes to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet consensus, allows users to delegate the ability to send transactions on their behalf, for instance, to make one approval for a batch of actions to save time and hassle.\n\nEIP-1153 (transient storage opcodes)\n\nThis proposal, part of Dencun, aims to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during smart contract execution.\n\nTraditional storage operations on Ethereum are permanent and consume gas. This can be inefficient for temporary data that doesn\u2019t need to persist for longer than one transaction.\n\nEIP-1153 is an opcode (operational code) that would allow smart contracts to use transient storage \u2014 storage that would be wiped clean at the end of transaction execution.\n\nThe Uniswap team lobbied for 1153 to be included, and wanted it already in Shapella, but they couldn\u2019t rally enough support to reach consensus among the core developers. The upgrade is expected to play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Uniswap\u2019s upcoming v4 protocol.\n\nRead more: What has Uniswap Labs cooked up for v4?\n\nBy enabling temporary storage, EIP-1153 can reduce the gas costs associated with storing data during contract execution and provide developers more flexibility in designing smart contracts.\n\nAnd by reducing the burden on permanent storage and minimizing state bloat, EIP-1153 can contribute to the overall scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-4788 (Beacon block root commits)\n\nImagine Ethereum as a vast library with two main sections: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) section, which is like the reading room where people come to read books (execute smart contracts), and the Beacon Chain section, which is like the library\u2019s catalog system, keeping track of all the books and their locations (consensus and coordination of the Ethereum network).\n\nBefore EIP-4788, these two sections functioned somewhat independently. The EVM section doesn\u2019t have direct access to the up-to-date catalog; it has to rely on indirect methods to understand what\u2019s happening in the Beacon Chain section.\n\nEIP-4788 proposes to put a \u201cBeacon Block Root\u201d (a summary or hash tree root of the parent block) into each EVM block.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving from an outdated card filing system in a library \u2014 inefficient and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 to a system with a real-time, accurate and direct link to the main library database.\n\nIn this modern library, every time a new book is added, moved or removed (the Beacon Chain updates), the readers (EVM) have immediate and accurate information. Readers can trust they\u2019re getting the most current information and the library operations (like executing smart contracts) are more aligned with the overall catalog system (the state of the consensus layer).\n\nAll this happens in a trust-minimized manner, eliminating the need for external oracles to provide this data, and thereby reducing potential points of failure or manipulation.\n\nThis change is particularly beneficial for liquid staking protocols such as Lido, smart contract-based bridges and restaking solutions, as it allows these protocols to access crucial data like validator balances and states directly from the consensus layer, enhancing their security and operational efficiency.\n\nEIP-4788 essentially introduces a protocol-level oracle, relaying Ethereum\u2019s consensus state throughout the mainnet.\n\nMisha Komarov, founder of Nil Foundation, which is deploying a zkOracle for Lido, called it \u201cdefinitely helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need the consensus layer state root within their application logic (right now it is being proven by Casper FFG proof done via zkLLVM to the execution layer within the zkOracle design,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: New Ethereum rollup takes a zero-knowledge approach to sharding\n\nEIP-5656 (MCOPY opcode)\n\nThe EVM operates using a set of opcodes that dictate various operations.\n\nEIP-5656 introduces a new opcode called MCOPY, which is proposed to optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts.\n\nIn the current EVM architecture, copying large data segments can be inefficient and costly when using existing opcodes. MCOPY offers a more efficient way, one which is expected to reduce the gas fees associated with these operations, while improving performance.\n\nFaster memory operations mean quicker execution of contracts, and developers would have more tools at their disposal to optimize their smart contracts \u2014 particularly when dealing with large data structures or complex operations that involve memory manipulation.\n\nEIP-6780 (restrict SELFDESTRUCT)\n\nIn Ethereum, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode allows a smart contract to delete itself from the blockchain.\n\nWhen executed, it removes the contract\u2019s code and storage from the state and sends the contract\u2019s remaining ether to a specified address.\n\nHowever, this feature has led to several issues, including complexity in state management and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy restricting SELFDESTRUCT, Ethereum can better manage its state size, leading to a more stable and predictable blockchain.\n\nThis is crucial for the network\u2019s long-term scalability and maintenance, as it will simplify future Ethereum upgrades.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
