        "content": "Ethereum ETF, Uniswap V4, and Cardano upgrade aim to enhance market accessibility and efficiency in Q3.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum ETF launch expected to attract institutional investors in Q3 2024.\n\nCardano's Chang hard fork aims to implement decentralized governance by July's end.\n\nShare this article\n\nThree major catalysts are set to impact the crypto market in Q3 2024, according to the latest edition of IntoTheBlock\u2019s newsletter \u201cOn-chain Insights\u201d. The events include the trading start of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US, the Uniswap V4 release, and Cardano\u2019s Chang hard fork.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is expected to launch this quarter, potentially attracting institutional investors. Analysts at IntoTheBlock predict ETH ETF inflows could reach 30% of those seen during the Bitcoin ETF introduction, which saw $5 billion in net inflows over its first five months.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs reported by Crypto Briefing, asset management firm Bitwise\u2019s CIO predicted that Ethereum ETFs could attract $15 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by total value locked, plans to release its V4 version. This is the second development in crypto seen by IntoTheBlock analysts as a potential catalyst for prices in Q3.\n\nNotably, the V4 update introduces \u201chooks\u201d for customization, dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and time-weighted average market maker functionality.\n\nCurrent profitability of UNI holders. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nMoreover, Cardano aims to implement the Chang hard fork by the end of July, introducing decentralized, community-run governance. The Chang upgrade will proceed once 70% of stake pool operators have tested and updated their systems.\n\nThis is also a development in crypto that could boost prices in this quarter, the analysts pointed out.\n\nThese developments follow historical trends of catalysts boosting asset values. During the month leading up to Cardano\u2019s last hard fork in September 2021, ADA\u2019s price increased by 130%, rising from $1.35 to $3.10.\n\nThe On-chain Insights newsletter also mentions the application for a Solana ETF made by Bitcoin ETF issuers VanEck and 21Shares, further expanding institutional crypto access. Although it is unlikely to get approved in 2024, much less in Q3, this movement could boost investors\u2019 sentiment."

        "title": "Ethereum staking ETFs will hit Hong Kong in six months \u2014 and the financial hub won\u2019t stop there - DLNews",
        "content": "Hong Kong could launch Ethereum staking ETFs within the next six months.\n\nOther crypto products, like a Uniswap ETF or Chainlink ETF, may follow.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched in April have been warmly received by Hong Kong\u2019s financial sector.\n\nEthereum staking exchange-traded funds are coming to Hong Kong \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Vivien Wong, partner at HashKey Capital, a crypto asset management firm that played a vital role in getting Hong Kong\u2019s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs off the ground.\n\n\u201cAs soon as spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the US, people ran to us asking, \u2018are you planning to launch an Ether staking product?\u2019\u201d Wong told DL News.\n\nShe said regulators, like Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, were talking with the industry.\n\n\u201cLast month, I sent a message to regulators to say there was a need for Ether staking,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWithout hesitating, they said \u2018okay, please send a detailed proposal.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe timing of her comments is notable.\n\nNine spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch in the US any day now, as soon as the Securities and Exchange Commission finalises applications.\n\nStaking Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum is designed so users can choose to lock in their Ether holdings and earn a 3% yield on the asset \u2014 a process called staking.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhile spot Ethereum ETFs enable investors to easily get exposure to Ether through their brokerage accounts, they don\u2019t allow them to gain that extra yield.\n\nIn fact, in Hong Kong, holders of these ETF shares must pay a management fee that\u2019s anywhere between 0.3% and 0.99%, depending on the fund they choose.\n\n\u201cFor a new Ethereum product to launch, it will probably require another six months or so,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWaiting for the mainland\n\nHong Kong is so keen to offer products that don\u2019t yet exist in the US, because the government wants the city to become a fintech powerhouse, according to Wong.\n\nAnd the process is running \u201cpretty smoothly,\u201d she said.\n\nAlready, the existing crypto ETFs are attracting two types of investors: People who simply want to \u201cbuy and hold,\u201d and crypto natives, Wong said. Crypto natives, in particular, have been enticed by the ETF design.\n\nThe funds\u2019 timely creation and redemption process allows investors to use them for over-the-counter trading purposes, according to Wong.\n\nBut by taking the lead and offering advanced products, the hope is for Hong Kong to draw in investors from other jurisdictions \u2014 and even, eventually, from the mainland.\n\nMainland investors cannot currently invest in these products. But hopefully, if the regulatory situation changes, \u201cthere will be more endorsements from investors in China and we will see more inflows,\u201d Wong said.\n\n\u201dWe are waiting for that to open up this market,\u201d she added.\n\nMassive success\n\nHong Kong\u2019s crypto ETFs have hauled in almost $260 million in assets since they launched in April, per The Block data.\n\nCompared to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US \u2014 which have brought in $14.6 billion since January 11 \u2014 that might feel small.\n\nBut considering that Hong Kong\u2019s ETF market is 168 times smaller than its US counterpart, the products have been a massive success. \u201cThere is definitely excitement,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWhether its financial institutions, wealth managers, distributors, or high net-worth individuals, the entire Hong Kong market is slowly digesting the products and becoming more comfortable with them, she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a guaranteed win.\n\nOpinion about crypto had soured in the region after some of the scandals from the last bear market \u2014 notably the fraud case surrounding Hong Kong crypto exchange JPEX.\n\nUniswap ETF?\n\nWong said that other cryptocurrencies will possibly have their own ETFs someday, but none of the choices are obvious, she said.\n\nFor Hong Kong regulators to approve new crypto ETFs, the underlying token must be publicly tradable through registered virtual asset trading platforms.\n\nAnd it must be very liquid, meaning that it must be easy for deep-pocketed market participants to trade.\n\nHaving a robust use case doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n\u201dERC-20 tokens would be generally preferred,\u201d Wong said, referring to tokens issued on the Ethereum network. \u201cSome names like Chainlink or Uniswap.\u201d\n\nAnd a Solana ETF might be in the cards as well.\n\n\u201cWe are talking with the SFC right now,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe are getting on with launching new products.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The piece was modified to clarify that investors from mainland China will only be able to invest in the ETFs when Chinese regulation allows it.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.
