        "title": "Bitwise CIO lists three reasons why Ethereum will hit record after ETF launch - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs\u2019 launch will catapult its price to new heights, expert says.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s staking feature plays a key role in its prices.\n\nBitwise CIO expects $15 billion in inflows over the next 18 months.\n\nWith spot Ether exchange-traded products set to hit markets next Tuesday, one expert says Ethereum will hit a new all-time high soon after.\n\nMatt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer, said there are three reasons why Ethereum will rise above $5,000 after the ETFs start trading.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s slow supply growth, lack of miners, and staking will pay serious dividends and enable the new ETFs to outperform Bitcoin funds, Hougan said in a new investor note.\n\nHe has previously estimated that investors will pour $15 billion into spot Ethereum ETFs in their first 18 months of trading.\n\nEthereum supply slows\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are inflationary, meaning more are created and sold on the market over time.\n\nBitcoin does this, but the amount that will ever exist is capped at 21 million.\n\nEthereum is also inflationary, but a technical feature that slows this process was added three years ago.\n\nThe burn feature destroys a small portion of Ether with every transaction.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhen people swap, trade, or lend on the Ethereum network more frequently, more Ether can be destroyed than produced.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the net amount of Ether hitting the market has been nearly zero as of September 2022.\n\nThe network produces an equal amount of Ether as the burn feature destroys.\n\nThe total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. The total supply growth of Ethereum since 2015. Source: Etherscan. (Etherscan/Etherscan)\n\nHougan said this slowed growth and the launch of a new demand source will increase Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThere\u2019s less Ethereum on the market, and with the launch of Ethereum ETFs, many Wall Street firms will start buying it for their products.\n\nMore demand translates to higher prices.\n\nMiners aren\u2019t stakers\n\nBitcoin mining is an industry that demands enormous resources, from electricity costs to high-end machines. Miners regularly sell the Bitcoin they mine to pay these costs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case with Ethereum stakers.\n\nEthereum operates a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. This means it doesn\u2019t require an industrial-grade mining operation to keep it secure.\n\nInstead, users must lock up 32 Ether, which is worth roughly $111,000 today, and become validators who secure the network.\n\nValidators are paid in newly created Ethereum to prevent fraudulent transactions on the network.\n\nRunning a validator is far less expensive than running a profitable mining outfit. This means there is less need to sell Ethereum to continue operating.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, there is simply less forced selling each day in Ethereum than in Bitcoin,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nStaked and off the market\n\nMore than 33 million Ether are staked today, nearly 28% of the entire cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, according to a Dune dashboard by analyst Hildobby.\n\nMore importantly, says Hougan, this is Ether that\u2019s not moving soon either, as they are locked up for a set period, meaning it cannot be withdrawn or sold.\n\n\u201cCurrently, 28% of all ETH is staked, meaning it is effectively off the market,\u201d Hougan said\n\nThe combination of low inflation, fewer sellers in Ether stakers, and millions of Ether off the market make the proposition of an ETH ETF especially bullish, said Hougan.\n\n\u201cIf the ETPs are as successful as I expect \u2014 and given the dynamics above \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine ETH not challenging its old record.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 3% over the past 24 hours to trade at $65,000.\n\nEthereum is up 1.8% to $3,476.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nLiam Kelly is a DeFi correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs start trading Tuesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. - Fortune",
        "content": "New spot ETFs for Ethereum\u2014which will let investors purchase the second most popular cryptocurrency in the form of stocks\u2014 are expected to begin trading on Tuesday, July 23. The Securities and Exchange Commission has green lit at least three funds to enter the market that day, sources told Reuters, although it\u2019s believed that a total of eight Ethereum ETFs will launch simultaneously.\n\nThe instruments follow in the footsteps of the eleven trading spot Bitcoin ETFs. Having accumulated over $54 billion in assets under management since launching in January, Bitcoin has soared 47% this year. Here\u2019s all you need to know about their Ethereum counterparts.\n\nWhat is a spot Ether ETF?\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the SEC\u2019s reservations, Ether is legally considered to be a commodity, but the corresponding ETFs will be securities.\n\nETFs first came to market in 1993. The funds pool together a basket of securities, such as a handful of different energy stocks, and the price aligns with the indexes that it tracks. They are listed on exchanges and can be traded during market hours, thus operating like stocks.\n\nSpot Ether ETFs will track the spot\u2014or current\u2014price of Ether. The products give investors access to the underlying crypto without the need to own a crypto wallet. The ETFs will be set up as grantor trusts, meaning investors will own a share of the Ether held by the trust.\n\nWho issues them and what are the fees?\n\nEight asset managers are proposing to offer Ethereum ETFs: BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Invesco/Galaxy Digital. Each instrument will be near-identical, so the fees charged to investors are competitive. For now, we know that Franklin Templeton will charge 0.19%, VanEck at 0.20%, and Invesco and Galaxy Digital will charge a 0.25% fee for its jointly filed ETF.\n\nThe full list of fees will be revealed when the final registration statements, or S-1s, are submitted to the SEC. This will be on Tuesday, if trading begins for all eight.\n\nWhere can I access them?\n\nThey will be listed on the Nasdaq, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWhy would someone buy an Ethereum ETF?\n\nBitcoin and Ether tokens represent units of ownership\u2014and thus value\u2014of an underlying blockchain. Beyond that, they are very different.\n\nWhereas Bitcoin may be a long-term hedge against inflation, Ethereum is closer to a tech investment. The blockchain\u2019s main premise is \u201cto remove the intermediary and allow for 24/7 uptime in financial services, such as trading and lending, in addition to tokenization, digital collectibles, and digital identity,\u201d Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, told Fortune.\n\nWhile for now crypto markets are tightly correlated, this may not always be the case, he adds. So, Ether ETFs allow investors to diversify which corners of the crypto economy they want to invest in.\n\nWill their popularity match the spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nDemand for the funds will be 20% that of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, told Fortune. This prediction is because the market capitalization of Ether is about one-third of the size of Bitcoin. Plus, he adds, the ETFs will lack a key benefit of holding Ether: Investors will not be allowed to stake, which generates yields. But, even at this smaller size, they would be \u201cextremely successful\u201d by any ETF launch standard, says Seyffart. Similarly, K33 Research predicts that during the first six months of trading, inflows will be $4 billion\u2014a quarter of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen judging their success, it\u2019s key to evaluate performance after six months of trading, rather than simply on \u201cgame day\u201d and the initial weeks, Leah Wald, CEO and president of Cyberpunk Holdings Inc., told Fortune. Launching in summer, they\u2019re coming to market when trading is typically \u201cmore muted,\u201d she points out. Plus, success should also be judged on volume and spread, rather than simply inflows, as the health of these metrics foreground AUM growth down the line, she adds, as investors feel safe allocating dollars into these new securities.\n\nWho will be investing in them?\n\nInstitutional investors, such as hedge funds, pension funds, banks and endowments. Retail investors will also access them, either by buying them directly, or through portfolio allocations via wealth advisors. The latter group will likely dominate the first six months of trading, as the Q1 13Fs for the spot Bitcoin ETFs reveal that over 80% of total AUM was from non-professional investors.\n\nHow will the ETFs impact the crypto market?\n\nIf K33\u2019s prediction of $4 billion in inflows over six months is accurate, at current prices, this would mean 1% of Ether in circulation would be absorbed by the ETFs by the end of the year. This absorption is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to strengthen Ether\u2019s price in the second half of the year, says Lunde.\n\nThe inflows would also be bullish for the wider market, history suggests. The fresh capital flowing into Bitcoin via the ETFs have boosted the crypto market cap by 46% in 2024, according to K33. Lunde anticipates the products \u201ccould further expand the broad market strength\u201d as they enable sidelined capital to enter the market. Plus, Bitcoin ETF investors have \u201chave proven to handle volatility with grace, and flows have been solid even during deep corrections,\u201d says Lunde, suggesting ETFs can open up the market to new investors committed to the long-term.\n\nLastly, as BlackRock, a behemoth of traditional finance, is issuing one of the funds, this shows the firm is diving deeper into crypto. This grants the industry a \u201csolid and well-needed stamp of approval,\u201d he says."

No assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, and Grayscale will update the market to the extent its expectations change.\n\n\n\nRecord Date July 18, 2024 Ratio of ETHE Shares: ETH Shares 1:1 % of Ether held by ETHE contributed to the ETH Trust 10% Anticipated Distribution Date July 23, 2024\n\n*By AUM as of 7/15/2024\n\nNO OFFER OR SOLICITATION\n\nThis communication is for informational purposes, solely in your capacity as a shareholder of ETHE, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. No shareholder approval of the Initial Distribution is required by applicable law, and we are not seeking ETHE shareholder approval.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain of the statements contained herein may be statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on Grayscale\u2019s views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.

You should not make any investment decisions based on these forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVICE\n\nThis communication is not intended as, and does not constitute, tax advice. As further discussed in the section of the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Initial Distribution,\u201d the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution are complex, subject to uncertainty in certain respects and may be affected by circumstances specific to a beneficial owner of ETHE Shares. Any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares who receives ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding ETHE Shares or ETH Shares, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares. Please refer to the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of the ETH Shares.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT\n\nA definitive information statement on Schedule 14C will be furnished to ETHE shareholders on or after the Record Date for the purpose of informing ETHE shareholders of the Initial Distribution, in substantial compliance with Regulation 14C of the Exchange Act. The information statement will describe the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, risks of owning shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and other details regarding the Initial Distribution, and will be made available on our website at www.grayscale.com/documents#regulatoryfilings. ETHE shareholders will not need to pay any consideration, exchange or surrender existing ETHE Shares, or take any other action to receive shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust in connection with the Initial Distribution.\n\nETHE is not a fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, unlike most mutual funds or ETFs.\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust Risk Disclosures:\n\nAn investment in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust or Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust may be deemed speculative and is not intended as a complete investment program. An investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of total loss associated with an investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Ether, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the shares of each trust could lose all or substantially all of their value. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset.
