        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the wide world of crypto, there are now many blockchains specifically designed for gaming\u2014but Ronin was among the first to launch.\n\nGaming blockchains are typically built to offer low transaction fees and a higher number of potential transactions, so they\u2019re supposed to be more affordable and more scalable than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some gaming chains are also private, meaning that developers must gain approval from a blockchain\u2019s creators in order to join its ecosystem.\n\nRonin is one of those examples\u2014at least for now, though founders have said they intend to open it up sometime in 2024 for more studios to build on. In the meantime, games like Pixels and Axie Infinity are drawing players to the Ethereum sidechain network. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nWhat is Ronin?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRonin is a gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain designed to handle transactions at a much faster and cheaper rate than Ethereum's own mainnet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain originally launched back in February 2021.\n\nIt originally launched a \u201cproof of authority\u201d blockchain (PoA), meaning individuals Ronin deems reputable run validator nodes, a type of computer software, to confirm transactions on its blockchain. One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRON set an all-time high price of $4.45 in March 2024, beating the long-standing record from 2022. Ronin's token has gained substantially so far in 2024 on the back of hype around Pixels and other games launching on the network, along with a broader markets upswing led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nOther tokens running on Ronin include Axie Infinity's AXS governance token and Smooth Love Potion (SLP) rewards token, Pixels' PIXEL token, and Apeiron's APRS ecosystem token.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nSky Mavis' own Axie Infinity launched the network, and it's a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nMore recently, Pixels has been the network's biggest hit, delivering a social farming simulation akin to Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, but with crypto incentives and NFT land plots. The game has attracted millions of players, initially fueled by its play-to-airdrop campaigns\u2014but the buzz is still going after the token launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond Axie and Pixels, Sky Mavis has started to onboard other external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding games like Apeiron, The Machines Arena, Kaidro, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few. But some games have left Ronin too\u2014such as Zoids Wild Arena and Battle Bears.\n\nWhat's next for Ronin?\n\nAlong with plans to open up the network to all builders at some point, Sky Mavis has also shared how it plans to expand the network to meet future demand. In April 2024, the company detailed plans to implement zero-knowledge rollups, tapping zkEVM tech to help grow the network in the coming years.\n\nRonin will become more Ethereum aligned. We are Ethereum\u2019s best chance at onboarding everyday people. We\u2019ve been doing it for 6 years but get no recognition since we aren\u2019t a true L2 yet. We will be the #1 ETH L2 by adoption. https://t.co/ekmUWVNmfZ \u2014 Jihoz.ron (@Jihoz_Axie) April 3, 2024\n\nIn a tweet, Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin wrote that Ronin will \"become more Ethereum-aligned\" as a result.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nThis story was originally published on January 28, 2024 and last updated with new details on April 8."
