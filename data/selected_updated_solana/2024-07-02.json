We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales appear to be igniting a potential sell-off today, as nearly $70 million worth of the cryptocurrency was transferred to Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This movement has sparked concerns among ETH traders about a possible market downturn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported two big transactions early this morning. The first tweet revealed that 9,999 ETH, worth around $34.3 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly thereafter, Whale Alert tweeted again to disclose that another 7,413 ETH, worth around $25.4 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance.\n\nThese transactions amount to a total of 17,412 ETH, equivalent to approximately $69.86 million at current market prices. Such large transfers to an exchange typically signal an impending sell-off, as whales \u2014 large holders of cryptocurrency \u2014 often move their assets to exchanges when they intend to sell.\n\nBroader market impact\n\nThe news of these substantial transfers has already had a palpable effect on the market. Ethereum\u2019s price has shown increased volatility following the alerts, with traders closely monitoring Binance for any signs of large-scale selling activity. The potential sell-off by these whales could exert downward pressure on the ETH price, impacting the broader market as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorically, significant movements by whale accounts have led to notable price fluctuations. When large amounts of cryptocurrency are sold off, it can trigger a domino effect, causing other traders to panic and sell their holdings, further driving down the price.\n\nAs of writing this article, the Ethereum price is $3,447.60. It has fallen 0.30% in the last 24 hours. However, the ETH price is down 8.94% over the past 30 days thanks to the ongoing bearish phase on the broader market. While the ultimate impact on Ethereum\u2019s price remains to be seen, the movement of such large amounts of ETH to an exchange is a signal that cannot be ignored."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is primed to mount a comeback against Bitcoin this month after underperforming its sibling cryptocurrency since the start of the year, according to K33 Research.\n\nOn the one hand, the leading smart contract platform is poised to receive its first US-listed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in July, inviting a tidal wave of new institutional demand into ETH. Meanwhile, Bitcoin holders are awaiting a 141,686 BTC ($8.8 billion) distribution from defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox\u2014a looming tsunami of potential sell pressure now ten years in the making.\n\n\u201cThe chickens of 2014 have come home to roost,\u201d wrote K33 Research in a Tuesday market update. \u201cWe expect net selling pressure to burden Bitcoin in an otherwise dry summer market, widening the chop suey range until rosier days arise as the leaves turn orange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the crypto market has lost much of its bullish momentum since April, K33 maintains that Ethereum ETFs will absorb between 0.75% and 1% of all ETH in circulation within their first five months on the market. Though the ETF launch could spark a \u201csell the news\u201d event for ETH in the short term (much like Bitcoin ETFs in January), the firm says ETH\u2019s \u201cpositive supply dynamics\u201d will afford it \u201crelative strength\u201d over the next several months.\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate,\u201d continued K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde, \u201cand I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched down to 0.046 By May 24. That\u2019s when surprise news broke that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs, taking the ratio back up to 0.055 today.\n\nIndicators suggest that positive sentiment around both ETH and BTC is returning to form\u2014particularly in the futures market.\n\nBitcoin futures premiums on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are back to trading in double digits at 10.9%, according to the report. As for Ethereum, the newly launched VolatilityShares 2x leveraged ETH ETF now holds 33,700 ETH ($114 million) equivalent exposure after just 15 trading days, showing that CME traders want long-leveraged exposure to ETH right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new ETF\u2019s popularity has helped push CME ETH open interest back towards all-time highs, currently sitting at 372,000 ETH ($1.26 billion). K33 Research said such high interest signals intent to make directional trades around ETH before the ETFs go live \u2013 though the direction of those trades remains unclear.\n\n\u201cThe soft funding rates suggest that the directional expectations are balanced, with neither bullish nor bearish positioning dominating \u2013 highlighting the uncertain market outlook and lack of consensus as ETH ETF launches are nearing,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethere\u00adum (ETH) is generating considerable\u00ad excitement as the\u00ad U.S. edges closer to approving spot ETFs. Analysts pre\u00addict substantial capital inflows into these ETFs, potentially driving ETH price\u00ads higher. This optimism is bolstered by re\u00adcent technical analyses pointing to a bullish tre\u00adnd for Ethereum.\n\nRenowne\u00add analyst Ali Martinez recently e\u00adxamined Ethereum\u2019s 3-day chart, re\u00advealing insightful data. Martinez highlighted the\u00ad TD Sequential indicator, known for pinpointing market turning points, which flashe\u00add a buy signal for Ethereum. This signal suggests a possible\u00ad rebound for ETH, indicating a short-term bullish outlook.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 5\n\nThe TD Se\u00adquential indicator is respecte\u00add for identifying trend exhaustion points. A marke\u00add 9 buy signal typically precedes price\u00ad recovery or trend re\u00adversal. Martinez interpre\u00adts this signal as a precursor to a rebound following a period of downward price\u00ad movements. Historically, such signals have be\u00aden followed by a consolidation or a reve\u00adrsal.\n\nMartinez\u2019s analysis indicates that Ethere\u00adum might see a corrective\u00ad upward move. The rece\u00adnt price action shows Ethereum trading downward, with occasional upward spike\u00ads. The \u20189\u2019 buy signal suggests a potential pause\u00ad in the bearish trend, possibly le\u00adading to a brief rally.

This te\u00adchnical pattern\u2019s confirmation suggests a bullish wave, with 20-30% price\u00ad increase projections. Following this bre\u00adakout, Ethereum\u2019s target price\u00ad range is optimistic and promising.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,484.66, showing a 3.38% increase\u00ad and a 53.58% rise in trading volume within a day. This positive price\u00ad action indicates potential further upside\u00ads. The price is encounte\u00adring resistance around the $3,500 mark, with significant barrie\u00adrs at the $3,520 and $3,550 levels. A close\u00ad above $3,550 could propel Ether towards the\u00ad $3,650 resistance.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 7\n\nFurther re\u00adsistance is near $3,720, and an upside bre\u00adak above this level could drive\u00ad the price higher, pote\u00adntially reaching $3,880. However, a downside correction might start if Ethe\u00adreum fails to clear the $3,550 re\u00adsistance.

        "title": "Lido Takes Initial Step to Decentralize Ethereum Node Operator Set Amid SEC Allegations - Unchained",
        "content": "Monday saw the debut of Lido\u2019s Community Staking Module on the Holesky test network, which aims to allow new entities, including solo stakers, to become node operators without needing permission from its DAO.\n\nLido jumpstarted the liquid staking ecosystem in 2020 by introducing its flagship product, stETH, a rebasing token representing a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nAs it faces allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, liquid staking leader Lido is preparing to become more decentralized by taking a step toward integrating a more diverse set of Ethereum node operators, such as solo stakers, the \u201cgold standard\u201d for staking, per the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nOn Monday, a Lido initiative called Community Staking Module, which is expected to allow permissionless entry for node operators, activated on the Holesky test network, according to a governance post in Lido\u2019s forums by Dmitry Gusakov, the tech leader of Lido\u2019s community staking product.\n\nThe move comes days after the SEC implied in a lawsuit against Ethereum software provider Consensys that Lido\u2019s liquid staking token, stETH, is an unregistered security. Staked ETH, aka stETH, represents a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their staking rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nLido\u2019s stETH has a market cap of $33 billion, making the liquid staking provider the leading DeFi protocol by total value locked. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard by crypto analyst Hildobby, Lido commands a 29% share of the total 33.3 million staked ETH.\n\nThe advent of Lido\u2019s community staking module marks a change to the protocol that first introduced liquid staking in 2020, because Lido on Ethereum has had a curated and permissioned validator set since its inception, in which those interested in acting as a node operator for Lido had to be vetted by the Lido DAO.\n\nPermissioned and Restricted Since Inception\n\nUnlike its competitor Rocket Pool, before a node operator can conduct validator operations for Lido, governance has to vote on whether to include a prospective address into Lido\u2019s active set of node operators. At presstime, Lido has 39 node operators, which includes the likes of P2P.org, Chorus One, and Consensys.\n\nThe initiative centered on permissionless entry allows \u201cany node operator \u2013 and especially community stakers, from solo stakers, to groups of friends, to amateur operators \u2013 to operate validators by providing an ETH-based bond (security collateral),\u201d according to its documentation.\n\nThe new community module is expected to make solo staking more accessible through its inclusion of several features such as a low bond for node operators as well as smoothed rewards from Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and maximum extractable value.\n\nLido becomes less centralized by making its node operator set permissionless. During the lifecycle of a crypto project, a protocol will typically start with heavy elements of centralization, ranging from core developers holding control over the direction of the project, sometimes in the form of fundraising to delaying a protocol\u2019s token generation event that aims to introduce governance mechanisms for those in the community.\n\nEventually, founders and core members of a protocol would introduce decentralization initiatives, such as implementing onchain voting processes or making node operation permissionless such as the case with Lido.\n\nSEC\u2019s Focus on Consensys and Lido\n\nAlthough, like most DeFi projects, Lido has had a roadmap to decentralization for a while, the initiative comes several days after the SEC charged Consensys for offering and selling unregistered securities, namely Lido and Rocket Pool\u2019s liquid staking tokens, through Metamask, a crypto wallet where people can stake and swap cryptocurrencies.\n\nConsensys, which is also a node operator for Lido, \u201chas offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who created and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets,\u201d the SEC\u2019s press release states.\n\nRead More: Could the SEC Have a Case Against Liquid Staking Protocols?\n\nThe complaint calls Lido and Rocket Pool issuers of unregistered securities, alleging that their staking programs \u201care each offered and sold as investment contracts and, therefore, securities.\u201d\n\nFollowing the prongs of the so-called Howey test, which, since a 1946 court case, has been the legal measure to determine whether an investment is a securities offering, the agency said these liquid staking tokens meet the criteria.\n\nIn its press release it said, the buyers of LSTs \u201cmake an investment of ETH in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits from the managerial efforts of Lido and Rocket Pool, respectively.\u201d However, neither Lido nor Rocket Pool has filed registrations to offer these securities with the SEC.\n\nWith the fourth prong of the Howey test being \u201cthe managerial efforts of others,\u201d crypto projects have sought to be decentralized enough that such a third party could not be easily named.\n\nWhen Unchained reached out to the founders and key members of Lido in May for commentary on whether the SEC took action against the liquid staking provider or contacted them about stETH, Unchained did not receive a response. According to a snapshot vote taken in Aug. 2022, Eric Hill, who goes by @Rotorless on X, is Lido\u2019s head of legal and general counsel. However, when Unchained contacted Hill for commentary, he said he did not hold that position anymore and wasn\u2019t \u201cthe right person to talk to.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Consensys, when Unchained highlighted SEC\u2019s claims that stETH is an unregistered security, Lido marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen said, \u201cWe\u2019re on it,\u201d but did not provide additional insights.\n\nLDO, the governance token for Lido, has decreased 6.3% in the past 24 hours and 19.7% over the last 30 days to trade at $1.92, making its market cap stand at $1.7 billion, per CoinGecko.\n\nUPDATE (July 3, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET): Added clarification on the timeline for Lido\u2019s plan to make the process to become a node validator permissionless, as well as the way Lido founders and key members responded to queries about regulatory issues when Unchained reached out to them in May."
