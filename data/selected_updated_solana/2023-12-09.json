        "content": "Crypto analysts at the investment management giant VanEck are predicting big things for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) in 2024.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, and Patrick Bush, a digital assets senior investment analyst, predict that Ethereum will lose market share to Solana next year due to the latter project having \u201cless uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also predict that Solana will rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, total value locked (TVL) and active users.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts. TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets. Solana currently ranks sixth among chains in terms of TVL, according to the decentralized finance aggregator DeFi Llama.\n\nSigel and Bush also predict that Solana will join the race for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. So far, financial firms have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSOL is trading at $74.05 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 6.65% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Altcoins Cardano, Solana and Algorand noted a spike in their social dominance in the past 24 hours.\n\nADA, SOL and OP social dominance marked one of the highest levels seen in 2023.\n\nAnalysts at crypto intelligence tracker Santiment recommend proceeding with caution when trading in these assets.\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment, altcoins like Cardano, Solana and Algorand noted an increase in their social dominance. Amidst a market wide crypto rally, these assets were most mentioned among traders on social media platforms like X.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin analyst calls early bull market as BTC price targets $50,000 in December\n\nSocial dominance in ADA, SOL, OP marks an increase\n\nBitcoin price rallied closer to the $45,000 mark, fueling market participants with optimism and driving altcoin prices higher. Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Algorand (ALGO) ranked in popularity among traders, indicated by a spike in their social dominance.\n\nThe social dominance of these assets marked one of the highest levels in 2023, and this implies traders should be cautious when opening a position in ADA, SOL or ALGO, according to Santiment analysts.\n\nSocial discussions are a key metric that help determine the relevance and adoption of an asset among traders. Cardano\u2019s social discussion is at a six month high, Solana and Algorand\u2019s social discussion rates are at a two month and three month high respectively.\n\nADA, SOL, ALGO social dominance climbs\n\nThe development implies there is a Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) altcoin price rallies, among traders, making it important for investors to proceed with caution when trading these assets.\n\nOne of the likely catalysts driving this increase in social discussions is Robinhood\u2019s introduction of commission free trading for the European Union region. The cryptocurrency trade platform introduced EU traders to Solana, Polygon and Cardano, among other cryptocurrencies as part of its strategic move.\n\nRising demand from traders has likely fueled gains in altcoins like ADA, SOL and ALGO."

This level is significant, as 642,000 wallets have bought 347,000 BTC here.\n\nShould the bullish trend continue, we might see a push toward the next major supply zone at $47,300, where 614,000 wallets hold 427,000 BTC.\n\nHowever, if the $42,700 support breaks, all eyes will turn to the $38,000 mark as the next critical area to watch.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,423 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Chainlink (LINK), Martinez urges investors and traders to be cautious about the leading blockchain oracle.\n\n\u201cChainlink trades above a key support zone! Over 17,000 addresses bought 47 million LINK between $14.40 and $14.80.\n\nWhile this level may hold and trigger a rebound, you must watch out!
