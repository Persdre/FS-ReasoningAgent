        "title": "Binance looks to boost FDUSD adoption with fee-free trading for Ethereum, XRP, others - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Binance has expanded its free trading options for the spot and margin trading pairs of the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin pairing with six digital assets, including BNB, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, according to a Dec. 5 statement.\n\nBinance users will see zero maker and taker fees for these pairs starting Dec. 8 for an undisclosed period. The exchange explained that the free trading option would exclude these pairs from BNB fee discounts, rebates, and other adjustments.\n\nHowever, the firm stated that it \u201creserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk account registrations, as well as trades that display attributes of self-dealing or market manipulation.\u201d\n\nBinance is actively pushing FDUSD.\n\nThe free transaction promotion is part of Binance\u2019s ongoing efforts to encourage its users to use the FDUSD stablecoin.\n\nLast week, the crypto platform said it would phase out support for Binance USD (BUSD) by Dec. 15. Binance urged users to convert their BUSD holdings into the new stablecoin before the end of the year, saying it would end BUSD withdrawals by Dec. 31 and that BUSD balances would be automatically converted to FDUSD.\n\nBinance\u2019s decision relates to the BUSD stablecoin\u2019s regulatory issues. Earlier in the year, the BUSD issuer, Paxos, suspended the stablecoin issuance following scrutiny from U.S. regulators. At the time, the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which classified the stablecoin as a security.\n\nWhile Binance and Paxos have vehemently rejected this classification, the crypto community promptly deserted the stablecoin, with its circulating supply dropping to less than $2 billion as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nConcurrently, Binance has been heavily pushing FDUSD as a viable alternative, introducing new products for the digital asset and incentivizing its use. However, FDUSD\u2019s circulating supply remains less than 1 billion and is only available on less than five crypto exchanges.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining stocks surging, analysts and even legacy banks like JPMorgan Chase are increasingly bullish on the sector\u2019s prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum-based project Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is nearing $5 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), thanks to the buzz around its innovative Stake-to-Mine model.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Sector \u2013 A Brief Overview\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using specialized computers to solve complex math problems that validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn return, miners earn BTC as a reward \u2013 providing an incentive to continue mining.\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining was possible on regular home computers.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin network has grown, mining has become increasingly competitive, spurring an arms race in mining hardware development.\n\nThe introduction of ASIC mining rigs has enabled industrial-scale Bitcoin mining operations, helping the mining sector balloon to a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by large firms.\n\nAlthough the sector\u2019s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, recent innovations have begun to focus on boosting efficiency in a greener way.\n\nMoreover, these concerns have led to the exploration of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power in BTC mining operations.\n\nAccording to a report from Industry Research Co., the entire crypto-mining market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2028.\n\nAnalysts & JPMorgan Bullish on Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nSeveral analysts, and even huge financial institutions like JPMorgan, are growing increasingly optimistic about the prospects of companies that operate in the crypto mining space.\n\nCleanSpark ($CLSK), in particular, has attracted bullish praise recently.\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan called CleanSpark its \u201ctop pick\u201d among mining stocks, citing its \u201cscale, growth potential, power costs & relative value.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, crypto analyst UltraXBT expressed confidence in CleanSpark at current levels, claiming it\u2019s a \u201c$25 stock that is currently identifying as a $4.50 stock.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ThoughtfulTrade on Twitter noted that a Bitcoin breakout above $46,000 could spur the price of mining stocks like CleanSpark to soar even higher.\n\nWith BTC mining profitability improving due to the crypto market\u2019s recovery, firms like CleanSpark that leverage low-cost power stand to capitalize.\n\nMoreover, the upbeat outlook from JPMorgan and analysts reflects the growing optimism around the Bitcoin mining space in general.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Platform Introduces Innovative Stake-to-Mine Model & Raises $4.8 Million\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining stocks like CleanSpark offer indirect exposure to crypto prices, a new altcoin project called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) aims to reinvent mining rewards through staking.\n\nThe Ethereum-based Stake-to-Mine protocol allows users to earn regular BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than purchasing expensive hardware.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol works by distributing \u201cmining credits\u201d to those who stake BTCMTX, which can be exchanged for cloud mining power.\n\nIn turn, this democratizes access to BTC mining by lowering the barriers to entry \u2013 meaning anyone can get involved.\n\nThe Stake-to-Mine mechanism also enables considerable staking yields, with current APYs exceeding 120%.\n\nUltimately, by reinventing mining rewards and making hash power more accessible, Bitcoin Minetrix has the potential to transform the crypto-mining space.\n\nOn the back of strong interest surrounding its unique value proposition, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team recently launched a presale for BTCMTX.\n\nThe presale aims to raise funds to develop and scale the Stake-to-Mine platform further.\n\nMore than $4.8 million has already been raised from eager investors, with BTCMTX tokens available to buy for $0.012 each.\n\nOnce the presale concludes, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on leading centralized exchanges, enabling seamless trading for speculative investors.\n\nWith strong presale momentum and backing from high-profile names like VoskCoin, BTCMTX seems poised to make a splash when public trading begins.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
