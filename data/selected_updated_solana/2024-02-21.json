        "content": "Ether\u2019s trip to $3,000 may have been short-lived, but on-chain data and the state of the wider ecosystem suggests that there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the digital asset.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) hit a near two-year high ahead of $3,000 on Tuesday \u2013 the first time it has traded at this level since April 2022.\n\nThe second largest digital asset by market cap rallied over 12% in the last week and briefly changed hands at $3,031, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, ether had failed to gain momentum towards a move higher, suggesting that this resistance level won\u2019t be so easy to breach.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this recent rally could also have some traders on their toes, given the last time ether rallied to this level in the weeks leading up to April 3, 2022. At the time, ether rallied from $2,520 over three weeks to a high of $3,580, but its price plummeted 46% over the next 40 days that followed.\n\nIn its most recent review of the crypto market, onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that while Bitcoin dominance still remains significant, there are early signs of more investor capital rotating into other ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe note that following the approval of the bitcoin ETF, ether has started to outperform bitcoin, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023,\u201d said the Glassnode analysts.\n\nIt is also likely that major inflows into ether will only materialize over the coming weeks, as they tend to lag relative to bitcoin inflows on account of investors looking for confirmation that digital asset markets are growing.\n\n\u201cIn the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into bitcoin occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ether,\u201d said Glassnode analysts.\n\nOptions market data suggests that a retest of some crucial price levels might come sooner rather than later. Coinalyze data points to more bullish bets on the price of ether, showing that 59% of traders were in long positions over a 24-hour time frame."

        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

        "content": "On Feb. 20, Solana TVL surpassed $2 billion for the first time in 2 years, and funds flowing in from Ethereum through the Wormhole bridge suggest more SOL price gains ahead.\n\nSOL\u2018s price has lost steam after soaring to a new 2024 peak of $118.40 on Feb. 15. However, an on-chain data trail of funds inflows trickling down to Solana from the Ethereum (ETH) network this week could spark a SOL price rebound toward $150.\n\nSolana price dips 12%, falling below market average\n\nIn the first half of February 2024, Solana was at the forefront of the crypto market rally, with SOL price soaring 26.8% and adding nearly $11 billion to its market capitalization. But that market trend flipped on Feb. 15 as investors began to take profits once the SOL price reached the 2024 peak of $118.\n\nSolana (SOL) price performance vs. Total3 Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC and ETH) | Source: TradingView\n\nAt press time on Feb. 21, Solana is trading at $103, down 12% from its Feb. 15 peaks.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast, the total altcoin market has grown by 5% during that period. Solana\u2019s negative price performance seems driven by insiders and existing holders\u2019 booking profits rather than macro factors.\n\nSolana receives $25 million in inflows from Ethereum\n\nHowever, while some SOL traders are taking chips off the table, the Solana network has continued to make some giant strides this week, which could trigger an early price rebound.\n\nIn the past week, Solana has received significant inflows from Ethereum as investors increasingly look to leverage Solana\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective defi services.\n\nBetween Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, investors transferred funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum to Solana, per on-chain data from Wormhole bridge Explorer.\n\nFund Outflows Ethereum (ETH) to Solana (SOL), Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 21 | Source: Wormhole Bridge\n\nThis indicates that Solana continues gaining traction among developers and defi users due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. Hence, this rising flow of funds bridged into Solana-hosted decentralized applications (dApps) is a bullish indicator of its growing adoption and utility.\n\nSolana defi TVL hits $2 billion milestone\n\nInvestors transferring funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum into the Solana ecosystem, despite the 12% decline in Solana\u2019s price over the last seven days, shows an evident divergence between short-term price movements and long-term investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL) Total Value Locked (TVL) hits $2 billion, Feb. 21, 2024 | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nThe latest wave of fund inflows has now propelled Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Solana network above the $2 billion milestone for the first time since June 2022.\n\nThis further underlines that the ongoing SOL price pullback is not driven by any discernible deterioration of Solana\u2019s fundamental network growth metrics.\n\nIf the trends persist, the rising demand for Solana defi service could eventually evolve into market demand for native SOL tokens and ultimately trigger a bullish price reversal towards the $150 territory in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter an airdrop farming campaign that prompted hopeful recipients to flood Crypto Twitter with tweets, the Portal gaming token finally has a launch date\u2014and it comes with the announcement of a Binance Launchpool campaign that will offer up another way for crypto users to earn a potentially sizable stash of PORTAL.\n\nPORTAL will launch on February 29, according to the Binance Launchpool campaign page, and the crypto exchange will list the token at 10am UTC (or 5am EST). The Launchpool campaign will debut tomorrow, February 22, and offer token staking rewards ahead of the listing.\n\nBinance customers who stake either Binance Coin (BNB) or the FDUSD stablecoin into PORTAL liquidity pools can earn a share of the total rewards pool, which numbers 50 million tokens\u2014that\u2019s 5% of the total PORTAL supply of 1 billion Ethereum-based tokens.\n\nAccording to Binance, the token will debut with a circulating supply of 167,134,615 PORTAL, or about 16.7% of the total supply. However, Binance\u2019s Launchpool campaign is not available to users in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and more. A full list can be found here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPortal has yet to announce details about the actual airdrop distribution following a farming campaign that spanned November and December last year. A Portal representative told Decrypt\u2019s GG that details will be announced before the Binance token listing.\n\nIn pre-market trading on Whales Market, the PORTAL token is commanding bids of $1.02, which puts the total estimated value of the Binance rewards pool at just a hair over $50 million.\n\nWhat is Portal? Billed as a cross-chain crypto gaming platform and token, it\u2019s designed to bridge the gap across various ecosystems, providing one place to play, discover, and transact across popular blockchain games.\n\n\u26a1 Portal x @binance \u26a1 The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for is nearly here. On Feb 29, 10am UTC, $Portal will officially launch on @binance. This is just the beginning. We\u2019ve got so much to show you about Portal and the products we\u2019ve been building. Get ready! https://t.co/zge4Prs1n1 \u2014 Portal (@Portalcoin) February 21, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Portal\u2019s founding team members and advisors are associated with SuperDuper, the startup behind Ethereum NFT collection Creepz, including Chief Business Officer Dan Keene, who serves the same role at SuperDuper. Advisors Jamie King (ex-Rockstar Games) and Matt Dixon (ex-Electronic Arts) are among those who also advise SuperDuper.\n\nPortal is represented by prominent Hollywood agency WME. Beyond the airdrop farming campaign, the project also held a presale in December that attracted nearly $10 million worth of interest across Ethereum and Solana in just 15 minutes alone.\n\nThe Portal campaign comes right after Binance concluded a Launchpool push for PIXEL, the Ethereum token of the Ronin network game Pixels. PIXEL was listed Monday and generated more than a billion dollars worth of trading volume in less than a day, making it one of the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies in the world that day, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ethereum. Analysts see four drivers behind an even bigger surge - DLNews",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.
