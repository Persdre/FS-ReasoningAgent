        "title": "What is EIP-7251 (MaxEB) in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "EIP-7251, also known as MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for Ethereum that aims to address the issue of redundant network validators.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum has led to the continued increase of validators who participate in the network\u2019s consensus process. Ethereum researchers have expressed concerns about the potential instability in the network due to the continued increase of validator sets.\n\nRead on as we discuss EIP-7251 and its role in addressing these concerns.\n\nWhat Is EIP-7251 (MaxEB)?\n\nEIP-7251, or MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for the Ethereum network that aims to address the issue of \u2018redundant validators.\u2019\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum amount a validator can stake from the current 32 ETH to 2048 ETH while maintaining the minimum staking balance limit at 32 ETH.\n\nThe goal is to allow large node operators to consolidate their validator sets, potentially reducing the number of validators and increasing the network\u2019s efficiency. Validators won\u2019t have to fully exit and re-enter the protocol to merge their effective balances.\n\nFor solo stakers, EIP-7251 will enable them to earn compounding rewards and stake their ether in more flexible increments. For example, a large node operator with 2048 ETH can consolidate 64 validator sets into one, while a solo staker with a 45 ETH balance only has to dedicate resources to one validator set.\n\nAs of March 2024, the Ethereum network has over 950,000 validator sets. Theoretically, this means the network is truly decentralized. However, while the network recognizes each validator as a unique entity, a party can run several validators on the same device.\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum effective balance limit to allow consolidation and accurately reflect the network\u2019s decentralization levels.\n\nHow Does EIP-7251 Work?\n\nEIP-7251 proposes to reduce the number of validators while maintaining high economic security on the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-7251 relies on four key features that make it work:\n\nCreating a minimum balance and increasing the maximum balance: EIP-7251 proposes creating a minimum activation balance of 32 ETH and increasing the maximum effective balance from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH.\n\nCombination of multiple validator sets: With the increased maximum limit, large node operators combine their validators without cycling through the exit and activation queues. This helps speed up the staking process while decreasing costs due to the in-protocol consolidation.\n\nAdding execution layer partial withdrawals: Execution layer messages trigger partial withdrawals in addition to full exits. For example, a validator with 200 ETH staked can remove 50 ETH without exiting. This increases the flexibility of staking configurations, allowing validators to control the moment and amount they withdraw.\n\nCustom effective balance ceiling: EIP-7251 enables validators to customize the maximum amount that activates partial withdrawals.\n\nReasons For and Against MaxEB\n\nThere are several compelling reasons to make the case to increase the maximum effective balance:\n\nAddressing Consensus Layer Challenges\n\nUnder the current limits, the network experiences high withdrawal loads from exceeding the maximum effective balance. Additionally, the large validator sets strain the resources and cause network delays.\n\nConsequently, reducing the number of validators addresses this problem, especially as the network continues to scale.\n\nAllows for Future Upgrades\n\nUpgrades to the Ethereum network, as noted on the roadmap, such as single-slot finality and enshrined proposer-builder separation, rely on a low validator set. The consolidation helps lay the groundwork for the implementation of such upgrades.\n\nCompetitive Solo Staking\n\nWhile large node operators appear to be the key EIP-7251 beneficiaries, solo stakers also have something to gain. Individual stakers can stake flexible amounts of ETH and enjoy the compounding rewards.\n\nReduced Overhead Costs\n\nFor large node operators, the 32 ETH ceiling presents the logistical challenge of running thousands of validators on a single machine. EIP-7251 minimizes the hassle by reducing the number of validators. This also brings the operating cost down, which maximizes the returns.\n\nThere are several reasons against MaxEB:\n\nSlashing Risk\n\nA Proof of Stake (PoS) network such as Ethereum promotes economic security through slashing. Slashing involves partial or full destruction of a validator\u2019s staked assets if they are deemed responsible for actions that threaten the network\u2019s security. MaxEB raises the maximum limit a validator can stake, increasing their slashing risk.\n\nThe Ethereum community is aware of this risk and proposes modification of the slashing penalties. The idea is to introduce non-linear slashing mechanisms that will encourage consolidation.\n\nComplexity\n\nThe current ceiling of 32 ETH per validator makes it simple to consider different consensus aspects. Raising it to 2048 ETH may draw focus away from other critical areas. This may lead to a drop in the network\u2019s security levels.\n\nDecentralization\n\nAs of March 2024, there are over 950,000 validator sets on the Ethereum network. Consolidation under MaxEB will significantly reduce that number. Consequently, there might be an imbalance in committee influence. This goes against the principles of decentralization, as a malicious actor can potentially dominate a committee and execute a 51% attack.\n\nRegulatory Interference\n\nWith auto-compounding validator rewards possible after implementing EIP-7251, regulators may find grounds to argue that ETH is an interest-bearing security.\n\nCurrently, validators are considered service providers who earn rewards for securing the network. Implementing EIP-7251 will lead to more rewards for validators with a higher balance, which may offer regulators grounds to argue that being a validator is the equivalent of a savings account in a traditional bank.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEIP-7251 proposes significantly reducing the number of validators without making major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are key issues that the community needs to address to ensure its implementation doesn\u2019t affect the network negatively. The community has acknowledged challenges such as slashing concerns and has made proposals to address them. However, others, like regulatory concerns, have yet to be fully explored.\n\nOverall, EIP-7251 presents a pathway to an efficient Ethereum network, provided the community addresses all concerns before implementation."

        "title": "NFTs and the Environment: What You Need to Know - Investopedia",
        "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ordinals are assets that are tokenized using a blockchain. Because blockchains use energy, NFTs can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change through their production, exchange, and storage.\n\nLearn more about NFTs and ordinals, their environmental impacts, and steps users can take to be more aware.\n\nKey Takeaways Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may contribute to wasteful energy use and carbon output, depending on how they are produced.\n\nEthereum is the leading blockchain used to mint NFTs. It transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on Sept. 15, 2022. The transition, called The Merge, caused a significant reduction in NFT energy use.\n\n\n\nBlockchain developers and communities are working to find ways to lessen or eliminate the environmental impact NFTs have.\n\nUsers can lower their impact by choosing blockchains with less energy-intensive requirements.\n\n\n\nHow NFTs Impact the Environment\n\nNFTs are generally built on Ethereum or blockchains similar to it. Ordinals are similar to NFTs but created on the Bitcoin blockchain or blockchains like it.\n\nDepending on the programming and design of the blockchain on which these NFTs and ordinals reside, these transactions can consume significant amounts of energy.\n\n\n\nThis article uses \"NFT\" to refer to NFTs and ordinals for brevity.\n\nEnergy consumption occurs when an NFT is minted, bought, sold, and stored. Here's a look at each of these stages of the NFT lifecycle:\n\nNFT is minted : The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process.\n\n: The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process. NFT is listed : Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price.\n\n: Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price. NFT is sold/purchased : When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner.\n\n: When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner. Storage: The asset\u2014a file, image, and so on\u2014is stored off-chain, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS).\n\nMinting an NFT is a separate transaction on a blockchain, as is transferring ownership during a sale. All transactions use energy.\n\nNon-Transactional Energy Use\n\nNFTs also require storage, even if there isn't transaction activity. These tokenized assets are generally digital assets such as documents, images, and videos, all requiring digital space. Blockchains themselves are not equipped to store these assets, so only the tokens (alphanumeric sequences that are the result of hashed data) are stored on the blockchains. The assets are stored elsewhere, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). The IPFS was created as a decentralized and distributed storage system for platforms that need it, like blockchains.\n\nData storage requires energy. As the number of NFTs grows, the overall energy consumption and storage space of NFTs are likely to increase.\n\nElectronic Waste\n\nIn addition to energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste) is an issue. If a blockchain relies on mining, like Bitcoin does, hardware is continuously improved and upgraded.\n\nMining typically uses hardware such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems. This hardware can quickly become outdated\u2014it's also subject to 24-hour 100% usage, which wears electronic circuits out. Updating and replacing faulty equipment creates tons of e-waste.\n\nE-waste contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into the environment if improperly disposed of. Additionally, the processing of e-waste is energy-intensive and can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Hardware that isn't recycled ends up in landfills, releasing toxins into the environment.\n\nRecycling e-waste significantly lowers the energy consumption of manufacturing new electronic products by reducing the mining and processing of new raw materials, particularly precious metals.\n\nImproving the Sustainability of NFTs\n\nGiven the potential environmental impact of NFTs, there is a movement to develop more sustainable blockchain and NFT protocols. Additionally, artists, buyers, and sellers can choose to use NFT platforms and blockchains that use less energy. These would likely include less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms and, to a point, blockchains with hotspots in areas that use renewable energy sources.\n\nTo determine blockchain sustainability, you must inspect where nodes are located and determine the significant energy sources in those areas. For example, the Ethereum network has 2,900 nodes (the most) in the U.S., the energy generation of which is 79% from petroleum, natural gas, and coal. The U.S. also has about 1,600 reachable Bitcoin nodes. It's safe to say that platforms using a blockchain with a significant presence in the U.S. are not as energy efficient as they could be. However, Ethereum uses less energy, so in the U.S. it's a better choice.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nBlockchain mining and hardware recycling often rely on burning fossil fuels, leaving a significant environmental footprint. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy, offer eco-friendly alternatives to power these operations.\n\nSolar Energy : Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity.\n\n: Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity. Wind Energy : Wind turbines erected in windy areas can generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind.\n\n: Wind turbines erected in windy areas can generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind. Hydroelectric Energy : Hydroelectric power is taken from water sources, such as rivers or dams.\n\n: Hydroelectric power is taken from water sources, such as rivers or dams. Geothermal Energy : Geothermal power comes from active geothermal resources, such as volcanoes or hot springs.\n\n: Geothermal power comes from active geothermal resources, such as volcanoes or hot springs. Biomass Energy: Biomass energy consists of organic materials. Plants, crops, and agricultural waste can be burned to generate heat or converted into biofuels.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms\n\nShifting from Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism for Bitcoin and other mining-based blockchains, to more energy-efficient ones, such as Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, can significantly reduce the environmental impact NFTs have. PoS eliminates the competitive mining and reward process altogether.\n\nPoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW because PoS does not require miners to expend energy in a competition to solve a cryptographic problem. Instead, PoS uses a system called staking, where validators who have staked cryptocurrency\u2014basically locking it from being used\u2014on the network are randomly chosen to verify transactions and propose new blocks.\n\nEthereum is expected to consume about 5.36 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, while Bitcoin is expected to consume about 173.19 terawatt hours annually, more than Poland and Egypt.\n\nSome notable PoS blockchains include:\n\nEthereum : The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more. The NFT marketplace OpenSea is built on Ethereum.\n\n: The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more.

Cardano : Hosts some NFT marketplaces like Galaxy of Art.\n\n: Hosts some NFT marketplaces like Galaxy of Art. Tezos: The Tezos blockchain hosts several NFT marketplaces, such as Rarible, which operates an NFT marketplace and supports the artistic creation of NFTs.\n\nWhy Does an NFT Use So Much Energy? Non-fungible tokens use energy because they require a blockchain network to conduct work verifying them as transactions. More transactions require more energy.\n\nAre NFTs Harmful to the Environment? Creating, selling, and buying an NFT require energy and hardware use, which can lead to pollution or e-waste that would not otherwise be necessary if they did not exist.\n\nWhat Is the Carbon Footprint of an NFT? It is hard to determine what one NFT costs regarding carbon generation, but it's safe to say that they add to human activities' total carbon output.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNFTs leave a carbon footprint at every stage of their existence, but conscious choices and prioritizing eco-friendly practices in how they are created, traded, and stored can offset their potential impact on the environment.\n\nCryptocurrency developers can reduce NFT energy consumption by improving or switching to less energy-intensive blockchain consensus mechanisms. NFT minting and hosting platforms can use blockchains that don't require large amounts of energy.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
