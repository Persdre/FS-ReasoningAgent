        "content": "Justin Sun Announces Gas-Free Stablecoin Solution for Tron and Ethereum\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has announced his team's development of a gas-free stablecoin solution.

However, he did not provide specific details on how this mechanism would function.\n\nSun plans to integrate this innovative solution on the Tron blockchain by the fourth quarter of this year, and will \u201clater support Ethereum and all EVM-compatible public chains.\u201d Sun believes that this gas-free stablecoin could revolutionize the way companies offer stablecoin services, significantly boosting blockchain adoption. \"I believe that similar services will greatly facilitate large companies in deploying stablecoin services on the blockchain, elevating blockchain mass adoption to a new level,\" Sun posted.\n\nCurrently, Tron leads the market in peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers, consistently processing two to three times the volume of Ethereum, according to blockchain analytics firm Artemis. Tron hosts over $50 billion of Tether's $112 billion in value issued across multiple blockchains, based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nThis new solution could position Tron as a competitor to PayPal's PYUSD, which offers certain U.S.-based users the ability to make free cross-border payments. Additionally, Circle's USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum layer-2 Base via Coinbase Wallet also allows for free transfers, highlighting a growing trend towards cost-free stablecoin transactions."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that the current market correction is setting up Ethereum (ETH) for a parabolic surge at the end of the year.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 214,800 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum will likely consolidate between $4,000 and $2,800 in the coming months.\n\nThe trader shares a chart suggesting that Ethereum will witness a year-long parabolic rally starting in October that will eventually send ETH to a new all-time high at around $8,000.\n\n\u201cCapture this.\n\nETH.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $2,903, down over 4% on the day.\n\nLooking at Ethereum rival Solana (SOL), Inmortal believes that the large-cap altcoin is at risk of seeing much lower prices unless it can rally past $160 to develop a bullish higher high structure.\n\n\u201cBulls defending $120 level, taking no prisoners. I don\u2019t want to see the bouncing ball structure develop. A higher high would be key.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading at $130, down over 8% on the day.\n\nAs for the meme token Floki (FLOKI), the trader thinks that the altcoin is flashing a bullish setup similar to its April 2024 price action when it briefly traded below support at $0.00016 before rallying.\n\n\u201cFLOKI about to print the famous deviation + retest structure.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000135, down over 10% in the past day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Tether USDT\u2019s 24-hour trading volume exceeds the combined total of the following five digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nReflecting on Tether\u2019s dominance in trading volume provides insight into market liquidity. As CryptoSlate data indicates, Tether (USDT) maintains a higher volume than Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and First Digital USD (FDUSD), pointing to its significant presence in the market. Specifically, Tether recorded a 24-hour volume of over $55 billion, far surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s $28 billion and Ethereum\u2019s $15 billion.\n\nWith a market cap of over $112 billion, the trading patterns also show that Tether\u2019s volume has consistently been robust throughout 2024, peaking at $130 billion on March 16. Tether\u2019s stability and frequent use in trading pairs make it a preferred choice for traders seeking to hedge against volatility.\n\nThese volume statistics reflect broader market trends as Tether provides liquidity and stability. Tether regularly achieves daily trading volumes exceeding $25 billion, reinforcing its status as a key liquidity provider in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nPer Glassnode data, throughout 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen around $4 \u2013 $8 billion per day, far below Tether\u2019s volumes.\n\nThe high trading volume of Tether compared to other major digital assets illustrates its integral role in daily trading activities and the broader market strategy that traders and institutions employ. This continuous high-volume trading signifies trust and reliance on Tether\u2019s stability and accessibility, making it indispensable for efficient market functioning.\n\nWhile Tether has historically faced recounted challenges regarding its reserves and use in illicit activities, these volumes showcase its resilience in combating these claims. Tether\u2019s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently told CryptoSlate that Tether is currently over-collateralized, with the firm\u2019s profits being put back into reserves to strengthen its stability.\n\nFurther, Ardoino commented how Senator Warren\u2019s discouragement of accounting firms from engaging with Tether had hindered its ability to use one of the US\u2019s top four accountants for audits. The CEO claimed that Tether is continuously seeking to hire one of the leading companies but has almost given up on it happening any time soon, regardless of their efforts to do so.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "STAMFORD, Conn., July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments\u00ae, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager*, offering more than 20 crypto investment products, today announced that it has set a record date of July 18, 2024 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d) for the initial creation and distribution of shares of Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (the \u201cETH Trust\u201d) to shareholders of Grayscale Ethereum Trust (Ticker: ETHE) (\u201cETHE\u201d) (referred to as the \u201cInitial Distribution\u201d). Grayscale intends to list the ETH Trust on NYSE Arca, subject to required regulatory approvals, under the ticker symbol \u201cETH.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs part of the contemplated Initial Distribution, each holder of shares (the \u201cETHE Shares\u201d) of ETHE as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive shares (the \u201cETH Shares\u201d) of the ETH Trust, a Delaware statutory trust sponsored by Grayscale, as described in a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2024 and most recently amended on July 8, 2024 (the \u201cPreliminary Information Statement\u201d). ETHE will also file a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or after the Record Date.\n\nIn the Initial Distribution, ETHE will contribute 10% of the Ether that it holds as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date to the ETH Trust, and each holder of ETHE Shares as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive ETH Shares pro rata based on a 1:1 ratio, such that for each one (1) ETHE Share held by an ETHE shareholder as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date, such ETHE shareholder will be entitled to receive one (1) ETH Share on the Distribution Date, as described below and in the Preliminary Information Statement. ETHE shareholders will not need to pay any consideration, exchange or surrender existing ETHE Shares, or take any other action to receive ETH Shares.\n\nRecord Date July 18, 2024 Ratio of ETHE Shares: ETH\n\nShares 1:1 % of ETHE contributed to the\n\nETH Trust 10% Distribution Date Subject to conditions stated\n\nbelow\n\nImportantly, both the launch of the ETH Trust and the Initial Distribution of ETH Shares to ETHE shareholders are subject to regulatory review and customary conditions. The \u201cDistribution Date\u201d will be the first date following the Record Date on which the conditions to the Initial Distribution have been satisfied, including (i) the filing and effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form 8-A to register the ETH Shares under the Exchange Act, (ii) the effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-278878) under the Securities Act, and (iii) the ETH Shares having been approved for listing on NYSE Arca. The Distribution Date will be no sooner than July 19, 2024, and, as a result of such conditions not having been satisfied as of the date hereof, no assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nSubject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE (including with respect to the qualification of both ETHE and the ETH Trust as grantor trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares), it is expected that neither ETHE nor any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. Accordingly, it is expected that neither ETHE\u2019s contribution of Ether to the ETH Trust nor ETHE\u2019s distribution of shares in the ETH Trust to ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be reported to any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares (or to any intermediary holding ETHE Shares) as giving rise to income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or proceeds.\n\nFrom and after July 18, 2024 (the \u201cEx-Distribution Date\u201d), ETHE Shares will trade without the right to receive ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution. There is not expected to be a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d market for the ETH Shares prior to the Distribution Date. Following the Initial Distribution, ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on July 18, 2024 will automatically see both ETHE Shares and ETH Shares in their portfolios or investment accounts on the Distribution Date.\n\nThe Grayscale team will communicate additional updates, as applicable, including the anticipated Distribution Date, any material updates regarding pending regulatory approval and customary conditions, and the announcement of Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust\u2019s first day of trading on NYSE Arca.\n\n*By AUM as of 6/28/2024\n\nNO OFFER OR SOLICITATION\n\nThis communication is for informational purposes, solely in your capacity as a shareholder of ETHE, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. No shareholder approval of the Initial Distribution is required by applicable law, and we are not seeking ETHE shareholder approval.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain of the statements contained herein may be statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on Grayscale\u2019s views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Grayscale assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained herein and you should not place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

No assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVICE\n\nThis communication is not intended as, and does not constitute, tax advice. As further discussed in the section of the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Initial Distribution,\u201d the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution are complex, subject to uncertainty in certain respects and may be affected by circumstances specific to a beneficial owner of ETHE Shares. Any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares who receives ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding ETHE Shares or ETH Shares, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares. Please refer to the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of the ETH Shares.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT\n\nA definitive information statement on Schedule 14C will be furnished to ETHE shareholders on or after the Record Date for the purpose of informing ETHE shareholders of the Initial Distribution, in substantial compliance with Regulation 14C of the Exchange Act. The information statement will describe the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, risks of owning shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and other details regarding the Initial Distribution, and will be made available on our website at www.grayscale.com/documents#regulatoryfilings.

An investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of total loss associated with an investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Ether, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the shares of each trust could lose all or substantially all of their value. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset. Digital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset. Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust relate directly to the value of the underlying digital asset, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.\n\nA registration statement related to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. An investment in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust cannot be made, nor money accepted, until the registration statement is effective.
