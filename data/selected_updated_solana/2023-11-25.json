        "content": "Solana monthly volume exceeds $6 billion, supporting ongoing SOL price rally.\n\nCrypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa predicted a massive surge in SOL price in 2024.\n\nSOL price could retrace to sub-$50 level, before another leg up.\n\nSolana, one of the largest competitors of Ethereum, is currently experiencing a surge in its price. SOL rallied to $68.21, its highest level in 2023 and the altcoin is primed for further gains, according to a pseudonymous crypto analyst.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum whale activity could pave way for ETH price to hit new yearly highs\n\nSolana price hits 2023 peak in November\n\nSolana price is in an uptrend that started in mid-October 2023. The altcoin\u2019s price climbed steadily in the past month, hitting its 2023 peak of $68.21 on November 16, before commencing a correction.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL price is $58.07, the altcoin is trending sideways close to the $60 psychological level. The breakthrough past $60 was key to SOL price rallying to a yearly high. SOL price is above its three long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), 10, 50 and 200-day at $56.53, $43.25 and $29.51.\n\nIf SOL price sustains above the 10-day EMA, the altcoin is likely to continue its climb. A decline below the 10-day EMA could invalidate the bullish thesis for Solana.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart\n\nAnalyst predicts SOL price rally to three digits in 2024\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @AltcoinSherpa is bullish on SOL. The analyst evaluated the SOL price trend and commented that they expect the SOL price to correct and a sub-$50 entry would be ideal.\n\nAccording to @AltcoinSherpa, SOL price is likely to hit three digits in 2024, a massive surge in the Ethereum-alternative token."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of IOG and Cardano, billionaire Charles Hoskinson, who took part in the creation of Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and several other individuals, has commented on Buterin's recent ideas about how to improve the centralized Ethereum staking. Cardano founder's comment about Buterin's ideas was pretty sarcastic, though.\n\nButerin wants to redesign Ethereum staking, Hoskinson reacts\n\nIn a recent interview of Vitalik Buterin in Turkey, where he answered questions from the local community, he talked about the Ethereum road map. In particular, Buterin touched on the topic of Ethereum staking as he said that \"there is something to be done about staking centralization.\"\n\nIn particular, he mentioned current issues with multiple staking pools and \"solo staking being hard,\" summarizing that these issues and others about it are \"not really healthy.\" Buterin is considering introducing a redesign to the staking system on his blockchain. As one of the possible solutions here, the Ethereum frontman is considering the UTxO approach, which is based on unspent transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson's sarcastic reaction to that was, \"No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Buterin has spoken about the need to redesign the staking system of Ethereum. Earlier this year, Hoskinson and the Cardano army have several times criticized him for admitting certain inconveniences that the staking system adopted by Ethereum bears and slammed Buterin for considering introducing features that Cardano had implemented already to make ADA staking easier for its users.\n\nWhales stocking up on ETH in big way\n\nAccording to prominent whale transactions tracking platform Whale Alert, over the past 30 hours, several massive chunks of Ethereum have been withdrawn from three major crypto exchanges: Bitfinex, Binance and Coincheck.\n\nAnonymous whales have removed 50,000 ETH, 15,000 and 33,330 ETH from these platforms to their cold wallets, respectively. These lumps of Ethereum are evaluated at a massive $105,740,324, $31,138,359 and $68,795,390.\n\nBesides, another anonymous wallet withdrew 1,498 ETH worth $3.13 million earlier today from Binance, while ETH traded at $2,089. Per @OnchainDataNerd blockchain sleuth account, within the past couple of days, this whale has accumulated 4,770 ETH in total, paying $2,079 per coin on average.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that currently, whales are going on a big Ethereum buying spree. He shared a chart showing that within the last nine days, big ETH holders have been accumulating large amounts of ETH for the first time in the past nine months. He considers this to be a bullish signal for the second-largest crypto."

        "title": "BLAST: Ethereum\u2019s new layer-2 with a planned crypto airdrop - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we introduce a new layer-2 of Ethereum that is scheduled to release an airdrop in May 2024: we are talking about Blast, an infrastructure that looks to be the first to offer native yield for crypto such as ETH and stablecoin.\n\nTo date, the chain has not yet been launched and it is, in fact, impossible to bridging funds within it.\n\nHowever, we can deposit ETH in a multi-signature wallet that will, on the one hand, guarantee us a yield from here to the coming months, and on the other hand, give us the opportunity to participate in airdrop.\n\nParadigm and Standard Crypto, two well-known investment signatures in the crypto world, have funded the project with $20 million given its potential that could completely revolutionize the Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what it is all about and find out how to get airdrop.\n\nBLAST: Ethereum\u2019s first layer-2 offering native yield of ETH and stablecoin\n\nBlast is a new layer-2 ZK from Ethereum of the optimistic rollup type, which promises its users yields that beat dollar inflation simply by holding tokens on the crypto network, as well as offering an airdrop-style rewards campaign.\n\nIn detail, Blast presents itself as the first compatible EVM infrastructure capable of granting native ETH and stablecoin yields.\n\nBasically, those who hold a balance of these cryptos within the L2 passively get interest that is generated by going to Lido staking and MakerDAO, in a fully automated way and without the need for external actions.\n\nIt should also be noted that the project team has planned to donate the entire proceeds of fees recorded on the chain to all decentralized application developers, so as to incentivize the development of successful products.\n\nAt this time the chain is still under development, with the mainnet being launched in February and airdrops being unlocked about 2 months later.\n\nFor now, one cannot in fact bridging crypto within it but only deposit ETH and other stables at a multi-signature wallet that is a real safe for early adopters of the project.\n\nThere appears to be no testnet or mainnet readiness phases.\n\nWell-known crypto investment signatures Paradigm and Standard Crypto have been personally present at Blast\u2019s funding, leading a $20 million round.\n\nOther companies and private entities participated in the development of the project: these include names such as eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, and Jeff Lo.\n\nGiven the presence of major players on this list, who have funded infrastructure that has released voluminous airdrops in the past, we expect the same to happen for Blast.\n\nOn the other hand, the names of the team for the new rollup are not yet known: all we know is that they come from prestigious institutions such as the FAANG, Yale, MIT, Nanyang Technological University, Seoul National University, and that they have worked for some popular web3 and DeFi protocols particularly active on Ethereum and Solana.\n\nThe premise for Blast seems to be respectable: given the backgound of the project and the next-generation architecture of the chain we could easily see this layer-2 compete with the major players in the cryptographic industry in the coming years.\n\nLet us not forget, however, that to date Blast has created NOTHING yet: being too optimistic about a premature product could turn out to be a completely wrong approach such that it leads to an overstated interpretation of reality.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nHow to participate in BLAST\u2019s crypto airdrop\n\nTo participate in Blast\u2019s crypto airdrop, the first thing to do is to retrieve an invitation code because access to the platform in its \u201cearly access\u201d phase is limited.\n\nThe easiest way to find one is to search for it on X by selecting the keywords \u201cBlast code\u201d in the search bar and scrolling through the various user posts and browsing through the comments.\n\nThere are many invitation codes available because to maximize airdrop, the community tries to invite as many users as possible to join their \u201cteam.\u201d\n\nOnce we get a valid code, all we have to do is deposit ETH, stETH or stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, USDT.\n\nBe careful because these funds will remain locked until February 2024, at which time the Blast mainnet will be realized.\n\nIn return we will get an annualized yield of about 4-5%, as well as points that will entitle us to collect airdrop.\n\nThe rewards program is organized in the same style as Friend.Tech, which includes gamified elements within it to provide a \u201cfun\u201d investment experience.\n\nIf you plan to lock your funds into Blast to participate in the airdrop, the advice is to deposit crypto worth at least $1,000.\n\nIn just 48 hours since its launch, this platform has raised about $230 million from a total of more than 37,000 users. Understand for yourself that the competition here is very high, hence allocating a few hundred dollars to the project may not bring the desired results.\n\nThen consider that just for fees on Ethereum we will spend a minimum of $15-20 between deposit and withdrawal.\n\nImmediately after making your first deposit you can start sharing your invitation code within the network of contacts you are part of (before depositing you do not get an invitation code).\n\nThe more crypto deposited by individuals who sign up with your code, the more points you can get and consequently the larger the final airdrop.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, share codes initially only with those you know have the financial readiness to deposit substantial amounts of ETH or stablecoin ( codes only limited at first).\n\nAs you move forward with your score you will reach a level where you can share your code endlessly, and hence only at that point will it become a wise idea to spam it everywhere on all existing social media.\n\nTo get to that point your team (you and everyone you invited) will have to deposit at least 20 ETH. You can view your progress through a dedicated airdrop leaderboard.\n\nThe logic of the invitations follows somewhat the same ponzinomics concepts typical of projects that incentivize sharing and engagement among communities.\n\nBlur and other projects also exhibit similar lineaments, where the greater the contribution of your lines the greater your personal gain.\n\nTo be honest, this system does not represent the absolute best system for launching an airdrop and may prove inconvenient for some if you are not part of a close crypto degen community.\n\nAlso, the fact that a multi-signature wallet with 3 out of 5 signatures needed to approve transactions is handling the treasury of deposits does not reassure and still raises many questions about what to do.\n\nIn any case, it is worth mentioning that as backers on Blast there are renowned names who have collaborated on other projects in the past that have released very high value airdrops, sometimes even exceeding $10,000.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that blocking one\u2019s funds for Blast airdrop presents its own not insignificant risks, but at the same time the whole thing could turn out to be extremely profitable in the future."
