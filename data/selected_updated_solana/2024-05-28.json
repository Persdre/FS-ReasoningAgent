        "title": "Floki, Dogwifhat, and Pepe lead memecoin rally alongside Ethereum ETF approvals - Fortune",
        "content": "So-called memecoins have been rallying over the past week\u2014and among the five cryptocurrencies to gain the most are four Solana-based tokens. Floki leads the way (up 35%), followed by dogwifhat (32%), Pepe (27%), and Bonk (22%), according to CoinGecko data as of Tuesday morning. Bonk reached highs of $0.00004387, missing its all-time high of $0.00004547 in March by a razor-thin edge.\n\nThe price surges overlap with the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lighting eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds, with firms such as BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity among the filers. Memecoins, considered to be the highest risk and highest reward part of the crypto industry, often witness notable price swings during a pro-crypto news cycle. By contrast, Ether has climbed a modest 2% since Thursday\u2019s approvals, trading at $3,847 on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ETF approvals have \u201cpeople bullish on the far fringes of the coin space,\u201d Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University, told Fortune.\n\nIndeed, Google Trends data shows that search interest for \u201cEthereum\u201d over the past 12 months is near all-time highs, and memecoins are \u201cheavily driven\u201d by this kind of market attention, says Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that as money flows into the ecosystem through ETFs, it often trickles down to these smaller projects,\u201d Jonathan Bixby, chairman of Phoenix Digital Assets, told Fortune. Memecoins have surged recently because of their \u201csmall caps\u201d compared with those of other cryptocurrencies, he says.\n\nMemecoins occupy just a fraction of the market capitalization of major currencies: Floki boasts a market cap of just $2.9 billion, compared with Ethereum\u2019s $460 billion, according to CoinGecko data. In other words, Bixby suggests that investors of fringe coins could be anticipating a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats effect once the ETFs begin trading.\n\nHowever, Matt Ballensweig, managing director at BitGo, told Fortune that he doesn\u2019t attribute the recent growth for some memecoins to the ETF approvals or a single event, but it is \u201ca sign that momentum across other layer 1s (such as Solana) continues to remain strong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSolana has basically solidified itself as the chain with the most \u2018speculative fun\u2019 as traders continue to gamble on memecoins on decentralized exchanges.\u201d\n\nOne reason why Ether has shown minimal price movements since Thursday is likely because, so far, the SEC has approved only the 19b-4 forms. These initial filings submitted by soon-to-be issuers allow the securities to be listed on exchanges. But for trading of the financial instruments to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, previously told Fortune. He estimated the forms would take about two weeks to be approved."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Taking a Breather Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three megacap tokens are seeing significant selling pressure to kick off the short week.\n\nAs we kick off a short week, investors in a range of speculative assets are seeing selling pressure build. Of course, there are plenty of macro reasons for this trepidation. Some rather important inflation readings are due later this week, which could impact everything from growth stocks to commodities to cryptocurrencies. Everything is tied to interest rates these days.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC -0.95%), Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.81%) are among the megacap tokens seeing declines today. Over the past 24 hours, these three top tokens have slumped 3.8%, 3.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving today's price action in these top tokens.\n\nEnthusiasm over key catalysts wears off\n\nInvestors in these three megacap tokens have certainly had quite the run over the past few weeks, and really since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin started the party off with the approval of a dozen spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, which conjured up some significant demand for its token. In combination with a halving event, which saw the amount of newly minted Bitcoin slashed in half, this created a supply-and-demand dynamic investors liked.\n\nEthereum recently saw similar catalysts take hold, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs last week as well. Additionally, previous upgrades have resulted in Ethereum becoming less inflationary, and depending on the day, deflationary based on token burn metrics relative to transaction volumes.\n\nAs a more speculative asset, Dogecoin has ridden market momentum higher. But with these catalysts now seemingly in the rearview mirror (it's really amazing how quickly the market adjusts to news, particularly in this space), some investors may be looking to sell into this news and wait patiently for another catalyst to take hold. A similar \"sell the news\" effect took place immediately following the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nUntil the next catalyst takes hold, investors appear to be on pause for the next reason to bet big on this sector (and these three tokens by default).\n\nA pause in the rally, or a reversal?\n\nNow, the question is whether this recent dip is a sign of more downside to come, or if it's simply a consolidation period before the next move higher. Earlier this month, a speculative wave hit the crypto sector, driving everything from meme tokens like Dogecoin to large-cap cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum higher. But since then, it appears the broader crypto market is awaiting the next catalyst on the horizon.\n\nThere is certainly a tremendous amount of innovation and technological movement happening underneath the surface in the crypto realm. I wouldn't be surprised to see headlines pop up for any of these three tokens that have the ability to move the market higher, with all three benefiting from positive news. I just don't know what the catalyst will be, or when positive momentum can be expected to build again. For now, I'm happily watching this price action from the sidelines."

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin are holding us back - Blockworks",
        "content": "The year is 2024, and the fast-paced realm of crypto shows no signs of slowing. Innovation is the name of the game, and monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin still reign supreme.\n\nBut as someone who\u2019s been knee-deep in the trenches of blockchain development, I can\u2019t help but wonder if these behemoths are really cutting it anymore. Herein lies my thesis:\n\nModular blockchains are the disruptors poised to revolutionize scalability and creativity towards the next Cambrian explosion of Web3 products as we know them.\n\nAs engineers and product developers, it\u2019s time to embrace specialized tools for specialized tasks and leave the one-size-fits-all approach behind. This isn\u2019t to say that prior layer-1s haven\u2019t paved the way for some incredible innovations, but attempting to scale legacy layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin has proven inefficient and counterproductive. They\u2019re dragging us down, like trying to sprint through quicksand.\n\nBlockchain researchers have grappled with the challenge of creating the optimal system for years. Many architectures attempted to accommodate all users on a single chain or a tightly coupled group of chains. Yet, scaling such systems for billions of users is complex and limited. We\u2019ve thrown everything and the kitchen sink at it with solutions like sharding and layer-2 blockchains to provide additional scaling methods.\n\nDespite this, most efforts still fall somewhat short in addressing all fundamental scalability issues. As a result of these failings, and perhaps in response to them, modular blockchains are strutting onto the scene as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Prime yourself and think, \u201cmore legos.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of modular blockchains\n\nThink of modular blockchains like the Swiss Army Knife of blockchain development.\n\nThese chains break down the blockchain into modular components, specializing in specific tasks at the core of a blockchain\u2019s architecture: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability. By distributing tasks across multiple specialized layers, modular blockchains can, in theory, achieve greater scalability, customizability and security at a faster pace. When you distribute the workload like that, magic happens \u2014 so why waddle about in intellectual exercises of scaling bloated layer-1s?\n\nAt the core of modular blockchain architecture lies a layered approach that\u2019s as elegant as it is efficient. The old heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the foundational layer of the crypto economy and hold down the fort with their robust security and stability. Meanwhile, layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains provide scalability without compromising the security of the base layer. Lastly, layer-3 protocols offer specialized environments tailored to specific development needs.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ethereum is too hard to use\n\nOne of the first projects to propose modular blockchain development is the Celestia network. Celestia currently functions by separating execution from consensus and implementing data availability sampling (DAS) as a core feature.\n\nModular blockchains\u2019 adroit-like qualities for specific engineering challenges translate into a targeted effectiveness to service specific industry niches.\n\nTo illustrate, GameSwift, a modular blockchain project, is currently working to facilitate the development of games hosted on-chain. Their goal is to create a network of applications that will help avoid gamers\u2019 in-game purchases or earned assets being stored in a central server and consequently hacked. To highlight the relevance of this innovation, global gaming audiences spent approximately $54 billion on additional in-game content in 2020.\n\nThe shape of things to come\n\nModular projects are already pushing boundaries and redefining what\u2019s possible in the blockchain space. Hybrid optimistic and zero-knowledge solutions are on the horizon, promising even greater scalability and security, as is the application of sharding, incentivized verification and parallelized VMs (virtual machines) on the execution layer of a chain.\n\nWith layer-1s feeling the heat, Ethereum devs released plans for a unified settlement and data availability layer: danksharding, a promising development, and a term I can\u2019t say aloud without curling my lips. But development and on-time delivery for these monolithic chains\u2019 upgrades have been historically slow and unmet.\n\nBy accepting monolithic chains as what might be holding us back, modular architectures offer a glimmer of hope. We are transitioning from monolithic blockchains and siloed consensus layers to modular, application-specific chains with shared consensus layers.\n\nWhile challenges remain in standardizing cross-chain communication and ensuring decentralization at each level, the potential benefits of modular blockchains are too compelling to ignore. These blockchains have the potential, and are already being applied, to impact industries like supply chain management, real estate (property transactions), digital identity verification, energy grid management and even healthcare data management.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a die-hard Bitcoin maximalist or an Ethereum enthusiast, one thing\u2019s for sure: In a modular future, users emerge as the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\nNiko Hosn, CTO of ZTX and founder of RareMint, is an expert in Web3 gaming and blockchain development.
