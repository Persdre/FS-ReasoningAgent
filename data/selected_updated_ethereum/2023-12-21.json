According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading.

BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The PBS Foundation is opening applications for an initial $1 million in grants for research and development on Ethereum proposer-builder separation.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s pilot phase drew support from Coinbase, Consensys, Fenbushi Capital, Flashbots, Paradigm, the Uniswap Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nGrants will be disbursed by a council. The council includes representatives from Blocknative, Consensys, the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots, among others. The foundation\u2019s grant lead is Eugene Leventhal from the research group Metagov.\n\nRead more: For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck\n\nFirst proposed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, proposer-builder separation (PBS) is the concept of separating proposers \u2014 which submit transaction bundles to validators on a blockchain \u2014 and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nPBS represents an attempt at decentralization, as the combination of proposing and building gives well-heeled centralized mining pools a competitive advantage.\n\nPBS first went into effect after Ethereum\u2019s Merge to proof-of-stake. Now, the PBS Foundation aims to promote research and infrastructure to address some of the challenges the concept currently faces.\n\nNotably, MEV-boost relays have become centralized since the Merge. Relayers operate between block builders and validators on maximal extractable value (MEV) boosted transactions, selecting blocks with the highest possible fees. Roughly 90% of transactions in the last 500 epochs, or roughly two days, made use of MEV-boost. Of MEV-boost transactions in the past 24 hours, roughly 97% have been handled by five relayers, according to relayscan.\n\nBlocknative, once among those top relayers, discontinued its service in September, citing economic viability concerns. Relayers do not currently collect fees. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs a large relayer, has advocated fee structures outside of public goods funding to incentivize more relayers to join the fray.\n\nA spokesperson for the PBS Foundation said the grant funding could be used to fund relayers, with a particular emphasis on those who introduce novel designs for relaying.\n\nThe funding will also be focused on community and educational materials, data transparency on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and blocks, and research on how PBS can be improved \u2014 or even enshrined \u2014 on both the primary network and on layer-2 networks.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
