        "content": "Taiko says it provides an \"Ethereum-equivalent ZK rollup\" \u2013 described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a 2022 post as the holy grail of technological achievement for these scaling networks. A \"rollup\" is a term for a layer-2 chain, which acts like an auxiliary network to provide faster and cheaper transactions that can then be settled to a main or \"base\" blockchain like Ethereum. The \"ZK\" refers to \"zero-knowledge\" cryptography, a hot trend in blockchain design."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s MVRV ratio now sits above 100%.\n\nThis marks its highest level since April 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has climbed to its highest point since April 2022, data from Santiment revealed.\n\nThe MVRV ratio assesses whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. It does this by comparing the current market value of an asset to the average price at which all units were last moved on the blockchain.\n\nWhen it increases, it suggests that the current market value of an asset is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was 103.11%, having risen by 145% since 25th January, per Santiment\u2019s data. This rally coincides with the recent surge in ETH\u2019s price, which recently surpassed the $3,400 mark, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith an MVRV ratio of 103%, ETH\u2019s current market price is 1.03 times higher than the average price at which all ETH units were last moved on the blockchain. Therefore, on average, most coin holders would realize at least 100% profit on their investments if they sold now.\n\nNo cause for alarm\n\nWhile readings from ETH\u2019s Bollinger Bands indicator observed on a single-day chart revealed that ETH\u2019s price remained prone to swings, other key indicators showed that bullish sentiments exceeded bearish activity.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Awesome Oscillator returned green upward-facing bars at press time. This indicator measures market momentum by comparing its short-term and long-term moving averages.\n\nWhen it returns only green bars, it indicates that the short-term moving average is rising faster than the long-term moving average. This suggests that the bullish sentiment is strong and gaining momentum.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line (blue) rested solidly above the trend (orange) and the zero lines as of this writing.\n\nWhen readings from this indicator show the MACD and trend lines above zero (as is the case here), it suggests that bullish momentum is prevailing in the market.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nOn the coin\u2019s derivatives market, futures open interest totaled $11.38 billion as of this writing. The last time ETH\u2019s futures open interest was that high was in December 2021, per data from Coinglass.\n\nWith the growth in the coin\u2019s positive funding rates across exchanges, futures traders continue to place bets in favor of a price rally."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJust two days after the launch of Blast, an Ethereum layer-2 network from the founder of dominant NFT marketplace Blur, hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed into newly created protocols living on the network\u2014and buzz is growing about several other projects emerging in the ecosystem.\n\nThe network already boasts a total value locked (TVL) north of $2.4 billion, according to the Blast website. Many users have flocked to Blast in order to capitalize on future airdrops that may reward early users of applications and protocols within the network.\n\nAlready, clear winners have emerged, with some DeFi protocols receiving huge sums of investment, and other games and tokens garnering sizable attention on social media. Here\u2019s a glance at some of the projects dominating Blast in its first days.\n\nOrbit Protocol\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith a TVL of over $200 million, Orbit is currently the hottest DeFi protocol built within the Blast ecosystem. The protocol allows users to lend and borrow assets while remaining within Blast, and incentivizes users by letting them earn liquid rewards in the process. It also boasts its own native token, ORBIT.\n\nOrbit lending/borrowing and the $ORBIT token are now both live on @Blast_L2 mainnet\ud83e\udd6e\ud83d\ude80 Heres how you can skip the endless points by earning liquid $ORBIT yield and owning your Blast allocation \ud83e\uddf5 Get started:https://t.co/Aikku3Tr77 pic.twitter.com/Xu5bpP3vl0 \u2014 Orbit Protocol \ud83e\udd6e (@OrbitLending) March 1, 2024\n\nSpacebar\n\nSpacebar, which refers to itself as an \u201con-chain playground,\u201d is a gamified platform on which users are encouraged to interact and engage with each other to earn various types of points. Users connect their profile picture (PFP) NFTs to the ecosystem to create an avatar, and also mint new NFTs within the Spacebar game world.\n\nSpacebar also incentivizes users to stake ETH within the platform to earn additional rewards. A major pull to the project appears to be the promise of an upcoming airdrop to early and active participants.\n\nDegens, we are live on @Blast_L2 with Phase 1 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80 If you're looking for the best playground to play and farm, you found your home. \ud83c\udfe1 In Phase 1, you can:\n\n- Choose a PFP NFT as your digital identity on Spacebar.\n\n- Mint a free Blast Protoship NFT.\n\n- Stake $ETH.\n\n- Refer friends.\n\n-\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6I1koiIpLX \u2014 Spacebar \ud83d\ude80 (@spacebarxyz) February 29, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPac Finance\n\nThe first hybrid lending protocol to launch on Blast, Pac Finance facilitates both peer to peer loans, and peer to pool loans on the Blast network. The project includes features like self-repaying loans, one-click leverage trading, and instant lending loops. The platform is currently pledging quantities of Blast\u2019s yet-to-launch native token, which it received after winning the blockchain\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d app development competition, to early adopters.\n\nPacMoon\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u201ccommunity meme coin\u201d of the Blast ecosystem, PacMoon is a decidedly independent token project that took off this week to much fanfare. The token, PAC, has yet to launch\u2014it will via airdrop at some point \u201csoon,\u201d according to the project\u2019s team. But in the meantime, it has generated a frenzy on Twitter, where posts about the coin noticed by the PacMoon team are purportedly being rewarded with PAC allocations.\n\n1. Create content about PacMoon If we like or rt your post, you get $PAC. A rt will get you more $PAC than a like. You can stack likes and rts for more $PAC. \u2014 PACMOON (@pacmoon_) February 29, 2024\n\nZerolend\n\nAnother lending market on Blast, Zerolend incentivizes users to borrow and lend a range of tokens in exchange for rewards in ETH, BLAST, and ZERO, the protocol\u2019s native token. Unlike Orbit Protocol and Pac Finance, Zerolend already exists on two other blockchains: Manta and zkSync Era.\n\nDistrictOne\n\nDistrictOne is a gamified, incentivized group messaging platform built on Blast. By liking messages and engaging with posts, DistrictOne users can collectively earn rewards and compete for jackpots. A key element of the ecosystem are \u201cgems,\u201d which are rewarded to users for high engagement, and earn them spots in weekly and ongoing airdrops.\n\n3. \ud83c\udfae Gamified Spaces\n\nD1 transforms group interactions into thrilling rallies with jackpots.

It's all about community power and shared success. pic.twitter.com/S6WCqCqMJe \u2014 DistrictOne (@DistrictOneIO) February 15, 2024\n\nJuice Finance\n\nJuice Finance is a protocol that enables levered cross-margin trading. Users can yield farm and spot trade on other Blast protocols through Juice, and in the process, lenders and borrowers can earn various rewards. Holders of certain Ethereum NFT projects, including Pudgy Penguins, Wassies, CryptoPunks, Azuki, DeGods, and RektGuy, are automatically eligible to claim the platform\u2019s native Juice points. At writing, Juice has a TVL of nearly $35 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Time is Now.
