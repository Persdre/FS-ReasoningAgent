        "content": "It may sound counter-intuitive that a decentralized network can generate a profit, but that is exactly what Ethereum has done so far this year.\n\nAccording to an April 18 Token Terminal report, the Ethereum blockchain generated a $369 million profit in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIf this level of profit is sustained, the blockchain could generate around $1.5 billion for the year.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: The Ethereum blockchain generated a $369.08M profit in Q1 \u201824. Wait, what?! How can a *blockchain* like @ethereum be profitable? Let\u2019s go through Ethereum\u2019s business model step-by-step: 1. Fees. All users on the Ethereum blockchain pay transaction fees in ETH\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gHAoNbRf48 \u2014 Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) April 18, 2024\n\nEthereum Blockchain Profitable\n\nToken Terminal explained that Ethereum\u2019s revenue model is based on network fees, which are the gas users pay for making transactions. Gas costs spiked in early March but have now fallen back to yearly lows.\n\nMoreover, a portion of the ETH is burned and removed from circulation for every transaction. This accrues to the economic benefit of existing ETH holders since issuance becomes deflationary during times of high demand.\n\nThere are also \u2018expenses,\u2019 which is the issuance of new ETH to the network\u2019s validators and stakers as an additional economic reward.\n\n\u201cThe difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders,\u201d it explained.\n\nCrypto investor and Etherean Ryan Sean Adams said that Ethereum wasn\u2019t like other blockchains. Over the past 18 months, Ethereum generated almost $1 billion in earnings, he added.\n\n\u201cThis puts Ethereum in the top 20 entities globally in terms of buyback yield at 0.23%. Ethereum is only 9 years old. ETH should be over $10k based on this alone.\u201d\n\nNo, ethereum isn\u2019t like the other chains. Ethereum is profitable. Over the past 18 months Ethereum generationed almost $1 billion in earnings. These earnings were distributed in a permanent token buy-back program called \u201cthe burn\u201d. This puts Ethereum in the top 20 entities\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZaGn3C6XVS \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS \u2013 rsa.eth \ud83e\udd84 (@RyanSAdams) April 18, 2024\n\nOn April 19, venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz told his 98,000 X followers that Ethereum \u201cwas the most profitable software company in Q1 2024.\u201d\n\nEthereum generated $370 million in profit on $825 million in revenue for about a 45% net income margin, he added.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum were to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, it would top the net income margin (%) charts, with Microsoft, Adobe and Veeva thereafter.\u201d\n\nETH Price Slides\n\nNevertheless, ETH markets were getting no love last night, with the asset dropping below $3,000 for the first time in two months.\n\nHowever, the trend started to change in the following hours, and ETH, alongside the rest of the market, bounced off to about $3,100 as of now.\n\nStill, the asset has now retreated almost 25% from its 2024 peak and remains down 38% from its 2021 all-time high."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape constantly evolves, investors and market observers are closely monitoring several key developments that could shape the sector's future. Among these are Bitcoin's upcoming halving event, Ethereum's current price fluctuations due to significant whale activity, and the rise of new players like Furrever Token (FURR), which seeks to carve out a niche with its unique approach and potential high returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Cautions Against Expecting a Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving Event\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community braces for this year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, scheduled around April 19-20, JPMorgan has issued a less than optimistic forecast. Contrary to the significant price surges that followed previous halvings, the banking giant predicts that Bitcoin might not only fail to rally but could potentially see a decline in value.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin halvings have been pivotal moments that typically led to bullish market behavior. The process involves halving the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This mechanism serves as a counter to inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, such events have boosted the cryptocurrency's market price significantly within a year of occurrence. For instance, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin's price increased from $12 to $135 over the next 300 days.\n\nHowever, this year's scenario presents a unique backdrop. According to JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, the current market conditions are \"overbought\". Bitcoin's price, hovering around $61,200, is well above the $45,000 mark when adjusted for volatility in comparison with gold. This elevated baseline, combined with the peak price reached a month before the halving\u2014a first in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2014suggests a different outcome might be unfolding this time around.\n\nAdding to the cautious outlook, Goldman Sachs has also advised prudence. The firm highlighted the unpredictable macroeconomic factors currently at play, which could influence Bitcoin's performance differently compared to past cycles. Despite previous patterns of price appreciation post-halving, Goldman Sachs warns against assuming similar outcomes this year, given the distinct global economic conditions.\n\nThis tempered expectation marks a significant shift in sentiment among financial giants regarding the crypto market's behavior following the halving. As the event nears, the cryptocurrency community and investors are keeping a watchful eye, prepared for a range of possibilities that diverge from the historical norm.\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Continues as ICO Whale Offloads Significant ETH Holdings\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently experiencing heightened volatility, underscored by a recent 4% drop in price amid broader crypto market fluctuations. This latest dip has triggered a wave of speculation about the future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKey to the current market unrest is the activity of an ICO whale who has significantly reduced their holdings, selling off 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at a rate of $2,997 each. This move comes after additional transactions where the same whale offloaded 5,110 ETH on various platforms, with the price per ETH approximately at $2,545. Despite this large-scale sell-off, the whale still possesses about 29,700 ETH, which currently values approximately $89.4 million, held primarily across staking platforms.\n\nAdding to the market\u2019s unease, Whale Alert has flagged more Ethereum moving towards exchanges. Notably, an unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH to Coinbase, worth roughly $32.13 million, followed by another transaction of 10,726 ETH to the same exchange, valued at around $31.90 million.\n\nThese substantial movements to a major exchange like Coinbase are raising alarms about potential further increases in Ethereum\u2019s price volatility. However, amid these concerns, some analysts maintain a cautious optimism, buoyed by positive developments such as the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which may indicate a rebound or stabilization in the market soon.\n\nMoreover, with the cryptocurrency community looking forward to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, there is anticipation that this might also spur positive movements in Ethereum's price.\n\nAs the situation develops, Ethereum's current trading price stands at $2,978.31, marking a decrease of 3.45% from the previous day, with a trading volume that has risen by 10.77% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, Ethereum's price has seen a substantial 16% decline over the past week and an 18% drop over the last month, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty and the speculative nature of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Emerges as a Strong Contender Against Established Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) is carving out a niche for itself with a current price of $0.000564 and promising features that could potentially outperform major players like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON). What sets Furrever Token apart is its unique appeal rooted in the universal love for cute kitties, aiming to create a delightful and engaging experience for its users.\n\nThe charm of Furrever Token extends beyond its cat-themed aesthetics, encompassing a range of stickers, emojis, and visuals that enhance the user interface. This strategy not only enriches the community experience but also strengthens the bond among its members, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nOperating on the BNB-20 blockchain, the Furrever Token is designed with favorable tokenomics. About 65% of its tokens were made available during the presale, with the remainder distributed between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the development team. This distribution strategy promotes fairness and ensures the longevity and stability of the project.\n\nFinancially, Furrever Token is not just about the novelty; it offers significant return potential, boasting up to 15X returns which highlights its attractiveness as an investment. To secure its platform and user investments, the token has undergone rigorous audits, emphasizing its commitment to security and compliance.\n\nThe project\u2019s dedication is further evidenced by its active community engagement and transparent communication, critical factors that contribute to its growing legitimacy and appeal as an investment.\n\nAs Furrever Token continues to evolve and attract attention in the crypto market, its innovative integration of fun elements with serious financial prospects positions it as a formidable alternative to well-established cryptocurrencies like Solana and Toncoin.
