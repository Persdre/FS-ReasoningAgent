        "content": "Advertisement\n\nShibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, has set a new record by processing a staggering 7.4 million transactions in a single day.\n\nThis milestone is part of a broader surge that saw the platform handle over 12.5 million transactions in just two days.\n\nThis is a significant turnaround for a network that appeared dormant (or even borderline dead) just weeks ago.\n\nShibarium's stunning comeback\n\nShibarium has recently experienced a stunning resurgence, contrasting sharply with its previous state of inactivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past few days alone, the network recorded an impressive transaction volume, with nearly 35,000 transactions on Tuesday and over 29,000 on Wednesday.\n\nThis peak in activity is the highest since Oct. 25, when Shibarium processed a then-record of 62,000 transactions.\n\nEarlier this month, Shibarium had shown signs of increasing activity, but the recent spike surpasses all expectations. This revival is particularly noteworthy given the platform's earlier struggles, where it saw days with fewer than 10,000 transactions.\n\nModerate impact on SHIB's price\n\nDespite Shibarium's exceptional performance, the excitement has not translated into a significant spike in the value of SHIB.\n\nThe meme coin, which is the second-largest of its kind, has seen only a modest increase of 2.5% in its price over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe current market data show SHIB priced at $0.00000852, with a 24-hour trading volume of $134,747,522.\n\nAlthough Shibarium's achievements are noteworthy, they have yet to make a substantial impact on SHIB's market cap or its position on investor watch lists."

        "content": "The decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Goldfinch has approved plans to expand beyond Ethereum and launch its services on Base, a layer-2 blockchain created by major crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that our community has approved the deployment of the Goldfinch smart contracts on @BuildOnBase L2!\n\n\n\nThis strategic move aligns with our mission to make the power of crypto accessible to a broader audience by improving user experience and reducing gas\u2026 \u2014 Goldfinch (@goldfinch_fi) November 30, 2023\n\nGoldfinch governance members reached consensus on the proposal after extensive debate over the benefits of onboarding more users through Coinbase\u2019s large customer base versus remaining solely on Ethereum.\n\nThe Goldfinch community will next hold a soft vote and audit the code before officially activating the deployment contract to add Goldfinch to Base. This represents a major step toward lowering transaction fees and boosting adoption for the DeFi lending platform.\n\nAdditionally, Goldfinch\u2019s native GFI token surged 14% to $1.74 following news of the expansion on December 1.\n\nGFI Price | Source: Tradingview\n\nAs an Ethereum-exclusive project until now, the shift to a more affordable layer-2 network will enable greater accessibility by reducing prohibitively high gas fees on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGoldfinch co-founder Blake West and engineering manager Greg Egan were strong proponents for the move to Base, citing the blockchain\u2019s rapidly growing total value locked of over $300 million. They also referred to Coinbase\u2019s massive user base over 100 million worldwide that Base apps can leverage.\n\nAs one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges that recently went public, Coinbase\u2019s support provides credibility and a built-in customer pipeline that will accelerate DeFi adoption. Goldfinch aims to take advantage of Base as a customer acquisition channel going forward.\n\nThis latest development comes on the heels of Goldfinch marking the full repayment of its first-issued loan to crypto lender Fazz Financial in late November. The successful repayment of this genesis loan is a promising indicator for the newly expanded lending protocol."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders and analysts are discussing the roots of the \"New Solana Summer\" as all core metrics of on-chain activity are rocketing. Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

Regulatory and Economic Factors : Ethereum\u2019s future price could be affected by regulatory changes, with positive developments boosting investments and stricter regulations posing risks. Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role.\n\n: Ethereum\u2019s future price could be affected by regulatory changes, with positive developments boosting investments and stricter regulations posing risks. Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

        "content": "Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko has binned the narrative that SOL is an Ethereum killer.\n\nHe says that while the theory became loud during the past cycle, it should not be used in the coming one.\n\nAccording to the Solana executives, it is okay for the two technologies to have overlapping features and compete.\n\nSolana price continues to eye the $70.00 psychological mark, trading for $63.58 with prospects for more gains.\n\nSolana founder Anatoly Yakovenko envisions a future where SOL and Ether (ETH) co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Solana price nears $60 after 6% rise in a day as institutions pour millions into SOL\n\nSolana founder wants SOL vs ETH cold war binned\n\nSolana (SOL) founder Anatoly Yakovenko has urged his followers not to bring back the narrative that played during the past cycle, putting SOL against Ethereum (ETH), saying, \u201cIt is lame.\u201d The Solana executive envisions a future where the two ecosystems can coexist, leveraging their overlapping features to compete.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."
