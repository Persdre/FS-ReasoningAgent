        "content": "Two Ethereum traders made $120 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe traders employ a 'looping' strategy in DeFi, enabling leveraged positions on Ether to amplify their investments.\n\nUpcoming Ethereum upgrades and the potential approval of an Ether ETF are key market catalysts, potentially driving Ether's price even higher.\n\nA pair of high-value Ethereum traders are up nearly $120 million today as crypto prices continue to jump.\n\nAccording to DL News\u2019 analysis, two wallet addresses, 0x28 and 0x74, have used various lending protocols to increase their exposure to Ether.\n\nCombined, these wallets hold over 1.1 million in Ether and staked Ether derivatives \u2014 worth $3 billion. Both wallets are deposited in a handful of lending protocols like MakerDAO, Spark, Morpho and Compound.\n\nThe identities of wallet owners aren\u2019t publicly known, but these wallets caught attention in 2022 for nearly being liquidated for $600 million worth of Ether. Now, that risky bet has paid off.\n\nLooping on DeFi\n\nThe strategy these whales \u2014 a term for high-value crypto traders or investors \u2014 employ is commonly referred to in DeFi as looping.\n\nA trader deposits an asset, such as Ether, into a lending protocol and then borrows a different asset, like dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, against their deposit. They then swap that DAI for Ether, the original asset.\n\nAfter swapping cryptocurrencies, the trader re-deposits the newly-acquired Ether back into the lending protocol. This action allows them to borrow additional funds, establishing what\u2019s called a \u2018leveraged long position\u2019 on their original Ether deposit.\n\nThe looping strategy enables traders to achieve a leverage of 3-5x \u2014 multiplying capital by a factor of 3 to 5 times \u2014 on their initial investment.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut in this case, these whales have opted for a more conservative leverage range of 1-2x. Despite its potential for higher returns, this strategy carries a multitude of risks. A significant drop in the Ether price could lead to liquidation, resulting in the loss of the initial deposit.\n\nThe pair of whales deployed these strategies years ago when Ether was worth around $1,000. Ether is currently trading around $2,700. The price of Ether would have to drop over 60% for them to be liquidated.\n\nEthereum catalysts\n\nTraders who utilise the looping strategy inherently hold a bullish sentiment \u2014 conviction that the prices will go up \u2014 on the market.\n\nFor Ether, there are a couple of significant catalysts on the horizon.\n\nEthereum's Ether token has performed well over the past year.\n\nThe first is the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which will reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. After successful tests on two of Ethereum\u2019s test networks, the upgrade is slated to come to Ethereum mainnet around March 13.\n\nThe weeks leading up to major Ethereum upgrades generally coincide with increased interest in the Ethereum network, and some researchers even find that it causes Ether\u2019s price to increase.\n\nSince the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, the market has turned its sights to an Ether spot ETF.\n\nHeavyweights like Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco and others have all already applied for an Ether spot ETF, with a decision to be made by May 23.\n\nGiven the Bitcoin ETFs hold 692,000 Bitcoin, or 3.53% of the total supply, traders are hoping an Ether ETF would see a similar success.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.
