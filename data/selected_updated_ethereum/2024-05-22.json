        "content": "Amid growing anticipation about the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, global investment manager VanEck's ETF has been listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol \"ETHV.\"\n\nWhat Happened: This development is seen as a critical step before receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe DTCC, a key American financial market infrastructure provider, offers clearing, settlement, and transaction reporting services.\n\nA listing on DTCC is a necessary precursor to SEC approval. Currently, VanEck's ETF is designated as inactive on the DTCC website, indicating it cannot be processed until it secures the required regulatory approvals.\n\nNotably, VanEck is not the first Ether ETF listed by the DTCC; Franklin Templeton's spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF was listed on the platform a month ago.\n\nThe DTCC's list includes both active ETFs that can be processed and those that are not yet active.\n\nThe final SEC decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF application is expected by May 23.\n\nAfter months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC took significant action earlier this week by asking financial managers to amend and refile their 19b-4 filings on their proposed spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThis move has been interpreted by some analysts as a positive indication, raising the potential approval chance to 75% from 25%.\n\nIn a parallel development, Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has filed an updated 19b-4 form for BlackRock\u2018s BLK spot Ethereum ETF, with other amended filings also coming in.\n\nNasdaq submitted the amended form for the world's largest asset manager on Wednesday, while Exchange CboeBZX filed revamped 19b-4 forms late Tuesday for five spot ETF proposals.\n\nThese amended filings followed the SEC's request for exchanges to revise their 19b-4s earlier this week.\n\nAlso Read: White House Won\u2019t Veto Crypto Bill, But Seeks Stronger Consumer Protections\n\nForm 19b-4s notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and need the agency's approval before spot ether ETFs can become effective.\n\nAdditionally, S-1 registration statements would need to be approved before the funds can start trading.\n\nNasdaq's latest filing includes language similar to other amended 19b-4s regarding staking, indicating that the Fund\u2019s ETH cannot be staked.\n\n\u201cNeither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian (as defined below), nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust's ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,\u201d according to BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nAdding to the flurry of activity, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed on platform X that Grayscale GBTC has submitted a revised 19b-4 file for its Ethereum Mini Trust.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nThis event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.\n\nRead Next: Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations \u2018Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange traded products are finally set to begin trading next week, almost a decade after the first such vehicles appeared in Sweden.\n\nWisdomTree, 21Shares and Invesco have been given the green light by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, to list ETPs investing in \u201cphysical\u201d spot bitcoin and ether, the two most popular digital tokens, on the London Stock Exchange on May 28.\n\nHowever, the ETPs \u2014 which form part of a barrage of similar vehicles expected to list on the LSE \u2014 will only be available to professional investors because the FCA has ruled that \u201ccrypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose\u201d.\n\nThe stance is in sharp contrast to stock exchanges across much of continental Europe, as well as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and the US, which offer crypto ETPs to both retail and institutional investors.\n\nUS-listed spot bitcoin ETFs already boast combined assets of $50bn, despite only launching in January, with about 80 per cent of this held by retail investors, according to regulatory filings.\n\nA series of other crypto ETP managers, including ETC Group and CoinShares, are known to have filed to list vehicles on the LSE, ideally also on May 28 if they receive regulatory sign-off from the FCA in time.\n\n\u201cThe FCA approval of our crypto ETPs\u2019 prospectus is a significant step forward for the industry and UK-based professional investors seeking exposure to the asset class,\u201d said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree, which has $111bn under management globally.\n\n\u201cWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point. FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will have fees of 0.35 per cent, the same as equivalent vehicles listed in a number of continental European exchanges.\n\nOphelia Snyder, co-founder of 21 Shares, which will cross-list its existing Bitcoin and Ethereum Staking ETPs in the UK, with fees of 1.49 per cent, said: \u201cLondon hosts one of the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world \u2014 where there is proven institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nInvesco will bring its $240mn Physical Bitcoin ETP, already listed in Germany and Switzerland, to London with a 0.39 per cent fee.\n\nAll the UK-listed crypto funds will be constructed as exchange traded notes, a structure common across the European cryptocurrency market. The FCA has only approved vehicles that invest in bitcoin and ether and which are unleveraged and physically backed.\n\nDespite the retail investor ban, issuers remain hopeful that there will be sufficient interest among UK-based professional investors to make cross-listing their ETPs in London worthwhile.\n\nMore than 900 institutional investors have built stakes in US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC filings show, suggesting there may be an audience even for ETNs that are off-limits to retail investors.\n\n\u201cHedge funds and small family offices have always had an appetite [for crypto ETFs]. Private banks and discretionary fund managers are a little bit more hesitant, but they want to look at this asset class. Multi-asset managers are also looking at it,\u201d said Ravinder Azad, head of UK sales at WisdomTree. The company attracted 14 institutional investors to a UK crypto webinar earlier this year but already had more than 140 sign-ups for a follow-up event in June, according to Azad.\n\nBrown Brothers Harriman\u2019s 2024 Global ETF Investor Survey, released this week, found that in each of the US, Europe and Greater China, more institutional investors said they were bullish about the prospects for digital assets than any other asset class over the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, one crypto ETF issuer that has no plans to list a product in the UK while retail investors remain off limits told the FT: \u201cYou are launching a product that is not universal. It needs to be universal. That is the principle that underlies ETFs everywhere.\u201d"
