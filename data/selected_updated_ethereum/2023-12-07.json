        "content": "Stablecoins, in spite of their name, have been known to veer from their price anchors. In March, Circle's USDC , the second-largest stablecoin, temporarily depegged due to the collapse of banking partner Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). This in turn led Maker's DAI to drop, as a large part of that stablecoin's reserve assets were in USDC. Last year, the dramatic collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST marked the beginning of the crypto winter. Overall, large-cap fiat-backed stablecoins de-pegged from their price anchor more than 600 times this year, according to a Moody's Analytics report from early November."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nBitcoin transaction fees have witnessed a significant uptick recently, echoing patterns seen last month during the Inscription frenzy.\n\nThis time, however, the catalyst appears to be an increase in transactions awaiting confirmation in the Bitcoin network\u2019s mempool. The volume of coins in transactions held in the mempool reached 88,000 BTC.\n\nFurthermore, a detailed examination of transactions waiting in the mempool reveals that most fall under the 50+ sat/vByte fee cohort. High-priority transactions reach up to 337 sat/vByte, which converts to approximately $20.\n\nThis is paralleled by a surge in Bitcoin fees to roughly $12.5 million. This places Bitcoin fees hot on the heels of Ethereum, which currently tops the chart at $15 million.\n\nName 1 Day Fees 7 Day Avg.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is gearing up to continue its rally to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous crypto strategist Altcoin Sherpa tells his 200,700 followers on the social media platform X that he believes the smart contract platform will go much higher in the future, however, he warns traders of an upcoming dip after FTX\u2019s supply of SOL floods the market.\n\n\u201cSOL: I still think that we go a bit lower. FTX supply coming here eventually and I think this move up is to bait some buyers. Would just be patient on Solana. Note: I think that this one is going to go much much higher in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, investors should remain patient with Solana as the incoming cache of SOL tokens from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will add to its supply. However, the trader notes that during the last month, SOL has been consolidating.\n\n\u201cAlthough I think that you should still stay a bit patient given FTX supply is coming onto the market sometime (who knows when), Solana has also consolidated for a month in an overall macro healthy BTC (Bitcoin) upswing. In my opinion, this means you should at least be exposed now if you want in on this one.\n\nRecommend you do a swing trade on this one and have entries from here all the way down to sub-$50. It also works great as an investment too, where you just hold this for six months+ and let it ride. High percentage chance it\u2019s decently higher later.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $66.36 at time of writing, a 4.7% increase during the last day and an increase of over 550% from its price of $9.97 at the start of 2023.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair from Binance offers a glimpse into Ethereum's current market position \u2013 a position that, while seemingly bearish, may hold the seeds for a future rally against the digital gold that is about to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart presents a downtrend with Ethereum losing ground to Bitcoin, reflected by the downward slope of the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (black line) moving averages. This suggests that, in the short to medium term, Ethereum has been underperforming compared to the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThis underperformance can be linked to a subdued period for key Ethereum market drivers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With these sectors facing a downturn, Ethereum's price has not had the catalysts that could propel it forward, especially in comparison to Bitcoin, which often acts as a \"safe haven\" within the crypto market during times of uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the development activity within Ethereum's ecosystem tells a different story. Despite the lack of immediate market drivers, the consistent work being done on the platform could be laying the groundwork for a strong rebound.\n\nFor traders, the ETH/BTC chart is a vital tool for tracking market sentiment and volatility. A declining ETH/BTC ratio could indicate a period of risk-off sentiment where investors flock to Bitcoin's relative safety. Conversely, a rising ratio might signal a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to bet on Ethereum's growth prospects, which might also hint at the potential surge of altcoins in general.\n\nGiven the current chart trends, investors and traders may look for signs of stabilization or reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio as indicators of Ethereum's resurgence. Such a turnaround could be precipitated by a revival in the DeFi and NFT markets or by new developments and upgrades within the network."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum (ETH)? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is a blockchain supported by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Established in 2015, Ethereum introduced the idea of smart contracts, which are bits of code written into the blockchain that can support various types of applications or even new cryptocurrencies. The native token of Ethereum is ether (ETH 1.09%), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. Read on to learn what Ethereum is, what you can do with the Ethereum technology, whether ether is a good investment, and the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC 1.98%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? What is Ethereum? The basic idea of Ethereum is that it\u2019s a platform that can execute and verify application code without the need for a central authority. It does this through an implementation of blockchain technology run across a decentralized network. Blockchain is a concept used to secure data on a network. Basically, it ensures nobody changes the data on the network without authorization from the majority of people using it. A decentralized network means there\u2019s no single point of authority, like a corporation or government, that can make changes to the data on the network. Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model to secure the blockchain. Network members must stake Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether, to verify blocks written to the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is also used to pay for work done on the blockchain. Some merchants and service providers will accept ether as payment.\n\nWhat can it do? What can Ethereum do? Ethereum and the concepts pioneered in its development form the backbone of many advancements in blockchain technology. Using smart contracts, which are bits of code written to the blockchain, has allowed people to build all sorts of applications, including: Stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce.\n\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce. Lending applications. You can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.\n\nYou can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can create a unique token that can\u2019t be replicated, called a non-fungible token, or NFT. The token can represent anything from a piece of art or a deed to a house. There are dozens of other ways to apply smart contracts and blockchain technology. Is it a good investment? Is Ethereum a good investment? If you\u2019re interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether, is a good choice. Ethereum is the clear market leader in blockchain applications. Most new developments in decentralized finance or other uses for blockchain are built on the Ethereum network. That inherently gives ether value since it\u2019s needed to keep the network running and verifying the blockchain as well as paying for transactions on the blockchain. The shift to a proof-of-stake system from a proof-of-work system makes it more sustainable from an energy-use perspective. That opens the door for it to make advancements in processing speed, which can make smart contracts more broadly applicable. Ethereum has strong staying power (in the crypto world), so it\u2019s much more unlikely to provide the boom-or-bust results of other smaller currencies.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Ether and Bitcoin are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The currencies have a lot in common, but Ethereum builds on the underlying blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin\u2019s creator. The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a permissionless, decentralized digital currency. Its creator wanted a way to make payments that weren\u2019t backed by a central government or agency. As a result, Bitcoin is used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Ethereum had a much broader idea. The blockchain is used for all sorts of decentralized applications. While ether is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain, you can also have other cryptocurrencies built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin also use different protocols to secure their blockchains. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Under this system, every computer on the network is working to solve a complex math problem to write the next block to the blockchain. Once a computer solves the problem, the other members of the network verify the solution (which takes much less work), and a new block attaches to the chain. Ethereum used the same system until September 2022. It now uses a proof-of-stake system that requires network members to hold ether to validate the next block in the blockchain. Validators are financially incentivized to verify correct data because they risk losing their stake if they\u2019re a bad actor. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network. Transaction costs can vary more widely on Ethereum based on how many people are actively trying to write new data to the blockchain, i.e., transaction volume. Both have their use cases where they excel, and either ether or Bitcoin could be a viable investment choice for someone interested in buying and holding crypto."
