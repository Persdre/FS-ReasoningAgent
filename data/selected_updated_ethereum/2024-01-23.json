        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market are down bad this week. But some of the biggest losers near the top of the market were once recently stars of the show, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn recent weeks, all three of those top 20 cryptocurrencies were making big gains as they attracted institutional investor interest. Now, each has slipped by at least 14% over the past seven days, and have posted sizable losses on the day.\n\nEthereum is down sharply this morning, per data from CoinGecko, falling 7% over the past 24 hours to a current price of about $2,200 and pushing its seven-day dip to 14%.\n\nSolana is down almost 16% over the past seven days at a current price of $82.50. It has rebounded slightly from earlier this morning, but remains down about 5% on the day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile AVAX, which is the 11th largest cryptocurrency, has plunged 19% on the week to a current price of just under $29. Like Solana, it has shored up some of its losses since this morning, now down about 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt was just over a week ago that Ethereum came just shy of hitting $2,700, its highest price since April 2022. Excitement over Ethereum grew amid the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as investors considered the next wave of prospective institutional adoption, particularly as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked up the prospect of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSOL had been on a big run starting from the end of October. It was expected to take a hit during the trial of disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, who was heavily invested in the asset via his now collapsed crypto empire, FTX.\n\nBut major companies such as Visa and Shopify sung the project's praises and said they'd use its blockchain. A growing developer base also meant the price of SOL shot up. It rose as high as $123 in December 2023, nearing a two-year high after plunging to a price of about $8 in December 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAVAX also attracted interest when investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nLong-term holders have reason to be optimistic, though\u2014despite the recent dips in price, both coins over a one-year period are doing well: SOL is up 239%, while AVAX has jumped by 64%. Even Ethereum is up by 35% over the last year.\n\nThe broader crypto market has taken a nosedive as it follows the price action of the biggest digital asset by market cap, Bitcoin.\n\nSince crypto fund Grayscale converted its flagship BTC fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and started trading on the stock market, investors have been keen to redeem shares previously locked into the product.\n\nThis has put pressure on the price of the biggest and oldest digital coin in recent days.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Polymer Labs, a modular IBC-based networking protocol, has secured a $23 million Series A co-led by Blockchain Capital, Maven 11 and Distributed Global.\n\nOther investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Placeholder, Digital Currency Group, North Island Ventures and Figment Capital also participated in the round.\n\nPolymer can be described as a modular layer-2 network that employs Cosmos SDK\u2019s IBC protocol, OP stack\u2019s settlement functionality and Eigenlayer\u2019s data availability layer. It is the brainchild of Bo Du and Peter Kim.\n\nAfter being in the blockchain industry for a few years, the Polymer founders experienced firsthand how difficult it was to build interchain products. In the summer of 2021, they made a decision to drop their side projects and focus on fixing blockchain interoperability.\n\nRead more: The Interchain Foundation puts aside $26.4M to grow Cosmos ecosystem\n\nInitially, the team wanted to design their own interoperability protocol \u2014 similar to that of many general message-passing protocols that exist today. However, during their research, they came across the Cosmos SDK\u2019s Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, Du told Blockworks.\n\nIBC is an inter-blockchain communication protocol, as its name suggests. It allows different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate with each other. The protocol is designed to ensure that information can be securely transferred between separate operating chains.\n\nRead More: DeFi users \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 what chain apps are on\n\n\u201cIBC already had years put into its design and architecture, so we decided to stick with IBC and not invent a whole new standard,\u201d Du said.\n\nKim added that at the time, IBC was the most decentralized, elegant solution to establish connections and pass messages between chains.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe realized this was something that could be expanded to other chains; basically export the technology to have industry penetration rather than just the Cosmos app chains,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe team wanted to find ways to make the already established interoperability protocol on Cosmos a mainstream standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to integrate IBC natively into all these different chains, which is why we designed the virtual IBC protocol, which essentially allows chains that don\u2019t natively implement IBC to access IBC execution through Polymer and have Polymer execute IBC on its behalf,\u201d Du said.\n\nMany blockchain interoperability protocols today are focused on the state component of interoperability, which involves aligning the status of the data stored within separate systems, but Du believes this is just one part of the interoperability problem.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBeyond the state layer, two other layers need to be considered. This includes the application layer \u2014 that is, the layer responsible for encoding and decoding sent data and the transportation layer (TAO) \u2014 which manages the routing of raw data.\n\n\u201cAll of IBC\u2019s core logic will live on the transportation layer; this becomes decoupled from the application layer, and Polymer will hold the IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d Du said.\n\nThis means that at the end of the day, the application \u2014 which lives on Ethereum \u2014 will be able to interact with the IBC network through Polymer smart contracts.\n\n\u201cPolymer will then take the apps intended actions and execute the associated IBC logic and produce a commitment to the IBC state of that chain on Polymer \u2014 so essentially, Polymer is maintaining this merkle-ized IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: 2023\u2019s top 5 DeFi protocols by revenue\n\nSimilar work to decouple state, application and transport layers is being explored by the interoperability protocol LayerZero.\n\nIBC has been around for a long period of time. Du notes that its specs cover various considerations ranging from authentication, timeouts and acknowledgment, somethings its competitors may not have.\n\nThis means that applications will not have to individually implement these different changes when there are protocol upgrades.\n\n\u201cIf you want to design a protocol that is going to last for generations of builders, you need to be able to handle these different edge cases properly,\u201d Du said. \u201cThis is a foundational level protocol.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Polymer Labs, Yuan Han Li and Joshua Rivera from Blockchain Capital, shared this sentiment.\n\nThey note in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that \u201cwhile numerous arbitrary messaging protocols have emerged to address the cross-chain interoperability, they have all done so by building a new messaging standard, paradoxically causing more fragmentation when a standardized and battle tested way to move data between heterogeneous blockchains already exists.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Polymer team is hoping to ensure that IBC becomes a widely adopted interoperability standard that will shape how blockchain applications of the future will communicate. This latest funding round will bring the team closer to launching mainnet.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
