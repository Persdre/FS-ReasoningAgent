        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) flew off centralized exchanges this week, potentially reducing selling pressure on the ETH market, according to the crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock.\n\nIn a new analysis, Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock\u2019s head of research, tracked Ethereum\u2019s netflows, which measure the ETH moving in and out of centralized crypto exchanges by subtracting the amount of ETH\u2019s withdrawals from its deposits.\n\nOutumuro notes that more than $1 billion worth of Ethereum netflows left centralized exchanges this week. ETH\u2019s network fees, which indicate the willingness to spend and demand to use the asset, increased by more than 30% over the same time period.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also flowed off centralized exchanges, clocking $300 million worth of net outflows and breaking an eight-week trend of inflows onto exchanges. Bitcoin\u2019s network fees spiked by more than 50% this week as well.\n\nLarge upticks in exchange inflows tend to lead to an average price drop of 5% for crypto assets, according to a 2021 study published by fellow crypto analytics firm Santiment.\n\nETH is trading at $2,512 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 2.64% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBTC is trading at $47,478 at time of writing.

        "content": "Sat 10 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nA completely new Ethereum standard named ERC-404 is currently under development. Spearheaded by creators \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cAcme,\u201d this ambitious project aims to merge the fungible ERC-20 tokens with the usually incompatible ERC-721 NFTs. Behind this revolutionary idea lies the potential for fractional ownership of NFTs, a concept with profound implications.\n\nThe ERC-404 Hybrid Token Concept\n\nThe purpose of the ERC-404 standard is to combine the ERC-20 standards, which define fungible tokens such as USDT, with ERC-721, used for unique NFTs. This ambitious merge would result in a hybrid token that brings together the best of both worlds.\n\nSpecifically, ERC-404 tokens would allow multiple wallets to own fractions of the same iconic NFT. This way, it would be possible to own shares in a Bored Ape Yacht Club or a rare digital artwork. These fractional shares would then be tradable or usable, just like any ERC-20 token.\n\nThis disintermediated innovation in the field of NFT ownership opens up new use cases. For instance, lenders could accept fractions of an NFT as collateral, instead of having to seize the entire NFT. However, the technical challenges are complex for a successful integration of the two standards.\n\nEthereum, Adoption, and Criticisms Raised by ERC-404\n\nAlthough its development is still experimental, the ERC-404 standard has already garnered a lot of interest within the crypto ecosystem. Industry giants like Binance and OKX quickly announced their support for the standard before retracting it.\n\nThe Pandora token, the first to adopt ERC-404, experienced explosive growth in its valuation. Other projects using ERC-404 have also emerged, demonstrating the potential of this concept.\n\nHowever, ERC-404 also draws criticisms from within the crypto community. Some developers such as \u201cquit\u201d have warned against security flaws, like the potential theft of fractionated NFTs on poorly-configured lending platforms.\n\nThe creators of the standard have downplayed these risks, attributing the issues more to an incorrect implementation of ERC-404. Regardless, utmost caution remains paramount when it comes to the security of this experimental technology. Its adoption will require thorough audits and checks before it is deemed safe. With their ERC-404 standard, Ethereum developers are pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation by merging two previously incompatible standards.\n\nDespite the technical challenges and controversies, this promising concept of fractional NFTs is already generating a tremendous amount of excitement. If properly audited and secured, Ethereum\u2019s ERC-404 could become a major revolution for the future of cryptocurrencies and digital ownership. The next steps of this experimental project are crucial.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Sat 10 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum, the pioneering blockchain recognized for its crypto innovation and flexibility, has reached a historic milestone: that of 2 million daily active users. This unprecedented event not only underscores the platform\u2019s rapid growth but also heralds dizzying developmental prospects for the years to come.\n\nAn Expanding Ecosystem\n\nEthereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain technology, far surpassing its competitors in terms of active users and revenue generation for its holders (HODLers).\n\nThe platform has undergone a radical transformation since its inception, evolving from an energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) system to a more sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) model under the guidance of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThis transition to PoS, requiring validators to stake a significant amount of the ETH cryptocurrency, has not only reduced the blockchain\u2019s carbon footprint but also strengthened the network\u2019s security and efficiency.\n\nCrossing the threshold of 2 million daily active users is indicative of Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness and robustness.\n\nThe Ethereum community, with its unwavering commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, has made possible what seemed to be a distant goal.\n\nThe successful implementation of Layer 2 (L2) solutions to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs is a key factor in this exponential growth.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Future Anticipations\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum\u2019s price is also a crucial indicator of its vitality and potential.\n\nDespite market turbulence, characterized by significant price fluctuations of major cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has demonstrated impressive resilience and bullish trends, surpassing the $2500 barrier. This performance is partly attributable to the positive anticipation surrounding the launch of the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the United States, a development that promises to inject additional liquidity into the Ethereum market.\n\nThe introduction of an Ethereum spot ETF represents a major step towards recognizing Ethereum as an investable and legitimate asset class. This development could not only attract a broader spectrum of institutional and traditional investors but also strengthen confidence in altcoins. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge, with an ambiguous approach from regulators, underscoring the complexity of classifying Ethereum as a security or currency.\n\nThe future of Ethereum seems more promising than ever, with ongoing technical developments aimed at improving its scalability and further reducing transaction fees. The imminent Denchain upgrade, which targets the enhancement of layer 2 protocols, is particularly anticipated. This technical evolution, coupled with market optimism and increased liquidity due to spot ETFs, positions Ethereum on an upward trajectory towards new peaks.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "A recently published report by Finder conducted in January 2024 and shared with Coingape features the combined opinions of 40 crypto industry experts on the price projections for Ethereum (ETH) up to 2030. This survey, being a notable move to assess the growth potential of Ethereum, has delivered a common idea that there is a great future perspective of ETH among the participants.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Trajectory of Price Through 2030\n\nAs per the findings, the panelists expect a big rise in the market value of Ethereum and an average price of $4,887 by the end of 2024. This upward trend is expected to persist, with projections indicating a further growth to $7,492 by 2025 and an amazing jump to $19,190 by 2030.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese forecasts are all the more positive than the panel surveys in October 2023 and January 2023 and, in another way, highlight that the market and its performance are winning the confidence of market actors.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) has had a bullish rally in the last 24 hours with price bouncing between an intra-day low and high of $2,475 and $2,522. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,492, a 0.30% surge from the support level. During the rally, ETH market market capitalization surged to $299,492,362,705 while the 24-hour trading volume dipped by 36% to $8,169,785,827.\n\nExpert Ethereum Insights\n\nJonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of A.R.I.A., emphasized the significant milestone of Ethereum exceeding $2,470, indicative of a reversion to the bullish mode. Solomon and other experts, including Damian Chmiel of Finance Magnates, noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are strongly correlated. That suggests Ethereum may benefit from the same catalysts that have previously pushed Bitcoin up, such as ETF regimes and halving events.\n\nPedro Febrero, VP of Web3 at RealFevr, noted that Ethereum is in fact undervalued when compared to Bitcoin, considering its massive adoption and capabilities in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc. Nonetheless, experts\u2019 viewpoints on Ethereum\u2019s imminent future differed.\n\nWhilst some, including Josh Fraser of Origin Protocol, foresee an ETH peak price of $17,000 in 2024, influenced by such factors as possible ETFs and diminishing sell pressure, others, such as John Hawkins of the University of Canberra, take a more careful approach and predict a decline to $2,000.\n\nThe Consensus on Buying, Holding, or Selling ETH\n\nThe survey shows a strong preference for buying ETH, as 71% of the panelists recommend the acquisition at the current time. The expectation of Ethereum ETFs and the changing discourse around on-chain assets and decentralized applications gives credence to this view. Identically, a very small 3% of the shareholders believe that the best time to dispose of ETH is today because of the belief in the future development of Ethereum.\n\nDiversity of views is what one comes across in the discussion on the current valuation of Ethereum. Due to its impressive growth and potential as a global settlement layer, about half of the panelists think ETH is undervalued. On the other hand, however, a sizable 45% believe that Ethereum is fairly priced given the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for a similar event happening for Ethereum. Though a small fraction of the market views ETH as overpriced, the persistent system flaws within the Ethereum network are pointed at.\n\nThe survey further looked at the competition between Ethereum and new blockchain platforms, such as Solana. The majority of analysts (66%) have predicted that crypto fans will rely on the usage of Ethereum and Solana, thus taking advantage of the different features each provides. This point of view leads to a diverse and multi-chain future of the blockchain industry where different platforms meet the needs and choices of different groups of users.\n\nRead Also: XRP Price Prediction As Renewed Recovery Hints 14% Surge, But There\u2019s A Catch\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.
