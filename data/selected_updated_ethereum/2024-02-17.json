        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is following the market-wide rally, surging above $2.8k for the first time since May 2022. ETH has rallied 2.7% in the daily charts, 16.3% in the weekly charts, 23.8% in the 14-day charts, and more than 11% over the previous month. Moreover, ETH\u2019s price has surged by 68.4% since February 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Weekend Price Prediction; ETH Eyes $3,000\n\nETH is currently following Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) trajectory. BTC\u2019s latest rally could be due to increased inflows into spot BTC ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) investment vehicles. However, ETH is still down by over 40% from its all-time high of $4878, which it attained in November 2021.\n\nWhen will Ethereum (ETH) reclaim its all-time high?\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, Ethereum (ETH) will breach the $3000 level by next week. The platform anticipates the second-largest cryptocurrency to hit $3078.45 on Feb. 22, 2024, a rise of about 7.9% from current levels. However, CoinCodex predicts ETH to fall below $3000 soon after.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Shock: $113K Gas Fee Spree Leads to Crypto Catastrophe\n\nChangelly anticipates Ethereum (ETH) to reclaim its all-time high in 2025. The platform predicts ETH to hit a maximum price of $6,263.37 next year, a rise of nearly 120% from current levels.\n\nTelegaon, on the other hand, anticipates Ethereum (ETH) to reclaim its all-time high in 2024. The platform predicts ETH to hit a maximum price of $5,054.04 in 2024, a rise of over 77% from current levels. However, the platform does not clarify which month ETH could reclaim its all-time high.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that ETH could reclaim its 2021 peak very soon. There is a lot of talk about the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approving a spot ETH ETF later this year. A spot ETH ETF, along with BTC\u2019s halving in April, could usher in a bull run for the crypto market."

        "content": "Gas price paid per transaction bounced to levels last seen during the memecoin frenzy of May 2023.\n\nETH witnessed a minor retracement in the last 24 hours, dropping below $2,800.\n\nTransaction costs on Ethereum [ETH] rose to a 9-month high, spurred largely by the hype in the experimental token standard ERC-404.\n\nUsers make a beeline for ERC-404 transactions\n\nAs per on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the network collected a total of $84 million in gas fees the past week, marking a 61.5% jump from the week before.\n\nIn fact, average gas price paid per transaction bounced to 71 Gwei on the 9th of February, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data. Such levels were last seen during the May 2o23 memecoin frenzy that saw the emergence of Pepe [PEPE] token.\n\nThe spike came in the days following the launch of the first functional ERC-404 project, Pandora, which has seen extensive demand lately. As of this writing, the Pandora token was up 270% since its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nFor the curious, ERC-404 is a unique token standard, which combines the properties of ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens). As a result, tokens under this standard are both fungible and non-fungible at the same time.\n\nA special use case of this not-yet official token standard is that it can be broken down into fractions, effectively allowing multiple users to collectively own a single NFT.\n\nAn X user with a pseudonym PopPunk, who also happens to be a co-founder of gas auditing firm, stated that an average ERC-404 transaction required three times the gas required for an average NFT transaction. It was evidently clear that ERC-404 tokens were costing users a bomb.\n\nMeanwhile, AMBCrypto also observed a spike in daily on-chain transactions over the week, to the tune of 17%. In fact, about 1.15 million transactions were settled on the 16th of February, the highest for the month.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nETH pulls back but market appetite grows strong\n\nAs of this writing, the second-largest crypto was exchanging hands at $2,790, according to CoinMarketCap. ETH witnessed a minor retracement in the last 24 hours, dropping below $2,800.\n\nThe broader market sentiment was one of \u201cextreme greed\u201d, as per the reading from Ethereum Fear and Greed Index, suggesting substantial FOMO among market participants."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's recent price action suggests that the $3,000 mark is within reach. This level is not just a psychological barrier but also a significant milestone that reflects the growing confidence of investors in the asset's long-term value proposition.\n\nUpon reviewing the latest price chart, Ethereum has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The digital asset has persistently held above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, which are often looked at as indicators of bullish sentiment when the price is above them. The 50-day EMA, in particular, has provided strong support during the recent uptick, currently residing around the $2,500 mark.\n\nEthereum's surge past the $2,800 level has been met with increasing volume, indicating solid interest in sustaining higher price levels. Resistance is anticipated as ETH approaches the critical $3,000 threshold. This is due to the expected profit-taking by traders who view this round number as an opportune moment to realize gains. However, the strength of the current trend suggests that any pullback might be short-lived.\n\nIf Ethereum faces selling pressure at $3,000, the $2,800 level may serve as the first line of defense against a significant retracement. A further drop could see the $2,500 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, acting as a more substantial support level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum breaks the $3,000 resistance, we could see an extension of the bullish run, with potential targets moving into uncharted territory. Such a move would confirm Ethereum's bullish stance and could trigger a new wave of speculative interest in the asset.\n\nSolana loses momentum\n\nSolana has encountered an unexpected stall in its price momentum. The asset, which has been the main choice of bulls during this bull run, has struggled to breach the $120 resistance level, a barrier that has proven to be a significant challenge.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the price action reveals that SOL's movement has been constrained, with the $120 mark acting as a ceiling to its growth. This level is not just a technical resistance but has become a psychological one, with each approach being met with selling pressure that pushes the price back down. The inability to push past this point has led to a period of consolidation, with the price oscillating between this upper bound and support levels beneath.\n\nThe immediate support for Solana is observed around the $100 zone, a level that has been tested several times and has so far held firm. A break below this could open the door to further losses, with the next significant support level at around the $90 mark, where the 200-day Exponential Moving Average lies.\n\nThe lack of upward momentum in Solana's price can be partly attributed to broader market conditions, where increased transaction fees on the Ethereum network have led investors to explore alternative platforms. While this could potentially benefit Solana, the network itself has yet to showcase substantial growth factors that could catalyze a new wave of adoption and investment.\n\nSolana's recent outages and network instability have dampened the sentiment around the project, causing concern among potential users and investors about its reliability. These technical challenges need to be addressed for Solana to regain its footing and become a viable competitor to Ethereum once more.\n\nDogecoin faces fierce resistance\n\nDogecoin has encountered what may be considered its nemesis resistance at the $0.08 level. This price point has proven to be a formidable barrier and acted as a point of reversal during the previous run.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s price chart indicates that while the asset has encountered resistance at $0.08, it has shown a commendable ability to break through previous resistance levels. The resilience of Dogecoin\u2019s price can be seen in its recent approach to this threshold, as it edges closer to a potential breakout. The momentum behind Dogecoin, supported by an increase in volume, suggests that the asset may indeed possess the strength to push past this key resistance level.\n\nSupport for Dogecoin is currently established at the $0.075 level, where the cryptocurrency previously found buying interest. If a reversal were to occur, this support zone could be the first to be tested. A breach below this could see further support at lower levels, potentially around the $0.07 mark, where the 50-day moving average lies.\n\nThe Dogecoin network and community are experiencing a resurgence of activity, partly due to the celebration of Dogecoin's 14th birthday, which has historically been a catalyst for increased interest and speculative trading. Additionally, the potential implementation of Dogecoin on various payment platforms, including X payments (formerly known as Twitter) might become a strong growth factor."
