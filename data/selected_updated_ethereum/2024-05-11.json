        "content": "Real Vision crypto analyst Jamie Coutts says that key indicators for one Ethereum (ETH) competitor are flashing bullish.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 14,100 followers on the social media platform X that NEAR Protocol (NEAR) could soar more than 47% from its current value.\n\n\u201cAbsolute price momentum: has been consolidating since March. The technical pattern looks extremely bullish if it breaks this resistance around $7.60 which is where a cluster of volume has traded these past months. This is a high conviction set up if it breaks the pattern neckline, producing a target above $10.50 (+30%).\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing an inverse head and shoulders pattern (I-HNS). An I-HNS is a bullish technical formation with the right shoulder suggesting bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.\n\nThe analyst also predicts that NEAR\u2019s bullish trend against Bitcoin (NEAR/BTC) and Solana (NEAR/SOL) will continue.\n\n\u201cRelative price momentum: NEAR versus SOL and BTC are positive and ready to break higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, NEAR is also experiencing huge daily active user (DAU) growth on the network compared to other smart contract platforms, which is another bullish signal.\n\n\u201cAbsolute active user momentum: NEAR\u2019s Daily active users have grown from 50,000 to 1.76 million in the past year. Ex-NEAR that number has grown from 5.4 million to 8.75 million.\u201d\n\nHe says the user growth rate far exceeds the combined growth rate of the other layer-1 and layer-2 projects.\n\n\u201cRelative active user momentum: that\u2019s growth of 33x vs 0.6x for the rest of the L1/L2 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNEAR is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, down 3.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nMarkus Thielen, research CEO at 10x Research, has cast a spotlight on Ethereum's trajectory, suggesting a potential decline to $2,500. His analysis points to weak fundamentals within the Ethereum network that could not only affect its value but also pose a hindrance to Bitcoin's progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, often touted as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. However, in this present cycle, Ethereum remains a basket case.\n\nAccording to the 10x researcher, Ethereum was the driving force during the 2020/2021 cycle because it was intended to replace the legacy banking system. NFT minting opened up new avenues for cryptocurrency acceptance, which may have evolved into other personalized papers on the blockchain, resulting in widespread \"wallet\" adoption. However, the Ethereum developers did not respond quickly enough.\n\n#Ethereum -> see you at $2,500\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc471-14) Ethereum remains this cycle\u2019s basket case.

Thielen points out a high correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum, with an R-square of 95%. Ethereum\u2019s weak fundamentals are becoming a roadblock for Bitcoin, preventing large-scale fiat inflows into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, he says.\n\nThielen's forecast coincides with a period of increased uncertainty and volatility, with the cryptocurrency market under selling pressure. At the time of writing, ETH has fallen 4.32% in the last 24 hours to $2,902, matching the sell-off in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, amid the hype and market rally surrounding the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin holders' unrealized profits increased far quicker than those of Ethereum investors. The Bitcoin NUPL metric surpassed 0.5 and reached the euphoria phase three months before the equivalent metric for Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum declines briefly, JP Morgan sees a spot ETH ETF approval despite recent Wells notice - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum spot ETFs will likely be approved despite recent Wells notices, says JP Morgan.\n\nInsights from Glassnode show that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin in terms of price performance since the recent bull cycle began.\n\nEthereum will likely continue trading in key range without a bearish macro event.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a sharp price decline on Friday following data revealing its underperformance compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Despite recent Wells notices to crypto firms, JP Morgan analysts predicted spot ETH ETFs would be approved.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum needs a bullish trigger, Joseph Lubin blasts the SEC\n\nDaily digest market movers: Active user growth, declining gas fees, underperforming Bitcoin\n\nIn a recent Ethereum-based report, JP Morgan said that the SEC's recent Wells notices to Robinhood Crypto, Consensys, and Uniswap don't pose a challenge to the agency's potential approval of a spot ETH ETF. Although analysts of the banking giants expressed doubt if the products would see approval this month, they noted that the market won't see it as a huge disappointment.\n\n\"Markets do not expect an approval by this month as implied by the significant discount to NAV by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE,\" they said.\n\nJP Morgan analysts also suggested the SEC may \"face a legal challenge and eventually lose\" if it denies applications for spot ETH ETFs, considering the agency already approved futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nIn response, General Partner at Van Buren Capital Scott Johnsson expressed an opposite view, stating he would be surprised if a legal battle ensued following a potential spot ETH ETF denial. He mentioned that Grayscale hinted that it won't take the SEC to court this time after withdrawing a \"key tool\" \u2014 probably its application for futures ETH ETF. Johnsson also stated that a denial based on correlation arguments will be \"tough to appeal.\"\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Layer 2s are about to set a new all-time high in terms of active addresses, with more than 5.2 million monthly active users as of May 5, according to data posted by Leon Waidmann. Combined with monthly active users from the ETH Mainchain, the Ethereum ecosystem would have recorded nearly 7.6 million monthly active users \u2014 almost 5x active users in 2022.\n\nThe surge in user growth coincides with declining gas fees for Ethereum Layer 2s, which have been reduced more than tenfold since the Dencun upgrade in March, according to data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nMeanwhile, Glassnode data shows that Ethereum has underperformed in the last two years when compared to Bitcoin. This is seen in a low ETH/BTC ratio and ETH drawdown in this cycle (-44%), doubling Bitcoin's (-21%). The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of Bitcoin \"crossed 0.5 and entered the euphoria phase three months before the equivalent metric for Ethereum,\" noted Glassnode.\n\nTypically, an NUPL greater than 0.5 means unrealized profit from investors is greater than half of an asset's market capitalization.\n\nRead more: Ethereum could experience bullish run, ETH \u2018ultrasound\u2019 money narrative at risk\n\nAnother key insight from Glassnode data shows that Ethereum is trading close to the purchasing cost of short-term holders (investors who bought the asset within the last 155 days). The short-term holder's cost basis often serves as a resistance during a bearish trend or support during a bullish trend\n\nWith the price of Ethereum close to the average STH cost level of $3,010, Glassnode has suggested that recent buyers may \"panic should the market experience downside volatility.\" Recent reported whale purchases around this price level align with Glassnode's STH cost basis.\n\nOne interesting part of Ethereum's on-chain activity Glassnode highlighted is that long-term holders within the past one to two years are still holding onto their positions in hopes of \"better profit-taking opportunities.\"\n\nETH technical analysis: ETH may continue trading in key range despite recent decline\n\nEthereum saw a price inefficiency on Friday, extending from $3,045 to $2,905. This was accompanied by a sharp liquidation of long positions, reaching $27 million within four hours.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum resume sideways move as Grayscale files to withdraw Ethereum futures ETF application with the SEC\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe move isn't a surprise as ETH has leaned toward the downside in the past few days despite uncertainty among traders. However, key predictions remain unchanged as ETH would likely remain trading within the $2,852 to $3,000 range.\n\nThe recent decline could present a buying opportunity for whales who have continued purchasing ETH around the $3,000 mark. Without any bearish macro event in sight, ETH would likely hold the range until the SEC decides on Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application on May 23."

        "title": "Ethereum Devs Shut Down Linea\u2014Can Layer-2 Networks Be Trusted? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLate Saturday, an Ethereum layer-2 network called Linea found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nUsing an exploit, attackers had drained $2.3 million worth of ETH from a decentralized exchange that operates on Linea, called Velocore. Unable to reach the Velocore team, Linea\u2019s leadership made the decisive call to freeze all transactions across the network in an effort to prevent further malfeasance. The plan worked: Linea users were insulated from additional losses.\n\nThat\u2019s when the trouble started.\n\nCrypto users immediately decried Linea\u2019s actions across social media, arguing that the company had violated the industry\u2019s core principle, decentralization. If a few people could halt Linea in their pajamas, then how could the network be considered any better than Wells Fargo?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm done with this crap. It's 2024, and L2s are still spewing the same bullshit about their core values being \"permissionless\" and \"censorship-resistant\" after being live for over a year but are still running centralised sequencers. Give me a break. They act all high and mighty,\u2026 https://t.co/MykDJ9G3IF \u2014 sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / (@pcaversaccio) June 2, 2024\n\nLinea immediately pivoted, posting on Twitter that the network was still in the \u201ctraining wheels\u201d phase of decentralization, but that it planned to eventually transition to a completely trustless structure. (Disclosure: Linea is owned by Consensys, which is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).\n\nConsensys' L2 unilaterally turned off the chain yesterday Reasonable given the circumstances but also a clear sign that this is not crypto pic.twitter.com/q8VaaEFOpN \u2014 mert | helius | hSOL (@0xMert_) June 2, 2024\n\nThe incident laid bare a contradiction, some developers say, that doesn\u2019t only pertain to just one blockchain. Rather, it exposed flaws in the entire, burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem\u2014a collection of privately owned networks that has been frequently touted as Ethereum\u2019s path forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo you're saying you intervened on behalf of users here, but in the future, hopefully, if you work really hard, you won\u2019t be able to intervene and your users will lose all their money?\u201d Tom Lehman, the co-founder of several Ethereum projects including layer-1 alternative Facet and Ethscriptions, told Decrypt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nTo Lehman, the contradictions exposed by Linea\u2019s public relations woes this week are not isolated\u2014they are endemic to layer-2 networks.\n\n\u201cHaving a layer-2 that's centrally controlled is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that every single one of them being centrally controlled is a problem.\u201d\n\nNearly all major scaling networks\u2014like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon\u2014were created by private, for-profit companies. Most rely on sequencers, controlled by the network\u2019s team, which batch transactions together and submit them to the Ethereum mainnet. In such cases, like Linea\u2019s, project teams have the power to effectively shut off a network by halting said sequencers.\n\nWhy do most layer-2s exert such centralized control over their transactions? Linea, which did not respond to Decrypt\u2019s questions by the time of publication, claimed in statements this week that the issue is a technical one that requires long-term finesse.\n\nBut financial incentives may also be at play. By controlling that single choke point through which all transactions must pass, layer-2 teams also control the profits derived from processing every network transaction. Such fees are the lifeblood of layer-2s, which often employ dozens of people, and such Ethereum networks are collectively raking in millions of dollars in monthly, on-chain profit.\n\n\u201cL2s can be very profitable to run,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cBut that profit is tied to how much control you have.\u201d\n\nSome layer-2 teams say they are ahead of the pack, and have taken distinct steps towards decentralization. Arbitrum, for example, features a backup pathway that allows users to post their transactions to Ethereum directly, in case any issues emerge within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Submitting transactions via this delayed inbox is not ideal, however, and can take up to 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteven Goldfeder, the CEO of Arbitrum core developer Offchain Labs, told Decrypt that the company is currently working to decentralize its sequencer\u2014but made a point of arguing that it poses less of a centralization threat than other layer-2s, given that the Arbitrum Foundation could not single-handedly prevent users from posting transactions.\n\n\u201cOn Arbitrum, the problem is a lot smaller than on other networks,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\nGoldfeder welcomes vocal criticism of centralization risks in the layer-2 ecosystem. He believes such dissent applies crucial pressure to companies that otherwise might focus on different priorities.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, you have the wrong incentives: growth first, and decentralization at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just take one centralized system and replace it with another centralized system with a vague claim of eventually decentralizing\u2014often without technical details\u2014then I think it's very dangerous.\u201d\n\nSome developers like Arjun Bhuptani, the founder of inter-blockchain bridge Everclear, however, feel that even Arbitrum\u2019s solution to current centralization issues on layer-2s is insufficient.\n\n\u201cIt is better, but is still not \u2018censorship resistance,\u2019\u201d he told Decrypt of Arbitrum.\n\nFurther, Arbitrum itself has suffered network-wide outages repeatedly in the last year.\n\nTo Bhuptani, the issue of centralization is so pervasive on layer-2s simply because the privately owned networks are currently facing other, greater concerns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt largely just comes down to prioritization,\u201d he said. \u201cProjects are seeing bigger threats to their survival today on other axes than censorship, and so building decentralization is lower priority than things like security, custody risk, and market traction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the matter of censorship on layer-2 networks is still largely theoretical. The Linea team, for example, has never used its power to block transactions on behalf of a sovereign government.\n\nBut such a scenario is by no means fanciful. The U.S. government has blacklisted Ethereum wallet addresses on multiple occasions. Centralized crypto exchanges have cooperated with the Israeli government to ban flagged accounts. Just last month, a Dutch court sentenced a developer of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixer designed to keep transactions private, to over five years in prison.\n\nEven those within the layer-2 ecosystem worry about what might happen if the private teams behind so many networks\u2014which, thanks to their incredibly low transaction fees, have recently been positioned as the best way to securely onboard the masses to crypto\u2014are legally compelled to do the bidding of governments across the world.\n\n\u201cSomething that I might think is legitimate,\u201d Goldfeder said, \u201csome oppressive regime somewhere might think is illegitimate behavior that should be censored.\u201d\n\nSome Ethereum developers feel, however, that the whole debate this week about Linea and crypto\u2019s future has been blown out of proportion.\n\n\u201cIt's easy for people who were not affected by hacks to complain,\u201d Joseph Schiarizzi, developer of Arbitrum-based stablecoin OpenDollar, told Decrypt. \u201cBut if you've ever been a victim, you understand the Linea team made the right move.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not expect every piece of infrastructure to be decentralized,\u201d he continued. \u201cI care much more about honesty and transparency, which Linea was great on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLehman, who is currently developing a more decentralized alternative to networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, said he doesn\u2019t want to demonize layer-2 networks or dismiss their usefulness. He only worries about crypto\u2019s future if they become omnipresent.\n\n\u201cThe problem comes when you say \u2018L2s are the future, that's how we scale, that's it,\u2019\u201d Lehman said. \u201cAnd in the process, [you] hand over the keys to giant billion-dollar entities and endorse them running insecure systems.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
