        "content": "Linus's release of BitVM last year has been widely cited by Bitcoin developers as a breakthrough for the 15-year-old blockchain since it theoretically would facilitate the development of programmable layer-2 networks similar to those that are being used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to make transactions cheaper and faster. Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code \u2013 seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the hours leading up to the next Federal Reserve meeting, investor pessimism has hit Bitcoin and Ethereum hard.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC has dropped 7.6% and ETH is down 6% over the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin price is hovering around $57,000, while the Ethereum price is stuck at just under $2,900, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe volatility has been hellish for derivatives traders. In the past 24 hours, $457 million worth of crypto futures positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass. And no big surprise, $392 million of those were long contracts.\n\nTraders opening futures contracts are essentially placing bets on future price action. To be long on an asset is to bet the price will go up. And to be short on it is to bet it'll go down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it's not just blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have been impacted. Sagging prices have been widespread throughout the market. In fact, out of the whole top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinGecko, just a few assets have escaped the sea of red, barring stablecoins that have managed to maintain their pegs, such as Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee will publish its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.. Back in February, investors seemed certain that May would be the month that the FOMC finally cut interest rates\u2014which is usually a bullish sign for risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThat's because lowered interest rates usually coax traders out of U.S. Treasuries to chase gains in riskier assets, like equities and crypto assets.\n\nThe Fed's key interest rate currently stands at a high of 5.25% to 5.5% and has been unchanged since July 2023 as the central bank aims to curb inflation. Policymakers have been keeping a close eye on inflation, which is currently 3.5%, in hopes to get it closer to 2% before considering rate reductions. But that's becoming a distant hope, as last month inflation increased to the highest it's been since September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTraders had a small jolt of hope in March, when the Swiss Central Bank announced it was cutting interest rates. \u201cFor some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability,\u201d the central bank wrote in its decision at the time. But it seems the sentiment in Switzerland hasn't spread to other major central banks.\n\nJust a month ago, traders seemed certain that the Fed might lower interest rates in June, according to the CME Fed Watch tool. But sentiment has soured. Traders don't expect to see the Fed ease interest rates until December\u2014and even then it's just a 75% majority that seem to feel that way."

        "title": "If the SEC Thinks Ethereum Is a Security, Are ETH ETFs Doomed? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?\n\nOptimism among market participants is fading\u2014and now that the SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.\n\n\u201cIf this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,\u201d Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security\u2014and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant\u2019s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency\u2019s position on ETH.\n\nWhile the long-term impact of SEC\u2019s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren\u2019t happening\u2014at least, not without another legal fight.\n\nSpot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January\u2014but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.\n\nStill, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week\u2019s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC\u2019s now-evident position on ETH\u2019s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren\u2019t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that\u2019s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said.\n\nYes dif rules, 33 act for commodities \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 29, 2024\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear, though, that the SEC\u2019s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers\u2014at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved.\n\nVan Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved \u201cin time.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that Van Eck\u2019s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week\u2019s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.\n\n\u201cThis has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"
