        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin recently discussed a technology that could significantly enhance Ethereum's main network. This technology involves switching Ethereum's current system to \"Verkle trees,\" making the network more \"zk-friendly\" \u2014 in other words, more compatible with zero-knowledge proofs, which are methods of proving knowledge of some information without revealing that information itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin points out the current limitations with \"keccak Merkle Patricia trees,\" part of Ethereum's underlying structure. The main issue is the enormous \"witness sizes\" \u2014 the amount of data needed to prove a transaction \u2014 which can be up to 300 MB. Such sizes are impractical for processes that need to be lean and efficient, like zero-knowledge proofs.\n\n\"Verkle trees,\" on the other hand, are designed with zero-knowledge proofs in mind. They use a different type of cryptographic technique and are based on a specific kind of mathematical curve that is better suited for this purpose. The switch to Verkle trees would assist the application of zero-knowledge proofs to Ethereum's Layer 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvancements in the aforementioned technology by Polygon's zkEVM Type 1 were acknowledged. The network processes proofs quickly with the requisite computational power. The Ethereum community leans toward adopting Verkle trees rather than adjusting the existing system as suggested in proposals like EIP-3102.\n\nEnhancements that improve efficiency and scalability typically have a positive impact on the value of digital assets. However, implementing Verkle trees could lead to faster transactions and lower costs, which may attract more users and developers to the Ethereum network. This increased activity and demand could, in turn, push the price of Ethereum upward."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a rapid price decrease, a fascinating development emerged: Ethereum whales began to accumulate massive amounts of ETH, showcasing a strategic play in the face of uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe term \"whale\" is used to describe individuals or entities that hold a significant amount of a cryptocurrency, and their recent action in the wake of a broader market downturn has prompted attention and speculation across the crypto community.\n\nAs the Ethereum price sharply fell to lows of $2,850 on April 13, on-chain data captured a strategic accumulation made by an ETH whale or large holder.\n\nAccording to Spot On Chain, the Ethereum Whale \"0x435\" spent 70 million USDC to buy 23,790 ETH as Ethereum fell to nearly $2,942.\n\nDespite the recent 8% correction in the $ETH price (24H), whales are still buying $ETH!\n\n\n\n1. Whale 0x435 spent 70M$ USDC to buy 23,790 $ETH at ~$2,942 4 hours ago:\n\n\n\n\u2022 In total, the whale has accumulated 60,808 $ETH ($191M) from #Binance and DEX in the past 15 hours, after each\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ujZRULGAkX \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 14, 2024\n\nBased on data from on-chain sources, the whale's buying frenzy began days ago, when the ETH price began to plummet, and included withdrawals from Binance and decentralized exchanges.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports one of the said whale transactions, which involved a withdrawal of 37,018 ETH worth $120.7 million from Binance.\n\nThe said whale has accumulated 60,808 ETH worth $191 million from Binance and DEX following each sharp drop in the last 24 hours and has withdrawn 62,141 ETH worth $202.6 million from Binance in the past five days.\n\nCurrently, the whale has 85,931 ETH worth $278 million, as well as $136 million in USDT and USDC stablecoins in Aave.\n\nThe whale's actions coincided with a broader trend of Ethereum accumulation by large holders. Another mysterious whale, a fresh wallet tagged as \"0xE347,\" was said to have withdrawn 7,300 ETH worth $23.8 million from Binance and transferred it to Pendle Finance. A cVault.finance deployer paid 6 million DAI to buy 2,018 ETH for almost $2,973, according to Spot On Chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 6.05% in the last 24 hours to $3,060, up from intraday lows of $2,911, mirroring the broader crypto market crash. Ethereum declined for three days in a row from highs of $3,617 to lows of $2,850 on April 13 before slightly recovering."

        "content": "Aligned Layer, a startup touted as a \u201cuniversal verification layer for Ethereum,\u201d confirmed Sunday, April 14, that it raised $2.6 million in seed funding.\n\nLemniscap, a seven-year-old firm that has backed multiple companies in the crypto blockchain space, led the effort. The firm previously led the $2.4-million funding round for web3 startup Safary in January.\n\nBankless Ventures and Paper Ventures are also backing Aligned Layer, along with StarkWare, O(1)Labs and Ingonyama CEO Omer Shlomovits.\n\nAligned Layer announced the capital raise via social media. See below.\n\n1. We're excited to announce that we've raised $2.6M in our Seed Round, led by @Lemniscap , to enable developers to access affordable and fast proof verification for all proof systems.\n\n\n\nAligned Layer helps Ethereum become a better, faster and cheaper settlement layer for validity\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pFCOFRAh8R \u2014 Aligned Layer (@alignedlayer) April 14, 2024\n\nAligned Layer is touted as the first decentralized ZK Proof verification layer for Ethereum. It\u2019s also powered by Eigen Layer \u2014 a restaking mechanism that allows ETH stakers to reallocate their staked ETH and Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to improve security for other protocols.\n\nYou might also like: Blockchain fraud group strikes again, launches fresh scheme on Blast network\n\nAligned Layer goals\n\nThe company will put the proceeds of the capital raise toward expanding its operations and accelerating Aligned Layer\u2019s mainnet launch, scheduled for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAs an infrastructure provider, Aligned Layer aims to lower costs and improve speeds for developers that are building applications like L2s, or layer-2 networks.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to our team\u2019s shared dedication to making Ethereum the most cost-effective and efficient platform for ZK verification by using Eigen Layer,\u201d Aligned Layer co-founder Roberto Jos\u00e9 Catal\u00e1n said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe seed round also included participation from several angel investors, including Sreeram Kannan, Brandon Kase, Daniel Lubarov, DCbuilder, Chainyoda, Weikeng Chen, Sam Benyakoub, Lucas Kozinski and Peter Fittin (SizeChad). See below.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SizeChad/status/1779570022664245589\n\n\u201cAt Aligned Layer, we firmly believe that developers should be able to use the proof system that best suits their needs, without being constrained by the settlement layer,\u201d Catal\u00e1n added.\n\nThe funds are expected to give the company enough runway to execute near-term goals.\n\nThe Aligned Layer funding comes on the heels of a busy week for crypto venture capitalists. New York-based Monad Labs, for example, scored $225 million in funding as part of a round led by Paradigm. Monad is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine but can process transactions using the same set of rules faster.\n\nThere was also Bitcoin layer-2 network Mezo. The startup raised $21 million in a Pantera-led funding round.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, global investors put $2.5 billion into crypto-related startups, according to PitchBook.\n\nHowever, investors don\u2019t appear to be warming up to blockchain-related gaming companies. According to data from DappRadar, the sector secured $288 million in funding for the first quarter of 2024. That\u2019s a 57% decrease compared to the previous three-month period."
