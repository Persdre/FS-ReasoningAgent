        "content": "Movement Labs successfully raises $38 million in Series A funding, driven by the leadership of Polychain Capital. The investment will fuel the development of Movement L2, a cutting-edge layer-2 blockchain that promises enhanced security and efficiency for Ethereum transactions.\n\nThis initiative leverages the Move programming paradigm, initially developed by Facebook, to offer a robust alternative to traditional blockchain environments.\n\nFounders Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, young visionaries and former Vanderbilt students, are at the forefront of this innovative venture. They aim to integrate the Move Virtual Machine into Ethereum\u2019s expansive ecosystem. This move is anticipated to reduce transaction costs while boosting transaction processing speeds.\n\ngmove.\n\n\n\nemotional day for us at movement labs across all verticals as we announce our $38M series A,\n\n\n\nbefore we get into it, i want to talk a bit about where we came from 1/ \u2014 rushi (@rushimanche) April 25, 2024\n\nAddressing Industry Challenges\n\nThe drive for adopting Move stemmed from the persistent security challenges within the blockchain sector. Historical data reveals that between 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to siphon off approximately $5.4 billion across various protocols.\n\nMovement Labs\u2019 new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is designed to mitigate such risks by allowing developers to deploy verified code, preventing prevalent attack vectors like reentrancy attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the Move programming language incorporates techniques such as parallelization to manage multiple transaction streams effectively. This feature fortifies the network against potential security threats.\n\nThe funding round drew support from multiple venture capital firms, indicating strong confidence in Movement Labs\u2019 approach to blockchain security. Participants included notable names like Hack VC, Placeholder, and Aptos Labs. These partnerships underscore a collective commitment to advancing secure and efficient blockchain technology.\n\nMovement Labs is poised to launch the testnet phase of Movement L2 this summer, marking a milestone in their journey towards a decentralized and secure blockchain infrastructure. The introduction of the Move Stack and a shared sequencer further illustrates the company\u2019s dedication to innovation and scalability in blockchain technology.\n\nBy prioritizing decentralization from the outset, Movement Labs sets a new standard for layer-2 networks. This strategic direction enhances Ethereum\u2019s security and functionality and supports the broader adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors."

        "content": "Crypto stalwart joins industry offensive regulator moves to legally define Ethereum.\n\nSEC signalled it is poised to make a move on MetaMask.\n\nStaking is new front in legal war between DeFi and Washington.\n\nConsensys has joined the anti-SEC brigade.\n\nOn Thursday, Consensys, the company behind the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly waging a \u201ccampaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe firm, which is led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has locked arms with Coinbase, Greyscale, and the Blockchain Association in the vanguard of crypto industry stalwarts that have challenged the agency\u2019s three-year campaign to clamp down on digital assets.\n\nIn the process, Consensys hopes to protect its own position and one of its crown jewels \u2014 MetaMask, a wallet provider with 30 million users.\n\nAd hoc enforcement\n\nConsensys alleged the SEC is unlawfully deploying \u201cad hoc enforcement actions against Consensys and others.\u201d\n\nIn its lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas, Consensys said the SEC is trying to legally define Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe move alarms industry players because it would force projects to register Ethereum-linked tokens the same way traditional firms do with stocks and bonds.\n\nFor the crypto community, this is anathema because they consider blockchain-based assets as a separate class that deserves its own statutory regime, and rules and regulations. This idea is at the heart of Coinbase\u2019s defence against a lawsuit brought last year by the SEC.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nNew front\n\nStaking has opened a new front in the battle between the SEC and the industry since Ethereum switched to a Proof of Stake consensus method for maintaining its blockchain in 2022.\n\nThe SEC has been on a warpath to define Ethereum as a security ever since the network introduced staking that year.\n\nStaking refers to earning rewards from a blockchain network by locking up a cryptocurrency to support the network\u2019s validating nodes.\n\nA person familiar with the case explained that the crypto company had considered several options before moving to file.\n\nCertain elements of the SEC\u2019s investigation into the Ethereum protocol compelled Consensys to defend itself and the ecosystem before the Commission did any real damage, the person said.\n\nConsensys\u2019 complaint came after the SEC notified it was preparing to sue the firm over MetaMask, one of the industry\u2019s most widely used crypto wallets.\n\nThe SEC alleged in its notification that given MetaMask\u2019s \u201cswap\u201d and \u201cstake\u201d features, which let users trade cryptocurrencies and earn rewards on their holdings, Consensys is operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer, according to the filing.\n\n\u2018Ethereum is not a security\u2019\n\nConsensys says the non-custodial wallet is akin to a web browser rather than a trading platform like an exchange.\n\n\u201cAny investigation or enforcement action premised on Consensys operating as a \u2018broker\u2019 under the Exchange Act through its MetaMask wallet software would exceed the SEC\u2019s authority,\u201d said the complaint.\n\nThe crypto firm is asking the court to find that Ethereum is not a security, a move that would ripple across the industry.\n\nThat\u2019s because the SEC has made a series of legal attacks against some of the biggest firms in the industry.\n\nCoinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange, and the SEC are locking horns after the commission alleged that Coinbase is also operating as an unlicensed broker and exchange.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC notified Uniswap, crypto\u2019s largest decentralised exchange platform, that it was operating as an unlicensed broker.\n\nNow, the SEC appears to be turning to peer-to-peer protocols and applications.\n\nLiam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent.
