Balchunas previously stated that he could not see a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved but spot Ether ETFs are not. He compared the two cryptocurrencies, saying that \"Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nThe earliest deadline for spot Ethereum ETFs decision is in May later this year for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs. The SEC must make decisions on these applications by various dates ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) gained 8.5% over the past 24 hours, and rallied over 15% in the past week, breaking above the $2.5K level, as investors speculate on the potential of a spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.BF= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler fired warning shots to the crypto industry, casting doubt over whether digital coin ether would follow next in the footsteps of bitcoin to receive approval for an exchange-traded fund. After the bitcoin ETF approval, prices for ether \u2014 the token linked with Ethereum \u2014 spiked to their highest level since May 2022. That was because investors are betting on an ether \u2014 or ETH \u2014 ETF to be rubberstamped by the SEC next. The agency is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC has long been an opponent of cryptocurrencies, and its bitcoin ETF approval in no way changed its stance in a big way. After the ETF decision, Gensler issued a statement in which he called bitcoin \"speculative\" and said it could be used for \"illicit\" purposes. One comment poured cold water over hopes of an ETH ETF. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\" Gensler said Wednesday after the SEC decision on the ETFs.\n\nCrypto as commodities or securities?\n\nA long-running debate in the U.S. is over whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or as commodities. Key to Gensler's comments was his reference that bitcoin's status as a \"non-security commodity\" was one of the reasons why the SEC was comfortable approving the ETF. Gensler made clear that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\" in the SEC's view. This complicates matters for an ETH ETF. \"One distinction which I think people have to look at which is that bitcoin clearly has been bucketed as a commodity, Ethereum, there's still some question. Is it a security? Is it a commodity? And I think until that's resolved, it cannot be look at exactly like the bitcoin product, in terms of how do you structure and ETF around it,\" Bill Tai, chairperson of Aktai, told CNBC in an interview at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz. Tai said that approving an ETH ETF is \"not as clear cut\" as was the case of bitcoin. \"I do think that it's not out of the range of possibility, but there are additional factors to consider around that one because of its classification,\" Tai said. Securities and commodities are regulated under different laws and by different agencies.\n\nWill an ETH ETF happen this year?\n\nCommentators are split on when an ETH ETF may come to the market. Some, like Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, think it will happen this year. \"I'd watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn't long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream. Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,\" Trenchev told CNBC by email. \"You'd have to say now that bitcoin has knocked down the door it's only a matter of when not if others will follow \u2014 most likely in 2024 \u2014 and ETH is definitely the leader of the pack.\" Christopher Giancarlo, co-founder of the digital dollar project and former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures in 2017. He said that, in his experience at the regulator, the approval of one product opens the doors for others. \"Once we greenlighted bitcoin futures, there as a tremendous movement in the CFTC jurisdiction area for greenlighting ethereum futures and that did come 18 months later,\" Giancarlo told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he would be \"shocked\" if there weren't growing demand for an ether ETF. \"The SEC's going to have deal with the growing demand for that product,\" Giancarlo added. Others are a little more skeptical that the SEC could approve an ETH ETF in the short term.\n\nwatch now"
