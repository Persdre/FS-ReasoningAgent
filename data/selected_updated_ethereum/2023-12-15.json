        "title": "Ethereum community approves first-ever compliant tokenization standard, ERC-3643 - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The new token standard allows anonymous credentials to ensure only eligible users can access tokens.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Ethereum community has approved the ERC-3643 standard. This standard is the first-ever designed specifically for compliant tokenization. This new standard improves upon the widely used ERC-20 standard, particularly in securities activities. It enhances ERC-20 tokens with controlled advanced functions and compliance modules.\n\nJoachim Lebrum, Chair of the Technology Working Group ERC-3643 Association, stated that:\n\n\u201cThe ERC3643 standard is a groundbreaking step towards integrating advanced blockchain solutions into the enterprise sector, and this validation sends echoes across the ecosystem that ERC3643 is the superior standard for such use cases.\u201d\n\nERC-3643 is a permissioned token standard for tokenizing securities, real-world assets (RWAs), payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard uses a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework to verify users\u2019 token eligibility dynamically. This feature ensures compliance through anonymous but verifiable credentials.\n\nThe new ERC-3643 standard sets out to revolutionize how companies leverage blockchain technology. It provides them with a secure, compliant framework to tokenize various assets. Ethereum\u2019s official recognition of this standard demonstrates its goals to address users\u2019 diverse needs. It also establishes a benchmark for institutions implementing this framework in tokenization projects.\n\nCompanies now have an approved standard to actively deploy to bring real-world assets onto blockchains while integrating the necessary compliance controls and permissions.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict the momentum behind asset tokenization will accelerate. HSBC\u2019s research group forecasts the market for tokenized assets will swell to trillions of dollars by 2030. Governments and significant investment funds are demonstrating growing interest in this area. The next wave of tokenization will likely see bonds, equities, and other mainstream financial assets transitioning to blockchain-based models."

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service now fully decentralized as DAO takes control - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has achieved decentralized governance, according to a message from the project\u2019s creator on Dec. 14.\n\nENS is a naming system for the Ethereum blockchain that adds human-readable names to various resources, including crypto wallets and websites. Until now, the project\u2019s root node was managed by members of the Ethereum community.\n\nNick Johnson, ENS founder, endorsed the change in ownership. He wrote on X:\n\n\u201c[This is] truly the end of an era. Here\u2019s the message I just sent to the ENS root keyholders, requesting the transfer of the last of their powers to the DAO.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attached email stated that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of ENS, which is a governance group formed and controlled by ENS token holders, voted unanimously to acquire control of the project\u2019s root node.\n\nHe said that, in response to those voting results, he created a transaction to execute two actions that transfer root control to the DAO address (wallet.ensdao.eth). He wrote that this transaction transfers all remaining multisig responsibilities to the DAO, thereby \u201cretiring the multisig entirely.\u201d It is unclear whether the other multisig owners have approved the transaction.\n\nIndividuals who previously managed ENS\u2019 multisig include Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov, Metamask\u2019s Dan Finlay, MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan, Colony\u2019s Aron Fischer, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Jason Carver and Martin Swende, and Johnson himself. Johnson addressed those individuals in his message, writing: \u201cThank you so much \u2026 for your service to ENS over the years.\u201d\n\nENS governance will be more open\n\nENS\u2019 DAO is a governance group comprising token holders that vote on decisions and issues related to the project by staking tokens.\n\nAccording to the latest proposal, the DAO already has several ownership responsibilities but did not have control over the core ENS root name until now.\n\nThe DAO will gain specific capabilities by controlling the ENS root. The ownership change will allow the DAO to create, manage, and permanently lock top-level domains apart from the permanent and unchangeable .eth domain. It will also allow the DAO to update reverse resolutions that map addresses back to a name. The DAO may also introduce primary domain names on layer-2 networks.\n\nA snapshot indicates that voting concluded on Dec. 15, 2023. Virtually 100% of the staked tokens, or 1.9 million ENS, were staked in favor of DAO ownership. Johnson was one of the largest voters, staking 155,000 ENS in favor. Less than 17 ENS tokens were staked against the plan or were used to abstain.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great 2023, so has Ethereum (ETH), the second-most traded and recognizable crypto coin in the world. Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what promises to be a significant 2024 for cryptocurrency, analysts around the world have turned bullish on it. There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024. Also, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, with markets widely betting on rate hikes having come to an end and the first rate cut as early as first-quarter 2024, the crisis for crypto may have been averted.\n\nEthereum has already started to make good of the state of the market, and it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.
