If the situation does not change by the end of the day, one can expect a breakout to the $3,000 zone.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nOn the bigger time frame, one should pay attention to yesterday's bar's low. If the candle closes near it or below, the fall may continue to the vital area of $3,000 shortly.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nFrom the midterm point of view, the rate of ETH is far from key levels, which means neither buyers nor sellers are ready for a sharp move.\n\nIn this case, ongoing sideways trading in the zone of $2,900-$3,100 is the more likely scenario.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,074 at press time."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been dropping recently, following a second rejection from the $4,000 resistance level, and it has yet to recover.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been making lower highs and lows since failing to break the $4,000 level to the upside a while ago. The market has also broken below the 200-day moving average, around the $3,100 mark.\n\nThe price is currently retesting the 200-day moving average but is seemingly getting rejected to the downside. As things currently stand, the cryptocurrency seems likely to drop toward the $2,700 support level in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart demonstrates a zoomed-in view of the recent price action. As evident, the downtrend has recently been aggravated to the downside, with the market briefly breaking below the $3,000 support level.\n\nYet, following an oversold signal by the RSI, the price has recovered above the mentioned support zone. However, the price seemingly lacks the momentum to continue higher and might be on the verge of a deeper decline toward the $2,700 area.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Exchange Reserve\n\nDuring the Ethereum downtrend in the last few weeks, many analysts have been looking for signs of capitulation that point to a potential bottom. Some signals are becoming evident.\n\nThis chart displays the Ethereum Exchange Reserve metric, which measures the amount of ETH held in exchange wallets. An increase shows potential selling pressure, while a decline indicates a decrease in supply.\n\nFollowing the recent brief decline below the $3,000 level, the exchange reserve metric has experienced an increase above its 30-day moving average. This might indicate the beginning of the capitulation phase, as many investors\u2019 stop losses were below the $3,000 level."
