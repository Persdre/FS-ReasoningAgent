        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nToken trading on Solana decentralized exchanges briefly flipped that of Ethereum exchanges in December as meme coin mania raged, and now it\u2019s happened again\u2014this time ascribed to an impending token airdrop.\n\nAs of Sunday night, rolling 24-hour trading volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) topped Ethereum exchanges, according to data from DeFi Llama, with about $705 million on Solana during the span compared to $698 million on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is back on top as of this writing, but the networks remain close: DeFi Llama shows about $742 million in Ethereum DEX trading over the last 24 hours, while Solana remains steady right around $705 million. Ethereum is well ahead in terms of seven-day volume, however, at $8.9 billion compared to less than $4.5 billion for Solana.\n\nEven so, the recent short-lived reversals show that the long-dominant Ethereum is facing increasing pressure from Solana, as the rival chain offers much cheaper and faster transactions. That was the case in December when trading on Solana meme coins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) helped spike DEX volume.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, the culprit appears to be the impending launch of JUP, the official token of the popular Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter. It\u2019s set to debut on Wednesday with nearly a million wallets eligible to claim a share of JUP tokens.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Solana trading volume on Jupiter topped that of leading Ethereum DEX Uniswap V3 late Sunday, though much like with the broader chains, those places have already swapped as of Monday morning.\n\nUniswap V3 has over $629 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, while Jupiter has about $571 million in DEX trading on Solana during that span.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any recent trading will actually factor into Jupiter airdrop eligibility, however, as the protocol took a snapshot of early users on November 2. It said that some 955,000 wallets would be eligible for the eventual drop, which is now set to take place on Wednesday. However, Jupiter has additional tokens planned for future airdrops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJupiter\u2019s launchpad was used for last week\u2019s WEN meme coin drop as a test run ahead of the JUP drop. More than a million wallets were eligible for the WEN airdrop, though the claim only lasted until Monday morning\u2014with over 280 billion WEN left unclaimed.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethereum Insider and former advisor Steven Nerayoff recently touched on his time working with Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin. As part of his comments, Nerayoff used certain adjectives to describe the duo while also revealing some things they had both done to dampen his reputation.\n\nVitalik An \u201cIdiot\u201d And Lubin A \u201cSociopath\u201d\n\nNerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he thought Vitalik was an \u201cidiot\u201d and Lubin a \u201csociopath.\u201d He further questioned the former\u2019s capabilities, stating that Vitalik being a \u201ccalculator\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he can build a protocol. Meanwhile, The Ethereum insider believed Lubin was a sociopath, which was a major reason he left him after starting ConsenSys.\n\nGiving further insights into his time working with Vitalik and Lubin, the former Ethereum advisor mentioned that he started getting \u201cbad vibes,\u201d especially when he was reviewing the \u201centire organization to save it.\u201d This was what reportedly prompted him to keep a record of everything, including key conversations.\n\nNerayoff wasn\u2019t on the technical side, so he said that he didn\u2019t have \u201cconcrete info\u201d on what was going on in the Ethereum ecosystem then. However, that has changed, as he claims that, due to his research and having to defend himself in court, he is well aware of what Vitalik and Lubin have done. By trying to take him out, \u201cthey created their worst nightmare,\u201d Nerayoff said.\n\nETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHow Ethereum Founders Created Their Worst Nightmare\n\nNerayoff alleged that Vitalik and Lubin had tried to imprison him for helping them. Nerayoff is known to have been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for extortion, although it was later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence. As such, he seemed to have been suggesting that Vitalik and Lubin had a hand in the legal ordeal he went through.\n\nThis could explain why the former Ethereum advisor is on a mission to get justice and see that the Ethereum founders are brought to book. Before now, Nerayoff had threatened to expose \u201ccriminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.\u201d Then, his remarks suggested that Vitalik Buterin was one of the criminals he was referring to.\n\nIn a more recent statement, Nerayoff highlighted how Vitalik had obtained a Montenegro passport, noting that the country happens to be one of the foremost non-extradition countries. Nerayoff promises that he will soon reveal all the evidence he has against the Ethereum founders.\n\nDespite all the allegations Nerayoff has made, neither Vitalik nor Lubin has yet to come out to deny them. The Ethereum insider stated that this just proves their guilt, as they would have come out to defend themselves if they weren\u2019t.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking, as proposed by the Ethereum-based middleware protocol EigenLayer, involves reusing staked ETH tokens to secure other protocols. Proponents of restaking believe it can be used to amplify trust across networks, while detractors are worried about its possible ramifications.\n\nRead on to learn what Ethereum restaking is, how it works, and the pros and cons of restaking ETH tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBefore we can delve into restaking, we need to understand staking digital assets in PoS networks.\n\nStaking refers to network participants locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency on-chain to secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nOn Ethereum, it means locking up 32 ETH into a validator, which acts as an economic incentive for validators to act honestly when verifying transactions. In this process, a validator commits to producing Ethereum blocks and maintains the integrity of the Ethereum network. The economic incentive for validators is earning ETH rewards.\n\nHowever, if they attempt to manipulate the network or act dishonestly, they are penalized and stand to lose their staked ETH in an act called slashing.\n\nEthereum restaking refers to simultaneously using your staked ETH to secure other protocols and earn rewards. In other words, you are depositing your already staked ether tokens in another protocol to extend the same trust generated by Ethereum\u2019s validators to the new protocol.\n\nDuring this process, your ETH will remain staked on Ethereum, and validators will continue confirming transactions, but your staking power will now expand to other protocols. Restakers will earn additional rewards for their ETH stake but will be penalized or \u201cslashed\u201d for failing to perform their staking duties.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Restaking Work?\n\nEigenLayer\n\ndeploys smart contracts on Ethereum so ETH stakers can restake their assets on external protocols. EigenLayer acts as the conduit through which you can restake your staked ETH tokens, as well as a decentralized trust marketplace for stakers looking to compound their yields.\n\nEigenLayer provides two ways to restake: native restaking or LSD restaking.\n\nNative restaking allows you to restake your ETH stake directly to EigenLayer by assigning your validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts (EigenPod).\n\nLSD restaking is you restaking your liquid-staked tokens. You can stake ETH on liquid-staking platforms such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is less complicated and has a lower barrier of entry than running your Ethereum validator. You can then restake your liquid-staked tokens.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nallows you to stake Lido ETH (stETH), Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH), and more liquid staked assets.\n\nHow to Restake Ethereum\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how you can restake your ETH.\n\nSet up a Web3 wallet: Get a Web3 wallet to allow you to interact with DeFi protocols and dApps. If you have already staked ETH on liquid staking platforms, you can deposit it directly into the wallet. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer App: Navigate to app.eigenlayer.xyz and connect your wallet to the protocol. The page will display the assets supported on EigenLayer and the TVL of each locked in the smart contracts. Select a restaking option: Choose the method of restaking that works for you. If you are a validator running your node, then native restaking is optimum. Alternatively, you can select your preferred liquid staking token and input the desired amount. Confirm your transaction: Confirm your deposit on EigenLayer and in-wallet to ensure the transaction is complete.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Restaking Ethereum\n\nHere, we explore several benefits and drawbacks of restaking Ethereum for validators, protocols, and developers.\n\nPros\n\nAdditional rewards: The most obvious advantage of Ethereum restaking for a validator is the ability to compound staking rewards by staking ETH on other protocols.\n\nReducing the start-up cost of new protocols: By restaking Ethereum\u2019s pool of assets, new protocols can benefit economically from Ethereum\u2019s security offerings without starting their validation services.\n\nProtocols can retain sovereignty: By building on EigenLayer, protocols will have the flexibility to customize their architecture without adhering to the rigid rules imposed on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.\n\nCons\n\nSlashing: When you stake ETH, you are exposed to slashing as an economic consequence of bad behavior. Staking amplifies the risk, and you could lose staked ETH if you engage in malicious activity on a secondary protocol.\n\nRisk to Ethereum performance: Restaking opponents fear that with Ethereum\u2019s computational power being redirected to secondary networks, there could be a computational overload on Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\n\nCentralization risks: Restaking protocols like EigenLayer may attract ETH stakers with the promise of high yields, resulting in the rise of centralized networks and a decline in individual ETH stakers.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile still in its early stages, Ethereum restaking is an interesting approach to network security and validation and how users can actively contribute to both.\n\nEthereum restaking may set the precedent on how blockchain protocols incorporate the power of collective participation and pooled economic incentives to shape the future of decentralized finance."

        "content": "Sei Labs is rolling out an upgrade that it hopes will attract Ethereum developers.\n\nHowever, it is not the only layer 1 competing in the crowded market.\n\nSei Labs, the company behind the layer 1 blockchain Sei, is betting on its Sei v2 upgrade to attract developers and remove barriers for those looking to deploy DeFi protocols on its blockchain.\n\nIt will allow developers to deploy protocols from Ethereum \u2014 the biggest blockchain ecosystem with over $57 billion worth of DeFi deposits \u2014 on Sei without having to reconfigure their code.\n\n\u201cGoing to a new execution environment is very risky,\u201d Sei co-founder Jay Jog told DL News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t completely understand it, and you create even one small, tiny bug, that could result in your entire smart contract getting completely drained.\u201d\n\nInvestor deposits ($) in Sei, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nSei v2 is scheduled to go live in the first half of 2024 and will remove that risk for developers, Jog said.\n\nSei Labs is betting that Ethereum developers will opt to build on faster blockchains like Sei as the industry is growing more focused on interoperability, referring to the push to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems.\n\nTapping into Ethereum\n\nEthereum is currently where the vast majority of blockchain development takes place. A recent report from Electric Capital found that 71% of smart contract code was initially deployed on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough Ethereum is the birthplace for the majority of blockchain code, developers also frequently opt to deploy their projects on alternative blockchains that boast higher speeds and reduced transaction fees.\n\nBlockchains like Solana or Cardano have had a hard time attracting Ethereum developers because they use software that is incompatible with Ethereum\u2019s. Solana uses its own custom-made solution, while Cardano uses a UTXO model.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis has created an opportunity for Sei and similar projects looking to court Ethereum devs.\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 blockchain built on top of Solana, and Monad, a yet-to-be-launched blockchain, also offer Ethereum developers routes to deploy their code on a more performant blockchain without having to make alterations to it.\n\n\u2018The EVM is here to stay\u2019\n\nCurrently, blockchains fall into one of two broad categories: those that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 or EVM for short \u2014 and those that are not.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains make it easy for Ethereum developers to build on them, but many of those chains are prone to transaction congestion and high fees.\n\nWhile some EVM-compatible blockchains find a way around this using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, such blockchains are still relatively new.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains that use different software, like Sei and Solana, can achieve much higher transaction speeds.\n\nSei\u2019s answer to this situation is to upgrade its current architecture to make it fully compatible with Ethereum \u2014 a request that\u2019s at the top of developers\u2019 wishlist, Jog said.\n\n\u201cThe EVM is here to stay,\u201d Jog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the cleanest and most elegant execution environment to be using, but it is the one that has already gotten most market share.\u201d\n\nSei currently requires developers to write their protocols using programming languages like Rust or C++. But after the Sei v2 upgrade, they will be able to use languages like Solidity and Vyper that are popular with Ethereum developers.\n\nEVM parallelisation\n\nSei already achieves high transaction speeds compared to other blockchains. To maintain these high speeds while also letting developers use the EVM, Sei is implementing a technique called EVM Parallelisation.\n\nThis allows Sei to run multiple execution environments that can simultaneously process transactions instead of having to process transactions one after the other, as most blockchains do.\n\nSei is not the only blockchain leveraging EVM Parallelisation.\n\nNeon EVM also uses EVM Parallelisation to let Ethereum developers tap into Solana.\n\nInvestors deposits ($) in Neon, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nBut unlike Sei v2, where both EVM and non-EVM protocols will live on the same blockchain, Neon EVM is its own separate blockchain.\n\nThat means users must first bridge their assets to Neon EVM, introducing a point of friction, which hasn\u2019t prevented Neon from making inroads with Ethereum developers.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAave, the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum with over $7 billion worth of investor deposits, recently polled its token holders on whether it should deploy its v3 version to Neon EVM. The vote ended with over 83% of token holders signalling support.\n\nMonad, a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, is also promising developers EVM compatibility and fast transactions.\n\nBoasting a proprietary consensus algorithm, Monad claims it will achieve processing capabilities of up to 10,000 transactions per second upon its launch later this year.\n\nAlthough Neon EVM has a head start, the competition between these three EVM Parallelisation projects is only just beginning.\n\nSEI token price ($)\n\nSuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d Jog said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s been dozens of other chains where no one has gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sei Labs\u2019 focus on parallelisation, the Sei Foundation, an affiliated nonprofit that supports the Sei ecosystem, plans to launch a grants programme for those looking to develop on the Sei blockchain."
