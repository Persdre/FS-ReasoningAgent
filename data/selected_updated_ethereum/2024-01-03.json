        "content": "Solana NFT Sales Overtake Ethereum for the First Time Ever in December\n\nSolana's NFT sales volume surpassed that of Ethereum in December 2023, marking the first time this has occurred. According to data from CryptoSlam, Solana's NFT sales reached approximately $366.5 million, while Ethereum's sales totaled $353.2 million.\n\nWhen excluding wash trades, Solana's sales remained strong at $366.5 million, nearly matching its all-time high of $373.5 million set in October 2021. In contrast, Ethereum's sales were relatively flat, with December's total being comparable to November's $350 million.\n\nFurthermore, Solana saw an increased number of unique traders, with around 218,000 unique sellers and 279,000 buyers. That is nearly double the number of unique traders compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe surge in Solana's NFT sales may be attributed to the significant rise in the value of its native token, SOL, which has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. This has also led to the resurgence of the Solana ecosystem, coupled with a memecoin frenzy led by Bonk (BONK).\n\nThe influx of users and transactions on Solana may be driven by broader momentum around the network and the hype surrounding specific projects offering potential airdrops and other perks.

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is exploding in value after ETH founder Vitalik Buterin said the project is vital to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nButerin tells his five million followers on the social media platform X that all layer-2 (L2) projects should integrate with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a platform that lets users buy a \u201cdomain name\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain rather than using default addresses.\n\nThe domain names on ENS can be used to transfer and receive funds instead of using alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nSays Buterin,\n\n\u201cAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!\u201d\n\nAccording to data from blockchain data platform Dune Analytics, there are about 2.14 million active ENS names and more than 801,000 unique participants.\n\nLayer-2s, such as Optimism (OP) or Arbitrum (ARB), are built on top of Ethereum to improve scalability and costs.\n\nCCIP, or cross-chain interoperability protocol, is a protocol that allows for the resolution of information on or off-chain from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ENS was trading at a low of $8.88. After Buterin\u2019s social media post, ENS soared to $14.20, a nearly 60% gain. ENS has since given up some of those gains and is trading for $12.82 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Are Slumping Today. Here's Why. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A spot Bitcoin ETF was all but a sure thing -- has that changed?\n\nWell, that rally to end 2023 and into early 2024 had to end at some point.\n\nMany of the top cryptocurrencies in the market are reeling today, as risk assets across the board decline on a variety of headwinds. Ethereum (ETH 0.27%), Solana (SOL -1.54%), and XRP (XRP 1.99%) are among the tokens to watch for crypto investors, having declined 6.7%, 9.2%, and 8.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nA number of macro forces are driving most long-duration assets lower today. A strengthening U.S. dollar, a decline in long bonds (and corresponding surge in yields), and a widespread rotation to more defensive assets has plagued more speculative asset classes such as crypto over the past 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAdditionally, these three tokens have their own set of headwinds investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's driving this move in these three top-10 digital assets right now.\n\nI thought this was a crypto bull market -- what gives?\n\nA good portion of the recent rise in crypto assets over the past few months can be attributed to expectations about a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Expected by Jan. 10, such an ETF could pave the way for similar products for Ethereum (given there are proposals already underway) and potentially other major tokens such as Solana and XRP to follow.\n\nAccordingly, a narrative shift among many in the crypto market over the past day or so is wreaking havoc on investors relying on this catalyst. Some analysts and experts, such as Matrixport's Markus Thielen, believe that an ultimate approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF may still be a \"long shot.\"\n\nThis view appears to be spreading, with an increase in bearish bets on top cryptocurrencies driving some of the accelerated downside move today. Additionally, nearly $100 million in bullish perpetual contracts placed on Ethereum have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, as per Coinglass. XRP and Solana are also among the top five crypto tokens in terms of long liquidations today, suggesting leveraged upside bets on these tokens are turning sour.\n\nFundamentals weakening\n\nIn addition to the leveraged derivatives market, another key fundamental factor many investors consider when gauging the health of the crypto market over a specific time frame is total value locked (TVL). TVL generally reflects the amount of capital existing within specific crypto ecosystems. When times are good, capital flows into the crypto sector, and this number rises.\n\nUnfortunately, since the beginning of the year, the total TVL for all crypto projects has dropped 5.8% to $52.49 billion. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP saw similar declines in their TVL values, though these three projects have still seen their cumulative TVL numbers rally nicely off of last year's lows.\n\nWhile many still expect that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in short order (partly due to various meetings between Wall Street companies and the SEC in recent days), investors and users appear to be taking a cautious approach with their capital right now.\n\nBottom line\n\nOverall, the crypto sector, and many of its top tokens, appear to be feeling the effects of uncertainty today. At the end of the day, investing is about assessing probabilities. And up until a couple of days ago, the market seemed to be pretty certain that spot ETFs are coming in short order, leading to risk-on trades across this sector in projects that may follow Bitcoin's lead.\n\nThe expected decision date is now about a week away. Until then, I expect more volatility on the horizon, as additional leaks filter into the overall narrative for this sector."
