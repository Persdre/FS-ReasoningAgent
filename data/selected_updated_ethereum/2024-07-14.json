However, AMBCrypto found that large holders of Pepe [PEPE] seem not to share a similar sentiment.\n\nWe found this information after examining the addresses by holdings data. This indicator groups addresses into different segments and shows if they are accumulating or selling off their assets.\n\nIs the memecoin in chains?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto noticed that PEPE addresses holding tokens worth $100,000 to $10 million fell by double-digits. This decline implies that they have sold off some of their tokens within the last 30 days.\n\nThis is a surprise, primarily because PEPE is the top memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it was expected that the big wigs of the memecoin sector would give the same bullish cues as the rest of the bullish market.\n\nIf this stays the same when the spot Ethereum ETFs go live, PEPE\u2019s price might hike as a result of the development. However, it could be challenging to sustain the hike unless buying pressure increases.\n\nAt press time, the value of PEPE was. $0.0000087. This price meant that it was down 49.27% from the all-time high it hit on 27 May.\n\nGoing by the analysis above, further distribution could drag the price, and the token could be 55% down for the highs. However, post-Ethereum ETF\u2019s launch, the token might perform well on the charts.\n\nHigher highs will come later\n\nThis was the signal the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio gave. This ratio provides insights into profitability in the market.\n\nWhen the ratio rises, it means that the market cap is outpacing the realized cap. In this instance, holders of a cryptocurrency have motive to sell. However, if the ratio falls, it means that the realized cap is much more than the market cap.\n\nMost of the time, this brings about unrealized losses and there is little to no motive to sell. At the time of writing, PEPE\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was -10.90%, indicating that it experienced a poor level of demand dynamics lately.\n\nHowever, the good part is that the negative ratio might force market participants to hold on to the token. Therefore, the memecoin could be termed undervalued relative to its current market conditions.\n\nAs such, if buying pressure intensifies much later, we could see the price attempt to revisit its May highs. Despite the bearish signs pre-ETF launch, some analysts believe that the memecoin would gain from the development.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s PEPE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nOne of them is Donny Dicey, an analyst on X.

        "title": "Ethereum sees rising demand from U.S. investors \u2013 Price impact? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The increase in the Coinbase Premium Gap suggests a price increase for ETH.\n\nHowever, ETH might not reach $4,000.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, crypto investors have been buying Ethereum [ETH] in large numbers. This was evident from the trend of the Coinbase Premium Gap.\n\nThis metric measures the difference between the ETH price on Coinbase and that of Binance. When it decreases, it means that investors from America are selling ETH or refraining from buying.\n\nAmericans now trust in the altcoins\n\nBut high values, like its recent rise to 0.78 suggest strong buying pressure from the U.S. As per AMBCrypto\u2019s findings, increased exposure to Ethereum might be connected to the imminent Ethereum ETF launch.\n\nBut apart from that, it provides the altcoin price with a higher chance of increasing. For example, in March 2023, the Coinbase Premium Gap dropped to one of its lowest point ever.\n\nThis led ETH price to drop below $1,400. Fast forward to March 2024, the same metric hit a high point. At that time, ETH jumped to $4,065.\n\nAt press time, the market value of ETH was $3,194. This was a 34.70% decrease from its all-time high. However, if buying pressure continues to improve in the U.S. and other regions globally, we could see the price erase some parts of this drawdown.\n\nFurthermore, data tracked by IntoTheBlock gives context of price Ethereum can reach should accumulation intensify. The specific metric AMBCrypto looked at was the IOMAP.\n\nETH set to retest $3,437 despite neutral sentiment\n\nIOMAP stands for In/Out of Money around Price. In addition, this indicator spots buying and selling zones that are supposed to act as support or resistance.\n\nIt classifies addresses based on those making money, at breakeven point, and those out of money.\n\nThe larger the cluster of addresses at a price range, the stronger the support or resistance it offers. As of this writing, 3.56 million Ethereum addresses were in the money and purchased 2.47 million ETH at an average price of $3,140.\n\nTo the right, 2.02 million addresses bought 4.01 million ETH around $3,242, and are out of the money. Considering the larger addresses in the money, there is a chance ETH might break the resistance at $3,242.\n\nIf this is the case, the next area for the cryptocurrency to reach could be $3,347. AMBCrypto checked the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index to see if it could be a good time to buy ETH.\n\nFurther, this index ranges from o to 100. Values close to 0 indicates fear and those close to 100 indicates greed. As of this writing, the index was 39, meaning that there was neither extreme fear nor greed.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nHowever, the reading provides an opportunity to purchase the altcoin especially as the ETF launch is seemingly a bullish event.\n\nWhile the price of ETH seems in line to increase, a decrease in overall interest could invalidate the prediction."
