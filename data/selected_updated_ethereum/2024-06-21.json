        "content": "SEC's approval of S-1 forms crucial for Ethereum ETFs' public trading.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe initial date for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) trading in the US is still July 2nd, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In an X post, Balchunas doubled down on this date, highlighting that \u201ca bunch of amended S-1 Forms\u201d for those ETFs might be filed today.\n\n\u201cThen ball\u2019s in SEC\u2019s court to let issuers know about any final changes and effectiveness (aka final approval),\u201d added the analyst. On June 14th, he predicted the launch date for the first time, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nOn May 23rd, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ETF filings for eight Ethereum ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others. However, only the 19b-4 forms were approved, which acts as permission for the exchange-traded product to be created.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form, which is an initial registration required by the SEC before a security can be publicly traded, still needs approval. The first amended S-1 form came a few minutes after Balchunas\u2019 post, with Fidelity presenting the document with the adjustments ordered by the SEC.\n\nThe asset managers are not including their ETF fees on the S-1 forms, and the Bloomberg analyst assessed that they might be waiting for BlackRock to disclose \u201cto see what they need to orbit around.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart also expects all the remaining S-1 forms waiting to be amended to be filled today."

        "content": "Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire? Cathie Wood's Ether ETF Pullback And Her $20 Trillion Market Cap Prediction\n\nEarlier in the year, Bitcoin dominated financial headlines thanks to its recent halving and the emergence of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) boosting its demand. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest made a bullish prediction that Ethereum (ETH) may soon catch up to Bitcoin and potentially offer investors significant returns in the years ahead.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nDogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2013 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\n\nSpeaking at Big Ideas, an investor conference hosted by Ark Invest, Wood shared her optimistic outlook on Ethereum. She projected that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could soar to $20 trillion by 2032. Given Ethereum\u2019s current supply of approximately 122 million tokens, this projection translates to a staggering per-token price of over $166,000. Moreover, since the Ethereum Foundation continues implementing token burns, this price could rise even further.\n\nAt the hypothetical price of $164,000 per token, holding six ETH would equate to a value of just under $1 million. In comparison, the current price for six ETHs is roughly $21,000. To put this into perspective, the total market capitalization of the S&P 500 is approximately $40 trillion, while the global value of above-ground gold reserves is estimated at around $16 trillion. While reaching a $20 trillion market cap is theoretically possible for Ethereum, such a milestone is likely far off, if it happens at all.\n\nWood\u2019s optimistic forecast is primarily grounded in Ethereum\u2019s potential for mainstream adoption. Today, Ethereum is mainly used to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer services ranging from borrowing and lending to storing health records.\n\nHowever, in 2024, DeFi remains predominantly focused on small-scale financial platforms. Wood argues that if Ethereum can expand its use cases to provide substantial user benefits, broader adoption could follow, potentially driving up the token\u2019s price.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nWood\u2019s projection, while ambitious, may partly be intended to generate excitement among investors about Ethereum\u2019s future. Despite the optimism, her forecast might not materialize as predicted. It\u2019s crucial to note that Wood has a vested interest in Ethereum\u2019s success. Ark Invest, her firm, already offers an Ethereum futures ETF (ARKZ).\n\nHowever, it was reported by Bloomberg that Ark Investment withdrew from issuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Previously, Ark had submitted an application for a spot in Ether ETF in partnership with 21Shares, but Ark\u2019s name has now been removed from the filing. Despite this withdrawal, Ark\u2019s official statement emphasized the company\u2019s continued belief in Ethereum's transformative potential and long-term value. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that the decision might have been influenced by the ongoing \"fees war\" in the market, which complicates profitability for issuers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough many believed that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs would bring a boost to ETH prices, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a surprising move to approve the sale of spot Ether ETFs last month, ETH continued to slump, nearly dipping under $3,000 per token earlier this month. We've seen an incredible bounce back earlier this week, peaking at nearly $4,000 before hovering at $3,500 again.\n\nAn increase in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume would benefit Wood, particularly in relation to Ark Invest\u2019s financial products. Despite this potential conflict of interest, many investors remain optimistic about ETH\u2019s future. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow and the possibility of spot Ethereum ETFs looms, there is considerable potential for ETH to achieve new price milestones.\n\nThis story was previously published on Benzinga and has been updated.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire?
