Popular meme coin Dogecoin witnessed a steeper decline, down more than 14% since the start of the week.\n\nThe price drop triggered liquidations worth more than $140 million in the 24-hour timeframe, with nearly $100 million in long positions getting wiped out. Bitcoin liquidations topped $37 million.\n\nSurprisingly, the number of traders taking bullish long positions on Bitcoin spiked dramatically, exceeding those gunning for Bitcoin's price decline.\n\nBitcoin's Fear & Greed Index flashed \"Greed,\" reflecting a degree of FOMO in the market, and a potential surge in buying pressure.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 8:45 p.m. EDT) Kaspa (AIOZ) +8% $0.1208 THORChain (RUNE) +6.76% $5.75 Toncoin (TON) +3.67% $5.88\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.27 trillion, declining by 1.34% in 24 hours.\n\nThe U.S. equity market was a mixed bag on Wednesday.

This suggested that both asset classes were moving on separate wavelengths.\n\nThe 30-day correlation of BTC & ETH with traditional markets and commodities is currently close to 0, meaning crypto is doing its own thing right now.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/Wx8RxQwatF pic.twitter.com/8aQqAdwNQz \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) May 8, 2024\n\nPopular cryptocurrency trader Elja highlighted that Bitcoin was undervalued relative to its current network fundamentals.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s current network fundamentals indicate a 300% gain from the current level.

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- During turbulent times in the cryptocurrency market, where uncertainty looms large and volatility reigns supreme, certain tokens defy the odds and chart their path to success. Solana stands tall, riding a wave of surging momentum, while Ethereum grapples with its challenges, struggling to maintain its position amidst the chaos. Yet, amidst this backdrop of fluctuating fortunes, a beacon of excitement and opportunity emerges: Furrever Token (FURR). As Solana's meteoric rise captures headlines and Ethereum's struggles dominate discussions, FURR enters the fray with a sense of ambition and optimism fueled by the promise of its unique charm and a compelling $10,000 competition.\n\nEthereum ETF Decision Delay Sparks Volatility: SEC's Latest Move Sends ETH on a Rollercoaster Ride\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again postponed its decision on the proposed Invesco Galaxy Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), extending the deadline to July 5, 2024. This announcement has triggered a downturn in Ethereum's (ETH) price, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs. With major financial institutions like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and BlackRock also awaiting regulatory clarity, the market response has been marked by slight downward pressure on ETH, particularly among short-term traders.\n\nDespite briefly breaching the critical resistance level of $3,220, Ethereum has seen a decline of approximately 4% today. The volatility has led to significant liquidations among long traders, totaling $67.42 million, indicative of a cautious sentiment among investors amid regulatory uncertainties. As attention remains focused on further updates from regulatory authorities, Ethereum's trading volume has surged by over 66% in the past 24 hours, reaching $13.78 billion, highlighting the market's keen interest in developments impacting ETH's price.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana Surges: Breaking Trends and Charting New Heights\n\nSolana (SOL) has experienced a notable uptick in its price, currently standing at around $158.12, marking a 1.5% increase from yesterday. This surge follows a significant breakthrough that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Solana has signaled a potential reversal of its previous bearish trend by successfully breaching a key trendline resistance, instilling confidence in its upward trajectory.\n\nThe next obstacle in its path is the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), historically a formidable resistance level. Should Solana surpass this barrier, it could pave the way for further gains, potentially reaching the 50-day EMA at around $163.29. This technical achievement underscores Solana's resilience and heralds the possibility of a bullish phase, reinforcing its position as a compelling investment option in the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR)'s Path to Success: Leveraging Community Engagement and a Lucrative Competition\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is positioned on the brink of mirroring Solana's triumphs, propelled by its inventive strategy and recent strides in community engagement. With its mission grounded in fostering a warm and inclusive ecosystem, FURR has captivated investors and enthusiasts, boasting a vibrant community and rapid organic growth. Currently priced at $0.000648, FURR offers investors the potential for up to 15X returns, further enhancing its appeal in the market.\n\nThe recent unveiling of the Furrever Token $10,000 Frenzy Bonanza Competition is pivotal in FURR's journey toward success. This competition represents more than just a mere event; it embodies FURR's commitment to community involvement and excitement. Participants are invited to partake in simple tasks on the Gleam platform, accumulating points and increasing their chances of winning substantial rewards. With a $10,000 prize pool up for grabs, the competition ignites fervor within the FURR community and attracts new participants eager to be part of the excitement. However, time is of the essence, as there are only two days left to join, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging enthusiasts to act swiftly to seize this opportunity.\n\nMoreover, the competition's strategic significance extends beyond mere rewards. By incentivizing participation and rewarding community engagement, FURR aims to solidify its position as a leader in the market. The competition fosters long-term loyalty and enthusiasm among its supporters, laying the groundwork for sustained growth and success. As FURR harnesses the momentum generated by the competition, it sets its sights on a future defined by innovation, prosperity, and unwavering community support.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token $10,000 Bonanza Competition\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
