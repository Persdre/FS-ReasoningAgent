        "title": "Ethereum has burnt $12.7bn since the London hard fork. But that may be slowing down - DLNews",
        "content": "It's been 1,000 days since Ethereum first started burning transaction fees.\n\nBut the mechanism, which offsets new tokens issued on the network, is slowing down.\n\nMore efficient transactions, an explosion of activity on layer 2 networks, and the recent Dencun upgrade have all helped reduce the amount of Ether the network burns.\n\nWith the implementation of an upgrade known as EIP-1559 as part of the London hard fork in August 2021, Ethereum became the first blockchain to start burning a portion of the fees users spend on transactions.\n\nThat was 1,000 days ago.\n\nThe move, the blockchain\u2019s faithful hoped, would help counterbalance the issuance of new Ether tokens on the network, creating a more sustainable monetary policy.\n\nAnd it worked. Over the following 1,000 days, Ethereum users have burnt some 4.3 million Ether, worth over $12.7 billion just by using the network.\n\nWhen Etherum slashed Ether emissions by switching to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022, the network became deflationary \u2014 meaning more Ether was, on average, burned by the network than new Ether was issued.\n\nBut in recent months the rate at which Ethereum is burning tokens is slowing.\n\nA combination of more efficient transactions, an explosion of activity on layer 2 networks, and the recent Dencun upgrade have all helped reduce transaction fees \u2014 and thus the amount of Ether the network burns.\n\nThe lower fees are great for users. But if Ethereum can\u2019t attract enough activity to offset the drop, it could easily lose its deflationary status, potentially throwing its economic model into question.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhy is the burn slowing?\n\nWhen Ethereum users transact on the network they must pay a fee denominated in Ether.\n\nThis fee is made up of two parts: a so-called base fee charged by the network, and a priority fee, paid to block builders as an incentive to get the transaction processed faster. Ethereum burns base fees, and gives priority fees to those processing transactions.\n\nWhen activity on Ethereum increases, the network automatically raises the base fee users must pay.\n\nThe average base fee on Ethereum must stay above 23 gwei these days to ensure the network burns enough Ether from transaction fees to keep it deflationary. Gwei is a measurement for small amounts of Ether.\n\nOver the past 1,000 days, gas fees have averaged 41 gwei. If this trend continues, Ethereum\u2019s supply is set to shrink by 0.76% over the coming year.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to believe it might not.\n\nEthereum\u2019s March 13 Dencun upgrade introduced a new feature that cut the fees Ethereum layer 2s needed to pay to submit transactions to the main Ethereum network by as much as 98%.\n\nSince Dencun, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees have fallen from an average of 58 gwei on March 13, to just 7 gwei on May 2.\n\nAdditionally, more users are making the jump from Ethereum to layer 2 networks \u2014 separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum that rely on it for security.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time high of over 11 million weekly transactions in 2021, transactions on Ethereum have slowly declined to around 8 million per week at the end of March.\n\nAt the same time, weekly transactions on Arbitrum and Optimism, the two biggest layer 2s, have soared to a combined 18.5 million.\n\nWith fewer users transacting on Ethereum, the demand for transactions \u2014 and thus fees paid on the network \u2014 is falling.\n\nIncreasing gas efficiency\n\nCode improvements that reduce the amount of data smart contracts on Ethereum need to handle, should also reduce fees in the coming months.\n\nFor example, decentralised exchange Uniswap, the most frequently used Ethereum DeFi protocol which users have spent over $1.4 billion in fees transacting on, has included several optimisations for its upcoming Uniswap v4 version.\n\nV4 is expected to improve gas efficiency between swaps and liquidity operations, as well as reduce the cost of creating new liquidity pools by 99%.\n\nFuture versions of other top Ethereum protocols will likely also optimise for transaction fees.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Risk assets across the board got a boost from the Fed, with these three tokens seeing market-beating upside.\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector is getting a nice boost today from yesterday's commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The market received a jolt from Powell's commentary in a press release; he suggested the direction of the next Fed move will most likely be lower. The market had previously priced in some chance of an interest rate hike, which appears to be off the table, at least for now.\n\nWith a more accommodative monetary policy environment likely ahead, risk assets across the curve saw a big boost over the past 24 hours. Of course, the further out on the risk curve investors go, the more protracted this move can be. For top cryptos Bitcoin (BTC -3.28%), Ethereum (ETH -2.30%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -7.20%), it's meant a 24-hour move of 3.8%, 2.2%, and 4%, respectively, as of 4 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, there are some token-specific factors at play with these three tokens that investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's moving these closely watched digital assets.\n\nThe rally continues\n\nSince hitting a new all-time high right around the time of its most recent halving, Bitcoin's rally has faltered. Expectations for a potential continuation of this fall had taken hold because of economic factors that could affect the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut with interest rate hikes seemingly off the table, analysts have grown increasingly bullish on Bitcoin over the near and medium term. Lower interest rates should bring the U.S. dollar down, inflating the price of various commodities and goods that act as stores of value. For those who buy into this thesis for Bitcoin, that's a great thing. Indeed, yesterday's press conference likely had the greatest impact on Bitcoin for this very reason.\n\nEthereum's status as a commodity or store of value of sorts is also debatable. In second position in terms of market capitalization in this sector, Ethereum should benefit from a similar trend of capital flowing into cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin investors have benefited from. That's because the market is still expecting the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum ETFs at some point (though some suggest it's possible the SEC could still deem this asset a security), which should improve the supply and demand dynamics around this token. As Ethereum has shifted to a proof-of-stake protocol and taken on some deflationary measures for its token, there's a strong bull case building in the market that the same drivers that took Bitcoin on its run to record highs could be in play for Ethereum this year.\n\nDogecoin remains among the most speculative crypto assets out there, meaning it's a top choice for traders and investors looking to play short-term price swings in the market. It's no surprise that Dogecoin has seen a more pronounced move than its larger peers, for this reason alone. However, large liquidation data tied to a previous decline in these three tokens in recent days could also play a part in today's rally. Investors appear to have been looking for any reason to load up on risk and put capital to work on this dip. This recent macro catalyst appears to have provided the needed push.\n\nIs this rally poised to continue?\n\nToday's move needs to be put into context. Bitcoin declined to a low of around $58,000 per token yesterday, and while it's moving toward the $60,000 mark at the time of writing, that's still well off its all-time high of around $73,000 hit earlier this year. So, there's certainly both upside and downside potential in the near term, as this token did gap up quite quickly in short order.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin tend to follow Bitcoin's lead, so I'd say this is the token most investors should be focused on right now. I'm of the view that if a number of bullish catalysts materialize in the coming days, it's entirely possible Bitcoin could make another run at a new high, and Ethereum and Dogecoin could follow. It's just a question of whether this specific macro catalyst can be amplified by some additional news. Right now, there's not much on my radar, so I'm going to sit out this recent pop."
