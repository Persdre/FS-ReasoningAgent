        "title": "'Narrative Shift Away From ETH': Investor Justin Bons on Non-EVM L1s - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn Q4, 2023, the cryptocurrency segment is going through \"awesome\" processes as mainstream narratives are moving toward truly scalable L1s, a seasoned cryptocurrency expert says. Did EVM L2s fail to deliver on their promises?\n\nSOL, AVAX, NEAR, EGLD: Justin Bons indicates \"narrative shift\" and L2s' failure\n\nThe blockchain sphere is witnessing a major \"narrative shift\" nowadays. Instead of Ethereum (ETH), all eyes are on its L1 competitors, Cyber Capital CIO Justin Bons says in a recent X post.\n\nScalable first-layer blockchains like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Near Protocol (NEAR) and MultiverseX (formerly Elrond, EGLD) are beneficiaries of this shift.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis process is validating Ethereum's (ETH) strategy to bet on Layer 2 solutions (rollups) as a core scaling instrument, Bons concluded.\n\nAs a result of this shift, the \"blockchain trilemma\" may have finally been solved. As covered by U.Today previously, in his earliest statements, Bons appreciated the scaling opportunities of Tezos (XTZ) and The Open Network (TON).\n\nThe Cyber Capital CIO is an adamant critic of the current state of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and its L2s as well as XRP.\n\nNew Solana (SOL) summer catalyzed by retro airdrops?\n\nAccording to his views, these assets lack security and decentralization. Also, he stressed that a blockchain should make its L1 scalable instead of relying on rollups and sidechains.\n\nSolana (SOL) as a dangerous Ethereum (ETH) competitor is yet again in the spotlight for analysts in December 2023. As the blockchain exceeded Ethereum (ETH) in DEX trading and NFT sales, experts recall its 2021 rally to three-digit zones.\n\nAt the same time, the interest in Solana (SOL) is triggered by the activity of retroactive airdrop farmers. Inspired by Jito Network's (JTO) generous rewards, they are completing tasks to be eligible for Jupiter, Orca and other potential airdrop campaigns expected in Q1, 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum developers target January for the first testnet deployment.\n\nProgress made on the network increased, gas usage surged.\n\nEthereum [ETH] developers intensify testing for the upcoming Dencun upgrade, a significant milestone anticipated next year, introducing increased data storage capacity through the implementation of a process termed \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d\n\nMore updates and upgrades\n\nIn a biweekly call on 21st December, developers revealed their target date of 17th January for the Goerli test network to undergo the Dencun upgrade, to enhance layer 2 rollup efficiency and expand blockchain scalability.\n\nTim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, noted the possibility of cancellation in the event of major issues before the set date.\n\nLast 2023 AllCoreDevs call about to kick off ? Agenda: https://t.co/jVzStnpnmZ\n\nStream: https://t.co/pT6x13i7nD Will recap here later today https://t.co/YDWpJbtOma \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nMoreover, the Dencun upgrade, initially slated for Q4 2023, was rescheduled to 2024 due to the intricate engineering aspects. Developers outlined a tentative timeline for Dencun testing, intending to run through Sepolia on 31st January.\n\nNew folks, new forks\n\nAdditionally, the Goerli Shadow Fork took place with a network configuration involving 300 nodes distributed across North America, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nThe fork proceeded smoothly, and post-Dencun, the network achieved a 99% participation rate. The term \u201cparticipation rate\u201d refers to the percentage of nodes that successfully adopted the changes introduced by the fork.\n\nOnce stability was established, teams initiated a network spamming exercise with blobs, aiming for an average of 4 per block, but the network stabilized around 3 as planned.\n\nThe introduction of blobs increased the network\u2019s bandwidth usage by approximately 200 kbps, shifting from an average of 700 to 900 kbps.\n\nNotably, 95% of blobs propagated in less than 2 seconds, with an average propagation time below 500 milliseconds.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nThe news is likely to boost confidence within the Ethereum community. Moreover, it could potentially attract more users and projects to leverage the upgraded platform.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,315.75 and its price had grown by 4.15% in the last 24 hours. The overall interest in the network remained high during this period.\n\nThis was shown by the consistent gas usage on the Ethereum network. Coupled with that, the overall NFT trades occurring on the Ethereum network had also grown."

        "content": "The dates are subject to change if any unexpected bugs are discovered by developers. In the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, devs agreed to reconvene to discuss progress in the next meeting on January 4.\n\nBased on on-chain data from Santiment, Ethereum supply on exchanges as a percentage of Ether\u2019s total supply climbed from 8.07% to 8.16%. The increase in ETH tokens on the exchange platform is significant in comparison to the past three months, seen in the chart below. Mounting selling pressure could push ETH price lower.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges noted a considerable increase between December 21 and Saturday. As ETH reserves in exchange wallets climb, there is more Ether available to sell, typically increasing the selling pressure on the altcoin .\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EigenLayer \u2013 A Play in Three Acts - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from John deVadoss, the Co-founder of InterWork Alliance.\n\nAct One: From a Crisis, A New Institution Emerges\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the United States Housing and Economic Recovery Act, intended to address the subprime mortgage crisis (which had precipitated the then ongoing Global Financial Crisis), was formally signed. Two weeks later, on Monday, August 18, 2008, the domain bitcoin.org was registered.\n\nBy November 2008, Quantitative Easing was in action, and the United States Federal Reserve had started buying mortgage-backed securities. In January 2009, the code for Bitcoin was released as open-source, and by March 2009, the Federal Reserve held close to two trillion US dollars of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes.\n\nSuppose the goal was to beta-test digital currency at scale towards disintermediating secondary and tertiary financial institutions by directly linking citizens and a central bank. In that case, Bitcoin has been a spectacular success, heralding the upcoming era of CBDCs. If the goal were to make the common man conversant with digital currencies and their usage, Bitcoin would have succeeded remarkably.\n\nA revolutionary breakthrough when it was released, Bitcoin is many things to many people: a virtual currency, a new kind of money, a store of value, and the promise of freedom. But, more than anything, Bitcoin is a new monetary institution for the digital age. Bitcoin has demonstrated that digital monetary institutions are the future; it has done its job by moving the goalposts from why to when.\n\nSome see in Bitcoin and its pseudonymous creator(s), a Robin Hood-type legend, a Zorro-like hero, or a populist protagonist standing up against the system. It is not for me to deconstruct the thematic illusions, but as the old adage goes, the truth is bound to make you smile when it arrives.\n\nAct Two: The Rise of a Monolith and its Discontents\n\nBitcoin begat Ethereum, a 21st-century application platform to rival any of Silicon Valley\u2019s so-called enterprise-grade, global-scale platforms. And the Ethereum team did it all in the open, on with a crew of mostly volunteer developers spanning time zones and political and geo-political boundaries, long before working from home was a thing, shepherded by the genius of their founders and core developers.\n\nWhy Ethereum? Contrary to popular perception, Bitcoin is more than an application; it is more than the collection of technical capabilities that comprise the network and certainly more than a token. It is an institution, a self-governing institution. But it is not a platform. Bitcoin, when it was released, had a level of scripting extensibility, but it was not yet ready to enable developers to build new instances on top of it.\n\nEthereum, with its vision of being the world\u2019s computer, set out to create the definitive decentralized platform abstraction, a blockchain with built-in Turing-complete programming support, allowing developers to write smart contracts and to create decentralized protocols, services, and applications. And by any measure, the Ethereum project has been stunningly successful.\n\nProgrammable money, fiat-backed stablecoins, and the digitization of real-world assets are but some of how Ethereum has reshaped the world of monetary policy. Lending/borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and insurance are some of the financial domains in which Ethereum has helped rewrite the rules for historically highly intermediated products.\n\nAs a result of its extraordinary success, scaling has turned out to be a critical issue for the Ethereum project; it is worth noting that its scalability issues result from the project\u2019s prioritization of decentralization and security over scale. Scaling enhancements are anticipated to address network congestion and reduce transaction costs; Ethereum\u2019s gas fee problem has been a recurring theme.\n\nThere are two primary ways to scale the Ethereum network: on-chain and off-chain. On-chain refers to enhancements to the base layer and modifications to the network. Off-chain refers to the use of a separate network(s) (so-called Layer 2) to process transactions; Layer 2 networks may choose to emphasize scale over decentralization and security as they can benefit from the base network\u2019s strengths in these areas.\n\nNow, here is where things became very interesting. The so-called \u201con-chain\u201d proponents appear to be reluctant to let go, while the \u201coff-chain\u201d exponents appear to be eager to innovate. This is the classic saga of a maturing platform: how much loose coupling? How much composability? And on the other side, how much to enshrine on-chain before it becomes a net detractor for innovation?\n\nFor obvious reasons, Ethereum does not want to end up primarily as a reconciliation ledger for other Layer 2 networks and roll-ups, but at the same time, a monolithic approach imposes limits on a platform and its ecosystem and impacts a platform\u2019s ability to continue to grow its developer base. Things came to a head when Ethereum did its Merge update to Proof of Stake from Proof of Work.\n\nTrust is now a facet of staking and not mining anymore; was the value now more in the tokens and with the stakers? Or did it still lie in the underlying capabilities? And for how long? Could they be swapped out with newer, more innovative capabilities? And this leads to Act Three.\n\nAct Three: A New Economic Platform Advances\n\nEthereum begets EigenLayer, a first-of-a-kind economic platform.\n\nIn retrospect, it may appear linear, but it was genius, a first-class paradigm shift. The world may not be different with a change of paradigm, but the developer now works in a different world as they say, with a new mental model. We will look back and see a distinct transformation between decentralized applications in the Pre-EigenLayer era and those in the Post-EigenLayer era.\n\nAnd it was the Merge, with the shift to PoS that enabled EigenLayer to reframe the decentralized application model; PoW has no notion of negative incentives, but with PoS, while validators may earn rewards, their stake may also be slashed for misbehavior. With the advent of PoS, EigenLayer is able to programmatically bootstrap and scale Ethereum\u2019s trust model to guarantee economic security for a host of new protocols and services.\n\nDevelopers can secure their services without the need to create their validators, or to launch tokens, etc. The promise of loose coupling can now be extended to economic abstractions by creating markets for decentralized trust. A fascinating three-act play thus far, it remains to be seen what act four portends.\n\nJohn deVadoss is a co-founder of the InterWork Alliance, and he serves as on the Governing Board of the Global Blockchain Business Council."
