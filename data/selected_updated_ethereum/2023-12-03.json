        "title": "Cardano Not Listed in Top of Chains More Decentralized Than Ethereum: Here's Why - U.Today",
        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

        "content": "For the major period of November, the Ethereum (ETH) coin witnessed high volatility leading to a sideways trend between the $2,143 and $1,910 price levels. However, this consolidation came after a significant rally indicating the buyers could have an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum after the further rally. Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

He suggested that protocols could coexist without challenges or threats of killing each other.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cPareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok.

To put it in perspective, danksharding is an Ethereum rollup scaling method where transactional throughput is expanded through the provision of additional storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s statement on Ethereum underscores the fact that SOL and ETH can coexist and even overlap without any inconveniences.\n\nSolana Founder Douses ETH Rivalry Push\n\nDespite the growing industry eulogy for Solana, Yakovenko has warned the community members against instigating unhealthy rivalry with the Ethereum protocol.\n\nThis was when MakerDAO Co-founder and CEO Rune Christensen announced plans to fork the protocol\u2019s NewChain on the Solana blockchain, away from Ethereum. The news sparked some reactions from Solana proponents who saw the transition as a battle of the best.\n\nYakovenko immediately pointed out that it was a general win for open source. \u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIn October, one Ethereum community member identified as jebus.eth tried to take a jab at Solana by referring to it as a \u201cCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don\u2019t understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Solana co-founder was quick to respond to him, emphasizing the fact that his protocol is a pursuit of an entirely stateless digital realm, where unhindered communication and transactions flow freely among the people, liberated from the control of capitalist middlemen and government surveillance.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.
