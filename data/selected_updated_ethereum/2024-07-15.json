        "content": "Ethereum ETFs to coincide with Bitcoin Conference, potentially boosting market attention.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum ETFs are scheduled to begin trading on July 23, as reported by Bloomberg analyst.\n\nBitwise CIO projects $15 billion in inflows for Ethereum ETFs by the end of 2025.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe starting date for spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading in the US is July 23rd, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. He shared on X that the SEC is answering issuers today, asking them to return their final S-1 forms on Wednesday, July 17th.\n\n\u201cAnd then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course,\u201d he added.\n\nUpdate: Nate's instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course! https://t.co/D21FD9Qf94 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 15, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum ETF issuers filed their S-1 forms on July 8th but most of them left the fees out of their forms. According to Balchunas, this is likely a strategy from the asset managers to check how competitive the funds\u2019 fees are, especially BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form is an initial registration required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a security can be publicly traded.\n\nAs highlighted by Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart, this could mean that the Ethereum ETFs will start trading the same week as the Bitcoin Conference, set to happen in Nashville.\n\nThe launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs is a key step for crypto adoption by mainstream investors, as it solidifies the altcoin as a sound asset among institutional investors. An estimate by Bitwise CIO predicts that these investment instruments will capture $15 billion in inflows until the end of 2025, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum ETFs open the door for the approval of exchange-traded funds indexed to other crypto. VanEck and 21Shares both filed their form for the approval of the first spot Solana ETFs in the US on the last week of June."
