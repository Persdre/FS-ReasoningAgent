        "title": "Ethereum will outperform bitcoin next year and recapture market share in crypto, JPMorgan says - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": ": A photo illustration of the digital Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is seen on September 13 2018 in Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Yu Chun Christopher Wong/S3studio/Getty Images\n\nJPMorgan analysts expect ethereum to outperform bitcoin next year.\n\nA proposed network upgrade could serve as a catalyst for market share gains, they added.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan is also less bullish on bitcoin's price than others on Wall Street are.\n\nA potential network upgrade for ethereum could be bullish for the crypto next year, according to JPMorgan analysts.\n\nIn their crypto outlook for 2024, they see ethereum beating bitcoin and gaining market share.\n\n\"While we are cautious on overall crypto markets into 2024, we are looking for ethereum to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies next year helped by the forthcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding,\" they wrote on Wednesday.\n\n\"Protodanksharding\" is essentially a proposal to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second.\n\nThose changes could serve as a catalyst for ethereum to recoup its share of the crypto market by improving network activity.\n\n\"We believe that next year ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\" analysts wrote.\n\nEtherum has ridden the wave of the crypto comeback this year, up almost 90% since January. The currency now sits at $2,270. But its gains have lagged behind bitcoin, which has rocketed by around 154%.\n\nThe rally has largely been buttressed by optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will get regulatory approval soon. But JPMorgan analysts are more skeptical about the bullish bets on bitcoin.\n\nCrypto optimists believe a spot ETF approval would improve liquidity and lower the barrier of entry for more investors to invest in bitcoin without owning the currency. JPMorgan, however, thinks it's not so much new capital that would flow into the crypto as much as it is re-shuffled money from other crypto assets.\n\nAlso fueling the hype in bitcoin is the halving event scheduled for April next year, which tends to reduce the supply of the currency and lift prices. But the more bearish take by JPMorgan analysts is that the quadrennial event has been \"well factored\" into the current price, and the currency won't rally post-halving.\n\n\"We instead look for around 20% drop in the hash rate post halving as miners in higher cost locations or with less efficient hardware would be forced to exit the market,\" they wrote. \"This scenario would be more consistent with around $35k bitcoin price post halving.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "Cardano is constantly beating the \u201cghost chain\u201d claims, recently outperforming all other networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, to top the list of blockchains in chain activity.\n\nData from crypto-focused research and analytical resource Messari confirms this feat. According to Messari, Cardano currently leads in terms of chain activity over the past 24 hours. Notably, the metric employed by the platform to gauge a network\u2019s chain activity is its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nThis metric shows that Cardano beats every other mainstream blockchain network by an impressive margin. Interestingly, Cardano\u2019s 24-hour on-chain transaction volume currently stands at $23.56 billion. Notably, this represents all the transaction volume recorded yesterday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBefore now, Cardano\u2019s on-chain transaction volume averaged $9 billion every day throughout November. However, the network started witnessing an uptick in December, surging to a high of $11.32 billion on Dec. 2. This uptick persisted, with Cardano recording $29.86 billion on Dec. 9.\n\nDespite witnessing a drop in the days that followed, Cardano has maintained an intraday on-chain volume above the $18 billion mark. The recent $23.56 billion was recorded due to a new upsurge in this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, per Messari data, Bitcoin, the leading blockchain network, comes second on the list, with $13.09 billion in on-chain transaction volume, nearly half of Cardano\u2019s figure. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts network, secures third with just $5.06 billion in transaction volume.\n\nLitecoin sees a volume of $1.51 billion, while the XRP Ledger\u2019s volume only stands at $777 million. Other blockchain networks on the top ten list include Dogecoin, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Verge, and Stellar.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nIt bears mentioning that on-chain volume is different from trading volume. Trading volume refers to the total number of shares, contracts, or assets traded on a specific market, especially on exchanges, during a given period. It is typically a measure of market activity and liquidity.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain transaction volume involves the total number of transactions that occur on a blockchain. It includes all transactions, whether they involve trading, transfers, or other interactions within the network. On-chain transaction volume provides insights into the level of activity and usage of a blockchain.\n\nA high on-chain transaction volume indicates active use of a blockchain for various purposes, such as transfers, smart contract executions, and dApp interactions. This metric helps to evaluate the health and sustainability of a blockchain network, showcasing its utility beyond speculative trading.\n\nAmid the increased on-chain transaction volume, ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token, has witnessed an impressive price surge. ADA recently surged to a 19-month high of $0.68 today before facing opposition. Currently changing hands at $0.6349, the altcoin is up 42% over the past week."
