        "title": "Buying the rumor paid off for spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and Ethereum looks to be next - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs backed by actual bitcoin finally hit US exchanges on Thursday after more than a decade of attempts. So far it\u2019s done mostly nothing for bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin briefly neared $49,000 after the spot ETFs went live but it has since shed about $3,000 to retrace by 6%.\n\nThat\u2019s even slightly below where it was before the SEC\u2019s social media hacker posted an authorized approval announcement about the ETFs on Tuesday, about 24 hours before legitimate confirmation.\n\nAny boon to the price of bitcoin seems to have come way earlier. Bitcoin traded around $25,000 before BlackRock filed for its spot ETF last June and rallied 20% within days.\n\nWith the post-BlackRock pump, bitcoin had reclaimed its pre-Terra implosion price.\n\nBitcoin would give up those gains in the weeks following. But by mid-October, a fake news tweet claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s bid set bitcoin on a major uptrend.\n\nThere was immediate volatility around the tweet \u2014 climbing $2,000 and down again within 30 minutes \u2014 but bitcoin ended up shooting nearly two-thirds in two months, from $27,700 to $44,000 in December.\n\nAt this rate, ether could soon overtake bitcoin for six-month returns\n\nAbout there it hovered until earlier this week. Analysts, researchers, traders and pundits were generally in consensus that the SEC would indeed approve spot ETFs for launch in the US, and come Monday bitcoin had jumped 8% to clear $47,000 for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAll things considered, the bitcoin spot ETF approval was massively front-run by those trading on the rumor. Anyone who bought bitcoin when word of BlackRock\u2019s filing first broke last year would now be up by more than half.\n\nAnyone who bought bitcoin when the ETFs were officially approved would now be about even and could even be down slightly.\n\nHad they opted for ether, they\u2019d be up to 8% in the green, as traders appear looking to frontrun the next potential wave of crypto spot ETF approvals in the US.\n\nBlackRock and other issuers including Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy have filed for a spot ether ETF since lodging their equivalent bitcoin applications. The SEC has between late May and early August to make its first decision.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin and ether diverge after SEC\u2019s bitcoin ETF snafu\n\nIn the meantime, markets seem to be waiting to find out exactly how much bitcoin BlackRock, Fidelity and other ETF issuers actually bought to back their respective funds after a busy day-one session, when more than $4.6 billion in spot ETF shares were traded in the US overall.\n\nIn and outflow figures would be the first indications of investor interest and could shed light on their potential influence on bitcoin prices moving forward.\n\nSome preliminary figures have been floated on social media but analysts warn they may not be totally accurate. Confirmed data is only expected to be completely accurate later in the day, or even early next week.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A deeper dive reveals why Ethereum remains an overlooked gem in the crypto market.\n\nTo say Ethereum (ETH 0.21%) is down would be exactly correct. However, when considering the gains made among its peers during 2023, its 90% increase makes it feel like Ethereum more or less watched from the sidelines while other cryptocurrencies had triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nGiven its position as the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market, it seems unnatural for Ethereum not to have had a more considerable jump. But all this means is that Ethereum has some catching up to do in 2024. Here's why Ethereum remains an attractive buy.\n\nThe smart contract pioneer\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 altered the trajectory of crypto forever. Its novel smart contract functionality provided the foundation for developers to create innovative applications of blockchain technology that have now become common. Without Ethereum, things like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and much more would not exist.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche provide similar or even superior capabilities today, Ethereum remains the clear-cut leader of decentralized innovation. Several metrics demonstrate Ethereum's dominance over hopeful competitors, but two in particular highlight just how tight the original smart contract blockchain's grip on the market remains.\n\nThe undisputed champion of the decentralized economy\n\nFirst is total value locked (TVL). Quantifying the total value of assets currently staked or locked in a particular blockchain, TVL is a metric used to compare the amount of liquidity within varying DeFi ecosystems. The thinking goes that the greater the TVL, the more robust and valuable a blockchain is. As a disclaimer, this statistic has some limitations, but it does a good enough job of leveling the playing field to make comparisons.\n\nToday Ethereum's TVL is worth roughly $31 billion and accounts for 55% of the TVL across all blockchains with DeFi capabilities. Solana has just $1.3 billion in TVL, and Avalanche has $856 million.\n\nThe distance separating Ethereum from competitors undoubtedly results from its first-mover's advantage. As the first smart contract-capable blockchain, it was the only option for quite a while. Yet even as competing blockchains have joined the DeFi race and attracted significant hype, none has been able to challenge Ethereum where it matters most.\n\nFollow the developers\n\nGoing beyond TVL, assessing the number of active developers provides valuable insights into a cryptocurrency's potential. Developers are key players, responsible for creating applications, fixing issues, and introducing new features -- all critical for the sustained success of a blockchain.\n\nYet again, Ethereum shines. As of the latest count in October 2023, Ethereum had twice as many active developers as Polkadot, and nearly three times more than Solana.\n\nEthereum's extensive developer community is arguably its most valuable asset, giving it a significant competitive advantage over other blockchains. With developers involved in day-to-day maintenance, further upgrades, and exploring new use cases, Ethereum is typically the top choice for new projects seeking a reliable blockchain.\n\nMost importantly, a robust developer community not only ensures long-term viability, but also attracts more projects. Since the value of most cryptocurrencies is tied to their utility, a blockchain supporting numerous use cases often commands a higher price.\n\nEthereum's value proposition today\n\nConsidering its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum simply holds too many advantages compared to other blockchains not to be a leader in the crypto market this year. With an expansive and flourishing ecosystem of tokens, decentralized exchanges, NFTs, stablecoins, and much more, Ethereum provides investors with unparalleled exposure to the burgeoning landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nAs it currently stands, Ethereum remains almost 50% off its all-time high of nearly $4,900. Considering its position as a DeFi leader and the likelihood of a looming crypto bull market, Ethereum holds plenty of upside for the upcoming year. While the rest of the crypto market focuses on newer or more glamorous blockchains, don't forget about Ethereum. It still has plenty of room to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
