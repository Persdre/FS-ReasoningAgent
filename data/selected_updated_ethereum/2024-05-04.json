        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is yet to continue its uptrend following a rejection from the $4,000 resistance level. But the bulls are now showing signs of strength, perhaps staging a more considerable recovery.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAs the daily chart depicts, Ethereum\u2019s price has been making lower highs and lows inside a descending channel since failing to break above the $4,000 resistance level.\n\nYet, the cryptocurrency is climbing back above the $3,000 level and the midline of the channel. If the market successfully recovers back to these levels, a breakout above the channel and a continuation toward $4,000 and even higher prices can be expected.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart offers a much clearer picture of recent price action. The market has barely broken through the $3,000 resistance zone and is currently testing the midline of the descending channel.\n\nWith the RSI showing values above 50%, ETH is likely to break through the level and potentially continue outward to the $3,600 resistance area. In this case, market participants can be optimistic that a new bullish wave will begin soon.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rates\n\nFollowing the recent decline in Ethereum\u2019s price, many futures traders have been liquidated or reversed their long positions. This can be a good sign, as the futures market has seemingly cooled down.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the Ethereum funding rates metric, which measures whether buyers or sellers are executing their futures orders more aggressively (using market orders). Positive values point to bullish sentiment, while negative ones show bearish expectations.\n\nIt is evident that the funding rates have significantly dropped compared to a couple of months ago. Low but positive funding rates can be interpreted as a bullish signal, as they show that while the futures market is not overheated anymore, the demand is still there, and the price can soon rally higher."

        "title": "Ethereum Lead Dev Shares Crucial Message on Account Abstraction - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEther developer Yoav Weiss has shared some notes on Ethereum\u2019s road map for account abstraction.\n\nLately there's a lot of chatter about the road to full account abstraction. I wrote some notes on what we've been building and how it gets us to full AA.https://t.co/UYEM0e5QLX \u2014 yoav.eth (@yoavw) May 3, 2024\n\nIn his post, Weiss gives a detailed overview of ERC-4337, what led to its development as well as Ether team\u2019s future plans.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard enables smart contract crypto wallets on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing user experience with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concept, introduced by the Ethereum team led by Vitalik Buterin, aims to transition assets exclusively to smart contracts rather than externally-owned accounts (EOAs).\n\nERC-4337 introduces a \"pseudo-transaction\" object called a UserOperation, facilitating transactions on behalf of users and stored in an \"alt mempool\" until confirmation. This initiative marks a significant step toward improving the usability of Ethereum for dApps and smart contract interactions.\n\nBrief history\n\nWeiss discussed the origins and evolution of ERC-4337, highlighting the journey from Vitalik Buterin's initial proposal to the current focus on standardizing account abstraction (AA) across Layer 2 (L2) networks.\n\nThe development stemmed from the realization of wallet fragmentation due to custom implementations of AA by various L2 networks, prompting the need for a protocol-level standard like ERC-4337.\n\nThe road map now includes Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs), notably RIP-7560, aimed at facilitating the migration of L2 chains to native AA. RIP-7560 is being refined into separate optional RIPs to streamline the implementation process and address specific use cases like validation, 2D nonces, aggregation and EOA (externally-owned accounts) enhancements.\n\nFuture\n\nThe current focus has predominantly been on L2 adoption, but there's acknowledgment of the value in implementing AA on Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1). The plan is to gradually transition L2 chains to RIP-7560 while Ethereum L1 continues with ERC-4337, ensuring compatibility and a smooth migration process over time.\n\nWeiss emphasized the importance of collaboration with L1 core developers, L2 developers, and the broader community to refine RIP-7560 and ensure a successful implementation across both Ethereum L1 and L2.\n\nFeedback from developers working on the Ethereum Object Format (EOF) is particularly sought to optimize the clean separation between protocol and user-facing aspects in RIP-7560.\n\nButerin's take\n\nVitalik Buterin outlined four main goals for an account system revamp on Ethereum, emphasizing the need for key rotation and deprecation, quantum resistance, batching and support for sponsored transactions.\n\nHe highlighted the limitations of Ethereum's current end user account (EOA) model in achieving these goals, underscoring the necessity to transition the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem toward smart contract accounts (SCAs).\n\nButerin expressed a desire to avoid creating two separate developer ecosystems for smart contract wallets and EOAs, emphasizing the importance of cohesion and interoperability within Ethereum's development landscape.\n\nThe Ethereum core developers have recognized the importance of delivering incremental feature upgrades to enhance user experience in the short term, while simultaneously advancing a longer-term road map for Ethereum's evolution."

However, amidst this soaring trajectory, Furrever Token (FURR) has ignited a fresh wave of excitement by unveiling a lucrative opportunity for investors: the chance to pocket a substantial $10,000 reward. As BTC and ETH continue their upward ascent, the allure of FURR's enticing competition adds an extra layer of intrigue to the already exhilarating world of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Rockets Towards $62,000 Amidst Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nAmidst a recent tumultuous period for the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) is staging an impressive rebound, surging by nearly 5% to reach around $61,857.26. This resurgence follows a sharp dip below $57,000, with BTC climbing 5.2% over the last 24 hours. Market analysts are closely eyeing the critical $62,000 level, identified as a key resistance point on BTC's daily chart. While some traders anticipate a bullish breakthrough, others caution against a strong rejection, emphasizing the significance of sustained volume and candlestick closure above this threshold.\n\nTechnical indicators and on-chain data suggest various levels of resistance and potential targets, with some analysts eyeing $82,000 as the initial objective.

Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor doubt the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs this May. Three prominent applicants, VanEck, Ark 21 Shares, and Hashdex Nasdaq, face hurdles as the SEC scrutinizes underlying securities issues, potentially leading to postponements rather than outright denials.\n\nConcerns are raised that Ethereum may be classified as a security by the SEC, a move that could impact not only Ethereum but also other major cryptocurrencies and ETF applicants. In contrast, Hong Kong's crypto market experiences significant growth, with nearly $300 million in weekly inflows following the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

The tokenomics of FURR are designed to incentivize participation, with 65% of tokens available during the presale, creating ample opportunities for early investors to secure their stake in this whimsical ecosystem. Moreover, the team's commitment to transparency and longevity is evident through the allocation of 10% of tokens, locked for a year, reassuring the community of their dedication.\n\nThe launch on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PancakeSwap further enhances accessibility and liquidity, ensuring a seamless experience for investors. Held on the Gleam platform, the competition spans 7 days, offering participants the opportunity to accumulate points by completing various tasks. At the end of the frenzy, three lucky winners will each walk away with a share of the $10,000 prize pool in FURR tokens.
