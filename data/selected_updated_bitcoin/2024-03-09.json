        "title": "This Week in Coins: Bitcoin Touches $70,000 As Major Altcoins Soar - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt had been a long time coming: Bitcoin hit a new all-time high on Tuesday, soaring past its November 2021 record of $69,044 in the U.S. before dipping again.\n\nThen, on Friday, it did it again\u2014this time by jumping above $70,000. This is remarkable, considering that the coin was trading for below $17,000 in January 2023.\n\nBitcoin's rise was aided by record-setting trading days in the spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been particularly popular.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is now $68,413, up 10% over the past week, per CoinGecko data.\n\nAnd Ethereum, the second biggest digital asset, hit $4,000 for the first time since 2021. Over seven days, it has soared by 13% and the price of ETH stands at $3,894.\n\nBut the two biggest coins' gains over the week have been pretty tame compared to other assets. Meme coins, for a start, have jumped in value a ridiculous amount. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the winning asset out of the top 20 biggest digital coins and tokens, after having jumped nearly 135% over the week.\n\nIts rival, Dogecoin, had a very good week\u2014it nearly doubled in price. It has since dropped and is now priced at $0.1749. It touched $0.19 on Monday, and the Elon Musk favorite is still up over 27% the past seven days.\n\nElsewhere, Solana, the fifth biggest digital asset, rose above the $150 price point on Friday for the first time since January 2022. The token behind the Ethereum-competing blockchain is now up more than 13% over the past week and is priced at $145.82.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin spin-offs like Bitcoin Cash also did well, although the gains were fleeting. BCH, the 20th biggest coin, was up nearly 40% over a seven-day period at one point\u2014but it has now fallen back to $430 after peaking over $450 yesterday. BSV now trades at $109, up over 6% for the week.\n\nDespite the surge in alts and their tremendous gains, it's worth noting that most of them are well below their all-time highs from the previous bull market in 2021. Many still have a long way to go.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) ,surged past $4,000 on Friday, March 8. However, the ETH crypto faced a minor pullback. At press time, the Ethereum price was trading at $3,933 with a market cap of $472 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price To See All-Time High Soon\n\nCrediBULL crypto, a prominent crypto analyst, has weighed in on the current market dynamics, particularly focusing on Ethereum (ETH) following Bitcoin\u2019s recent achievement of tagging its previous all-time high (ATH).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the analyst, there\u2019s widespread anticipation within the crypto community that Ethereum is the next in line to surge, given Bitcoin\u2019s ATH milestone. Those who have remained on the sidelines are reportedly eyeing a potential pullback to the $3600-$3700 range, a sentiment echoed by many participants in the market.\n\nHowever, CrediBULL crypto suggests that such a pullback might not materialize immediately, as the demand for Ethereum remains strong. The analyst says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to witness Ethereum\u2019s price surge by another 25% or more before any significant correction occurs.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin as we move ahead in 2024. Over the last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price gained by 10% while ETH added 15% gains in the same period.\n\nBoosted by the imminent Dencun upgrade and a bullish atmosphere from Bitcoin\u2019s profit recirculation, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is gaining momentum. Analysis of the ETH/BTC chart indicates that altcoins are nearing a breakout point.\n\nAll Eyes on Dencun Upgrade\n\nIn the next week, the Ethereum blockchain will undergo its much-awaited Dencun upgrade bringing significant improvements to the network. The upcoming Dencun upgrade scheduled for this month will reduce transaction costs on layer 2 networks, stimulating increased activity and potentially drawing mainstream consumer interest to Ethereum.\n\nAnother catalyst is the pending regulatory decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, expected in May. Although the approval odds are less certain compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs, it still brings excitement to ether, according to the Bitwise analyst.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, ETH mainnet\u2019s revenue from network fees surged to $193 million this week, marking the highest level since May 2022 and reflecting a 78% rise from the previous week. This notable increase in on-chain activity was primarily fueled by heightened speculation involving meme coins.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.
