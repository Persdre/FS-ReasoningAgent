        "content": "Peter Brandt criticized Ethereum as a \u201cjunk coin\u201d due to perceived flaws\n\nMost experts, however, are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future\n\nThe crypto-market recorded significant volatility in the first quarter of 2024, with many leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum [ETH] and Bitcoin [BTC] both rising and falling. Ethereum, in particular, has showed some promising signs beyond price movements though, especially in terms of revenue.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was up by 1.71% over a 24-hour period, with the altcoin valued at $3,334.77.\n\nEthereum\u2019s mixed signals\n\nHowever, if we look at the monthly data, the altcoin has dipped by 11.94%, with its trading volume down by 5.18% too at a figure of $13.87 billion. Remarking on the month-long bearish movement and the long-term prospects of Ethereum, renowned trader Peter Brandt noted,\n\n\u201cI get tired of saying it, but $ETH is a junk coin despite mindless devotion of Etheridiots. As a store of value it is junk \u2013 a $BTC pretender.\u201d\n\nHe further elaborated,\n\n\u201cIts functionality is also junk \u2013 difficult to deal with L2s and outrageous gas fees. Of course it will always attract \u201cinvestors\u201d\u201d.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that other commentators are more positive about Ethereum. JP Morgan, for instance, cited Lido\u2019s reduced stake in Ethereum as a factor. In fact, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou believes this decline could save the altcoin from being classified as a security.\n\nETH\u2019s positive outlook amidst criticism\n\nBrandt\u2019s critique of the crypto stirred varied responses in the community. While some echoed his views, others went ahead to defend Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, aligned with Brandt\u2019s remarks and tweeted,\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the > $1bi per quarterl hacks, \u201chacks\u201d and rug-pulls on its seemingly unsecurable script, which is just getting worse over time, because complexity kills; and the eths in charge just continue adding complexity\u2026\u201d\n\nDespite various criticisms, however, many expect ETH to do well, particularly after Bitcoin\u2019s halving. Hashkey Capital\u2019s Head of Research, Jupiter Zheng, shares this sentiment too, suggesting that ETF denial may not significantly affect prices. Moreover, he believes that the approval of a spot Ether ETF with staking could further boost prices.\n\nThe derivatives market also highlighted a positive outlook, as reflected by ETH\u2019s Funding Rate in the green zone. This is a sign of strong dominance of long-position traders who are willing to pay short-position traders \u2013 A bullish sign for Ethereum\u2019s market."

While there\u2019s still a chance before May, the likelihood is falling as there\u2019s been no evident progress in the approval process.\n\nHowever, many in the industry remain optimistic about an eventual approval, citing parallels with the Bitcoin ETF.
