        "content": "FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevicha projects Ethereum\u2019s price could further dip towards $2,000, as the altcoin is down by over 8% weekly.\n\nThe crypto market is experiencing a period of subdued volatility, with the total market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion for the third consecutive day. Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years."

The slump has seen Ether fall out from below the confines of a bullish technical formation, but that could end soon as the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) theme gathers momentum.\n\nBitcoin price is range bound close to the psychologically important $40,000 level, nearly two weeks post Spot ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        "content": "A crypto analyst, Elja on X, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will reach a staggering $15,000 by 2025 based on technical analysis. The analyst argues that the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market is \u201ctemporary.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Elja notes that the second most valuable coin by market cap follows a similar fractal pattern that fueled its previous major price rally in 2021.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready To Rip Despite The Current Consolidation?\n\nSharing a screen grab of the current ETH price action, Elja says most people in crypto are \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and only focus on immediate price movements. In the analyst\u2019s assessment, traders should look at the long-term to understand the overall price pattern.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThus far, Ethereum, like Bitcoin (BTC), remains under pressure and struggling to break above immediate resistance levels. Looking at the development in the daily chart, ETH is back at a critical support level of around $2,200. Notably, the coin is down 20% from January 2024 highs of about $2,700.\n\nETH is under pressure, at least in the short to medium term. As it is, the coin follows the technical candlestick arrangement visible in Bitcoin.\n\nThe altcoin downtrend appears to have been triggered by events following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As an illustration, Bitcoin fell from around $47,000 to below $40,000 this week, weighing down altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain data shows that Grayscale Investments has been unloading thousands of coins behind Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Subsequently, there has been a sell-off in Bitcoin and across the altcoin scene. The situation has been made worse for Ethereum following the United States SEC\u2019s decision to postpone the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nWhile these developments have negatively impacted sentiment, Elja believes they will not derail Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth trajectory. Specifically, the analyst notes that ETH is consolidating, a \u201chealthy sign.\u201d\n\nETH To $15,000: Will Fundamental And Technical Factors Help?\n\nElja added that when crypto prices consolidate, it could suggest that whales are accumulating their position. Once this ends, ETH prices could trend higher. From the analyst\u2019s chart, the coin will break above $5,000 to $15,000 in the coming sessions.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Bearish Outlook: Analyst Predicts Price Nosedive To $38,130 8 months ago\n\nWhen making this prediction, the analyst compared the Ethereum price action to the fractal pattern that propelled ETH from around $200 to $4,800 in 15 months from 2019 to 2021. Extrapolating from past price action, Elja believes Ethereum is on a similar path. Based on analysis, the coin will likely break above November 2021 peaks.\n\nBeyond technical factors, ETH supporters cite the decreasing issuance rate. According to Ultrasound Money data, the network has been burning thousands of ETH, reducing supply. Additionally, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, believes Ethereum will be the choice network for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the years ahead.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Could a forthcoming Ethereum upgrade boost Ether\u2019s price? A recent study says yes - DLNews",
        "content": "The price of Ether is seen to increase in the weeks before major upgrades.\n\nA small group of contributors holds significant influence over key decisions regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nThe increase in Ether's price is most significant in the weeks before final discussions regarding EIPs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance decisions have emerged as an underappreciated influence on prices of Ether.\n\nA recent study by a trio of academics shed light on this relationship, particularly regarding EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAn Ethereum Improvement Proposal is a formal document suggesting new features or changes to the Ethereum blockchain that serves as a guideline for community consensus.\n\nThe study, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s decision-making process, uncovered a striking trend. In the periods leading up to final discussions of Core EIPs, Ether\u2019s price increased about 18%, and relative to Bitcoin it increased 12%.\n\nThe research also examined the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s governance, and found that a small group of developers and influencers hold significant sway over the EIP process.\n\nThe next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, which is expected to reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2s, is on track to launch in late February.\n\nEthereum developers will run through tests for Dencun on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe authors of the study were Cesare Fracassi and Moazzam Khoja at the University of Texas at Austin, and Fabian Sch\u00e4r at the University of Basel. The paper has yet to go through the academic peer-review process.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nData speaks volumes\n\nThe study analysed Ether\u2019s price trends during the final discussions and approvals of successful Core EIPs, looking at hourly price data from May 2016 to November 2023.\n\nOne of the most important findings was the 18% increase in Ether prices in the weeks preceding the last AllCoreDevs call before a major EIP.\n\nAn AllCoreDevs call is a regular meeting when Ethereum\u2019s core developers discuss and make decisions on EIPs.\n\nThis surge in prices was seen to reflect investors\u2019 evolving expectations about the likelihood of a proposal\u2019s approval, and its potential impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nTo ensure an accurate analysis, the researchers focused on a specific period of 80 days, split equally before and after these meetings.\n\nEther\u2019s price began to increase, the study found, about 30 days before the crucial discussions.\n\nA clear pattern was also seen when comparing Ether with Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 25 days leading up to the approval of a Core EIP, Ether\u2019s price against Bitcoin typically increased by about 12%, showing that Ether\u2019s price does tend to increase significantly in anticipation of major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nSuch increases are particularly significant considering the concentrated governance structure where a small group holds substantial influence over key decisions.\n\nFor example, an average of 10 people per client implementation \u2014 each client being a different version of software that runs the Ethereum protocol \u2014 are responsible for 80% of all software changes.\n\nWhen comparing Ether\u2019s performance with the S&P 500, its price movements didn\u2019t always align with the stock market trends, showing that factors influencing Ether are different from those driving the markets.\n\nFor market participants, from casual investors to institutional traders, these insights may offer some potentially valuable perspectives on how governance-related events can be crucial indicators for investment strategies.\n\nFor the Ethereum community and developers, the data highlights the impact their decisions have, not just on the network\u2019s technical trajectory, but on its financial ecosystem as well.\n\nEther's price performance for the last 30 days.\n\nEther\u2019s price is $2,270, up 3.7% on the day, after falling 16% from its yearly high of $2,700 on January 12.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is about one month away from being finalised, which according to the study, should coincide with an increase in Ether\u2019s price."
