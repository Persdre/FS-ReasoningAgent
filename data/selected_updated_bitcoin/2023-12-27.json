        "content": "A trader who accurately called the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bear market thinks that the uptrend of one Ethereum (ETH) challenger that has massively outperformed the broader crypto markets this year is far from over.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 233,400 followers on the social media platform X that the people who are calling for the end of Solana\u2019s (SOL) big rally this year will most likely miss out on the altcoin\u2019s surge to a fresh all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to Bluntz, Solana has a lot more gas left in the tank as he predicts that SOL could still print gains of more than 257% from current levels.\n\n\u201cSOL is still 113% away from ATH. Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has managed to sustain above the $2150 level. This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation. With sustained buying the ETH price should surpass the last swing high resistance of $2400 to obtain a better confirmation and entry opportunity.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the post-correction rally can chase a potential target of $2665 aligned with the 0.618 FIB level\n\nKey Level to Watch\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum seems strongly bullish, the coin buyers may face renewed supply pressure at the $2400 mark. In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend. On the contrary, a breakdown below this support would trigger a significant correction in ETH price\n\nBollinger Band: The flattish upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator offers an additional layer of resistance at $2400\n\nVortex Indicator: A bullish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope signals a recovery trend in active.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.
