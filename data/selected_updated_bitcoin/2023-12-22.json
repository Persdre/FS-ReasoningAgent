        "title": "Ethereum Price About To Bloom As ETHE Discount Rapidly Close: ETH To $3,500? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) prices have been languishing below the $2,500 mark despite the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nTaking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world\u2019s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETHE Discount Rapidly Closing\n\nTo illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.\n\nBased on the CEO\u2019s analysis, this development suggests that institutional investors, most of whom chose to buy the regulated ETHE product by Grayscale to gain exposure in a regulated manner to ETH, are now opting to buy ETH on the spot market, not through a derivatives product.\n\nThis shift from ETHE to ETH spot, Ahluwalia added, could be explained by the \u201ccheapest-to-deliver\u201d contract theory. In the derivatives market, this theory states that a derivatives product like ETHE is the cheapest way for institutional investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset, in this case, ETH.\n\nThis is because the derivative in question, ETHE, is a futures contract that tracks the price of ETH via a regulated exchange, in this case CME.\n\nWill Capital Flow To Spot Ethereum And Lift ETH To $3,500?\n\nTherefore, based on this theory, the CEO continued that it is likely that as the ETHE discount closes, marginal flows will go to the ETH spot to capture the staking yield. For this reason, institutions are not likely to pour more funds into ETHE since \u201cbig gains\u201d are done.\n\nAs a proof-of-stake (POS) project, users can stake ETH, helping secure the network, and as compensation, Ethereum distributes a yield of around 4.3% to validators. These operators must lock at least 32 ETH to validate a block of transactions and earn block fees. Since they have to stake, they also earn a yield.\n\nAs of December 22, there were over 28.6 million ETH staked, with the reward rate or yield at 4.32%, according to Staking Rewards. Considering how staked amount and yield are correlated, the more users choose to stake physical ETH, the lower the reward rate, or yield, is.\n\nThis dynamic will now come into play as ETHE discounts close and institutions or big players rotate funds into ETH via the spot market, possibly lifting prices.\n\nLooking at the ETH price action in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. However, a comprehensive close above $2,400 could lift ETH to $2,500 and later to $2,500 in a buy trend continuation pattern.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum: Why a price move to $2.5K is a good prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH accumulation has been increasing, suggesting a move toward $2,500.\n\nMarket participants are not convinced that the coin is about to jump.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment, active addresses on the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain have been rising. As of 18th December, the 24-hour active addresses was 395,000.\n\nBut at press time, the metric has climbed to 512,000. Active addresses measure daily interaction and speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the increase suggests that there are more market participants involved in ETH transfers. Like the active addresses, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain volume also increased.\n\nAt the time of writing, the volume was 13.02 billion. The rise in active users and volume implies a surge in network activity on the blockchain\n\nETH\u2019 season to switch states\n\nAlso, this could be a bullish sign for ETH\u2019s price. For a while, ETH has come under intense criticism for its inability to replicate Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] form. Likewise, ETH has also been unable to outperform many other altcoins.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that ETH will not have its season.\n\nOne reason for this assertion is the number of new ETH wallets created. Based on Glassnode\u2019s data, new addresses on Ethereum have been growing.\n\nThis indicates a surge in traction which could translate to a positive move for the price action. On a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis, ETH\u2019s value has increased by 84.11%.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency has been stuck between the $2,000 and $2,300 levels for some time. A look at the ETH/USD daily chart showed that a bullish thesis could soon be validated.\n\nThis was because of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). At press time, the 20-day EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50-day EMA (yellow).\n\nThis position is bullish and could be termed a buy/long trend. So, traders may need to desist from opening short positions.\n\nBut the Awesome Oscillator (AO) revealed that ETH\u2019s bullish season may not happen in a few days. At the same time, it may not be far away.\n\n$2,500 or nothing\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO had formed red bars. However, the red bars were decreasing in height, suggesting a weak bearish momentum.\n\nAlso, the increase in the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator means a move to $2,500 could be possible in the short to mid-term.\n\nIn the meantime, market participants are not all bullish on ETH. This was indicated by the Weighted Sentiment.\n\nAt press time, the Weighted Sentiment was -1.736. This negative reading is a confirmation of the bearish bias most market players have.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nConsidering ETH\u2019s circulation, on-chain data showed that it decreased to 242,000. This decrease implies that the number of ETH engaged in transactions has reduced compared to the hike on the 20th of December.\n\nPrice-wise, the drop in circulation suggests low selling pressure for ETH. So, it may be unlikely to see a nosedive in ETH\u2019s value soon."

We\u2019ll be back on January 13th.\n\nOne common \u2014 and not always unfair \u2014 criticism made by crypto enthusiasts is that the wider world conflates bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the subject comes up over Christmas, chances are family and friends will use the two interchangeably. In their minds bitcoin IS the crypto market. Yet people working around it, or even have more than a passing interest, know there is much more going on.\n\nRight now, bitcoin is in a happier place than it has been for 18 months, supported by speculation that the SEC will approve a bitcoin exchange traded fund after Christmas. But the rest of the market doesn\u2019t quite have that same warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nA large chunk of \u201cthe rest\u201d is ether, the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, because of the blockchain it represents, ethereum.\n\nEthereum has always been a more ambitious project than the bitcoin blockchain, which is a database for transactions. It can hold assets and lets programmers code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That means it is the foundation for so much of the industry\u2019s non-bitcoin activity ranging from decentralised finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs to gaming.\n\nHistorically, these markets have given ethereum a unique position of strength over competing blockchains: if one sector of the industry explodes, so should ether.\n\nBut while ether has climbed a respectable 93 per cent this year, it has underperformed bitcoin (up 162 per cent), Solana (up over 550 per cent), and Cardano (up 154 per cent).\n\n\u201cThis year ether has been totally outshined by the excitement related to bitcoin,\u201d said CK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZK Squared Capital.\n\nFor ether, the problem is that these cutting-edge crypto projects, like decentralised finance, NFTs and gaming \u2014 the ethereum network\u2019s bread and butter \u2014 still haven\u2019t shaken off their past.\n\nProjects like DeFi crypto exchange Uniswap have yet to generate any mainstream buzz, crypto-inspired games like Axie Infinity are today synonymous with North Korean hacking exploits, and NFTs have only recently made headlines for blinding party goers in Hong Kong.\n\nAs far as the non-bitcoin crypto market is concerned, the coins that have performed best this year are the ones exploring the links between crypto and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe demand for AI investments has found its way into crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser at Lumida Wealth Management. \u201cCrypto tokens linked to AI have emerged as one of the strongest crypto investing themes,\u201d he added.\n\nWhether there are overlaps between crypto and AI is a theme for another day. For now, they are the kingfishers catching the sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see the far superior returns of AI-related tokens compared to other tokens,\u201d added Zheng, adding that these tokens will be \u201cthe most exciting theme going into 2024.\u201d\n\nBut ethereum\u2019s lacklustre year behind bitcoin is not all down to being superseded by the latest tech hype cycle. US regulators are still pursuing cases that could end up defining ether and other crypto tokens as securities.\n\nAnd ethereum also has to face up to its own disappointments. In September last year the network underwent a supposedly revolutionary surgery with the \u201cMerge\u201d. It was a technical operation, blending one ethereum blockchain with another, but came with big promises.\n\nBefore the Merge, if the ethereum network were a country, it would have ranked in the world\u2019s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing nations like Belgium and Finland.\n\nThe Merge virtually eliminated the network\u2019s carbon footprint, and when I dedicated 2,500 words to ethereum\u2019s supposed revolution, everyone I spoke to told me it was the removal of the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption. Ether would even come on to the radars of ESG-conscious investors.\n\nIn fact, the anticipation for a record-setting future was so intense that YouTube\u2019s former head of gaming Ryan Wyatt told me that crypto could soon focus on \u201conboarding the next billion users.\u201d\n\nBut the price of ether fell in the months after the Merge, and while it has recovered, those billion users haven\u2019t materialised.\n\n\u201cIf the expectation was that the Merge would boost investments from ESG-minded investors I think that expectation would be premature,\u201d said Alex de Vries, co-founder of Digiconomist, a website that tracks the environmental impact of the crypto industry.\n\nInstead, ether is at risk of being eclipsed by bitcoin. At the time of the Merge, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation represented roughly 40 per cent of the entire crypto market and ethereum\u2019s share was 18 per cent, according to industry data aggregator CoinMarketCap.\n\nToday ethereum accounts for 17 per cent while bitcoin\u2019s share has expanded to 52 per cent.\n\nIf conversations with family and friends this Christmas do veer down the cryptocurrency road, good luck in explaining it.

        "title": "Ethereum could surpass $4,000 in 2024, propelled by Bitcoin spot ETF and sharding - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price rallied by over 85% in 2023 \u2013 a similar increase in 2024 places the target above $4,000.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval will be a key catalyst for a price rally and also set a precedent for ETH ETF approvals in Q2 and Q3 2024.\n\nEthereum mainnet is expected to undergo the sharding upgrades, starting with Dencun, which will introduce proto-danksharding.\n\nInvestors and traders alike are anticipating ETH price to rise in order to book profits before Q2 2024.\n\nEthereum price increased considerably in 2023, recovering about a third of the crash from December 2021 to May 2022. However, the remaining two-thirds of this crash is expected to be recovered in 2024 owing to multiple factors.\n\nETH investors have a lot to look forward to throughout the year as events such as spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Dencun (sharding) update, and spot Ethereum ETF decision will be taking place, which are expected to be bullish catalysts. However, the lack of institutional investors' interest might act as a barrier to this growth and keep ETH from reaching $4,000.\n\n2024 Fundamental outlook: Ethereum price to witness growth from spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\n2024 is expected to kick off the bull run that the crypto market has been waiting for since June 2022. Ethereum price, along with the rest of the market, is set to witness bullishness owing to one single factor \u2013 the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOver a dozen investment fund managers, including the likes of BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, have applied for ETFs. The initial outcome was not positive as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exhibited skepticism, but following Grayscale's win, sentiment changed.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the asset manager in the lawsuit filed against the SEC for rejecting the request to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This imbued confidence in the market, and the deadline for the final decision is expected to arrive by January 10, 2024.\n\nBitcoin spot ETF update\n\nAs Bitcoin price rallies, Ethereum will fulfill its role as the \"Silver to BTC's Gold\" and likely push other altcoins to rally as well.\n\nFurthermore, this approval will also set a precedent for Ethereum spot ETFs, which asset managers are already eyeing. VanEck, ARK Invest, and BlackRock, among three others, have already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Grayscale, too, filed to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these applications have strong odds of approval, too, since they would be similar in design and structure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, their final deadline is between May and August 2024, giving investors time before they can get their hands on the investment products.\n\nEthereum spot ETF filings\n\nThat said, following the spot BTC ETF approval, ETH ETFs will see much less friction in acquiring a green light from the SEC. This will be the driving factor for the continuation of the Ethereum price rise in Q2 2024.\n\nThe Surge after the Merge\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the future of the blockchain. Referencing the Merge, Buterin stated that the chain is only 55% complete and has a long way to go.\n\nThe next four stages, as noted by Buterin, will be The Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The first of these four \u2013 The Surge \u2013 will introduce sharding on Ethereum.\n\nSharding is a key scalability solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network's capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts. This is done by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable chains called shards.\n\nEthereum Sharding structure\n\nThese shards are individual components of the Ethereum network itself. Each shard operates as an independent blockchain with its own set of smart contracts. These chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, reducing congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe main goals of Ethereum developers with the sharding update are as follows:\n\nScalability: As the Ethereum network continues to grow, it faces significant limitations in transaction throughput and processing capacity. Sharding introduces a parallel processing approach, allowing multiple transactions and smart contracts to be processed simultaneously across different shards. Crosslinking: Shards communicate with each other through crosslinks, which are references to the state of one shard included in another shard's block. Crosslinking helps maintain consistency and integrity across the entire Ethereum network. Increased opportunities for validators: Validators participate in the consensus process by proposing and validating blocks on individual shards. Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they lock up as collateral in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nIn the sharding update, the beacon chain will play a crucial role as well. The beacon chain was the first Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which acts as a separate blockchain that coordinates the overall network and manages the consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Stake). This chain will be used to coordinate communication between the shards.\n\nThe process of implementing sharding will begin with the Dencun upgrade. Set to be executed in Q1 2024, the upgrade will bring proto-danksharding to the network. Proto-danksharding will act as the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, which is a crucial part of the Surge.\n\nDencun upgrade will also optimize the Ethereum gas fees, which has been a prevailing issue for users. Throughout 2023, Ethereum layer-2 chain\u2019s fee per transaction has averaged $0.02 to $0.21, whereas Ethereum mainnet transaction fees have averaged $4.86.\n\nEthereum and layer-2 chains\u2019 gas fees\n\nAs these updates are set to arrive in Q1 and Q2, with many of them expected to be deployed by May-June, they will likely act as the bullish catalyst of the second half of 2024.\n\n2024 Technical Outlook: Ethereum price could see $4,000\n\nEthereum price over the past year had a good run, rising by more than 85%. While Q1 proved to be a good quarter for the altcoin, the growth halted, and ETH largely consolidated throughout Q2 and Q3, struggling to breach the $2,000 mark.\n\nHowever, in Q4, Ethereum price began rallying again, mostly owing to expectations surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which also led to many investment funds filing for spot ETH ETFs. During this duration, ETH shot up by 51% to end the year at around $2,200, which is the present trading price.\n\nThus, if throughout 2023 ETH rose by over 85% despite the bearish market conditions, a similar rally or even a larger one can be expected out of a bullish year in which ETF approvals are expected, network developments are implemented, and Bitcoin halving will take place.\n\nETH/USD 1-week chart\n\nIf ETH repeats 2023\u2019s performance in 2024, the target for next year will be at over $4,000. The price indicators also suggest a bullish outcome despite the slight correction in the past few weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just exited overbought, coinciding with the pullback witnessed over the last week, whilst the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the zero line, showing the uptrend is accompanied by strong bullish momentum.\n\nAlthough the receding green bars do suggest that the bullishness is waning at the moment, some pullback before bullish momentum regains strength is common in longer timeframes, and this can be observed during the past bull runs as well.\n\nFurthermore, ETH has observed the 50, 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as support, which is a bullish indication since the last time this happened was in July 2020. At that time, ETH ended up scoring a 1,577% rally from $288 to $3,928, a feat that will not be replicated in 2024.\n\nNevertheless, despite the bullish indications, one should remember that the recent rally has caused the Ethereum price to be overbought on RSI, and investors might attempt to book profits in the first half of 2024 again. This falls in line with historical movement where ETH lived in the overbought zone (RSI above 70.0) for about six months before initiating short-term corrections in June 2021.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nThe prospect of investors selling their holdings to realize profits is also evident from the on-chain metrics, which suggest investors may book profits if the Ethereum price shoots up. Nevertheless, ETH would still be expected to remain above the $2,500 mark until Q2, after the corrections, the ETF hype subsides, and the market moves on to the Ethereum network upgrades.\n\nProfit-taking will bring corrections, but traders remain bullish\n\nOn-chain metrics can be used to analyze investors' behavior and make predictions about future price activity. One of the most important on-chain metrics is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric is an indicator used to assess the average profit/loss of investors who purchase an asset. It can provide clues as to when investors might begin taking profits and selling their holdings, leading to pullbacks in price.\n\nThe quarterly and yearly MVRV ratios are the most useful for long-term analysis. The 90-day MVRV ratio measures the average profit/loss of investors who purchased an asset in the past three months, and the 365-day MVRV ratio measures the same over the last year.\n\nFor Ethereum, the 90-day MVRV sits at 15.25%, which indicates that investors who purchased ETH in Q4 2023 are sitting at 15.25% profit. Similarly, the 365-day MVRV ratio is presently at 24.18%, suggesting that those who purchased throughout 2023 are, on average, witnessing 24.18% profits.\n\nInterestingly, considering both the timeframes, it is evident that these investors are likely to be tempted to sell their holdings soon to realize profits. This could most certainly trigger a sell-off. As seen in the chart, when MVRV hits 9% to 34% on the yearly time frame and 7.8% to 31% on the quarterly time frame, ETH has undergone considerable corrections. Hence, this area is termed a danger zone.\n\nEthereum MVRV ratio\n\nApart from investors, the traders are also seemingly bullish. This inference is derived from the funding rates, which show an increasing trend. Such a trend suggests that long positions are gaining dominance, indicating a prevailing bullish market sentiment.\n\nAs can be observed on the chart below, the last time funding rates plunged into negative, i.e., short traders gained dominance, was back in March 2023. Since then, the rates have largely been positive, which means people are betting on a rise. This is solely being done with the intention of selling for profits.\n\nEthereum funding rate\n\nSo, considering these conditions, the bull run that starts due to spot Bitcoin ETF hype, followed by the sharding update, will likely urge investors to sell and realize profits. However, long-term holders will refrain and wait until the bull run flips and ETH begins witnessing a downtrend.\n\nWatch out for institutions\n\nOne key factor that might act as a headwind to Ethereum price reaching the target of $4,000 is the lack of institutional interest ETH has been witnessing. Year to date, the crypto asset only managed to rake in $19 million, which is far lower than Solana's $146 million worth of inflows and astronomically less than Bitcoin's $1.7 billion.\n\nEthereum's year-to-date institutional flows\n\nIf this trend continues in 2024 as well, ETH might struggle to capitalize on the rest of the bullish cues since institutions are expected to drive the next bull run, and lack of interest from them may not play in Ethereum's favor.\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarize the outlook for Ethereum in 2024, the best advice is to sit on holdings, wait and gain. A bullish year for the broader crypto market and a bullish year for ETH investors is the forecast. But that does not mean the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold is completely immune to bearish outcomes.\n\nWhile an increase to $4,000 is possible, it is not a certainty since regulatory changes and unprecedented crashes plague the crypto market. Furthermore, considering the performance in 2023, ETH has not necessarily been the favorite asset of institutional investors. This lack of interest, if noted in 2024 as well, could act as an opposing force on ETH's potential growth.\n\nThus, it is advised always to do your own research and make the most ETH-ducated decision."
