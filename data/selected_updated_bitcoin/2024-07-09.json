        "content": "Three years ago, Bitcoin went through an update called Taproot , which made the network more expressive. This expressivity also accidentally made the Bitcoin equivalent of NFTs possible through Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Ordinals protocol . This is what I mean by \u201ctrading bitcoin for other bitcoin\u201d: \u201cNFTs\u201d can work on Bitcoin because the Ordinal protocol is able to see which satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin, a hundred millionth) are inscribed with arbitrary data which can be a picture or text or something else . These collectibles are called inscriptions so as to not be confused with NFTs (which are separate tokens). If you were buying an inscription, instead of buying an entirely new token as you would on Ethereum, you\u2019re just buying some bitcoin that\u2019s only special when seen through the lens of the Ordinals protocol."

Per the latest tweet from Whale Alert, 11,215 ETH were transferred from an unknown wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis latest ETH transaction is estimated to be worth around $34.35 million. It is a major move as it appears that the whale has shifted ETH in order to trigger a sell-off. Moreover, the timing of this sell-off is crucial as it comes amid the recent market crash.\n\nThe broader crypto market has been consolidating after last week\u2019s crash. The price of Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has crashed 16.68% over the last 30 days. This shows the intensity of this market dump, impacting major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) .\n\nWhile many are still expecting a price recovery from ETH, it appears that some traders are dumping their holdings. In the case of this Ethereum whale, they have almost $34.35 million in ETH. Since this is a major amount, it can further impact the market and push the ETH price to lower levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhales always play a crucial role on the digital asset market. The buying and selling from these traders leave short-term impacts on the price movements of a particular coin. In this case, the Ethereum price can absorb the toll of this sell-off. It may hinder the potential recovery of the coin after a recent downturn.\n\nETH price outlook\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum is trading around $3,072. While the price is up 0.52% in the last 24 hours, it has failed to recover from the previous losses. The recent bearish sentiment has not been good for bulls, causing uncertainty on the market."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF approval is looming: 2 reasons to avoid - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum price has crawled back in the past two days as investors focus on the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nETH price rose to $3,112 on Tuesday, 10.5% above where it traded at last Friday. There are hopes that the SEC will approve ETFs soon as companies continue filing their final documents with the agency.\n\nVanEck submitted its amended filing on Monday, while Invesco filed on Tuesday morning. Bitwise and 21Shares have also made their filings. Analysts believe that these funds could start trading as soon as this week.\n\nFirst S-1 just rolled in today from VanEck.. they already had their fee so nothing to see here really, they just putting ball back in SEC's court. Expecting the rest today except for Bitwise who did theirs last week. pic.twitter.com/gF6OZTKIrs \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\nThese funds come a few months after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $14 billion in inflows.\n\n2 reasons to avoid spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum funds will provide non-traditional crypto investors a good way to track the price of Ethereum without the need to deal with some of the complexities of crypto, such as wallet keys. As such, funds will be ideal for large institutional investors who find it overly complex to deal with real coins.\n\nHowever, there are two main reasons why investors should consider investing in Ethereum instead of ETFs.\n\nFirst, buying and holding ETF in a hot or cold wallet is in reality a relatively simple process. One can easily do that using one of the popular exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, crypto.com, among many others.\n\nAfter buying Ether, the only fee that customers pay is when they are selling their coins to exit the investment.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum funds will have an expense ratio, likely around 0.25%. In its filing, Invesco Galaxy revealed that its fund will have a unified sponsor fee of 0.25%. This means that a $100,000 investment will attract an annual fee of about $250. Over ten years, if Ether remains steady, an investor would pay $2,500 in fees.\n\nThe fee differential explains why Bitcoin has had a better return than spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the past six months, Bitcoin has risen by 24.31% while the other ETFs have risen by about 20.7%. This spread will compound over time.\n\nBitcoin vs IBIT vs FBTC vs ARKB ETFs\n\nSecond, Ethereum funds will not have staking features, which provides steady income to investors. Data compiled by StakingRewards shows that the total staked Ether stands at over $100 billion, giving it a staking ratio of 27.16%. It has a yield of about 3.29% and a $100k investment will return nearly $3,300 a year.\n\nTherefore, since Ether and spot ETH ETFs will move in sync, it seems like a better idea to just stake Ether."
