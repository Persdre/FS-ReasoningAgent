        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nAfter a phenomenal run, Bitcoin cooled down. The price of Bitcoin is now at $51,064, after a modest 2% weekly drop.\n\nCash had flooded into the market as retail investors showed interest in the newly approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that has finally slowed.\n\nStill, the asset is up significantly since the start of the year, when it was trading for $42,245 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Ethereum (ETH) has been the star of the week. The price of ETH crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, and now it's trading for $2,956, a 6% jump over the past seven days.\n\nInvestors are interested in the asset again as more major Wall Street firms apply to release a spot Ethereum ETF. The SEC has until May to approve or deny such a product.\n\nAnd Uniswap (UNI), the 16th biggest token, is doing really well: it's up 66% this week and priced at $12.41. It shot up sharply yesterday on news that the foundation behind the popular decentralized exchange wants to overhaul the governance system to reward users who stake the token.\n\nThe idea is a \"large-scale upgrade to Uniswap protocol governance to incentivize active, engaged, and thoughtful delegation,\" the foundation said. A vote will come in March.\n\nOver the past week, UNI has been the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy far, though, the most impressive performers have been AI tokens, which boomed along with AI sticks after Nvidia's earnings report. The top chipmaker reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the final quarter of 2023, beating analyst estimates.\n\nAs a result, AI-associated digital assets are soaring. Worldcoin (WLD) is up 71% over the past seven days, while SingularityNET (AGIX) doubled before settling at a 71% gain for the week.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Ethereum (ETH) could appreciate to a five-figure price.\n\nYusko says in a new Altcoin Daily interview that based on the Ethereum versus Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC), ETH could go up by 410% from its present level in a scenario where Bitcoin ends up hitting the $150,000 mark.\n\n\u201cI probably have no reason to go against what has existed for a long time which is the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It used to be almost exactly 10-to-1. So if Bitcoin was $20,000, Ethereum would be $2,000\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say Bitcoin gets to $150,000 like I think it will. And let\u2019s say we don\u2019t go all the way back to [a Bitcoin-to-Ethereum ratio of] 10-to-1 but we go to\u2026 Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1.5. So that\u2019s [an Ethereum price of] $10,000.\n\nI think there are a lot of people that have that number in their brain. And a lot of people say, \u2018Well that\u2019s not enough.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s say it gets all the way back to 10-to-1. Then that would be [an Ethereum price of] $15,000. So, comfortably somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,921 at time of writing.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s expected price performance relative to that of Bitcoin (BTC), the hedge fund veteran says,\n\n\u201cI could see a bigger rally in Ethereum than Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of what you would expect in the pump part, in the final meteoric parabolic move. Ethereum has historically outperformed Bitcoin and it probably should again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $51,904 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP\u2019s popularity has surged, outperforming ETH in Google searches in several countries.\n\nRipple\u2019s lawsuit outcome and events like the Bitcoin halving could further boost XRP\u2019s prominence and value.\n\nJapan and Many More\n\nDespite the lengthy lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the entity\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 remains among the trendiest cryptocurrencies. Its popularity rose significantly last year when Ripple secured three vital (yet partial) court victories against its opponent.\n\nAccording to most recent trends, XRP has even surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in Google searches in certain countries (over the past month). Japan, the Philippines, and South Africa are the top 3 nations where Ripple\u2019s coin has dwarfed its. XRP searches have also been on the rise in Finland, Malaysia, and Indonesia, albeit in a more modest fashion.\n\nEthereum remains more popular in some leading European economies, including France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and others.\n\nA few months ago, Solana briefly flipped ETH in terms of Google searches. The trend coincided with SOL\u2019s rapid price increase, which skyrocketed by approximately 1,000% between the beginning of last year and New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nCan XRP Progress Even More?\n\nSome could argue that Ripple\u2019s coin might surge in popularity even more if its price explodes in the following months. The crypto space is rammed with analysts who have recently predicted colossal surges for the coin.\n\nSeveral important factors and upcoming developments hint that such an ascend is not out of the cards. Perhaps the most obvious one is the outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, which is nearing a grand trial (scheduled on April 23).\n\nA decisive win for the company might trigger huge excitement and cause a bull run for XRP and the entire market. On the other hand, the opposite scenario could pause the advancement of the industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is worth mentioning, too. The event occurs approximately every four years and reduces the rate at which new BTC is mined. Historically, it has been followed by a massive crypto bull run, which might positively impact the XRP price.\n\nThose willing to explore additional factors that could play a role, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "The crypto ecosystem has gone through several dramatic changes in the past few years. In 2020 and 2021, the industry was driven by hype and speculation only to crash in 2022 and early 2023. There was no better example of this hype cycle than Solana (CRYPTO: SOL).\n\nIt peaked at more than $250 per token and dropped below $10 per coin after the collapse of FTX. But this continues to be one of the lowest-cost and highest-throughput blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, and if you think the innovation and disruption of crypto is from utility and not just speculation, this is still a cryptocurrency to hold long term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat people do in crypto matters\n\nThe health of a blockchain can be seen in the activity of developers and users. This can be judged by developer activity. Solana reports 2,500 to 3,000 developers consistently, short of only Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) at about 6,000 developers.\n\nOn the user side, transactions per second is a great gauge of how much activity there is on a blockchain. Solana averages between 3,000 and 4,000 transactions per second compared to a blockchain like Ethereum at around 13 transactions per second.\n\nThese two factors together will give you an idea of the health of the blockchain itself. If developers are building it and users are using it, the blockchain has a likely chance of growing in the future.\n\nETFs and the future of crypto investing\n\nWe have seen billions of dollars flow into the crypto industry over the past month after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to speculation that Ethereum will be the next to get an ETF and more cryptocurrencies may follow.\n\nSolana could get an ETF if Ethereum is approved. It has similar characteristics and smart contracts to Ethereum and has strong institutional and consumer interest.\n\nBut I don't think it's likely Solana will hold a place like Bitcoin in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is more like digital gold that investors simply want to hold long term, whereas Solana is more of a utility coin for the blockchain. But there could be buyers for both kinds of assets.\n\nSolana's uncertainty\n\nThe one downside of Solana is the coin itself is not as important to the ecosystem as it is to something like the Ethereum blockchain. Yes, there's a proof-of-stake element to Solana, but a lot of transactions simply happened with USDC stablecoin as the medium of exchange.\n\nThe future of Solana may be driven by a USDC-denominated token or some other fiat-backed token, and not the Solano cryptocurrency that we see today. This may mean less upside with the cryptocurrency itself, despite being the native coin to the blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven all of these factors, I think the biggest reason to be bullish on Solana long term is the fact that this is where innovation development and transactions are taking place on the blockchain today. There's more activity and innovation on Solana than almost any other blockchain. And activity and USDC we are using the Solana blockchain for normal financial transactions without even knowing it in the future. That will be a truly disruptive future, and is a great reason to buy Solana.\n\nIs it too late? I don't think it is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them.
