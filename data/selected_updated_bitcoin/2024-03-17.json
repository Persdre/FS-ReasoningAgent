AMBCrypto found that transaction volume on the network, also assessed using a seven-day moving average, attained a YTD high of $7 billion on 11th March.\n\nAs transaction volume rallied, the average fee paid per transaction on the network also climbed. According to The Block\u2019s data, this reached a YTD high of $25 on 11th March.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT sector fails to react\n\nDespite the recent uptick in demand for the Ethereum network, its decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token ecosystems have witnessed declines.\n\nFor example, the total value of assets locked (TVL) across the DeFi protocols housed within the chain declined by 5% in the last week. Per DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $53.4 billion.\n\nOut of the top 10 DeFi protocols on Ethereum, only one (ether.Fi) recorded a TVL hike in the past seven days. The rest of them witnessed a decline.\n\nThe network\u2019s NFT sector recorded a 21% decrease in sales volume in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, despite the 90% uptick in the number of traders trading NFTs on the network during that period, the transaction count fell by 2%.\n\nIn the last seven days, 166,000 NFT transactions worth $130 million were completed on the Ethereum network.\n\nLook before you leap\n\nThe network\u2019s native coin ETH sold for $3,721 at press time. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value dropped by 6% in the last week. The decline followed a sharp fall in Bitcoin\u2019s value on 14th March, when its value was below $68,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that its Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator has posted red upward-facing histogram bars since 11th March.\n\nAn asset\u2019s AO measures market trends and changes in momentum. When it displays red upward-facing bars, it suggests increasing negative momentum in the market. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or entering short positions."
