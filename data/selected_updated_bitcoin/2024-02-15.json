        "content": "A Solana-based (SOL) decentralized rendering altcoin is trading sideways despite the news that the top US crypto exchange platform would be adding support for it.\n\nIn a new announcement, Coinbase says that it\u2019s going to be listing Render (RENDER), a decentralized altcoin that allows users to share their unused GPU (graphics processing unit) power to render graphics and visual effects for other projects as a means of earning rewards.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will add support for Render on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported.\u201d\n\nThe digital asset had a lukewarm response to the listing, as it is trading for $4.91 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease over the last 24 hours.\n\nRender used to be an Ethereum-based (ETH) token, but it switched over to Solana in late 2023. According to Jules Urbach, the project\u2019s founder, the move greatly enhanced the utility of the protocol.\n\nSays Urbach,\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it will be supporting both the Solana and Ethereum versions of the asset, noting that the tokens have slightly different names across blockchains.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will support trading of the Render token on both Ethereum and Solana networks. Render on the Ethereum network will retain the ticker RNDR while Render on Solana will have the ticker RENDER and will be named Render (Solana) on our trading platform.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Genesis Global has been approved by the bankruptcy court to sell around 35 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision during a court hearing held in White Plains, New York.\n\nThis approval authorizes Genesis to monetize its holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust.\n\nGenesis to Sell its GBTC Shares\n\nIn addition to the $1.3 billion in GBTC shares, Genesis intends to sell over 11 million shares in two Grayscale Ethereum Trusts, with a combined value exceeding $200 million, as detailed in a court filing dated February 2.\n\nThis will result in a total of approximately $1.6 billion shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) combined.\n\nHowever, Genesis\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, attempted to delay the proposed sale until after the bankruptcy court decides on the subsidiary\u2019s debt repayment plan, which is scheduled for later this month. DCG expressed concerns that premature Grayscale share sales could depress prices, minimizing potential recoveries for Genesis creditors.\n\nJeffrey Saferstein, representing DCG, also emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid the rapid unloading of shares. Additionally, DCG sought the right to seek input on selling Grayscale shares.\n\nDespite these objections, Judge Sean Lane ruled in favor of Genesis, asserting the company\u2019s right to determine the strategic sale of its assets. He emphasized that the sales would be conducted over time with the assistance of a broker to prevent any rapid unloading of shares, which could adversely affect prices.\n\nLane justified his decision by highlighting the \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d of Genesis and its creditors in crypto, suggesting that they are well-equipped to maximize the value of the Grayscale shares.\n\nSEC and NY Attorney General Settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Genesis is moving forward with its liquidation plan, which entails shutting down the company and repaying customers in cash or cryptocurrency, depending on the nature of their deposits.\n\nThe company has reached settlements with the U.S. SEC and New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month, resolving their objections to its bankruptcy plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlements, the SEC will be paid a $21 million fine if Genesis has any surplus funds after repaying customers. Furthermore, any funds recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings will be used by the New York Attorney General to assist creditors allegedly defrauded by Genesis."

        "content": "Thu 15 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nIn the particularly booming crypto market landscape lately, making a relevant choice between positioning on Bitcoin or Ethereum can be quite the dilemma. These two crypto ecosystems are the leaders of the crypto market. But they are distinctly different in terms of their functionalities and advantages. Understanding this divergence can be crucial for your crypto investment choices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the safest crypto investment over Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is often nicknamed the \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its longevity and its increasing value over time. It is now widely regarded as a store of value and a hedge against often rampant inflation.\n\nMoreover, its simplicity and history make it an appealing choice for cautious, or even wary, investors. On this point, it stands out significantly from Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum firm.\n\nThe latter offers a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just limited to being a simple cryptocurrency.\n\nThanks to its flexibility, this platform paves the way to new prospects in various sectors such as finance and logistics, among others. This leads some to say that Ethereum represents decentralized innovation where Bitcoin is a safe investment choice. However, this doesn\u2019t always settle the question of choosing between these two crypto platforms.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum: how to make the choice?\n\nThe choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly depends on your investment goals and your risk tolerance as an investor. Generally, Bitcoin is a good option if you\u2019re looking to preserve value, due to its stability and reputation as a safe asset.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for growth opportunities, Ethereum might be particularly attractive because of its potential for innovation and its diversity of applications. This characteristic makes it an undisputed solution in terms of application development, due to its structure that\u2019s especially suitable for deploying dApps in a relevant way.\n\nEither way, these two crypto platforms share one common factor. As with the majority of cryptocurrencies, they are subject to high volatility and face uncertain regulations in many regions around the world. Even though Bitcoin features a more established technology while Ethereum is constantly evolving with regular updates.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum will depend on your investor profile and your long-term goals. Hence the need to do your own research beforehand to take into account your particularities in terms of crypto investment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Bitcoin price could extend gains by 5% to $55,000 as BTC bulls hold their breath.\n\nEthereum price could leap 7% to $3,000 if ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check.\n\nRipple price garners strength for an 11% move to $0.6000, levels last tested on January 12.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pumping hard, with altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) following in line. The apex cryptocurrency continues to recover some of the ground lost during the past years.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price posts a new range high as Gensler details economic difference between BTC and the US Dollar\n\nBitcoin eyes $55,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could take $55,000 soon, a 5% climb above current levels that does not seem so far right now. With strong technical indicators behind it, BTC is confronting resistance at the upper boundary of the ascending channel.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, suggesting rising momentum that could send Bitcoin price higher. The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are also flashing green with large volumes in positive territory, showing a strong bullish presence in the BTC market. This is accentuated by the MACD moving higher above its signal line (orange band).\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, considering BTC is overbought, investors should not be surprised if a pullback happens, which could send Bitcoin price below the midline of the channel and into the supply zone (turned bullish breaker) between $44,300 and $46,760. A break and close below the $45,554 midline would confirm a continuation of the fall.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price $50,000 milestone short-lived as US CPI inflation signals persistent inflationary pressure\n\nEthereum price could leap to $3,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s $3,000 target is now within reach as ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token has breached resistance due to the midline of the channel with the potential for a 7% climb to the forecasted target.\n\nThe MACD and AO both show a strong bullish grip, while the RSI hints at rising momentum, which could ferry Ethereum price to the psychological level, last tested on April 26, 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nLike BTC, however, ETH is also overbought, with the RSI above 70. With this, a correction is likely, with Ethereum price likely to descend 6.5% to $2,600 or in a dire case, revisit the $2,500 level. Such a move would denote a 10% drop below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Classic price coils up for a breakout with $30 in the cards for ETC\n\nXRP bulls are back in the game\n\nRipple (XRP) price has sustained a recovery since early February, showing that XRP bulls are back in the game. With Bitcoin showing directional bias, altcoins are following and the remittance token is not far behind.\n\nWith the RSI above 50, coupled with a bullish effort seen in the green histogram bars of both the MACD and AO, Ripple price could extend the gains 11% to retake the $0.6000 psychological level.\n\nRipple price is sitting in the upper half of the Bollinger Bands, between the centerline and the upper band at $0.5196 and $0.5428, respectively. This accentuates the bullish thesis.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit booking could cut the rally short, sending XRP price below the midline of the channel. In a dire case, the altcoin could descend to the $0.4734 support floor, levels last seen on October 12.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple unveils plans for crypto custody while XRP price trades sideways"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Tops $2,800, A Rally To $4,000 In The Making? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying at an impressive rate alongside its peer Bitcoin, which almost touched $53,000 on Thursday. Investors seem to be spoilt for choice, especially with altcoins making incredible strides. As discussed earlier today, investors are likely to start redistributing capital from Bitcoin profits into altcoins, propping tokens like ETH for a larger breakout targeting $4,000 in Q1.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: A Rally In The Making\n\nEthereum price bullish outlook comes amid impressive performance of Bitcoin ETFs which achieved a humongous cumulative net inflow of $4 billion on February 1.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestors perceive this surge as validation of Bitcoin and crypto from traditional investors. ETFs allow institutions to seek exposure to BTC without dealing with the complexities associated with navigating exchanges, owning physical digital and assets which require special custody services.\n\nAway from the BTC ETF, Ethereum is poised for a larger breakout due to the upcoming Dencun upgrade. All three testnet launches have been completed implying that developers will be announcing the final dates for the mainnet debut before the end of Q1.\n\nOptimism for a spot Ethereum ETF has also started to build. Following the approval of BTC ETFs, speculators turned to Ethereum as the next-in-line digital asset.\n\nThe approval of an Ether ETF, although a long shot at the moment, considering the hawkish stance of regulators in the US on whether Ethereum is a security or not, is expected to drive prices higher as witnessed with Bitcoin.\n\nAmid these expectations and potential market mover factors, Ethereum seeks a breakout above $2,800 to extend the leg to $3,000 and subsequently to $3,600 before the end of February.\n\nFor starters, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator backs the uptrend, displaying a buy signal and green histograms above the neutral area.\n\nIf interest in ETH continues this week, holding above $2,800 would signal confidence in the uptrend and possibly ignite FOMO among investors as they speculate on further price increases this week.\n\nSupport is expected at $2,700 on the downside. However, if profit-taking destabilises Ethereum price, traders may want to consider $2,500 and $2,200 as key support areas.\n\nBlockchain data by IntoTheBlock reveals that over 7.8 million Ethereum addresses are currently in profit, while 5.45 million addresses deal with unrealized losses.\n\nThe largest support area stands out at $2,365 \u2014 the average price at which 1.72 million wallets purchased slightly over 5 million ETH. Based on the chart below, Ethereum price has a higher chance of rallying to higher levels above $3,000 as opposed to dropping to January\u2019s support at $2,200.\n\nThat said, Ethereum could still be a steal if bought at the current market value. In case of dips to lower support areas, consider a dollar-cost average strategy to make the most out of the sublime bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.
