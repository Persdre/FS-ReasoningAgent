        "content": "Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could depreciate drastically.\n\nCowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum has fallen below the bull market support band (BMSB), an indicator consisting of a 20-week simple moving average and a 21-week exponential moving average used to determine whether the price of an asset is in bullish or bearish territory.\n\n\u201cThe last time that Ethereum fell below its bull market support band was actually about 30 weeks ago. Or the last time it was below its 20-week simple moving average was about 30 weeks ago. So it\u2019s been quite a while and now we have closed below it once again.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cowen, the price of Ethereum fell drastically during two previous times that closely resemble the current moment when the second-largest crypto asset closed below the BMSB.\n\n\u201cIn both cases, after it fell below the Bull Mark Support Band, Ethereum/US dollar then fell about another 50%\u2026\n\n\u202650% from here [around $2,970] puts ETH all the way back down at around $1,400.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,902 at time of writing.\n\nThe widely followed analyst says that he foresees the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair bottoming out over the coming weeks though the Ethereum/US dollar (ETH/USD) pair could take longer to form a bottom.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price to Reach $10,000 by the End of 2024? Analyst Weighs In - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum\u2019s price recently surpassed $3,000, with analysts predicting further significant gains.\n\nDeclining MVRV ratio, negative exchange netflow, and potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the US could drive ETH\u2019s value higher.\n\nIs ETH Gearing up for an ATH?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant uptrend in the past few days, with numerous digital assets rising to multi-week highs. Although not witnessing such a substantial increase, Ethereum (ETH) is also among the notable gainers.\n\nIts price surpassed the $3,000 mark, representing a 4% increase on a daily scale. Numerous analysts believe this could be the starting point of a bull run that can take place in the near future.\n\nThe X user Michael van de Poppe is among the optimists. He claimed recently that ETH is on its way to reaching a higher timeframe support level. \u201cThe good times are there in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d he assumed.\n\nCryptoYoddha was even more bullish, envisioning a price explosion toward the $10,000 milestone by the end of the year.\n\nLast but not least, World of Charts argued that ETH has started breaking the \u201cfalling wedge consolidation\u201d on a 12-hour timeframe. \u201cTrend is already up and expecting continuation towards $4500 in coming weeks,\u201d the analyst forecasted.\n\nObserving Some Important Factors\n\nOne element signaling that ETH\u2019s value could be on the verge of a rally is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). It helps to identify if the asset is overvalued or undervalued. A high ratio suggests a market top, while a low one may indicate a good buying opportunity. The MVRV has been on a significant downfall since mid-March.\n\nAnother factor is ETH\u2019s exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the past month (according to CryptoQuant\u2019s data). Shifting from centralized platforms towards self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.\n\nLast but not least, ETH\u2019s price may head north in case of the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. However, such a green light may also lead to the same immediate \u201csell-the-news\u201d event witnessed after the BTC ETF approvals in January."

        "title": "MIT grads\u2019 $25 million crypto crime puts spotlight on Ethereum front-running - Fortune",
        "content": "If you graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with elite computer skills, you can make great money working for a tech company\u2014or even more money working on Wall Street. But if that doesn\u2019t grab you, and you want to get even richer, you can always try your hand at white-collar crime like twentysomething brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. The pair came up with a scheme that let them pocket $25 million in just 12 seconds. Unfortunately, it ended badly, as the feds announced yesterday in a press release that reads like a pulp novel.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents,\u201d wrote the DOJ. For good measure, the release quotes an agent who declares the crime was solved \u201cwith cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work.\u201d\n\nPurple prose aside, the case involves some impressive detective work as well as a sophisticated explanation by Justice Department lawyers of a new type of alleged crime involving the Ethereum blockchain. The crime involves the arcane business of \u201cMaximum Extractable Value,\u201d or MEV, which entails packaging transactions in a block in a way that allows those who construct the blockchain to profit from others\u2019 transactions.\n\nThe miners who build blockchains do not, of course, do this out of the goodness of their hearts. Instead, the process relies on incentives that allow miners\u2014in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains\u2014to obtain a reward in the form of both coins and transaction fees for adding a new block. When Ethereum switched to a new blockchain construction process known as proof-of-stake, however, it created new opportunities for miners to make money\u2014including by front-running trades included in the blocks they package. This is what people mean by MEV. (Bitcoin investment firm River, as well as the DOJ\u2019s criminal indictment, has a good explanation of how exactly it works).\n\nMEV has been around for a while now, and while a number of people in crypto find it distasteful, it is not illegal\u2014and indeed, similar things go on in the world of traditional finance such as the practice known as payment for order flow. The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, took things a step further when they detected a bug in a popular piece of software used to carry out MEV. This allowed them not to simply front-run Ethereum users\u2019 transactions, but to tamper with them in a way that allowed them to outright rob them.\n\nAll of this is likely to draw new scrutiny of the murky practice of MEV, and potentially lead to calls for reform among the Ethereum crowd. As for the Peraire-Bueno, the episode also showed that people with MIT degrees are also capable of old-fashioned stupidity. Not only did they get caught, but the DOJ also found evidence they conducted web searches about things like money laundering and how to get away with financial fraud. Don\u2019t Google your crimes, people! Finally, the brothers can at least take comfort that they are not the only MIT grads to be charged with crypto crimes\u2014the school is also the alma mater of a certain Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe government of El Salvador has mined 474 Bitcoins in the last three years via volcano-powered rigs, contributing to the country's overall holding of 5,575.
