        "title": "Bitcoin Drops 6.3% and Drags Ethereum and Dogecoin Down With It - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Traders continue to sell the news of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin (BTC -0.15%) ETF was supposed to bring billions of dollars into the crypto industry, but in typical fashion, investors bought the rumor and sold the news. As of 2:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, and the selling accelerated early this morning.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.21%) has rallied the last few days but dropped 3.7% between 10 a.m. ET and 2:30 p.m. ET. Dogecoin (DOGE -0.56%) plunged 3.9% in just the last few hours as well.\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF approval was months in the making, and when these ETFs were announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, the market started to sell off. A lot of traders had bought in anticipation of the ETFs (buying the rumor) and then began selling when there was no longer a catalyst to count on in the future (sell the news).\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin has been flat in the past week, Ethereum is up 10%, and Dogecoin is down just 0.4%. So there hasn't been a big move if you pull back a bit.\n\nI do think it's notable that Ethereum has gained as much as it has. The speculation trade has likely moved to the second-largest cryptocurrency, which could eventually be a popular ETF asset as well.\n\nTechnology takes it on the chin\n\nCryptocurrency doesn't trade in a vacuum, either. Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has traded with high-growth tech stocks, and they're having a terrible day.\n\nLayoffs at Cloudflare, Alphabet, Discord, and dozens of other companies are calling into question the growth we should expect for 2024. There's still a delayed realization in parts of the tech industry that growth is slowing and costs need to come under control if companies are going to be profitable.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily impact cryptocurrencies directly, but if cryptocurrencies trade with growth tech stocks, it's not surprising to see a sell-off.\n\nWhat we don't know matters most\n\nThe theory of the last few months in cryptocurrencies was that an ETF approval would bring new buyers into the crypto market, bringing billions of dollars with them. But will that be the case?\n\nIt seems to me that buying cryptocurrencies is easy enough for anyone who wanted to buy some over the last few years. An ETF may make it easier in some ways, but it also comes with fees that are unnecessary for cryptocurrencies you can hold in self-custody.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies continue to fall as the market realizes that new money isn't coming in as expected following ETF approvals. And there's no increased utilization of the blockchain for innovative purposes if assets are held in an ETF.\n\nThis week has been more volatile than even a normal week in crypto. Don't be surprised if that's the theme for the next few weeks as the market figures out who is buying crypto to hold and who was just speculating on ETF approvals. There may be more speculation going on than investors would like to think."

        "title": "Buying the rumor paid off for spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and Ethereum looks to be next - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs backed by actual bitcoin finally hit US exchanges on Thursday after more than a decade of attempts. So far it\u2019s done mostly nothing for bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin briefly neared $49,000 after the spot ETFs went live but it has since shed about $3,000 to retrace by 6%.\n\nThat\u2019s even slightly below where it was before the SEC\u2019s social media hacker posted an authorized approval announcement about the ETFs on Tuesday, about 24 hours before legitimate confirmation.\n\nAny boon to the price of bitcoin seems to have come way earlier. Bitcoin traded around $25,000 before BlackRock filed for its spot ETF last June and rallied 20% within days.\n\nWith the post-BlackRock pump, bitcoin had reclaimed its pre-Terra implosion price.\n\nBitcoin would give up those gains in the weeks following. But by mid-October, a fake news tweet claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s bid set bitcoin on a major uptrend.\n\nThere was immediate volatility around the tweet \u2014 climbing $2,000 and down again within 30 minutes \u2014 but bitcoin ended up shooting nearly two-thirds in two months, from $27,700 to $44,000 in December.\n\nAt this rate, ether could soon overtake bitcoin for six-month returns\n\nAbout there it hovered until earlier this week. Analysts, researchers, traders and pundits were generally in consensus that the SEC would indeed approve spot ETFs for launch in the US, and come Monday bitcoin had jumped 8% to clear $47,000 for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAll things considered, the bitcoin spot ETF approval was massively front-run by those trading on the rumor. Anyone who bought bitcoin when word of BlackRock\u2019s filing first broke last year would now be up by more than half.\n\nAnyone who bought bitcoin when the ETFs were officially approved would now be about even and could even be down slightly.\n\nHad they opted for ether, they\u2019d be up to 8% in the green, as traders appear looking to frontrun the next potential wave of crypto spot ETF approvals in the US.\n\nBlackRock and other issuers including Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy have filed for a spot ether ETF since lodging their equivalent bitcoin applications. The SEC has between late May and early August to make its first decision.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin and ether diverge after SEC\u2019s bitcoin ETF snafu\n\nIn the meantime, markets seem to be waiting to find out exactly how much bitcoin BlackRock, Fidelity and other ETF issuers actually bought to back their respective funds after a busy day-one session, when more than $4.6 billion in spot ETF shares were traded in the US overall.\n\nIn and outflow figures would be the first indications of investor interest and could shed light on their potential influence on bitcoin prices moving forward.\n\nSome preliminary figures have been floated on social media but analysts warn they may not be totally accurate. Confirmed data is only expected to be completely accurate later in the day, or even early next week.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This development has significantly sparked interest in Ethereum-based tokens, leading to a notable surge in their value. Ethereum's price, in particular, has reached its highest point since May 2022. Investors are optimistic about the possibility of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF receiving SEC approval, contributing to this upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to enthusiasm, Vitalik Buterin's recent proposal to increase Ethereum's gas limit further fueled the surge, with Ethereum's price surpassing the $2,600 mark for the first time since May 2022. This has set a promising stage for Ethereum price climbing towards the $3,000 milestone.\n\nTechnical analysis using Bollinger Bands on the daily timeframe supports this bullish perspective. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,655, having moved above the upper Bollinger Band at $2,539, indicating a shift to bullish market momentum.\n\nTo reinforce the prediction of Ethereum reaching $3,000, a significant challenge must be overcome: breaking through the psychological resistance around $2,800.
