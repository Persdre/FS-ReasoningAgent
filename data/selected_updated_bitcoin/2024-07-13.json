        "content": "Kraken Head of Strategy Thomas Perfumo said spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs could help the crypto sector while commenting on political developments in the US.\n\nOn July 12, Perfumo told Bloomberg that spot Ethereum ETFs would attract capital flows while attracting attention to crypto, noting:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rising tide, lifts all boat story. \u201c\n\nPerfumo further explained that Ethereum\u2019s eventual value \u201chinges on the Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nHe said that the crypto market is \u201cpricing in\u201d $750 million to $1 billion of net inflows to Ethereum products on a monthly basis, which would imply that Ethereum could reach all-time highs between $4,000 and $5,000.\n\nPerfumo also compared expectations to Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in March, which he called a \u201cquiet peak\u201d that occurred without any evidence of millions of new investors entering the industry.\n\nPolitical developments\n\nPerfumo also commented on political developments. Early in the interview, he said US election outcomes will \u201cset the tone for policy making and the legislative agenda for the next four years.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of legislative action and clarity and noted that recent developments show bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nThe House recently decided to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and attempted to repeal the SEC\u2019s controversial accounting rules along with the Senate. However, President Joe Biden chose to veto the resolution.\n\nPerfumo said:\n\n\u201cEven though you\u2019ve hit barriers at the executive level, [there\u2019s] still good progress going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Republican party appears \u201cmore pro-crypto [and] more progressive\u201d on the matter, noting Donald Trump\u2019s plans to attend the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.\n\nTrump has also made numerous statements in favor of pro-crypto policy, including at recent campaign events in Wisconsin and San Francisco.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Nada from SEC this week. Unclear why they taking such sweet ass time. Every issuer is ready. Docs are ready. It\u2019s like a rain delay in baseball. Gotta just wait.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is keeping issuers of spot Ethereum ETFs in suspense with extended delays. Additionally, Ethereum bulls are eagerly anticipating a significant price rally once the approval process concludes.\n\nNate Geraci Predicts Timeline for Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nETF Store President Nate Geraci recently shared his observations of the SEC\u2019s approach towards the spot Ethereum ETFs review process. Geraci stated that the US SEC seems to be treating the spot Ethereum ETF S-1 filings in a manner similar to the 19b-4 forms, thereby maintaining a high level of secrecy in the matter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the silence, Geraci believes that the approval shall happen by the next week. \u201cI still think approval is likely next week. There is absolutely no reason for delay,\u201d he said.\n\nIt appears the SEC is playing the spot eth ETF S-1s similar to the 19b-4s\u2026 *Extremely* tight-lipped. Still think approval next week. Absolutely no reason for delay. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 12, 2024\n\nThe SEC is repeating the same mistake this time as it did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said Geraci while quoting SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce. Back then Pierce said: \u201cHad these products come to market in the way other comparable products typically have, we would have avoided the circus atmosphere in which we now find ourselves.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas also commented on the SEC\u2019s lack of action regarding the Ethereum ETFs. He said that there\u2019s been no communication throughout this week after the issuers submitted S-1 forms on Monday. This leaves the issuers puzzled over the delay.\n\n\u201cEvery issuer is ready. Docs are ready. It\u2019s like a rain delay in baseball. Gotta just wait,\u201d Balchunas remarked. He expressed hope that the situation might progress quickly next week, but uncertainty remains. As per the market sentiment, the issuers are expecting one more filing submission before the final approval by the SEC.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Gas Fee Flashes Inactivity Concerns Before Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nTop Players Accumulate ETH Before the ETF Approval\n\nOver the last few weeks, some of the top market market players and Ethereum whales have been accumulating ETH in preparation for the ETF approval.\n\nThomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken showed that the US Ethereum ETFs can see inflows to the tune of $1 billion every month following the approval. Additionally, big market players like Tron founder Justin Sun have accumulated $1.1 billion worth of Ethereum gearing up for a big rally ahead.\n\nAs of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.25% up trading at $3,123 with a market cap of $375 billion. Ethereum bulls should take the price past $3,200 in order to trigger the bull run up to $4,000 and beyond.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Executive Says Ethereum ETF Is Close to the Finish Line\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum's price has followed a divergent pattern in the first 365 days after a Bitcoin halving event.\n\nOver 90% of ETH's supply has been in profit since January.\n\nEthereum investors are slowly displaying confidence again with ETH ETFs on horizon.\n\nEthereum is up 0.3% on Friday as key insights from Glassnode reveal ETH's next potential move as the current bull cycle matures.\n\nDaily digest market movers: How ETH has performed so far in current cycle\n\nDespite earlier predictions that the agency would likely approve issuers' spot ETH ETF S-1 registration statements, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has remained silent. While the SEC remains mum, key on-chain data provide insight into key historical price moves in Ethereum and how they may affect the current cycle:\n\nEthereum has followed a somewhat divergent market performance in the first year after a Bitcoin halving event, according to Glassnode. In 2016, ETH suffered a 45% drawdown before picking up the pace to rally about 3,400%. In the 2020 halving, ETH charged up by 150% before rising about 2,150%. Since the past halving in April, its price has remained relatively flat.\n\n\n\nETH Price Performance after Halving\n\n\n\nEthereum has often experienced steeper drawdowns than Bitcoin during the early and later stages of previous bull cycles. In previous cycles, ETH saw corrections of above 65%. However, the largest drawdown in the current cycle is quite low compared to others, coming in at -42%.\n\n\n\nThe total supply of ETH in profit crossed the 90% mark in January and remained relatively above it throughout H1. According to Glassnode, extended periods where 90% of a coin's supply is in profit often indicate the later stage of a bull cycle. This is characterized by profit-taking from investors, which in turn outweighs demand.\n\n\n\nETH Percent Supply in Profit\n\n\n\nETH's growth is evident in its 267% rise, adding $354 billion to its market capitalization since the FTX lows of November 2022.\n\nETH technical analysis: ETH investors are slowly gaining confidence again\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,135 on Friday, up by a mere 0.3% on the day. After posting a bearish exhaustion candle, ETH briefly declined to $3,060, sparking over $40 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. Long and short liquidations accounted for 81% and 19% of total liquidations, respectively.\n\nThe move saw ETH's total liquidations flipping that of Bitcoin despite its relatively lower market cap. This could prime ETH to begin a fresh move toward the upside.\n\nETH options Open Interest (OI) declined to $5.16 billion on Monday, its lowest level in the past year. The move signified heightened uncertainty among traders as ETH's price retraced below $3,000.\n\nHowever, following a slowdown in the bearish pressure and a slight rebound in ETH's price, ETH options OI has begun climbing up again, nearing the $6 billion mark on Friday. The price recovery and rising OI indicate traders are slowly gaining confidence in ETH again.\n\nThis is also evident in ETH's Long/Short Ratio, which has risen to 1.04 in the past few hours.\n\nWith the potential launch of Ethereum ETFs on the horizon and BTC seeing heavy selling pressure from miners, the German Government, and Mt. Gox repayment, investors may reallocate capital into ETH. However, the SEC's delay to greenlight issuers ETH ETF S-1 drafts may hamper a good price increase.\n\nAs a result, ETH will likely follow a horizontal trend within the $2,852 to $3,300 range but slightly tilted toward the upside until the SEC moves on ETH ETFs.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, ETH may drop to around $3,041 in the short term, where there is a liquidity wall of $35.57 million, before rebounding."

        "content": "A significant Ethereum whale has made a substantial purchase, investing millions into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This notable transaction occurred at a crucial time, as the crypto community anxiously awaits potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe timing of this large-scale acquisition, combined with the ongoing regulatory uncertainty, has ignited intense interest among investors and analysts. Many view this as a possible indicator of shifting market dynamics for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDetails Of The Whale Purchase & Market Context\n\nA significant Ethereum transaction has caught the attention of the crypto community, highlighting growing interest in the cryptocurrency as speculation about ETF approval intensifies. An Ethereum wallet, identified by the address 0x517\u20267aF15, has made a substantial purchase of 10,545 ETH coins.\n\nThis acquisition occurred over a brief three-hour period, indicating a rapid and decisive move by the buyer. The total value of this purchase amounts to approximately $33.29 million, with each ETH coin acquired at an average price of $3,156. Interestingly, the buyer executed this large purchase through five separate transfers. Each transfer involved an identical amount of ETH, suggesting a strategic and possibly automated buying approach.\n\nOver recent weeks, there has been a noticeable trend of accumulation among top market players and Ethereum whales. Thomas Perfumo, the head of Strategy at Kraken, has provided valuable insight into the potential impact of spot Ethereum ETF approval. According to Perfumo, U.S. Ethereum ETFs could see substantial inflows, potentially reaching $1 billion every month following approval.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, other high-profile figures in the crypto space have been making significant moves. For instance, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has reportedly accumulated Ethereum worth $1.1 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Hong Kong & Australia Bitcoin ETF Inflows Hit Record High\n\nCurrent Ethereum Market Status & Regulatory Outlook\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum price is trading at $3,153.88, with a 24-hour trading volume of $8.9 billion. This represents a 1.30% price increase over the last 24 hours and a 4.60% increase over the past week. The current circulating supply stands at 120 million ETH.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has been delaying its decision, creating uncertainty for ETF issuers and investors. Market analysts remain optimistic about an imminent approval, with some predicting it could happen as soon as next week.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the SEC might be repeating its approach from the Bitcoin ETF approval process, potentially causing unnecessary delays. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF strategist Eric Balchunas noted a lack of communication from the SEC this week, despite ETF issuers submitting their S-1 forms on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, just before the final decision on ETF approval, Ethereum gas fees dropped to a two-month low, suggesting major inactivity on the Ethereum network. This development adds another layer of complexity to the current market situation and regulatory expectations.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Co-founder Highlights US Govt\u2019s Crypto \u2018Mess\u2019\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
