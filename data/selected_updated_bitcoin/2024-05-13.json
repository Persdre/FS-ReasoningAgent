        "title": "Ethereum has been increasingly inflationary for over a month as fees hit all-time low - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since Ethereum moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022, it has become a deflationary asset. The total circulating supply of Ethereum (ETH) currently stands at 120,105,358 ETH, representing a 415,680 ETH decrease from the supply levels observed before The Merge.\n\nHowever, over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics have shifted, with 35,548.72 ETH being burned (removed from circulation) and 75,072.43 ETH being issued as block rewards to validators. The net result is a supply increase of 39,523.71 ETH during this period. Data from Ultrasound Money show that, based on the supply change over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s current annualized inflation rate is approximately 0.4%.\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate stands at 1.068%, while Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (pre-merge) inflation rate would have been significantly higher at 3.74%. If the current 30-day rate persists, projections for the next year indicate that around 433,000 ETH will be burned, and 914,000 ETH will be issued, creating a net gain of 481,000 ETH.\n\nData from OKLink shows a continued decrease in ETH burned since March, when an average of around 6,000 ETH was burned daily. Since the start of May, only around 900 ETH has been burned daily, the lowest average levels since The Merge.\n\nThe recent Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network has had a notable impact on the ecosystem. The upgrade has led to a decrease in layer-2 transaction fees and overall network activity. Consequently, this has seemingly resulted in a lower burn rate, pushing Ethereum\u2019s supply back into an inflationary state.\n\nData from Etherscan and Ycharts shows that gas fees have also plummeted to around 5 gwei, the lowest on record.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate has drawn closer to that of Bitcoin, especially in the aftermath of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event last month. As per data from the past 7 days, Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate for the past week stands at 0.54%, just 0.29 percentage points higher than Bitcoin\u2019s post-halving rate of 0.83%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflation rate has been steadily increasing since February when it reached a local low of -2%.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s supply has become slightly inflationary in the short term due to reduced network activity and burn rate, its overall supply is still decreasing on a net basis. This can be attributed to EIP-1559, which introduced a burn mechanism for a portion of transaction fees.\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate and supply dynamics will likely be influenced by future network upgrades and adoption trends. If transaction fees and burn rate remain low, Ethereum may continue to experience inflationary pressure in the near term. However, the long-term trajectory will depend on the success of upcoming upgrades and the overall growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe adoption of layer-2 networks and the recent increase in layer-3 network activity reduces load from the Ethereum mainnet, yet it does so at a cost. However, the current increase in L2 and L3 activity is not at a level to create sufficient L1 transactions to keep Ethereum deflationary. Only time will tell whether the ultra-sound money concept for Ethereum will be retained in a world dominated by L2 and L3s."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, major tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing significant fluctuations, presenting both challenges and opportunities for investors. Amidst this dynamic environment, the Furrever Token (FURR) emerges with an innovative marketing strategy aimed at attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, further diversifying the crypto ecosystem with its unique thematic focus and competitive initiatives.\n\nNavigating Bitcoin's \"Danger Zone\": Market Dynamics and Speculations\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing considerable volatility, currently trading at approximately $61,229.50, marking a slight increase of 0.65% from the previous day. This instability is particularly evident as BTC recently tested the critical $60,000 support level, a move that has heightened caution among investors. This phase is often described as the \"danger zone,\" a term used to denote the turbulent period following Bitcoin's halving events.\n\nDuring trading on May 10, Bitcoin's price momentarily dipped to an intraday low of $60,190 on Bitstamp, down from attempts to stabilize around $63,000. This sudden decrease has sparked widespread speculation among traders and analysts. Many believe that large-volume institutional actions, coupled with the temporary closure of the BTC ETF market, might have driven the drop.\n\nDespite this recent dip, market experts like Rekt Capital remain optimistic, suggesting that the end of this challenging \"danger zone\" could be in sight. Historically, such periods have been marked by sharp downturns followed by eventual stabilizations. The current market scenario of BTC demonstrates the complex interplay between market sentiment and institutional influences, which continues to dictate the cryptocurrency's price movements. As Bitcoin navigates through these fluctuations, the broader crypto community watches closely, anticipating the cryptocurrency's next moves in this unpredictable market landscape.\n\nEthereum Faces Market Headwinds and Analyst Scrutiny\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently been trading at $2,927.63, marking a slight decrease of 0.25% from the previous day. This modest drop is part of a broader trend of challenges that have caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.\n\nA significant event stirring the market was a major sell-off by an Ethereum whale who liquidated 6,714 ETH at a price of $2,903 each, culminating in a loss of approximately $6.5 million. This large-scale transaction has intensified concerns over Ethereum's future price direction. Market indicators are not promising, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a decrease in investor interest and key averages indicating a bearish outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Ethereum's substantial trading volume of $10.1 billion over the last 24 hours, the price has declined by 4.07%, fluctuating between $2,935.95 and $2,894.15. Analysts have pinpointed the $3,017 level as a crucial resistance point; surpassing this could potentially shift the momentum to a bullish trend and help Ethereum break out of its current descending channel pattern.\n\nHowever, several factors are complicating this outlook. The cryptocurrency has been in a descending channel since mid-March, and the delayed approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added to the bearish sentiment. Moreover, the recent Dencun hard fork, which was intended to enhance Ethereum's scalability, did not have the expected positive impact on its price, leading to further speculation about its effectiveness and future impact on Ethereum's market performance.\n\nThese developments paint a complex picture for Ethereum as it navigates through ongoing market challenges and investor scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Attract Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors\n\nThe Furrever Token (FURR) has introduced an exciting $20,000 competition, targeting holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to diversify into its presale phase, which prominently features cat-themed imagery and an engaging, playful ecosystem. Operating on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token is currently offering 65% of its approximately 9 billion token supply to early investors, signaling a strong start with over $1 million raised in just two months.\n\nAs the presale progresses, Furrever Token continues to captivate the community's interest, with its current price set at a modest $0.000648. A notable aspect of this token is its absence of buy and sell taxes, which enhances its accessibility and affordability, appealing especially to new entrants in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe centerpiece of Furrever Token's promotional activities is the \"Furrever Token $20,000 Highest Total Buys Competition.\" This contest is designed to spur enthusiasm and investment by rewarding the top 10 participants who purchase the most FURR tokens during an 18-day period from May 9, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, to May 27, 2024, at 12:00 UTC. The top purchaser will be awarded $5,000, with descending prize amounts for the other top buyers.\n\nThis initiative not only underscores Furrever Token's commitment to building a robust and engaged community but also positions the token as a potentially lucrative opportunity for investors in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, looking to leverage their holdings into new and promising digital assets.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nJoin $20,000 Furrever Token Giveaway\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
