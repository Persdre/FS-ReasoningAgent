        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the blockchain network\u2019s ecosystem, liquidated $1.6 million worth of ETH, according to crypto analytical firm Arkham Intelligence.\n\nData from the platform reveals that the foundation utilized the CoW Protocol to sell 700 ETH, acquiring $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin. Subsequently, the funds were transferred to an address \u201c0x9ee\u2026313D,\u201d identified as the Grant Provider by Etherscan.\n\nThis transaction, which may have occurred when ETH was valued around $2,400, closely mirrors a previous one on Jan. 16. During that instance, the foundation exchanged 100 ETH for $253,000, with the funds also directed to the Grant Provider wallet.\n\nDespite these recent sales, the Ethereum Foundation retains a substantial crypto portfolio. It currently holds 312.894K ETH, valued at approximately $747.40 million, and 31.2K WETH, valued at $74.65 million. Additional assets in its possession include $1.96 million DAI, $113.61K USDC, and $72.97K BUSD.\n\nGiven the considerable volume of ETH held by the foundation, its trading activities often influence the asset\u2019s price movements. Consequently, market observers often monitor its transactions for potential insights into the organization\u2019s plans.\n\nAs such, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s recent selling activities have contributed to a 4.3% decline in Ethereum\u2019s price, which currently trades at $2,386 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade\n\nInterestingly, these fund movements coincide with the recent launch of the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network\u2019s testnet, Goerli, on Jan. 17. This upgrade aims to alleviate gas fees and enhance transaction speed through improvements to the network\u2019s layer-2 rollups.\n\nThe upgrade is the most technical advancement the blockchain network has seen since the Shapella hard fork that allowed the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH).\n\nHowever, a bug delayed the network\u2019s launch for around four hours before the problem was fixed through a patch, allowing the network to run smoothly.\n\nPer Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next phase of its development will happen soon, with a planned upgrade to the Sepolia testnet and the Holesky testnet in the offing.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 3:39 pm UTC on Jan. 22, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is down 4.59% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $283.3 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $10.18 billion.

        "title": "Why Ethereum Slumped More Than 6% Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is seeing significant declines today as sentiment sours around the world's No. 2 cryptocurrency.\n\nMegacap cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH -0.51%) has continued to sell off in today's session, now having given up most of its gains since the sector-driven mania following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum declined 6.1% over the past 24 hours, dropping below the $2,350 level. This move appears to be tied to a number of market-driven forces, but also some token-specific headwinds that investors are pricing in today.\n\nHere's what's behind today's big downside move in Ethereum.\n\nSignificant Ethereum selling pressure impacting this token\n\nWhen certain investors sell a given cryptocurrency or stock, investors pay attention. Accordingly, news that the Ethereum Foundation (the nonprofit doing much of the behind-the-scenes work to keep Ethereum up and running) sold more than $1.6 million worth of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency has sent shockwaves reverberating through the market.\n\nRecent reports show that this large sale, in which 700 Ether were sold, continues a trend of capital-raising from the Ethereum Foundation. A previous sale of 100 Ether tokens on Jan. 16 from the same wallet suggests that the ongoing development work may be more costly than initially thought, providing some downside selling pressure on this token.\n\nEthereum does have another upgrade on the go, with its so-called Dencun upgrade already underway as of last week. Thus, it's possible that these token sales could dry up as development activity slows, but it's a key factor in the supply/demand equation investors are digesting right now.\n\nAdditionally, concerns around capital flight from the crypto sector, evidenced by more than $2 billion of Bitcoin ETF outflows, has some concerned about the secondary impacts on Ethereum. So far, the excitement around these exchange-traded products hasn't stoked the kind of investment many initially thought would come. For future Ethereum ETFs, that's not great, and this sector-wide selling pressure will likely continue to flow through to the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\n\nWhat to make of today's move\n\nOccasionally, it's important to reflect on the cost impacts various development initiatives have on various blockchain networks and their associated tokens. Given Ethereum's aggressive upgrade schedule and top-tier talent in terms of the developers working diligently on ensuring this protocol's stability, these token sales may not be surprising. But it does appear some in the market have been caught off guard by the corresponding selling pressure and sentiment shift caused by these sales.\n\nThat said, it could also be true that these ongoing upgrades provide outsized value relative to their initial up-front costs. Crypto investors and users want to see an Ethereum network that's as low cost and efficient as possible. That's what this Dencun upgrade aims to achieve.\n\nAdditionally, some recent news around MetaMask launching an Ethereum validator staking feature could result in more locked-up Ethereum tokens, potentially offsetting some of the recent selling pressure we've seen from the Ethereum Foundation and others.\n\nThese effects likely won't offset the institutional capital flight we're seeing from the crypto sector. However, it's the longer-term supply-and-demand dynamics investors will need to consider when it comes to this top-tier crypto.\n\nThus, I think the jury remains out with respect to how Ethereum will perform as it continues its ongoing upgrades in the coming months. For now, sentiment has soured, but long-term investors may want to consider this dip as a potential buying opportunity, as traders look elsewhere to take on bullish positions."

        "content": "The Ethereum community\u2019s concerns about execution client diversity has intensified, as roughly 84% of all validators are running Go Ethereum.\n\nMost Ethereum staking pools use just one execution client: Go Ethereum (Geth). As a result, some Ethereum enthusiasts have publicly encouraged people to avoid using Geth for their validator duties because of the potential risks of over-relying on one client.\n\nMore than four-fifths of all validators, which are in charge of proposing and validating new blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, use execution client Geth, according to data provided by the crypto analytics website clientdiversity.org, which covers about 60% of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum clients are software implementations people can download to run the Ethereum network. In order to perform its duties, a single validator typically runs two clients simultaneously to address different components of Ethereum \u2014 the consensus side and the execution side.\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client for Ethereum running on about 8% of validators encountered a bug yesterday, Ethereum core developer \u0141ukasz Rozmej said on X. The bug, which has since been resolved, has sparked a conversation about a hypothetical bug impacting Geth.\n\nWhile the consensus side has seen its client diversity improve, execution client diversity on Ethereum is weak. Specifically, the following Ethereum staking pools and service platforms \u2014 per execution-diversity.info \u2014 likely use Geth as their only execution client for their validator duties: Allnodes, Ankr, Blox Staking, Binance, Bitcoin Suisse, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, and Stakefish.\n\nIn addition, Lido, the largest liquid staking platform with more than nine million ETH staked, has connected over three-quarters of its validators to Geth as well.\n\nA \u2018Supermajority Client\u2019\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, designed Ethereum to work on different software clients, not just one, so that a bug affecting a single client would not adversely impact the whole blockchain.\n\nHowever, Geth is considered a \u201csupermajority client.\u201d As such, validators that run Geth have the capability to finalize the Ethereum blockchain without agreement from validators running other software clients, such as Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon. This has the potential for disastrous results such as a network split, loss of funds, and reputational damage to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cShould Go-Ethereum, likely to be the majority execution client after the Merge, produce an invalid block, it could get finalized and thus cause the catastrophic failure described in scenario 3,\u201d wrote Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist in a 2022 blog post. Scenario three entails a hypothetical situation where a client with more than two-thirds of the stake has a bug in its software and includes an invalid block to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nValidators running a minority client would only lose a small amount of rewards for having a bug, while the cost of having a bug for validators running a supermajority client would be massive.\n\n\u201cCounterintuitively: staking with a minority client bears significantly less risk \u2013 those affected by the recent Nethermind bug hardly lost the rewards of one to two days. Being on the wrong side as part of a majority, however, can lead to significant loss of stake,\u201d wrote co-founder of Gnosis Chain Martin K\u00f6ppelmann on X on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Lefteris Karapetsas, the founder of portfolio tracker Rotkiapp, noted on X that \u201cIn case of a supermajority Ethereum client bug that leads to complete loss of the stake of those stakers at the moment this would burn > ~20% of the entire ETH supply.\u201d\n\nLido did not immediately reply to Unchained\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nOn Monday night, Coinbase announced on X its goal of including an additional execution client in its validator infrastructure, after the Ethereum community expressed concerns about Coinbase\u2019s single client staking steup revolving around Geth.\n\nThe largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. said it relied solely on Geth for validation because it was the only execution client that met the company\u2019s technical requirements. But Coinbase said it is open to change.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date,\u201d wrote Coinbase on X. \u201cMany other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is currently assessing alternative execution clients, and said it would share their next steps by the end of February.\n\nUPDATE (January 23, 2:00 pm. ET): Updated with details of Coinbase\u2019s announcement."
