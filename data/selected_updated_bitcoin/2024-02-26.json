For Ethereum, the open interest accounts for approximately 2.77% of its market cap. Both have seen increases in the past weeks, but they are historically at an average level."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) continues to be the top coin. The second biggest digital asset by market cap is trading at 22-month highs on Monday.\n\nETH is now priced at $$3,151, CoinGecko shows, having broke past the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022 last week. It has gained 3.5% since the same time yesterday and risen by more than 8% over the past week.\n\nKaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt that \"open interest just hit a multi-year high of $7.7 billion and funding rates are at their highest levels since early January,\" meaning new capital is entering the market due to rising speculative interest as well as hedging.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nETH's network is set to undergo an important upgrade next month. Named \"Dencun,\" it aims to solve scalability problems with the blockchain.\n\nThe upgrade will bring \"proto-danksharding\" to the network, promising to make it faster and cheaper to use via layer 2 solutions. Layer 2s, or L2s, batch together unverified transactions made on Ethereum, process them on an external network, and send confirmation back to mainnet.\n\nA number of high-profile, traditional Wall Street firms are also hoping to get a spot ETH exchange-traded product approved.\n\nSuch a fund, if given the green light by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would bring the asset to traditional investors. Big names like BlackRock, VanEck, and Grayscale are all waiting on the regulator. Just last week publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase submitted a comment letter to back Grayscale's bid for an Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC in January approved 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have so far been popular and received huge inflows of capital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered said last month that a spot ETH ETF will get approved by May and send the asset's price above $4,000 per coin.\n\nDespite its recent surge, ETH is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Ethereum whales are accumulating large volumes of ETH after supply on exchanges hit a six-month peak.\n\nETH price sustained its uptrend even as Ether holders consistently realized gains since February 15.\n\n$20.48 million in short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as ETH price climbed to a new 2024 high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s large wallet investors, including a wallet address that allegedly belongs to Justin Sun of TRON, have been spotted accumulating the altcoin, according to on-chain data. The accumulation by whales could offset the altcoin\u2019s Supply on Exchanges, thereby reducing the selling pressure on ETH.\n\nTypically, Ethereum price rallies post a Bitcoin halving event, the upcoming halving in April 2024 could catalyze gains in ETH if the trend repeats itself.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price teases with a breakout, eyes $3,200 milestone as ETH bulls show resolve\n\nEthereum price could sustain uptrend with whales\u2019 massive ETH accumulation\n\nData from on-chain intelligence tracker Lookonchain revealed that wallet that allegedly belongs to TRON co-founder Justin Sun scooped up 12,702 ETH worth $36.9 million on February 21. Between February 11 and 21, the address bought 104,055 Ether worth $296 million at an average price of $2,846 from Binance and decentralized exchanges.\n\nWallet that allegedly belongs to Justin Sun, Ethereum accumulation. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe tracker identified addresses that are accumulating Ether in the past week. A whale wallet withdrew 14,632 ETH tokens from Binance, worth $45.5 million and staked it in the past week. Two other large wallet addresses withdrew 6,000 Ether from Kraken, worth $18.7 million, in the past two days.\n\nWhile Santiment shows that ETH Supply on Exchanges has hit its highest level in six months, the recent activities of whale wallets could reduce the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nEthereum Supply on Exchanges. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum wallet addresses holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH tokens have accumulated more Ether since the beginning of February. Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ETH have shed their Ether, reducing their Ethereum holdings in the same timeframe.\n\nKey catalysts\n\nThe accumulation of ETH wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million Ether coincides with Ethereum price rise, as observed in the chart below, in the past six months. This suggests it could be a key catalyst to the token\u2019s gains. If this trend continues, Ethereum price could continue rallying past the $3,000 mark.\n\nEthereum holdings of different whale cohorts. Source: Santiment\n\nAnother key catalyst is the upcoming Bitcoin halving. As seen in previous halving events, Ethereum price rallies in response to the mining reward halving of the largest asset. This is a trend that has repeated in the previous three halvings. If it continues, Ethereum price could rally towards its $4,000 target, ahead of the SEC\u2019s decision on Spot Ethereum ETF approval in May 2024.\n\nIt's important to note that in the past 24 hours, $20.48 million in short positions were liquidated as Ethereum price surged to a new peak in 2024, according to CoinGlass data. ETH price climbed to a high of $3,135.65 on Monday."
