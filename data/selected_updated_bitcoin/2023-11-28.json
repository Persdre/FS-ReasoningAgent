        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says that key indicators are flashing bullish for the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) as the altcoin remains above the $2,000 level.\n\nIn a new analysis, the former Goldman Sachs executive says that Ethereum\u2019s price action continues to print bullish patterns.\n\n\u201cThe zoomed-out chart of Ethereum continues to be one of the most bullish I have seen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the macro guru, Ethereum\u2019s market structure is closely mirroring increasing market liquidity.\n\n\u201cFed net liquidity versus Ethereum: Ethereum, for example, is basically a pure play on liquidity.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, Pal says that Ethereum is now potentially forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern after having completed a bullish flag pattern.

We have been highlighting the bull flag chart pattern in Ethereum \u2013 which we recently cleared \u2013 for several weeks now and it looks like we could be forming a larger cup-and-handle pattern.\n\nA close above $2,150 would be very positive.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could run 5% north to test the $40,000 psychological level amid rising momentum and bullish RSI crossover.\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 5% move past the range high at $2,141 with the RSI mirroring Bitcoin momentum.\n\nRipple price eyes 10% gain to the supply barrier at $0.6582 but only if the $0.5981 support level holds.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, leading the broader market north with a price action characterized by higher highs. It points to growing volatility with forces such as the legal troubles of Binance and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals chatter continuing to drive the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices are also teasing with bullish biases, hinting at bullish moves depending on how the bulls play their hands.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price gains might be sustainable with declining stablecoin dominance\n\nBitcoin could move north if RSI crossover is enough to go by\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has breached the $38,008 resistance level, though not decisive just yet, to trade for $38,139 at the time of writing. There remains potential for a stretch to the range high at $38,414, or in a highly bullish case, a neck up to tag $40,000.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving north and is just about to cross above the signal line (yellow band). Historically, every time this crossover happens, BTC reacted with a bold move north, thereby qualifying the crossover as a buy signal.\n\nIn the same way, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) continues to hold in positive territory, showing that bulls still have control despite a strong bearish pull.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could see Bitcoin price fall back below the $38,008 support, or worse, test the $35,487 support. In a more dire case, the slump could see BTC lose the support confluence between the horizontal line and the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $33,912. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis, setting the tone for an extension south to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nEthereum price eyes a 5% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price eyes a 5% climb to test the $2,141 range high before a possible correction, with the bullish breaker still holding as a support zone. The immediate support is at $2,029, atop which ETH continues to sit. Like in the case for Bitcoin, the RSI is about to cross above the signal line, hinting at a possible move north.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if sellers have their way, Ethereum price could fall into the supply zone turned bullish breaker, confirming the continuation of the move south by breaking and closing below the midline of this order block at $1,935.\n\nThe slump could extrapolate for Ethereum price to flip the bullish breaker back into a supply zone under the $1,864 support.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whale activity could pave way for ETH price to hit new yearly highs\n\nRipple price must hold above $0.5981 for 10% gain to play out\n\nRipple (XRP) is coiling up for a 10% move to the supply barrier stretching from $0.6582 to $0.7186, but it all depends on whether the $0.5981 support level holds. To confirm the uptrend, XRP must shatter the midline of the supply zone at $0.6857. In a highly bullish case, the $0.8000 psychological level could be tagged soon.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears dominate, selling pressure could send XRP price below $0.5981, thereby invalidating the bullish thesis. In an extended move south, Ripple price could test the 50-day SMA at $0.5853, with prospects for more losses past the 200 and 100-day SMAs at $0.5531 and $0.5480, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price to pull north as Ripple beckons financial institutions to adopt XRPL XRP token."

        "title": "Ethereum price may lose $2,000 level as ETH becomes deflationary again due to validator exit - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price, trading at $2,038 on Tuesday, will likely fall below the crucial support level amid waning bullishness.\n\nETH validators, for the first time since Shapella's hard fork, have begun exiting to the tune of 1,018 per day.\n\nETH issuance has also taken a hit and, for the first time since December 2022, has recently had its growth rate decreased by 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum price has been affected by the Shanghai hardfork since even before it was activated. But since the upgrade, this week marks the first instance when the market is witnessing the fear of unstaking come to life.\n\nEthereum price could take a bearish turn\n\nEthereum price has been hovering around the $2,000 mark since the beginning of the month. Trading at $2,038 at the time of writing, the second-generation cryptocurrency has failed to breach the resistance of $2,124 for the second time this month. While it did manage to break out of the downtrend over the past week, it is still vulnerable to a decline below the $2,000 support level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a measure of the speed and change of price movement. According to the indicator, there is still room for ETH to bounce back and reinitiate bullish momentum, given it is sitting above the neutral line at 50.0. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also exhibiting the dominance of bearish momentum in the market presently, owing to the red bars on the histogram and the lack of a potential bullish crossover.\n\nThus, all the fingers point at a likely downtrend, which might see Ethereum price touching the lows of $1,900 or testing the support at $1,795.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the broader market cues turn bullish and ETH bounces back from $2,000, it could make another attempt at breaching the resistance marked at $2,124. A rise through that level would invalidate the bearish thesis, opening ETH up to tagging $2,200.\n\nEthereum turns deflationary again\n\nThe chance of a bullish turn of events is both likely and unlikely. It's likely because ETH is deflationary once again. An asset being deflationary simply means that it no longer has an infinite supply but that it will reduce over time. This generally is a bullish event since low supply plus high demand equals a rise in price.\n\nBut the reason it could be unlikely in the case of Ethereum is that the conditions under which ETH is turning deflationary are unfavorable. According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, daily ETH issuance has experienced a slowdown. Over the last week, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum daily issuance\n\nThis marks the first issuance decrease in nearly 12 months, and the reason behind it is the exit of validators. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum runs on the Proof of Stake consensus method, which requires node/block validators to stake ETH in order to qualify. Earlier, this staked ETH could not be withdrawn, but that feature was activated after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nSince then, on average, 380 validators have exited on a daily basis. But this figure shot up by 168% in just a month, rising to 1,018 validators.\n\nEthereum validators\n\nConsequently, the staked ETH has also noted a decline. The possibility of the validator exit could be due to one or more of these three possible reasons:\n\nInvestors are opting to change their staking setup, for example, by transferring stakes from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).\n\nInvestors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital toward safer assets, such as US treasuries, as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.\n\nInvestors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend rather than less liquid-staked ETH.\n\nNevertheless, this is not a good sign for Ethereum as the validators are the backbone of the network, and their exit could prove to be rather negative."
