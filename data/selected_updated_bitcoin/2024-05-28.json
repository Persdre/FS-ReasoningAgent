        "content": "Ethereum Could See Bull Run Following SEC Approval of ETFs, According to Analysts\n\nMarket analysts predict that Ethereum is on the brink of a significant upward trajectory following the recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After facing delays and limited engagement, the top regulator in Wall Street gave the green light to a substantial number of asset managers seeking to offer Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIndustry observers like data firm Kaiko anticipate a further surge in value for the second-largest digital currency as a result of this development. While there may be some downward pressure on the price of ETH due to expected outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has been trading at a discount for the past three months, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain positive.\n\nKaiko draws its conclusion from the impact of Bitcoin ETFs following their approval in January. Investors who had invested in Grayscale's GBTC product immediately sought to cash out, leading to a short-term decline in Bitcoin's price. Kaiko suggests that a similar trend could occur with Ethereum ETFs, causing selling pressure on ETH due to outflows from Grayscale's ETHE.\n\nHowever, despite potential short-term challenges, Kaiko emphasizes that the regulatory approval of Ethereum ETFs has important implications for ETH as an asset. It removes some of the regulatory uncertainty that has affected Ethereum's performance over the past year. JPMorgan, the largest bank in America, expects the funds to begin trading before November."

        "content": "Representation of Ethereum\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cryptocurrency market lately, you\u2019re likely aware of the fact that Ethereum has made a 30 percent jump in recent days, marking a two-month high value, and shocking the overall crypto market. The price of Ethereum is $3,727.51 at the time of this writing, though that figure is obviously subject to change as the market continues to fluctuate. Given that ether has been all over the news in recent days, it\u2019s only fair to assume a number of fresh eyes have been placed on the world of crypto investments.\n\nSo, let\u2019s unpack what exactly Ethereum is, how it works, and examine the factors which led to this week\u2019s historic leap. Furthermore, we\u2019ll examine trends in the market and see if we can construct a comprehensive outline of where the decentralized currency will climb in the coming years. Without any further preamble, let\u2019s take a moment to dive into Ethereum, its price, and its applications.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nLike other hot cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain, which utilizes open-source software to regulate price without the control of government forces. The blockchain was first programmed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and has since grown to become one of the most commonly accepted cryptos on the market, second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum trades in a currency called ether, often abbreviated to ETH, and holds many investors all over the globe. Ether is designed to be programmable and secure, meaning it can be stored in an offline crypto wallet and used to purchase goods and services all over the world.\n\nAs one of the largest and most widely-recognized cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is often utilized by those who are fresh into crypto trading, as well as seasoned veterans of the blockchain. Still, many traders were quite surprised to see that ETH had jumped so high this past week, as the fluctuating value seemingly came out of nowhere, at least to the untrained eye.\n\nWhat Caused Ethereum To Rise?\n\nMarket fluctuations are normal for any form of currency, but have the potential to be especially volatile for the crypto market. Still, a 30 percent jump on a seemingly random Tuesday, combined with ETH being on the market for over a decade, makes this fluctuation quite a surprise. Regardless, those who have had their finger on the pulse saw this Ethereum bump coming, due to a pair of key factors.\n\nFor starters, the SEC is currently on pace to make a decision regarding spot Ethereum\u2019s exchange-traded fund, (or ETF for short) which should make ether easier to trade than ever, and more accessible to the general market. If Ethereum\u2019s ETF does reach final approval from the SEC, prices will undoubtedly soar even higher. The second major factor is simple, as the public has reacted to the impending decision, causing droves of investors to vie for an opportunity to invest greater total funds into ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBasically, market trends were dictated to rise due to the recent upheaval the crypto coin is about to undergo, making investors more enthusiastic than ever to throw their money behind Ethereum funds. Bitcoin had a similar surge when it was approved by the SEC, so many crypto investors are currently hoping that their investment will see a similar meteoric rise.\n\nHow Much Will Ethereum Be Worth By The End Of 2024?\n\nDue to intense market changes, it can be quite difficult to predict the value of any cryptocurrency in advance. Still, some experts have maintained a watchful eye of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and managed to put together a comprehensive idea of where the market might take their value. According to Investing Haven, Ethereum was projected to level out somewhere between #2,222 and $3,597 before the recent ETF news. Bullish projections now see the coin reaching highs of $5,000 to $9,000 with any luck, though these figures are still wholly speculative.\n\nThe most important sign of Ethereum\u2019s success is actually, somewhat surprisingly, the US dollar, as that is the highest source of ETH investments at this time. Experts have advised those interested in making crypto investments to follow the trend of the US dollar, and invest based on successes in that market, as announced by the federal reserve.\n\nHow Much Will One Ether Be Worth In 2030?\n\nWhile short-term trends are nearly impossible to calculate, long-term trends suggest that Ethereum will continue to rise in the coming years, meaning it\u2019s still likely a prudent move to invest now, despite the exponential increase of the past week. Per a financial report in Forbes, a single share of Ether could reach highs of $40,000 by the end of 2030. While this figure may seem astronomic, it was calculated using several key factors, including the safety and scalability of Ethereum, the comprehensive market strategy put forth by blockchain developers, and the rise of additional decentralized platforms.\n\nWhile it can be quite scary to break into the world of crypto trading, Ethereum seems like it\u2019s currently on track to be one of the most accessible high-yield investments in recent memory. Still, be sure to invest carefully if you do decide to engage with the crypto market. Do lots of independent research, interface with known and trusted advisors, and as always, never get out over your skis."

        "title": "Standard Chartered expects Ethereum to hit $8k in 2024 \u2013 Experts pick 5 coins for bigger gains - The Economic Times",
        "content": "After the US SEC asked exchanges to fine-tune their Ether ETF filings, market experts are almost certain that approval is on the way. Just like it was with Bitcoin, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to be the next big thing in the crypto market.Standard Chartered, agreeing that Ethereum will receive the green light for spot ETFs soon, has updated its price target for the leading altcoin. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research, believes ETH could peak at $8,000 by the end of the year.According to Geoff Kendrick, spot Ethereum ETFs will drive inflows of $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months. This inflow of capital is what is expected to be the driving force behind the next major move in the crypto market.Ethereum undoubtedly could play a massive role in this year\u2019s crypto winter, but there are other cryptos that are set to record bigger gains. Based on the predictions from top experts, KangaMoon , Chainlink, VeChain, Dogecoin, and Chiliz are some of the best cryptos to buy for more profits than Ethereum. Let\u2019s find out why.KangaMoon (KANG), the presale sensation of 2024, is one of the top altcoins predicted to shine in this altcoin season. The KangaMoon community has quickly grown to over 32,000, and over $7 million has been raised to create the most community-centric project.The aim of the project is simple: building and rewarding a lively community of people with similar interests in crypto games, meme culture, and engagements. Social-Fi, a new protocol, will power KangaMoon to reward users based on their level of engagement.KangaMoon has also partnered with RaidSharks to launch a community engagement bot that will add more flavour to the ecosystem. In addition, KangaMoon features a metaverse, \u2018Kangaverse\u2019 where players will be able to play selected crypto games, develop as well as level up their characters, and sell them for money.The unique approach of KangaMoon has made it a favourite in the crypto community. The price of KANG, its native token, has already increased by 400% this year to hit $0.025. The potential surge to $1 makes KANG the best crypto investment of the year.The decentralised oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top altcoins with a very bullish outlook in 2024. According to the pseudonymous trader, Immortal , all LINK needs to do to prepare for a massive price increase is remain above the $16 support level.The Chainlink price has held this support level since recovering it in mid-May. According to Immortal\u2019s analysis, LINK could explode to $28 by September. However, the long-term Chainlink price prediction suggests that LINK could hit $40 by December, levels the altcoin last recorded in May 2021.In a recent tweet, crypto exchange Bitget announced that it had listed VeChain (VET) on its platform. While the news has failed to spark a bullish move for VeChain, market analyst Crypto EA remains optimistic about the potential of VET this crypto summer.The analyst explained that VET recently touched the lower level of its Bollinger Bands (BB), resulting in the recent VeChain price pump. Based on his predictions, VET could target the higher level in this bull cycle. If VeChain follows through with this trend, the altcoin price could rise by at least 500% to hit $0.18. CryptoEA, however, believes VET could top out at $0.5 in this bull cycle.According to the pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse, spot ETH ETFs would make the crypto markets \u2018get crazier.\u2019 While the ETH altcoin price could see a major pump in price, Flow Horse is even more bullish about Dogecoin (DOGE).He notes that Dogecoin has been \u2018sitting in a really nice area for long,\u2019 and could be activated by the ETF approval. Based on the chart shared by Flow Horse, the Dogecoin price could pump towards $0.60 this bull cycle, an increase of more than 4x from its current range at $0.1600.Chiliz (CHZ) is one of the top altcoins already benefiting from the momentum Ethereum has been building. According to Santiment, the leading blockchain platform focused on sports and entertainment, is one of the altcoins seeing a surge in whale activity. The surging whale activity comes as Naver Pay and the Chiliz enter into a partnership to launch exclusive ticketing and payment services.With the potential to increase the Chiliz crypto, whales seem very optimistic that the price of CHZ could be on the rise. From its current range at $0.120, a Chiliz price prediction suggests that CHZ could hit a yearly high of $0.60 before this bull cycle is over.With Ethereum predicted to experience the same kind of rally as Bitcoin did after its ETF approval, it\u2019s a no-brainer why ETH is one of the best coins to invest in now. However, while it could be the face of this crypto summer, predictions from experts suggest other altcoins will end up with bigger gains.Standard Chartered\u2019s $8,000 prediction suggests the price of ETH will increase by 2.1x before the end of the year. Meanwhile, CHZ and VET could see an increase of 5x, and DOGE a rise of 400%. However, the best crypto investment for this year remains KANG, with a potential rise of 50x.While ETH prepares to lead another crypto bull market, LINK, CHZ, VET, and DOGE are some of the topcoins to invest in for bigger returns. Meanwhile, the top option remains KangaMoon as its unique new platform could fuel the biggest rally of the year.Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!The above content is non-editorial, and TIL (Times Internet Limited) hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.
