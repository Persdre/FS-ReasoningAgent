        "title": "Should You Buy Solana Right Now While It's Below $200? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Solana can convince investors it's the next Ethereum, it could skyrocket in value.\n\nIn 2023, Solana (SOL 0.81%) was one of the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, up an eye-popping 900%. In 2024, Solana has continued to turn in a stellar performance. At its current price of $165, Solana is up more than 60% through the first five months of the year.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Solana appears to be running into a wall right now. It is down nearly 20% since it hit an intra-year high of just over $200 in March. Should you view this as a potential buying opportunity, or as a warning sign that Solana's impressive recent gains could be coming to an end? Let's take a closer look.\n\nIs Solana the next Ethereum?\n\nThe primary reason to invest in Solana right now is that it could eventually become the next Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Solana is a direct challenger to Ethereum in the Layer 1 blockchain space, and has been steadily gaining ground in every major niche, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For nearly four years, Solana has been tagged as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and now it finally seems to be delivering on its promise.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest raved about Solana last year, calling it a faster, cheaper, and more efficient version of Ethereum. That's backed up by real numbers. Solana, for example, says it can process 50,000 transactions per second. Ethereum, by way of comparison, can only process 15 to 20 transactions per second. To achieve faster transaction processing speeds, Ethereum relies on a confusing mix of Layer 2 scaling solutions that even developers say is becoming too hard to use.\n\nSolana's secret weapon\n\nMoreover, Solana has a secret weapon that Ethereum simply cannot match: A mobile crypto strategy that is finally gaining traction with customers. Solana officially launched its new \"crypto phone\" (the Saga) last year. Early sales were weak, but a clever marketing promotion based around Solana meme coins has led to sales taking off.\n\nFrom the outset, Solana's mobile strategy was designed as a way to onboard new crypto users. The goal was to get a mobile phone into people's hands, give them plenty of apps they couldn't find anywhere else, and design new mobile experiences to make crypto easier to use. That, in turn, could result in people beating down the door to become part of the Solana blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAdmittedly, this might be a very long-term strategy. But it might just work. According to investment firm VanEck, all Solana needs is a single \"killer app\" with at least 100 million users, along the lines of a ChatGPT. If Solana can find a \"killer app\" for its mobile phone, it could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nVanEck ran the numbers and determined that, in a bull-case scenario, Solana might be worth over $3,200 by 2030. So, yes, if you buy into this analysis, you should be buying Solana while it's still below $200. At today's prices, you might be able to make a 20-fold return on your investment.\n\nThe case against Solana\n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons to be concerned about Solana. For example, the current bout of meme coin popularity taking over the Solana blockchain seems to be leading to some unsustainable performance. All of the improvement that we've been seeing in Solana's metrics -- such as new users, new unique wallets, and spikes in transaction activity -- might just be a lot of smoke and mirrors.\n\nMoreover, Solana continues to stand in Ethereum's shadow when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the end of May, the SEC granted approval for new spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading soon. If they are anywhere near as successful as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could lead to a huge influx of investor money flowing into Ethereum. That's fantastic for Ethereum holders, but it could act as a negative drag on Solana's price over the short to medium term. Money that otherwise might have gone into Solana will now be going into Ethereum.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nThat being said, I'm taking a long-term approach when it comes to Solana. As Solana steadily gains market share at the expense of Ethereum, and as it continues to build out its mobile crypto strategy, I'm highly confident that it can continue to boost its valuation. Solana is still 36% below its all-time high of $260, which could be a reasonable near-term price target.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, of course, Solana will find the one \"killer app\" that it needs. If that happens, it could skyrocket in value and achieve what many have been predicting for several years now."

        "title": "Ethereum Is Making Big Moves. 3 Reasons I'm Buying It Hand Over Fist in June. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is poised for substantial growth not only in June, but for months and years to come.\n\nThe crypto world is buzzing with excitement as the market rides a wave of bullish momentum. While this surge is promising, it also makes choosing the right cryptocurrency to invest in quite challenging, as nearly everything seems to be on the rise.\n\nAmidst this flurry, one cryptocurrency stands out due to its recent developments and long-term potential: Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Here are three compelling reasons why I'm investing heavily in Ethereum this June.\n\n1. SEC approval of a spot Ethereum ETF\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to invest in Ethereum right now is the anticipated approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In January, Bitcoin (BTC 0.04%) was the first cryptocurrency to get this approval, and now there is a growing appetite among investors for exposure to the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nThe integration of Ethereum with traditional finance through an exchange-traded fund is incredibly encouraging for many reasons. First, since ETFs can be purchased from brokerage accounts, a spot Ethereum ETF will democratize access for many traditional investors who are uncomfortable buying cryptocurrencies on crypto exchanges. This ease of access can attract a broader range of buyers and potentially drive significant price appreciation.\n\nYet, the most important cohort that the ETFs will cater to is institutional investors. Without the ETFs, institutional investors have been hesitant to purchase cryptocurrencies directly, due to regulatory and security risks. A spot Ethereum ETF approval will allow previously sidelined institutions known for their deep pockets to join in on the game.\n\n2. The tokenization of real-world assets\n\nAnother reason to be bullish on Ethereum is its potential for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Tokenization involves converting physical and intangible assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, making them easier to transfer, trade, and manage. This can include anything from real estate and art to stocks and bonds.\n\nThe market for tokenized RWAs is expected to grow to $10 trillion by 2030, and for many reasons, Ethereum is positioned to capture the bulk of this value. The network's robust decentralization, strong security, and established ecosystem make it an ideal platform for institutions looking to tokenize assets.\n\nIn fact, we are already seeing the beginnings of this movement. For instance, in May, BlackRock (the world's largest asset manager) launched a tokenized fund on Ethereum, marking a significant step toward the convergence of blockchain technology and traditional financial instruments.\n\nHighlighting the transformative potential of blockchain technology, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently stated that tokenization will be \"the next generation for markets.\" And rest assured, Ethereum will be the blockchain of choice for this revolution.\n\n3. Ethereum's leadership in smart contracts and DeFi\n\nThe beginning stages of tokenization on Ethereum are an example of why it is one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Launched in 2015, Ethereum was one of the first blockchains to introduce smart contracts, making it the first programmable cryptocurrency. This pioneering status has given Ethereum a competitive advantage in terms of experimentation and documentation, two crucial factors developers consider when choosing a blockchain to build on.\n\nOver the years, this experimentation has led to the development of several novel applications of blockchain technology, such as decentralized finance (DeFi). By using Ethereum's smart contracts, DeFi developers can build decentralized applications that allow financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading to occur without traditional intermediaries, enhancing efficiency and accessibility.\n\nTo put it simply, Ethereum is the undisputed leader in the DeFi space, with over 60% of the DeFi economy built on its blockchain. And with DeFi as one of the most prominent and innovative use cases of crypto, as DeFi grows, so should Ethereum.\n\nDeFi is just one (great) example of how Ethereum fosters innovation and experimentation. The recent advancements in tokenizing real-world assets demonstrate Ethereum's capacity to stay at the forefront of blockchain technology. Investing in Ethereum is essentially investing in the future potential of blockchain experimentation and development. As more projects and applications are built on Ethereum, its value proposition will continue to strengthen for decades to come."
