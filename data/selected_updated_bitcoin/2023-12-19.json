        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) halving, expected in April 2024, is leading mining companies to reassess their operations to ensure they are prepared for the drop in rewards. One such way is by acquiring smaller firms to bring economies of scale to their activities. Earlier this month, Marathon said it had more than $800 million of cash and bitcoin to \"capitalize on strategic opportunities, including industry consolidation\" ahead of the halving."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

        "content": "A crypto analyst who accurately called the bottom of the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bear market is flipping bullish on an altcoin running on the Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 232,400 followers on the social media platform X that Chainlink (LINK) is flashing multiple bullish reversal signals on the eight-hour chart.\n\nThe analyst predicts that LINK could rally to a level last seen in January 2022.\n\n\u201cOk LINK swept $13.9 one final time and made the fifth wave down for C and beautiful high time frame bullish divergence as well.\n\nI believe this is a major wave four low now in.\n\n$20 en route, RIP anyone who capitulated.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis method that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset goes through a five-wave rally with each wave having its own sub-waves.\n\nAt time of writing, LINK is trading for $14.57, suggesting an over 37% surge if it hits Bluntz\u2019s target.\n\nLooking at the smart contract platform Solana (SOL), Bluntz thinks that the altcoin is gearing up to break out against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC), indicating that its US dollar pair will likely see steep rallies.\n\n\u201cSOL/BTC trying to break this most recent bull flag after chilling for a few days.\n\nWhen this 37-day range breaks, SOL is going to gigasend.

I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one.

        "title": "Up More Than 150% for the Year, These 3 Cryptos Have the Potential to Outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink are three cryptos that could outpace Bitcoin next year.\n\nWithout a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC 0.91%) has been the standout crypto performer of 2023. Up more than 150% for the year, Bitcoin has completely reenergized the crypto market. With Bitcoin currently trading around $42,000, some investors are even speculating that Bitcoin could soar past the $100,000 mark next year.\n\nBut with all the excitement around Bitcoin, investors might be overlooking cryptocurrencies with the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year. Three potential standouts include Solana (SOL 1.03%), Avalanche (AVAX 2.98%), and Chainlink (LINK 0.50%). Let's take a closer look at why you might want to put these cryptos on your investment radar right now.\n\nSolana and Avalanche\n\nBoth Solana and Avalanche are direct competitors to Ethereum (ETH 1.16%), the second-most valuable cryptocurrency. In crypto terminology, all three are Layer-1 blockchain networks. This simply means that they are the core base layer on which everything else is built in the blockchain world. That includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming, and Web3 apps.\n\nIf you compare the market caps of Solana and Avalanche to that of Ethereum, there's still a huge chasm. Ethereum is 8 times the size of Solana and 18 times the size of Avalanche. From my perspective, this gap should be much smaller.\n\nAnd many other investors seem to agree. Avalanche is up a sizzling 270% this year and Solana is up a blistering 630%. With that kind of performance, they are starting to gain the attention of some high-profile institutional investors. For example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, making the case that Solana is a faster and more cost-effective version of Ethereum. The implication, of course, was that Solana might one day overtake Ethereum.\n\nThe big question is whether the first-mover advantage of Ethereum is simply too insurmountable. Ethereum has seemingly been first to market with nearly every major blockchain innovation of the past five years, and that means Ethereum has a dominant position in just about every niche of the blockchain world. So keep your growth expectations for Solana and Avalanche in check.\n\nChainlink\n\nChainlink is the premier decentralized blockchain oracle in the world right now, and it's not even close. While Chainlink currently has a market cap of $8 billion, its nearest competitors have market caps measured in the hundreds of millions. For the year, Chainlink is up about 160%, and is now the 13th-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nAs a blockchain oracle, Chainlink provides data to smart contracts, which are small pieces of self-executable computer code. These smart contracts form the basis of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is why the data provided by Chainlink is so valuable. When smart contracts can't find the data they need on the blockchain, they turn to Chainlink for \"off-chain\" data.\n\nIf you buy into the concept that data is the oil of the digital economy, then you can see why Chainlink is so valuable. What has me especially excited about Chainlink is the potential for an integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In May, Chainlink outlined some of the potential use cases. And then, at this year's Chainlink conference in October, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt (a strategic advisor to Chainlink) hosted a fireside chat with Chainlink founder Sergey Nazarov discussing the intersection of blockchain and AI.\n\nThe big caveat here, of course, is that Chainlink is not an AI company and it's unclear when (or if) there will ever be a formal integration of Chainlink with ChatGPT. So, as an investor, just be aware that you're not getting direct exposure to the AI market by investing in Chainlink.\n\nJust how risky are these cryptos?\n\nWhile all three of these cryptos have the potential to outperform Bitcoin next year, Bitcoin should probably continue to represent at least one-half of your total crypto portfolio. Given that Bitcoin currently represents one-half of the current value of the $1.6 trillion crypto market, this seems like a reasonable rule of thumb.\n\nMoreover, keep in mind that the crypto market is still a volatile place to invest your money. All three of these cryptos are riskier than Bitcoin, and that means you should handle them with extreme care. That said, if you're willing to take on the extra risk, all three of these cryptos could outpace Bitcoin next year."
