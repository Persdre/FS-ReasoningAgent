        "content": "New data reveals that a deep-pocketed Ethereum (ETH) investor has woken up from a year of dormancy and is selling off its crypto assets as the top altcoin loses momentum.\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the crypto whale has woken up from a 12-month slumber and is selling its stash of ETH over decentralized exchange platforms (DEX).\n\n\u201cA whale that has been dormant for one year is dumping ETH on DEX! So far, 18,865 ETH has been sold for four million DAI through four new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229. And currently has 5,588 ETH ($12.5 million) left.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,214 at time of writing, down about 6% from its 2023 high of $2,359.\n\nLookonchain then brings its attention toward the amount of decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) deposited into Binance, the top crypto exchange platform by volume. According to the data, noncirculating supply wallets deposited 8.3 million LINK, worth $119 million at time of writing, into Binance.\n\n\u201cThe wallets [have] deposited LINK to Binance every three months since Aug 26, 2022.\n\nInterestingly, most of the time, the deposit is at the bottom of the price and the price rises after that.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.08 at time of writing.\n\nConcluding its analysis with Solana-based (SOL) memecoin Bonk (BONK), Lookonchain says that while one savvy trader lost $46,000 on November 1st, on December 15th, the same entity made a staggering $4.4 million from trading the dog-themed meme asset.\n\n\u201cThis trader owns two wallets. In the past year, the trader withdrew 334.5 billion BONK ($218,000) [from crypto exchange] MEXC and bought 32.18 billion BONK ($41,000) from DEX.\n\nAnd deposited 204.2 billion BONK ($80,000) to MEXC, leaving 172.5 billion BONK (worth $132,000 on Nov 1st).

Some Bearish Perspectives: Despite optimism, some, like trader Peter Brandt, are skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, questioning its functionality and future as a listed asset.\n\nCan Ethereum Be the Best Performer Next Year?\n\nThroughout 2023, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 managed to recover most of the losses incurred during the devastating 2022, reaching almost $2,400 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) a few days ago. However, that valuation is still at the foothills of the all-time high of over $4,800 registered in November 2021.\n\nSome analysts believe the recent uptrend could continue next year, with ETH rising to a new peak in the following months. According to FieryTrading, the asset has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the near future:\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions.\u201d\n\nThe analyst predicted that Ether could jump to the coveted level of $5,000 by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou \u2013 Managing Director at JPMorgan \u2013 also gave his two cents, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844) upgrade. He claimed it could help the ecosystem thrive and push ETH\u2019s price toward $8,000 by 2026, while Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is another person who forecasted success for ETH next year. In his view, the asset might correct to approximately $1,900 but remains poised to soar to $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOne Bearish Outlook\n\nIt is worth noting that some prominent figures are not so bullish on Ethereum. One example is the renowned trader Peter Brandt, who maintained that the token is \u201cnot comparable to BTC as a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke against the functionality of Ethereum and its gas prices, forecasting that it could \u201cnot even be a listed asset in 10 years.\u201d"
