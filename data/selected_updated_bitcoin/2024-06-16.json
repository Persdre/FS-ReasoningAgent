We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to data provided by cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum whales have scooped up more than 700,000 ETH tokens (roughly $2.45 billion) over the past three weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this buying spree, Ethereum is struggling to regain its bullish momentum. The flagship altcoin is currently trading at $3,562 on the Bitstamp exchange after reaching an intraday low of $3,360 on June 14.\n\nEarlier this week, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted that Ethereum's bearishness might persist in the near future due to aggressive selling by futures traders.\n\nIt surged in tandem with Bitcoin on Wednesday due to better-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies retraced together with other risk assets after some hawkish comments made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called into question the possibility of several rate cuts this year.\n\nWill Ethereum ETFs be bullish catalyst?\n\nLast month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly approved several 19b-4 forms for Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), triggering a major rally. On May 27, Ethereum came close to reclaiming the $4,000 level due to investor exuberance. However, this excitement quickly dissipated as soon as market participants realized that the SEC was yet to approve S-1 registration forms that would make it possible for these products to start trading.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that the final approval of Ethereum ETFs would take place over the course of this summer during a recent congressional hearing."

        "content": "NOT followed TON\u2019s price direction as demand pushed the volume to $1.37 billion\n\nToken seemed overbought, pointing to a possible fall to $0.016 on the charts\n\nNotcoin [NOT] defied the broader market \u201cred period\u201d as the price climbed by 7.22% in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, this happened at a time when Bitcoin [BTC] slid to $65,103 before slightly recovering above $66,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] also registered a decline to $3,381 around the same time. The performance underscores Notcoin\u2019s next-to-nothing correlation with the top two cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt press time, NOT changed hands at $0.020. On 14 June, however, the token had initially tapped $0.022 on the price charts.\n\nNOT sentiment bullish, goes with TON\n\nHowever, Notcoin is not alone in its rise as fellow Telegram-linked project Toncoin [TON] joined in too. A few weeks ago, AMBCrypto had reported how NOT did not follow the same trend as TON.\n\nOn the back of the latest price hike, it would seem now that the two have aligned.\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, we also found that sentiment around Notcoin has been incredibly bullish. Using the Weighted Sentiment metric, for instance, AMBCrypto observed that the reading was 0.178 on 13 June. However, at press time, the same metric had hit 0.617.\n\nThe notable hike within a short period implies that online comments about NOT were much more positive than those that were bearish about the token.\n\nApart from the price hike and bullish sentiment, Notcoin\u2019s volume surpassed the $1 billion mark. The increase in volume constituted a 131% hike in the last 24 hours.\n\nTrading volume is crucial for a cryptocurrency\u2019s price and direction. It indicates if market participants are interested in a token.\n\nHeavy movement of the volume, alongside a price increase, suggests an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, if the spike comes with a price fall, it implies a hike in selling pressure.\n\nNotcoin\u2019s price may go down later\n\nFor NOT, it was the former. However, it is unlikely that NOT\u2019s volume would hit $4 billion like it did when the price hit an all-time high of $0.029 on 2 June.\n\nEvidence of this was reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is an oscillator that measures speed and changes in price movements.\n\nA value of over 70 indicates that an asset is overbought. When it is less than 30, it means that it is oversold. In Notcoin\u2019s case, the RSI on the daily chart had a reading of 74.27.\n\nSimply put, the token was overbought. Thus, the price might begin a slow reversal down the chart. If this happens, the price of NOT might fall to $0.016 within a few days.\n\nHowever, this prediction would be invalidated if the broader market condition changes. Assuming prices across the board begin to move north, NOT might follow suit.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s NOT\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nShould this be the case, the value of the token might jump to $0.022 once more. Besides that, market participants should be on the lookout for developments or announcements around the project as this could also impact the price."

        "content": "The first half of June was notably bearish for the crypto market as Bitcoin price hit a low of $65000 amid several unfavorable updates. The FUD surrounding macroeconomic development, Bitcoin miners capitulating, the ETFs outflow, and whale distribution combined to fuel the recent correction in the majority of major cryptocurrencies including Ether. The Ethereum price dropped to a three-week low of $3362 on Friday but has now witnessed an ease in selling pressure amis stable the weekend.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Headlines of The Week: Bitcoin & ETH Ride Rollercoaster, XRP & LUNC Make Waves\n\n\n\nadvertisement\n\nSEC\u2019s Potential ETF Approval and Whale Investments Boost Ethereum Price\n\nDuring the recent market downturn, Ethereum formed a new lower high at the $3950 resistance level on the daily chart. The coin buyers failed to surpass the last high indicating an initial shift in market sentiment where traders prefer to sell on bullish bounces.\n\nOn June 14th, the coin\u2019s price peaked at $3,887 before experiencing a significant drop of 13.5%, bringing it down to a low of $3,364. This price level coincides with the 100-day EMA, which has now begun to stabilize the declining Ethereum price, aiding its recovery to $3,509. Concurrently, the market capitalization has increased to $431.2 billion.\n\nThis surge is likely triggered by SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s recent statement to lawmakers, suggesting that the agency could finalize the approvals for listing and trading spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the summer.\n\nMoreover, in a recent tweet, renowned trader Ali (@ali_charts) highlighted a significant trend in the Ethereum market. According to his analysis, Ethereum whales have made substantial investments over the past three weeks, purchasing more than 700,000 ETH, which amounts to approximately $2.45 billion.\n\n#Ethereum whales have bought over 700,000 $ETH in the past three weeks, totaling approximately $2.45 billion! pic.twitter.com/sfmXnkqD49 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2024\n\nThis notable accumulation by large holders despite the ongoing correction indicates strong confidence for the Ethereum price to rebound.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Permanent Holders Scoop 298K ETH In A Day, ETH Price Rally Soon?\n\nIf the broader market correction persists, the ETH price may dive to $3200 and seek support from the long-coming support trendline. As per the past record, the Ethereum coin rebound thrice from dynamic support indicates a high accumulation for investors.\n\nThat said, the daily chart indicates a new resistance trendline forming above, suggesting that Ethereum might enter a sideways trading pattern. A breakout above this barrier is needed for buyers to regain control, and bolster a rally to $3900.\n\n\n\nTechnical Indicator:\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The 100-and-200-day EMAs as dynamic support preventing ETH price from a major correction\n\nMACD: A bearish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal (orange) indicates a seller as the key driving force behind the current price movement.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDon\u2019t expect crypto ETF momentum to slow after the approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds in the United States: Wall Street's \u201cgreed\u201d will bring more and more such products, Tether and WAX co-founder William Quigley told Decrypt this week.\n\nQuigley predicted a proliferation of ETFs for other leading cryptocurrencies like Solana and Cardano, driven by Wall Street's relentless pursuit of profit.\n\n\u201cWall Street is greedy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time Wall Street packages a new product to sell to consumers, if that product is successful, you can guarantee there will be copycats. There would be no ETFs if the Bitcoin ETF had failed.\u201d\n\nHe added that Wall Street loves the \u201cnext hot new thing\u201d because it\u2019s something it can talk to its consumers about and sell their products. But should the momentum eventually cool, Quigley expects that ETF providers will shift focus to the next big trend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe will continue to see new ETFs launching until there's a big pullback,\u201d he added. \u201cThen, you\u2019ll see some of those ETFs shut down by the firms who launched them due to lack of demand.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January marked a significant milestone in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, thus providing a more accessible and regulated investment vehicle.\n\nThis approval sparked significant interest and investment inflows, highlighting the growing acceptance and institutional interest in digital assets.\n\nThe success of the Bitcoin ETF has paved the way for further crypto-related financial products, and the market has been keenly awaiting similar developments for other such products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe anticipation for Ethereum ETFs has been particularly high, especially following the positive signals from regulatory authorities. The funds received initial approval in late May, but will not start trading until funds\u2019 S-1 registration forms are approved.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday indicated that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs might be completed by the end of the summer.\n\n\u201cIndividual issuers are still working through the registration process that's working smoothly, and I envision sometime over the course of the summer,\u201d Gensler said during a Senate hearing Thursday.\n\nTradFi butts in\n\nDespite the added mainstream attention coming with ETFs, Quigley expressed dissatisfaction with the increasing involvement of traditional finance in the crypto space.\n\n\"I was happy with crypto without Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be smaller? Of course. But I didn't feel the need to keep growing the size of crypto now.\u201d\n\nHe warned that Wall Street's aggressive marketing of crypto products could lead to significant risks, especially if institutional investors pull out during market downturns.\n\nDespite his reservations about Wall Street's involvement, Quigley acknowledged that a significant capital influx is essential for substantial market growth.\n\n\"If you want a massive amount of capital, then yes, you have to do things like ETFs,\" he conceded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile ETF hype was partially credited with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high price above $73,700 in March, alongside anticipation for April\u2019s quadrennial halving event, BTC has yet to seriously challenge that mark again in the months since\u2014and is down this week at a current price of just under $67,000.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s price typically climbs six months or more after the halving, which constrains the expanding supply, as the impacts of that event start to be felt. Quigley believes that historical patterns will continue along that path as well.\n\n\"It can't go higher because it's not the right time,\" he said, predicting a significant price increase ahead.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Millionaire Maker? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum still has upside potential. But does it have enough to make you a millionaire?\n\nThere's no denying that Ethereum (ETH -4.16%) has been one of the best crypto investments of the past decade. At its current price of $3,500, Ethereum is up more than 10,000-fold from its initial price of just $0.31. As a result, an investment of just $100 in 2015 would have likely been enough to make you a crypto millionaire today.\n\nBut we're moving into Ethereum's second decade now, and it's no longer a slam-dunk certainty that you can become a crypto millionaire by investing at today's prices. If you are thinking about investing in it for that purpose, here are three important questions to ask yourself.\n\n1. Does Ethereum still have 1,000x upside?\n\nLet's assume for a moment that you have $1,000 to invest in Ethereum right now. For that initial investment to grow to $1 million, it would need to increase in value 1,000-fold. A decade ago, that was certainly possible. But what about today?\n\nRemember: In 2015, Ethereum had the all-important first-mover advantage. It was literally the first smart-contract blockchain platform, and that opened up all kinds of new opportunities that even Bitcoin (BTC -2.10%) couldn't match.\n\nSo Ethereum went on to create, define, and control entire sectors of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to blockchain gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it was not just the first to market. It was also best to market.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum no longer has the first-mover advantage. There are plenty of new challengers, and plenty of blockchains that can offer exactly what it can offer, if not more. So it only makes sense that the explosive growth that characterized the early years of Ethereum might no longer be possible. That's bad news if you're expecting 1,000x upside.\n\n2. How long can Ethereum remain the market leader?\n\nThere are now three direct Ethereum challengers -- Solana (SOL -4.76%), Avalanche (AVAX -6.54%), and Cardano (ADA -4.85%) -- that rank among the top 15 cryptocurrencies in market cap.\n\nThe appearance of these new challengers means that Ethereum's dominant market share in the various niches is slowly being eroded. So even if it is able to create entirely new blockchain niches (as it has for the past decade), the share of the market it will capture will likely continue to shrink over time.\n\nOf even more concern, some of these blockchain rivals are being viewed by investors as potential \"Ethereum killers.\" This poses a clear existential threat.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing blockchains, users and developers have a choice. And if the new Ethereum rivals continue to claim much higher speeds, enhanced throughput capacity, and lower fees, which blockchains do you think users are going to choose?\n\n3. What will be the effect of the new ETFs?\n\nLastly, there's the question of just how much of a lift the new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are going to provide. Just about everyone agrees that there was much more demand and hype for the new spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more than $30 billion in customer funds. However, JPMorgan Chase thinks that the new spot Ethereum ETFs will pull in only $3 billion.\n\nAs a result, the spot Ethereum ETFs are likely to be much less impactful than many people think. If you're expecting the price of the crypto to soar as soon as these new ETFs start trading, you might be disappointed.\n\nSetting realistic expectations\n\nThis might be tough to acknowledge, but Ethereum might only have 10x upside over the foreseeable future. And even that could be too optimistic. Given its current market cap of just over $400 billion, a 10-fold increase in value would imply a new market cap of $4 trillion. That's significantly more than Nvidia, which now has a lofty $3 trillion market value.\n\nA $4 trillion valuation might have been possible back when Ethereum had a clear economic moat to keep away potential challengers. But the barbarians are now at the gate, and some of them are crossing the drawbridge.\n\nFor that reason, I'm unconvinced that Ethereum is still a millionaire maker. Unfortunately, if you are really serious about becoming a millionaire, you might need to find \"the next Ethereum\" -- an undiscovered crypto with 1,000x upside that you can buy for mere pennies. And that, as we all know, is a lot harder to do than it sounds."
