        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months as investors move their capital within the crypto markets to generate more gains.\n\nPal tells the 21,300 subscribers of his YouTube channel that Ethereum will \u201cmassively outperform\u201d Bitcoin just like how lower-rated junk bonds tend to surpass the higher-rated treasuries when investors rotate their capital.\n\nAccording to Pal, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will positively impact Ethereum as he expects market participants to reinvest their BTC gains in ETH.\n\n\u201cSo ETH is just doing what it\u2019s supposed to be doing. But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF. And it\u2019ll bring the ETH ecosystem alive.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s been a story of Solana which I\u2019ve been long all year, and Bitcoin. That barbell has been the best trade in the world. Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021. [In] 2019, [Bitcoin] came out of the gates really, really fast then corrected, then we had Covid-19, which we\u2019re not going to repeat.\n\nI know many people are expecting \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to get a 50% collapse and you buy that one.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll get corrections. I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto Price Prediction For December 26th: ETH, HNT, ROSE - CoinGape",
        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: On Tuesday, the crypto market witnessed a sudden selling pressure prolonging a correction trend in several altcoins. Despite this pullback, the overall market dynamic remains in buyers\u2019 favor, providing a new entry opportunity in coins like Ethereum(ETH), Oasis network(ROSE), and Helium(HNT).\n\nCurrently, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $1.66 trillion, marking a slight decline of 0.31% since yesterday. In contrast, the total trading volume in the crypto sphere has witnessed a substantial increase of 23.61% in the last 24 hours, totaling $74.32 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Analysts Predict BTC Rally To Continue As Bitcoin Funding Rates Reset\n\nEthereum(ETH) Price Takes A Strategic Pause Before Next Leap\n\nIn December, the Ethereum(ETH) coin predominantly fluctuated within a defined range, oscillating between $2400 and $2133. While this lateral movement in the daily chart signifies market indecision, it came after an 8-week rally indicating the buyers are taking a breather.\n\nThis pause in momentum, hovering above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, suggests a healthy market correction, potentially setting the stage for a renewed upward trajectory. Notably, Intotheblock, a prominent on-chain data provider, highlighted that Ethereum\u2019s long-term holder base expanded significantly, exceeding 70% in December.\n\nThis shift underscores a strengthening investor confidence and long-term commitment to Ethereum. Currently, the ETH price is trading at $2141, experiencing a minor intraday setback of 1.34%.\n\nThe Ethereum price is primed for a potential breakout above the $2400 resistance, which could pave the way for reaching higher targets at $2675 and $2957.\n\nHelium(HNT) Price Offers Pullback Opportunity\n\nHelium (HNT) coin demonstrated remarkable performance in the first three weeks of December, surging 236% from a monthly low of $2.7 to a high of $9.65. Despite the overall market uncertainty, HNT experienced a 23.57% retracement, now trading around $7.31.\n\nAccording to Fibonacci retracement analysis, if the Helium price sustains above either the 38.2% or 50% levels, which correspond to $6.55 and $5.5 respectively, it maintains its bullish stance. A rebound from these levels would suggest a replenishment of bullish momentum, potentially leading to the HNT price surpassing the $10 mark.\n\nMoreover, the midline of the Bollinger Bands provides additional support, reinforcing the likelihood of a recovery\n\nOasis Network(ROSE) Price Gives Key Resistance Breakout to Chase $0.167\n\nIn line with general bullish sentiment and the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, the ROSE token price has shown an aggressive rally initiated from the 4th week of October. In the last 10 weeks, the coin price has surged from $0.0396 to the current trading price of $0.14, registering a remarkable 264% growth.\n\nIn light of an increasing volume, the ROSE price has breached some crucial resistance like $0.085, $0.116, and most recently $0.137. If the Coin buyers managed to close today\u2019s daily candle above this breached resistance, the buyers would obtain another stepping stone for higher levels.\n\nThe post-breakout rally will surge the price another 15% to hit the next resistance level at $0.167.\n\nThe Momentum Indicator RSI at 80% reflects a strong bullish momentum and a slight hint of overbought assets.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "The best crypto books of 2023 - Fortune",
        "content": "In 2015, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper published Digital Gold, an early account of Bitcoin that holds up as one of the best books on crypto. Since then, there have been a flood of other titles as publishers rushed to cash in on a subject defined by easy riches, outrageous characters, and a mind-boggling array of scams.\n\nThis past year brought a new glut of books. Unlike the ones published during crypto boom years, which pulse with a mix of greed and adulation, most of the 2023 titles came wrapped in a thick sheen of scorn\u2014and understandably so given the spectacular frauds, epitomized by Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX, that defined the industry\u2019s most recent bust.\n\nHere are Fortune Crypto\u2019s picks for the three best crypto titles of the year: two of them monuments to crimes, and one a reminder that the broader blockchain industry is not only alive and well but becoming part of the mainstream financial system.\n\nGoing Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon\n\nBy Michael Lewis\n\nStar business writer Michael Lewis\u2014whose bestsellers include Moneyball and The Big Short\u2014enjoyed an unprecedented level of access to boy king Sam Bankman-Fried right up until his $32 billion empire unraveled in the space of a week.\n\nThe published version of Going Infinite is not what Lewis had intended to write, and, indeed, the first version of his manuscript cast Bankman-Fried as a sympathetic figure poised to change the world through the nebulous philosophy of effective altruism. The final text reflects how Lewis had to adapt his story upon learning that the young mogul\u2019s tale was all a web of lies.\n\nThis abrupt pivot results in the last chapters of the book becoming an intellectual scramble as the author can\u2019t quite forsake his onetime protagonist. But that doesn\u2019t matter much given the incredible amount of mind-blowing detail Lewis is able to reveal about Bankman-Fried, his family, and the bizarre, hypocritical lifestyle he forged while walking the highest corridors of power in Washington, D.C., and raising money from everyone from Tom Brady to Sequoia Capital. Going Infinite will join Digital Gold as one of the all-time best crypto books.\n\nNumber Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall\n\nBy Zeke Faux\n\nAs the title suggests, there is nothing subtle about this book. Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux takes the reader on an up-close tour of the very worst people in crypto\u2014from the grifter/rapper wannabe Razzlekhan to the Bond-like villains slinging billions of dollars of digital assets in murky cross-border business dealings.\n\nNumber Go Up is often uproariously funny, most notably when Faux risks his kids\u2019 college savings to temporarily purchase a Bored Ape NFT in order to attend a cringe-inducing party of crypto geeks. But the book is also a sober look at the darker side of crypto. In particular, Faux shows how the unregulated stablecoin Tether has helped to power a sinister industry called pig-butchering that relies on slave labor to text lonely people and dupe them into sending money to offshore criminal gangs. While the people behind Tether are unquestionably shady, Faux\u2019s drive to expose them sometimes takes on a monomaniacal quality, and his campaign to show the entirety of crypto is a scam feels more like advocacy than reporting. Still, this is a relatively minor quibble with an otherwise excellent book.\n\nEthereum for Business: A Plain-English Guide\n\nBy Paul Brody\n\nEven as scams and scandals dominated news coverage of crypto for most of 2023, the industry continued to plod forward and\u2014to the likely disappointment of its many haters\u2014even flourish. This book by Paul Brody, Ernst & Young\u2019s global blockchain leader, explains why that\u2019s the case.\n\nEthereum for Business shows how a growing number of real-world enterprises\u2014from banks to shipping agencies\u2014are using the power of distributed-ledger technology to improve security and efficiency in everything from payments to supply chains.\n\nThe book is not a narrative yarn like the others on this list, but is instead a practical overview of an emerging field in crypto and business, focusing on Ethereum\u2014the second-most-valuable blockchain and one that popularized the use of autonomous smart contracts. It will be helpful reading for anyone interested in how technology is changing business and benefits from Brody\u2019s clear, straightforward writing style."
