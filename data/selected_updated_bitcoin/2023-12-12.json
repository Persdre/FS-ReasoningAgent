The layer-2 network is powered by the Optimism (OP) development stack and is compatible with Ethereum, Ethereum layer-2s and alternative EVM chains.\n\nAccording to Seamless, SEAM is the protocol\u2019s new governance token.\n\n\u201cSeamlessFi is excited to introduce SEAM, the governance token of Seamless, which is Base\u2019s largest native lending protocol!\u201d\n\nCoinbase is listing SEAM as the new governance token is being airdropped.\n\nAt time of writing, SEAM is less than 24 hours old, making it relatively volatile, which is why Coinbase is listing the asset under its Experimental Label.\n\nSEAM is currently worth $13.11, down 5.8% from its all-time high of $14.35, reached mere hours ago.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
