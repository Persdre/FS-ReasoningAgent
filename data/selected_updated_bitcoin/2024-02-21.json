        "title": "Spot Ether ETFs Could Introduce New Concentration Risk in Ethereum: S&P Global - Unchained",
        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ethereum. Analysts see four drivers behind an even bigger surge - DLNews",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.
