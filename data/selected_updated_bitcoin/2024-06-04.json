        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum spot ETFs will perform much like their Bitcoin-based predecessors, hauling $4 billion of inflows within five months after launch, according to K33 Research.\n\n\u201cThis estimate is based on the relative global ETH assets under management (AUM) market share compared to BTC of 28%,\u201d wrote the crypto brokerage firm in a Tuesday report. Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)\u2019s ETH open interest is currently 23% of Bitcoin, reflecting a similar market share in another institutionally focused market.\n\nAs of June 3, US Bitcoin ETFs had absorbed $13.9 billion since their January launch. Across the world, Bitcoin ETFs now control over 1 million BTC, comprising over 5% of the circulating BTC supply.\n\nBy contrast, institutional funds currently control 3.3% of the circulating ETH supply. Using this as a benchmark, K33 said it expects anywhere from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion worth of ETH ETF flows after launch. This comprises between 750,000 and 1 million ETH, or 0.65 to 0.85% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a big promise when compared to the Ethereum futures ETF debut last year, which hauled peanuts in AUM next to the launch of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. K33 believes this lackluster launch was an outlier given the poor timing with which Ethereum ETFs hit the market, and is not representative of ETH\u2019s true investment demand.\n\nFor example, the firm notes, ETH CME futures\u2014currently sitting at 22.9% of Bitcoin\u2019s size\u2014have averaged a 35% share of the market since inception. Furthermore, Between September 29 and December 26, ETH futures ETFs experienced 34.6% of the inflows of their Bitcoin-based equivalents.\n\n\u201cIn Canada and Europe, ETH ETPs hold roughly 1/3 of the AUM held by BTC ETPs,\u201d wrote K33. \u201cU.S. futures-based ETH ETFs are pulling the global ETH dominance lower.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has previously predicted that the Ethereum ETFs will haul between 10% and 20% of what the Bitcoin spot ETFs did. \u201cGrabbing 20% of what they got would be a huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n10 may be a bit much.. but I'd at least divide by 5 when it comes to expectations around the Ether spot ETFs re flows/volume/media/everything relative to spot bitcoin ETFs. That said, grabbing 20% of what they got would be huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards. https://t.co/QDenr3jY2B \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 29, 2024\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."
