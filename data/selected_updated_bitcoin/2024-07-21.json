According to Kaleo, the ETF launch will turn out to be a sell-the-news event.\n\nBut after the pullback, the trader predicts that ETH will soar above $4,550.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really bullish on this cycle, one more sweep of the lows would be an absolute gift. We\u2019re heading way higher from here \u2013 just think we might need a bit more patience before the fun really starts.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,521, a slight increase on the day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Prediction: Ethereum Will Hit $5,000 by 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are two key catalysts that could propel Ethereum to a new all-time high next year.\n\nUp more than 50% through the first half of 2024, Ethereum (ETH -7.12%) now appears to be on track to regain its all-time high of $4,891 from the previous crypto bull market rally. Given Ethereum's current price of $3,400, that would imply a rally of more than 40% within a relatively short period of time.\n\nThat's certainly possible, given how well Ethereum has performed over the first half of the year. But a lot still needs to go right. Here's a closer look at two key factors that could propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\n1. Continued growth of Ethereum's blockchain ecosystem\n\nFirst and most importantly, Ethereum needs to see continued growth in core segments of its sprawling blockchain ecosystem. One of the most important of these segments is known as decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to traditional financial products and services reinvented with the help of blockchain technology. As such, DeFi offers the potential for faster, cheaper, and better solutions than those currently offered by traditional Wall Street providers.\n\nIn order to come up with a reasonable future price forecast for Ethereum, it is important first to come up with a ballpark figure for how much market value Ethereum can realistically create over the next few years. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has crunched the numbers and determined that blockchain networks such as Ethereum could potentially generate $5 trillion in new market value by 2030.\n\nThat may sound like a huge, pie-in-the-sky number, but not when you take into account emerging trends such as asset tokenization, which refers to the process of transforming traditional financial instruments into digital assets that live on the blockchain. The faster that the process of asset tokenization takes place, the more valuable Ethereum becomes. According to consulting firm McKinsey, asset tokenization could be a $2 trillion market opportunity by 2030, and Ethereum stands to be a key beneficiary.\n\n2. Mainstream investor acceptance of Ethereum ETFs\n\nEven if you don't buy into the idea of blockchain-powered financial products transforming the modern financial system, there is one other path to Ethereum soaring to the $5,000 mark: the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs, which are scheduled to begin trading this summer. In a bullish scenario, as much as $4.8 billion in new investor money could flow into these new ETFs, helping to boost the price of Ethereum.\n\nTo get a sense of how much of a boost these ETFs may provide, consider the example of the spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.33%) ETFs, which began trading in January. Over the ensuing six months, the price of Bitcoin soared from approximately $45,000 to $70,000, for a gain of nearly 55%. For the sake of argument, let's assume that the new Ethereum ETFs are not as successful as the Bitcoin ETFs, and the gains are not as significant. But even a rally of 40% would still be enough to propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a $2 trillion asset?\n\nIn fact, a price forecast of $5,000 may turn out to be conservative. For example, investment firm VanEck came up with a base-case price forecast of $22,000 for Ethereum for the year 2030. This assumes that Ethereum can continue to make inroads in areas such as DeFi and Web3, and that key blockchain metrics continue to see improvement over the next five years. At a price of $22,000 per coin, Ethereum would have an implied valuation of more than $2 trillion, making it more valuable than all but a handful of companies in the world.\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, keep in mind that crypto can be incredibly volatile and unpredictable. There's always the chance that Ethereum will no longer continue to see rapid gains after a remarkable first decade of growth. Tech issues could prevent it from scaling past a certain point, and the arrival of new competitors could blindside it.\n\nThat being said, if you think that we're on the cusp of a major bull market rally, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar as a cryptocurrency capable of soaring in value over the next several years."
