In October, 20 Ethereum validators controlled by Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol with over $18.5 billion of deposits, were slashed, resulting in a $30,000 hit.

But the stringent security comes with a downside \u2014 it\u2019s easy for honest stakers to be slashed if they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with this tension where the fundamental security mechanism of Ethereum is actually the fundamental insecurity mechanism for validator node operators,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSolving slashing\n\nCubist\u2019s solution to accidental slashing is to create a layer of abstraction that validators must go through to sign off on the data they send to the Ethereum network.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum are very similar to databases where the current state must follow on from the previous state. If a validator tries to publish an incorrect state it gets slashed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a database. The problem is databases are actually kind of hard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a whole bunch of validators, you have to have a global scalable database for every validator key. That\u2019s something you can get wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Cubist proposes is that all validator clients must send messages to another piece of software \u2014 which Brown refers to as a \u201csky key\u201d \u2014 that is better equipped to make sure the validator\u2019s messages contain the correct data.\n\nAccording to Brown, as long as the sky key has serious slashing protection, the validators that rely on it will also be safe.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get all the hard database stuff right once and then all requests just go through that key,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTo make sure multiple validators aren\u2019t relying on the same abstracted key, Cubist deploys a separate instance for each validator. \u201cIf you have 100 validators there are 100 keys in the sky. One for each,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBeyond Ethereum staking\n\nWhile Cubist\u2019s slashing solution is most relevant to Ethereum, the most popular proof of stake blockchain, it is also relevant to other areas of staking.\n\nOne area which has previously drawn concern from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is restaking \u2014 an upcoming blockchain feature that will allow users to double-stake their Ether on other protocols and blockchains.\n\nCubist has signed partnerships with both EigenLayer and Babylon \u2014 two restaking protocols \u2014 specifically to focus on protecting their ecosystems from slashing.\n\nAccording to Stefan, protocols like these all have unique slashing conditions, which presents an additional layer of complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important to have anti-slashers in place on these risk taking protocols,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while Stefan and Brown say they are confident in Cubist\u2019s anti-slashing standards, they are also mindful of the risk of having all stakers rely on only their specific implementations.\n\n\u201cThe standards are not saying, \u2018You must use this setup, you must use this hardware,\u2019\u201d Stefan said.
