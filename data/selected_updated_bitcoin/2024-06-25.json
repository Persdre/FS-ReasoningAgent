        "title": "Ethereum ETF update: Speaking at Bloomberg Invest, CFTC chair Gary Gensler says application is \u2018going smoothly\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler betrayed impatience upon fielding questions from reporters about crypto, including his agency\u2019s handling of applications to launch Ethereum ETFs. In speaking with journalist Annmarie Hordern at the Bloomberg Invest event in New York on Tuesday, Gensler accused his interviewer of going after \u201cclicks\u201d after she asked him several questions related to crypto policy.\n\nThe issue of cryptocurrency ETFs has been contentious during Gensler\u2019s SEC tenure, most notably when a federal appeals court last year rejected the agency\u2019s decision to refuse applications for a Bitcoin ETF. The court ruling led the SEC to approve those Bitcoin applications in January and, despite initial signals from Gensler that the Ethereum petitions would be rebuffed, the agency more recently indicated it would grant them.\n\nThe agency\u2019s apparent change of heart has led to ongoing speculation about how long the process will take. Despite his grumblings, Gensler\u2014a noted crypto opponent\u2014offered a few details.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the timing, but it\u2019s going smoothly.\u201d He elaborated that his team is waiting for asset managers to make \u201cproper disclosures.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s comments came after SEC filings from this spring suggested that the agency may have adopted the position that Ethereum was a security for more than a year.\n\nGensler also made a point to clarify that an ETF trading Ethereum futures has already been approved. Last October, the SEC approved futures ETF applications for Valkyrie Investments, VanEck Funds, Proshares, Bitwise Asset Management, and five others. The pending spot ETF applications would give investors direct exposure to the asset via regulated exchanges.\n\nOnce heralded as a supporter of crypto by many who saw his tenure teaching a course on the subject at MIT as an endorsement, Gensler has come down hard on the industry over the past few years. Last year alone, the regulator brought 46 enforcements against crypto-related firms, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nGensler juxtaposed the 11 Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved this year, which are currently trading on regulated markets, with what he called the \u201cnon-compliant model,\u201d or exchanges that also knowingly trade non-compliant securities. \u201cIt\u2019s about real protections for investors and for other people that want to access the capital markets,\u201d said Gensler. It\u2019s about trust in those markets.\u201d\n\nGensler declined to answer a question about reports that his stance on crypto might cost Joe Biden, who appointed him, the election. \u201cMy number one priority is the American public,\u201d said Gensler. \u201cThat\u2019s the client, and so that\u2019s who we represent.\u201d"

        "title": "Cega Shark Bull vaults on Ethereum and Arbitrum combine stability with high returns - Blockworks",
        "content": "The promise of guaranteed high yields with downside protection is often a red flag when navigating a sea of DeFi app marketing speak.\n\nYields are often exaggerated while risks get buried. It\u2019s easy to promote sky-high APRs when you print your own token to fund temporary incentives.\n\nIn the offchain financial world, however, there is such a wild beast emerging from the depths: Shark Fin notes.\n\nDeFi app Cega Finance, a leader in exotic options and structured financial products, launched an onchain version on Ethereum and Arbitrum today.\n\nA Shark Fin is a type of structured financial product that offers a unique risk-reward profile. These notes provide investors with enhanced returns if the price of the underlying asset stays within a predetermined range. The name derives from the shape of the payoff diagram, which resembles a shark\u2019s fin.\n\nSource: Cega.fi\n\nThe potential returns sharply increase to a peak if the asset\u2019s price remains within the range, and then level off or decline if the price moves beyond the specified threshold. This structure allows investors to benefit from stable market conditions while protecting against significant downside risk.\n\nCega\u2019s launch provides conservative investors an onchain version with crypto as the underlying assets.\n\nExpansion from Solana to Ethereum\n\nCega debuted its first four vaults on Solana almost exactly two years ago, but branched out to Ethereum in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRead more: Solana options protocol Cega comes to Ethereum\n\nThe decision to launch on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was always part of Cega\u2019s roadmap, but the collapse of FTX in November 2022 prompted Cega to expedite its plans, according to co-founder Winston Zhang.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we couldn\u2019t wait, and we wanted to continue growing,\u201d Zhang told Blockworks.\n\nInitially, the team considered expanding crosschain via LayerZero or Wormhole, but ultimately decided to hire a new team of Solidity developers to rebuild on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhile that was a little bit slower, it provides the best affordance for safety and security because we\u2019re able to control the smart contracts design ourselves and not rely on a third party,\u201d Zhang explained.\n\nThis transition, which took three to six months, was particularly a response to demand from large-scale investors like DAOs, funds and high-net-worth individuals who prefer the stability of Ethereum.\n\nThe decision to add Arbitrum was driven by its strong DeFi community and significant TVL, making it an ideal target audience for Cega\u2019s products. Arbitrum\u2019s growth, fueled by platforms like GMX, aligns well with Cega\u2019s offerings, which appeals to trading aficionados and derivatives enthusiasts.\n\nIt\u2019s not a migration \u2014 Cega maintains a presence on Solana with thousands of users, and the product will continue to be developed there.\n\n\u201cWe are having conversations about what it means to reprioritize the Solana ecosystem and how to think about product parity for some of the new products that we\u2019ve launched on Arbitrum and [Ethereum] mainnet,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nMaking complex products accessible\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Cega faces is how to simplify complex financial products for their non-professional users. They made a conscious effort to create intuitive visualizations and straightforward documentation to avoid overwhelming users with technical jargon.\n\nTypically reserved for accredited investors in traditional finance, the goal is to make this class of investment tools accessible to everyone, regardless of investment size.\n\n\u201cThe products that we\u2019re building are ultimately derivatives products, but they add a number of benefits for the end user that they can\u2019t get from existing [perpetual futures] platforms or vanilla options platforms,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nThe new \u201cShark Bull\u201d vaults target users who might typically have capital on lending platforms like Aave, and want to increase their stablecoin yield without taking directional risk to crypto markets.\n\nThese vaults offer 100% principal protection with a guaranteed yield of 12.7%, and the potential for up to 30% returns under certain circumstances by combining lending and options strategies.\n\nStablecoins\u2019 lending yield forms the baseline return, while a portion of the yield is used to purchase out-of-the-money (OTM) call options on crypto assets \u2014 the \u201cbull\u201d component, driving the high bonus payouts if prices rise.\n\nThe lending counterparties in this case are not smart contracts but major crypto market makers, so this introduces some credit risk. Cega facilitates these loans but is not a custodian, and manages the risk through stringent legal agreements and ongoing credit monitoring provided by Credora.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin lenders have a new regulation-friendly option for yield\n\nCega, based in Singapore, emphasizes compliance with global regulations. These days, that requires geofencing the US-based customers.\n\nDecentralization plans\n\nThe company raised a total of $9.3 million from notable investors including Dragonfly and Pantera, and does not yet have a token.\n\nZhang said his team deliberately avoided participating in the points incentivization game popular over the past year, preferring to focus on providing real sustainable yield.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually really proud of that,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nEven without incentives, the platform has about $16.6 million in TVL currently, and about $404 million in cumulative trading volume.\n\nLooking ahead, Cega does plan to launch a token while maintaining its core values of responsibility and prudence, Zhang said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many protocols in crypto and in DeFi that just aren\u2019t built on real foundations,\u201d he said, citing the project\u2019s published values.\n\n\u201cThere just have been way too many examples in the ecosystem of carelessness, and lack of responsibility, and that is not us.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
