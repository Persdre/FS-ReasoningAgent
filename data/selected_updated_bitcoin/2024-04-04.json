        "content": "BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes is predicting one new decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoin project will take off on a massive rally once the broader crypto market resumes an uptrend.\n\nHayes is predicting that Ethena (ENA), a governance token launched by Ethena Labs for the project\u2019s DeFi protocol, could soar more than 817% from the current value.\n\nHayes is one of the investors in the project along with investment giant Franklin Templeton, digital asset manager Galaxy Digital and Binance Labs.\n\n\u201cCongrats Ethena Labs on a successful TGE (Token Generation Event). If this is what ENA is worth [when] the market is puking, imagine how high it will go once we resume up only! ENA = $10. It\u2019s just math yo.\u201d\n\nENA is trading for $1.09 at time of writing, up more than 25% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Ethena Labs project also includes the yield-earning \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d token USDe. The project aims to create a stable and scalable form of money in the crypto space without relying on traditional banking systems.\n\nA number of crypto exchanges have listed the token for trading, including the world\u2019s top exchange Binance. Ahead of the listing, ENA became Binance\u2019s 50th project added to its Launchpool platform, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast: Can ETH Still Hit $4,000 Pre-Bitcoin Halving? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto market is gradually flipping bullish after a dismal start on Monday characterized by drastic losses after major altcoins tumbled. ETH, the token powering the most prominent smart contracts ecosystem, dropped to test $3,200 support, contributing to the generally bearish crypto market. Considering the current Ethereum price forecast, as it dodders at $33,379, the path of least resistance is gradually flipping upwards, aiming for highs above $4,000.\n\nBulls Wake Up In Tandem With The Soaring DeFi TVL\n\nThe volatility experienced by Ethereum has not significantly affected the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector within the ecosystem. A minor dip from the yearly high of approximately $58 billion eased to $47 billion, hinting at positive sentiment in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to data graphically highlighted by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) in the sector has recovered to slightly above $50 billion, underscoring growing interest in the long-term fundamental outlook.\n\nOften investors prefer to participate in securing the network while in the process earning more coins instead of selling at the earliest sign of profit. Should the value of ETH locked in smart contracts continue to surge, it would be prudent to look forward to further price increases this week and this month in general.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Assessing Mid-Week Bullish Comeback\n\nEthereum price is slowly making its way to the $3,500 barrier, but first, it must confirm the validity of the support provided by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $3,364.\n\nBacking the ongoing bullish push is a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. Buying pressure is bound to surge behind the token as the MACD rises into the positive region. The forming green histograms also validate the bullish thesis.\n\nConservative traders are likely to wait until Ethereum price tops the yellow band and the descending trendline resistance \u2013 marking the second confirmation of the uptrend.\n\nWith Bitcoin halving on the immediate horizon, interest in major altcoins could start to increase exponentially. Although the event is pertinent to BTC, the bullish sentiment associated with it tends to prop the entire crypto market to rally, with some tokens hitting new all-time highs.\n\nHowever, the IOMAP by IntoTheBlock realistically places a realistic resistance at $3,435 where 1.85 million addresses purchased 4.17 million ETH. Before rising above this level, some holders may choose to offload at their respective break-even points, thus creating selling pressure.\n\nOn the bright side, breaking above this hurdle could drastically change the technical outlook propping Ethereum for a bigger breakout ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nDeclines could intensify if Ethereum price respects the seller congestion at $3,450, and possibly trigger a sell-off back to $3,200 and $3,000. If investors sell around the halving, it would be too early to rule out losses as far as $2,930.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.
