ENS, much like DNS, is a public good and a core part of the internet infrastructure.\n\nBy pairing up ENS names and GoDaddy domains, we will streamline the way users interact with web domains, blending the familiarity of the DNS with the potential of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nENS is worth $19.78 at time of writing, up 9.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could fall 5% to the support confluence between 100-day SMA and horizontal line at $40,650 as boring chop continues.\n\nEthereum price could revisit $2,200, a 4% correction, as the 50-day SMA proves impenetrable.\n\nA retest of the October lows around $0.4734 seems likely for Ripple price as XRP token holders show weakness.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to record a boring chop, trading horizontally, with altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) mimicking the price action. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price continues to suffer in the hands of unmotivated traders.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: Crypto markets to turn volatile as AI steals the spotlight\n\nBitcoin price likely to fall 5%\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading within a range, consolidating between the centerline and the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $41,895 and $44,210, respectively. With the two Bollinger bands contracting, BTC could record an impulsive or rash move soon.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is closely bearish, teasing with a cross below the signal line (yellow band). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also appears subdued with miniature volumes on the histogram bars. This is also reflected in the Awesome Oscillator (AO), tilting the odds in favor of the bears.\n\nIf the bears have their way, Bitcoin price could descend 5% to find support due to the confluence between the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the horizontal line at $40,650. If this level fails to hold as support, BTC could extend the fall into the demand zone between $38,496 and $39,582. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $39,196 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, potentially going as low as the $37,800 support.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if bulls have their way, Bitcoin price could shatter past the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $44,210. This could see BTC climb to $48,000, or in a highly bullish case, tag $50,000, nearly 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price gains strength as GBTC outflows shrink\n\nEthereum price could drop to $2,200\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action is almost similar to that of BTC. It could fall 4% to $2,200 as overhead pressure due to the 50-day SMA continues to build. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token\u2019s price has made multiple attempts to breach this supplier congestion level to no avail.\n\nWith the RSI below 50, the AO and MACD in negative territory, and below the latter\u2019s signal line (orange band), the odds favor the downside. Ethereum price could slip past $2,200 to test the 100-day SMA at $2,203. In a dire case, the fall could see ETH dip into the demand zone between $2,059 and $2,118.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure could see Ethereum price overcome the 50-day SMA to confront the $2,388 barrier. Flipping this into support could restore Ether into the ascending parallel channel, a gateway to more gains.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum monthly transaction count climbs to highest level since July 2022\n\nRipple price looks for pullback as XRP holders show weakness\n\nRipple (XRP) looks ready to fall as it is stuck below the foothold of the midline of the descending parallel channel. Increased selling pressure could see XRP price retest the October lows around $0.4734, with technical indicators showing an unmotivated holder community. This is seen by the waning momentum on the RSI below 50 and the position of the AO and MACD in negative territory.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, enhanced buyer momentum could see XRP price breach the resistance due to the midline of the channel, bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price trades broadly unchanged leading up to crucial milestone in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

        "title": "Mollars ICO & What You Need to Know About Ethereum Blockchain\u2019s New Bitcoin - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The official Initial Coin Offering [ICO] for the Ethereum blockchain token \u201cMollars\u201d launched on Monday, November 21st. The token price starts at $0.30 in the first phase.\n\nMollars is a hybrid cryptocurrency that will be an alternative to Bitcoin as it\u2019s a store of value tokens. There will be a difference, however, as it\u2019s starting a decade after BTC was first introduced to the world.\n\nWhat are Store of Value Tokens and Coins?\n\nLike Bitcoin, Mollars aims to be a store of value that\u2019s in high demand, and the founder will not hold tokens privately. Possibly as high as 99.5% of today\u2019s cryptocurrency founders have a personal stash of tokens that was likely introduced to investors through the \u2018fine print\u2019 in the crypto brand\u2019s whitepaper.\n\nIn Mollars whitepapers, it\u2019s clearly stated that no party involved in the development of this token will be given tokens. A complete 100% of the tokens generated by the founder and developer team will be put onto the crypto market and exchanges.\n\nAnother attribute that makes Mollars a store of value, like Bitcoin, is that it will be fully decentralized.\n\nThe founder will not own the brand. The creator of the token created infrastructure and formulas to give the token longevity, but the enigmatic figure will have no control over the token once it has been released on top crypto exchanges.\n\nMollars ICO and Potential Exchange Listings\n\nThe first exchange that Mollars will be listed on is Uniswap, the world\u2019s #1 decentralized crypto exchange. If the ICO reaches its goal of US$ 2 million dollars, it will have a listing day price of US$0.62.\n\nThe 62-cent listing would mean today\u2019s first-round ICO investors would get ROI Yields of over +200%.\n\nThe price of the listing day could be weaker if the US$2,000,000 milestone is not met with the Initial Coin Offering fundraising.\n\nWith 15,661 tokens sold since its debut on November 21st, the Mollars ICO listing is averaging a daily buy rate of just over 2,610 tokens. At this rate, it would take the Initial Coin offering a substantial amount of time to complete. However, the \u2018buzz\u2019 is building, and that daily buy rate is expected to increase.\n\nAnother reason users might begin buying more is the crypto token\u2019s founder\u2019s recent release of the white paper and mission statement. One of those statements includes a \u2018catalyst\u2019 to expand the Mollars brand via product.\n\nBitcoin Had a 10-Year Head Start\u2026 So Here\u2019s The Catalyst\n\nThe new ERC-20 token will be a necessity for those who wish to use Mollars developers\u2019 coming mystery web3 product. This decentralized app [dApp] will launch in early 2024 at the same time as the hybrid tokens launch on its first major crypto exchange.\n\nWhat exactly is the dApp Mollars will launch? It\u2019s not yet clarified but the web3 \u2018goody\u2019 is being believed to target P2E gamers and metaverse enthusiasts of the Ethereum blockchain world.\n\nMollars ICO in 2024\n\nThese claims by the new ERC-20 token\u2019s developers have left some analysts to believe today\u2019s first round ICO investors could generate more than just the typical listing day gains.\n\nAs the Mollars token is being offered at US$ 0.30 cents today, it will list on a major crypto exchange in second quarter of 2024.\n\nMany new tokens see gains when listed on new cryptocurrency exchanges, but having an actual product could lift the token.\n\nICO & Tokenomics\n\nSpecifics for the ICO launch and post-listing plans have been made clear based on the fundraising goal being met successfully. A total of 4,500,000 tokens will be sold. Mollars initial coin offering will have 4 funding rounds. The price of the token pre-exchange will increase with each round incrementally.\n\nFirst-round investors will have the best opportunity to buy Mollars tokens at the previously mentioned rate of US$0.30. After a modest 200,000 tokens have been sold, the second round will begin.\n\nThe ICO price for second-round token investors will be US$0.40, which is a substantial increase. A maximum of 300,000 tokens will be sold in this second stage before the price is bumped upward again in the third round.\n\nAs popularity grows, the supply available in the ICO\u2019s third round will more than double to 700,000 $MOLLARS tokens. By this third round, Mollars will have the first details and possibly a preview of their web3 product.\n\nIn the fourth round of the ICO, investors will have to pay half a dollar to buy tokens early.\n\nIn the 2 rounds following the fourth, the token presale will increase by US$0.05 each round. Specifically, 5th-round investors will have to pay US$0.55 per token, and 6th-rounders will have to buy tokens at a rate of US$0.60 each.\n\nThe total token supply that will be sold in the Mollars presale totals 4,000,000 crypto coins.\n\nAfter the ICO presale is completed, the $MOLLARS coin will appear on a top crypto exchange quickly \u2014 according to public plans.\n\nLearn more about the ICO and this new hybrid token at their official website \u2014 www.Mollars.com.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
