        "content": "A widely followed analyst and trader believes that Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for a big burst to the upside.\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 230,700 followers on the X social media platform that Ethereum has officially entered bull territory after leaving its multi-month accumulation range.\n\nAccording to the analyst, Ethereum will leave behind traders who are fixated on ETH\u2019s performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\n\u201cETH has well and truly broken out of a year and a half range now.\n\nJust waiting for the inevitable rage pump that catches everyone out while they\u2019re too busy shi**ing on ETH/BTC.\u201d\n\nWhen paired against the US dollar, Ethereum is trading at $2,373 at time of writing, up by around 93% so far this year. When paired against Bitcoin, Ethereum is trading at 0.05462 BTC at time of writing, down by around 23% year to date.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, Bluntz says that the flagship crypto asset will likely extend the rally that kicked off at around the $36,000 level. According to the analyst, Bitcoin looks poised for another move up while other traders are waiting for a deep corrective move.\n\n\u201cAll I see is people taking profit and warning of impending 10-15% pullbacks.\n\nYou all are not ready for how far this leg from $36,000 extends.\u201d\n\nBluntz is a popular practitioner of the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis method that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally with each wave having its own five sub-waves.\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will rise to as high as $53,000 before ending the five-wave surge.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,435 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is the layer-1 smart contract blockchain Sui (SUI). According to Bluntz, Sui is gearing up to break out of its accumulation phase.\n\n\u201cSUI is another new coin that looks ready for the markup phase.\n\nHad an 80% decline after initial listing pump and now some very nice accumulation.\u201d\n\nSui is trading at $0.681 at time of writing, slightly above Bluntz\u2019s accumulation range.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto: Ethereum Catches up with Bitcoin, Altcoin season? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin has long played the role of the undisputed leader, paving the way for its crypto brethren. But, as in any good epic tale, a challenger arises: Ethereum. As we approach the end of 2023, we might be witnessing the dawn of a new era, where the altcoin is no longer content to follow but aims to compete. Is it the season of altcoins? In this financial ballet, Ethereum sketches a daring dance to catch up with the Bitcoin giant. Let\u2019s analyze this captivating plot together.\n\nCrypto ETH: The Phoenix of Altcoins?\n\nYesterday, a remarkable event occurred: Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency reached a new annual high of $2,312, demonstrating resilience worthy of a phoenix.\n\nWith a 10.28% progression in one week, Ether is no longer the timid younger sibling following in its elder\u2019s footsteps. Against a still-dominating Bitcoin, this crypto seems to whisper a promise: \u201cNothing is played out yet.\u201d This meteoric rise, although impressive, asks a burning question: how high can Ether go in this frenzied race?\n\nETH, like a maestro, has masterfully directed its dance around a graphical triangle, signaling a bullish target of $2,780. This geometric figure is not just a crypto trader\u2019s whim; it is a strategy, a meticulously planned plot.\n\nThe Ichimoku indicators, with their colorful curves, seem to play a harmonious melody, supporting this ascent. But beware, every story has its twists. If ETH falls below its protective cloud, this dream of $2,780 may vanish, reminding us that falls are always possible.\n\nETH: The New Hero?\n\nSo, are we witnessing the emergence of a new hero in this crypto saga? Ethereum, with its current configuration, seems to have all the trumps to hit its target. But in this world where caution is queen, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is as unpredictable as a stormy ocean.\n\nThe question remains: Can Ethereum, strengthened by its ascent, truly reach $2,780 before the end of the year, and in this odyssey, can it redefine the rules of the game established by Bitcoin?\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s rise is more than just a market fluctuation; it is a true digital odyssey, redefining the dynamics of power in the world of cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, Ether, with its recent performance, prompts deep reflection on the future of altcoins. Is it a mere resurgence, or are we witnessing the dawn of an era where altcoins, led by Ethereum, play a leading role? The future, albeit encrypted, looks thrilling. In a world where surprise is the only constant, one thing is certain: the crypto realm will continue to mesmerize, astonish, and perhaps, overturn established titans.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Altcoins Could Surge in Price After Bitcoin and Ethereum Rallies This Week: Glassnode Co-Founders - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The co-founders of the crypto analytics firm Glassnode believe that altcoins are about to go on a rally as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) soar.\n\nGlassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who share the Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, say that the total altcoin market cap is already rising, indicating bullishness for alts.\n\n\u201cHow much longer will altcoins trail behind before making their move? The Bitcoin narrative continues to steer the ship, but a closer look reveals the total altcoin market cap playing catch-up. With Ethereum and BTC leading the way, we are potentially on the brink of an altcoin surge.\u201d\n\nThe founders also predict increased volatility for Bitcoin\u2019s price but a rally continuation. They say that the crypto king could dip to the $40,000 level while remaining in an overall uptrend.\n\n\u201cBTC\u2019s bullish momentum: navigating the uncharted journey to $46,000.\n\nDespite the four-hour timeframe indicating BTC is overbought BTC\u2019s upward trend may persist, intensifying investor FOMO (fear of missing out) across the board.\n\nTechnically, BTC navigates uncharted territory towards $46,000. Expect volatile moves between $40,000-$46,000. The 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) provides a safety net for potential pullbacks, making shorting risky. Current patterns hint at a climb towards $45,000.\n\nConclusion: stay alert, but optimistic. Yet the BTC\u2019s momentum suggests more upside.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $43,424 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe two also use the Elliott Wave theory to suggest that the total market cap for cryptocurrencies could soar to an all-time high (ATH) of $4.4 trillion during the current bull cycle, surpassing the previous ATH of about $3 trillion.\n\nThe Elliott Wave theory attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology which tends to manifest in waves. Traditionally, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave \u201cABC\u201d corrections.\n\n\u201cThird time a charm? When crypto starts its move, it goes vertical by the end of the move! The journey has just begun. And RSI (relative strength index) is in the \u2018extremely bullish\u2019 zone. Are you strapped up for this move? Extreme euphoria may likely be seen by the end of the rally.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the total crypto market cap stands at $1.69 trillion.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The meme coin market has seen an uptick in the past week, with Cardano\u2019s Snek (SNEK) and Solana\u2019s Bonk (BONK) experiencing immense gains.\n\nThese meme-inspired coins on different blockchains have rallied impressively, attracting retail investors seeking the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.\n\nWith meme coin momentum showing no signs of slowing down, some experts wonder if a new Ethereum-based token may be next to ride the hype.\n\nSNEK Surges After Investor FOMO Boosts Forgotten Meme Coin\n\nIt\u2019s been an excellent week for SNEK holders, with the coin\u2019s price rising almost 170% since last Friday.\n\nSNEK is now trading for $0.00079, its highest value since June.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, over $3.5 million worth of SNEK exchanged hands in the past 24 hours \u2013 a 49% increase from the previous day.\n\nThis highlights the renewed interest and hype surrounding the token in recent days.\n\nThe Cardano-based meme coin had gone quiet for months after its initial price surge when it launched earlier this year, but fresh waves of investor demand have now pushed its market cap back over $54 million.\n\nMuch of this newfound momentum comes from the current bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum rallying powerfully, speculative coins like SNEK tend to benefit from the spillover hype.\n\nAlthough its fundamentals may still be lacking, SNEK\u2019s price action hints that further upside could be ahead.\n\nBONK Price Explodes Over 5,500%, Hitting All-Time High\n\nThe BONK meme coin on Solana has seen ever more parabolic price action than Cardano\u2019s SNEK this past week.\n\nAfter trading sideways for most of the year following January\u2019s spike, BONK has suddenly caught fire and rocketed over 5,500% since the start of November.\n\nBONK recently hit an all-time high of $0.000012, with the token now boasting a market cap of $710 million.\n\nThis makes BONK the third-largest meme coin globally, flipping Pepe (PEPE) coin.\n\nMuch like SNEK, BONK has benefited from the return of speculation to the crypto sector in the past three months.\n\nThanks to the market\u2019s strength, the entire Solana ecosystem has seen renewed developer and investor interest.\n\nAs the SOL token began to rally, it brought visibility and liquidity to projects built on the network, positively affecting BONK.\n\nMajor exchange listings have also played a key role in BONK\u2019s trajectory, with the buzz around the token showing no signs of abating.\n\nCould an Ethereum-Based Meme Coin Could Explode Next?\n\nWith meme coin mania hitting networks like Cardano and Solana, attention now turns to whether an Ethereum-based project could be next to benefit from the speculative wave.\n\nEthereum has lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s powerful rally in recent months, yet the ETH/BTC pair surged almost 8% yesterday.\n\nThis shows capital flowing back into Ethereum and is beginning to benefit existing meme coins like Pepe (PEPE), which is up by 9% since yesterday.\n\nMoreover, some investors now believe Ethereum\u2019s strength could provide scope for a relatively unknown project to break out in a similar fashion to SNEK or BONK.\n\nTwo potential candidates include Meme Kombat (MK) and Wall Street Memes (WSM).\n\nMeme Kombat features an AI-powered battle arena where users can place bets on the outcomes of hilarious fights between meme coin mascots.\n\nAlongside the battle arena, Meme Kombat has a staking protocol where investors can lock up the native MK token and earn yields of 318% annually.\n\nIn terms of coins already listed on exchanges, Wall Street Memes is a meme coin inspired by the values of those who took down the short sellers during GameStop\u2019s short squeeze in 2021.\n\nWSM has already climbed the ranks of the top meme coins on CoinMarketCap, with room to grow as its FDV is still under $50 million.\n\n$WSM is currently listed on Uniswap and OKX, and $MK is available to buy at memekombat.io.\n\nBoth MK and WSM feature the viral potential that could help them attract a surge of interest from internet communities if Ethereum continues gaining ground.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "VanEck predicts $40B inflow into Bitcoin ETFs and $100k BTC in 2024 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Global investment management firm VanEck\u2018s 2024 predictions for crypto suggest a transformative year ahead for the sector, highlighting pivotal events and trends set to redefine the digital asset landscape from economic fluctuations to groundbreaking technological advancements.\n\nThe forecasts are based on analysis beyond just the crypto sector, looking at economic trends, technological developments, and regulatory dynamics. From the anticipated U.S. recession\u2019s intertwining with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, aiming to bolster Bitcoin\u2019s resilience above $30,000, to the fourth Bitcoin halving poised to elevate its market value, these predictions spotlight pivotal moments in crypto\u2019s journey.\n\nFurther, VanEck\u2019s outlook predicts Ethereum to retain its position beneath Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance while simultaneously outshining major tech stocks and facing competition from other smart contract platforms. The NFT market, which will be fueled by both Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2024, is expected to scale new heights, reshaping the landscape of digital collectibles. Meanwhile, the stablecoin realm, particularly with USDC, anticipates unprecedented growth.\n\nThe predictions also highlight the potential shift in exchange supremacy, with Binance\u2019s leading spot trading position challenged by emergent rivals. Additionally, DEXs are projected to claim a significant slice of the spot trading market. A breakthrough is anticipated for blockchain-based gaming, with a game surpassing one million daily active users, marking a milestone in mainstream acceptance.\n\nRobbie Ferguson, Co-Founder and President of Immutable, told CryptoSlate,\n\n\u201cRecognition from VanEck, one of the world\u2019s top 10 ETF issuers, is exceptional validation of the work we\u2019ve been doing for web3 games since we built the first decentralized game on any blockchain in 2017[\u2026] This endorsement further validates our platform strategy, and relentless focus on an exceptional end player experience.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Solana\u2019s ascent to a top-three blockchain position, along with the rise of DePi networks like Hivemapper and Helium, anticipates broad diversification within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFinally, a pivotal area highlighted by VanEck is the integration of Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols in decentralized finance (DeFi), expected to usher in a new era of institutional participation. This, along with new corporate accounting treatments for crypto holdings, signals a shift towards mainstream and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nVanEck predicts spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved in Q1.\n\nIn 2024, VanEck predicts the U.S. economy to enter a recession amidst slowing economic momentum and cooling inflation. This downturn, marked by 19 months of consecutive decline in leading indicators, weak commodity markets, and increasing corporate bankruptcies, sets a challenging backdrop. Yet, in this economic landscape, the debut of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will be approved in Q1.\n\nVanEck forecasts that these ETFs will attract substantial investment, drawing a parallel with the early success of the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF launched in 2004. The GLD ETF experienced rapid inflows, capturing a notable fraction of the gold market within its first quarter. Applying these metrics to Bitcoin, adjusted for the current era\u2019s higher money supply, the prediction is a striking initial influx of around $1B, potentially reaching $2.4B within a quarter for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis significant capital flow into Bitcoin ETFs reflects a deeper shift in the financial landscape. With the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s M2 money supply considerably higher than during the GLD launch, the potential for Bitcoin ETF inflows is magnified, leading to an estimated $40.4B over the first two years. This surge is partly driven by a predicted preference for Bitcoin as a form of \u2018hard money\u2019 amidst concerns over sovereign debt levels and inflation, positioning it as an alternative to gold among investors.\n\nFurthermore, the expected lower transaction costs of these ETFs, compared to current retail trading fees, suggest a potential for broader market adoption. Such cost efficiencies historically have catalyzed the widespread acceptance of new technologies and could similarly propel Bitcoin ETFs into the financial mainstream. Despite the looming recession and potential market volatility, these developments indicate a robust demand for Bitcoin, potentially sustaining its price above $30k in the early phase of 2024.\n\nImpact of the Bitcoin halving and new Bitcoin ATH.\n\nVanEck predicts that the fourth Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April, will unfold smoothly without major disruptions. This halving is likely to lead to the disconnection of unprofitable miners, shifting the landscape towards those with more efficient, low-cost power solutions. Despite the initial adjustment period, where the market might experience some consolidation, Bitcoin\u2019s value is projected to rise. VanEck predicts that following the halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price could surpass the $48k mark, aligning with the technical pattern observed in April 2022. This uptrend is expected despite some miners potentially underperforming compared to Bitcoin\u2019s price, with low-cost miners like CLSK and RIOT predicted to outshine others. The post-halving period might also see significant growth for at least one publicly traded miner.\n\nThe second half of 2024 could bring even more dramatic developments for Bitcoin. Amid a backdrop of global political shifts and an increase in global voting participation, Bitcoin is anticipated to scale new heights. This period of heightened political activity and potential changes in regulatory landscapes, particularly following a significant U.S. presidential election, sets the stage for Bitcoin to potentially achieve an all-time high. VanEck speculates that by Nov. 2024, Bitcoin could hit a new peak in value, potentially reaching $100k by the year\u2019s end. This scenario, marked by a departure from certain regulatory stances, could lead to a landmark moment for Bitcoin and its perception in the global financial system.\n\nThe Flippening won\u2019t happen, but DeFi will rise.\n\nEthereum is set to make significant strides but will not surpass Bitcoin in market dominance. Ethereum\u2019s performance is expected to outshine even the largest tech stocks, but it will not achieve the long-speculated \u201cflippening\u201d to overtake Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s clearer regulatory status and its appeal due to its energy-intensive mining process are anticipated to draw increased interest from state-backed entities in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Notably, Argentina might join the ranks of countries like El Salvador and the UAE in state-level Bitcoin mining support, focusing on utilizing stranded methane and gas resources.\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions are poised for substantial growth following the implementation of EIP-4844, which promises to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees. This upgrade is expected to catalyze a consolidation within the Ethereum network, with two to three Layer 2 chains emerging as dominant players. These leading chains could potentially surpass Ethereum in monthly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and total value locked (TVL). This shift is likely due to the reduced transaction costs enabling more efficient trading and arbitrage opportunities. By the fourth quarter of 2024, these Ethereum Layer 2 chains collectively might double Ethereum\u2019s current DEX volume and exponentially increase transaction numbers, signaling a significant evolution in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nIn total, VanEck made 15 predictions for crypto in 2024, listed below:\n\nU.S. Recession Arrival and Debut of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Uneventful Fourth Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin\u2019s All-Time High in Q4 of 2024 Ethereum\u2019s Market Position Behind Bitcoin in 2024 Dominance of ETH Layer 2s Post-EIP-4844 NFT Activity Peaks to New Heights Binance Relinquishes Top Position in Spot Trading Stablecoin Market Cap Hits Record High with USDC Market Share Recovery Decentralized Exchanges Attain Record Spot Trading Market Share Bitcoin Yield Opportunities Driven by Remittances and Smart Contract Platforms Emergence of a Leading Blockchain Game Solana Outperforms Ethereum with Resurging DeFi TVL Meaningful Adoption of DePin Networks Corporate Crypto Holdings Boosted by New Accounting Standards DeFi\u2019s Reconciliation with KYC Regulations\n\nThe full report from VanEck is available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\n13.15 GMT: Updated to include comment from Immutable.\n\nMentioned in this article"
