        "content": "VanEck Analysts Predict Ethereum Could Reach $22,000 by 2030\n\nVanEck analysts have significantly raised their price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) to $22,000 by 2030. In a post on X, VanEck shared, \"We've raised our 2030 ETH price target to $22,000, influenced by ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data.\" This statement was accompanied by a link to the detailed report authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev.\n\nVanEck is among several Wall Street investment managers aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, following their successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether ETFs last month, enabling investors to benefit from Ethereum's price appreciation without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency. This setup also allows ETF sponsors to earn fees as more assets flow into their funds.\n\nThe VanEck analysts expressed optimism about the approval and trading of spot Ether ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges. \"This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians, and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs,\" they noted.\n\nVanEck's base case price target is $22,000, with more extreme bullish and bearish scenarios predicting prices of $154,000 and $360, respectively. The analysts concluded, \"We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as 'Digital Oil' because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum.\""

        "content": "Analysts from the investment management firm VanEck have updated their Ethereum ETH/USD price prediction for 2030, setting a new target of $22,000.\n\nWhat Happened: VanEck, which is currently seeking approval to list a spot Ether ETF, announced the revised forecast on Wednesday. as per a report by The Block. The new price target is based on the potential of Ether ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s scaling progress, and on-chain data analysis.\n\nThe VanEck report authors, who hold positions in Ethereum directly or through private funds, believe that Ethereum\u2019s ongoing market share growth and its leading position among smart contract platforms could bolster a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nThe $22,000 price target is the authors\u2019 base case price target. The bullish and bearish price predictions were $154,000 and $360, respectively.\n\nWhy It Matters: VanEck is one of several Wall Street firms aiming to list spot ether ETFs in the wake of successful spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs launched earlier this year. The SEC gave the green light to spot Ether ETFs last month.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that spot Ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,\u201d said the VanEck analysts. They estimate that these ETFs could draw between $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion in net inflows during their first five months of trading. The optimism is in contrast to SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s position, who hinted at delays.\n\nThese estimates come on the heels of recent projections by cryptocurrency analyst Flow, who fixed a base price target of $5,294 for ETH by the end of 2024. The bullish and bearish price predictions were $6,730\u200b and $4,428, respectively.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $3,863.06, following a 1.37% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Will Dogecoin\u2019s Price Discovery Follow Bitcoin Like It Did Historically?\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst\n\nIn late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMany consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF\u2019s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching.\n\nThe firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin\u2019s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale.\n\nMany believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications. In the long run, these use cases could potentially elevate Ethereum over Bitcoin, as Ethereum may have more room to adapt to changing market conditions. However, as it stands, Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin, which is expected to be reflected in ETF trading figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?'\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin helped found Ethereum in 2013, he envisioned using the platform and blockchain technology as a force for good. He envisioned the network as a means to increase social welfare and provide users access to valuable projects. It makes sense, then, that Buterin has criticized the meme coin craze overtaking the crypto community in 2024. Buterin stated he is not a fan of the meme coin frenzy and prefers the community push \"things in a better direction.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nButerin's comments were in response to a post on X regarding the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token, a project centered on rapper Iggy Azalea. \"If $MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation, it'll also be the mother of this cycle's celebrity experimentation,\" said Chris Burniske on X.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder responded, stating he is \"feeling quite unhappy about with [sic] \u2018this cycle's celebrity experimentation' so far,\" and that he can respect the means \"if the end is worthy (health care, open source software, art, etc).\"\n\nButerin argues that the creators of these tokens use celebrities' names to attract investors while providing little value in return. He contends this practice detracts funds from more useful projects and contradicts his original vision for Ethereum.\n\nCelebrity memecoins have recently become popular among crypto investors. Tokens centered around celebrities like Donald Trump, Caitlyn Jenner, and Elon Musk have attracted billions in investment without providing much value.\n\nWhile most of these meme projects are antithetical to Buterin's grand vision for Ethereum, he mentioned one project that used its funds to add value, though not to the scale he hoped for.\n\n\"Ashton and Mila\u2019s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we\u2019ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era \u2014 at least there was an actual show being funded,\" Buterin noted. The Stoner Cats project featured an NFT collection, which funded an animated show. The project raised enough to hire Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Chris Rock, and Buterin himself as voice actors.\n\nStoner Cats is an example of how crypto project funds can create valuable content. However, the SEC sued Stoner Cats over its NFT offering, resulting in a $1 million civil penalty.\n\nWith many projects aiming to drive up token prices or make quick money, Buterin asks, \"How do we push things in a better direction?\" It will be interesting to see how projects respond to his call-out.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Brief History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche curiosity into a mainstream financial phenomenon, transforming how we think about money, technology, and business. It began with the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency that promised a decentralized, secure, and immutable way to transfer value across the globe. Bitcoin's success paved the way for Ethereum, a platform that expanded the potential of blockchain technology with its smart contracts and decentralized applications. As the crypto landscape continued to evolve, new innovations like the BlockDAG Network emerged, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional blockchain architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article explores the fascinating history of cryptocurrency, from the inception of Bitcoin to the rise of Ethereum and the cutting-edge developments in BlockDAG Network, providing a comprehensive overview of the journey and the impact these technologies have had on the world.\n\nBitcoin: The Genesis of Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin, often hailed as digital gold, revolutionized the financial world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. The brainchild of a pseudonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's white paper was released on October 28, 2008. The document introduced a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, enabling digital value transfer between parties without intermediaries like banks. This system utilized a blockchain, a chain of transactions stored on multiple computers competing to process and store transactions. This process, known as mining, created new Bitcoin BTC tokens and ensured the network's security and decentralization.\n\nThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. At the time, 10,000 BTC was worth $41. As Bitcoin's value surged over the years, reaching peaks like $70,000 in March 2024, this transaction became a legendary story in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's journey from a cryptographic novelty to a multi-trillion-dollar asset involved overcoming significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and security breaches. However, its decentralized, immutable, and divisible nature made it a revolutionary global financial instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum: Beyond Currency to Decentralized Applications\n\nWhile Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced a decentralized platform for running smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's unique feature is its Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that run exactly as programmed without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. This innovation opened the door to numerous applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network by compensating miners for computational work and transaction validation. Despite facing volatility and security challenges, Ethereum has solidified its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network: The Next Evolution in Blockchain Technology\n\nThe traditional blockchain architecture, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, operates on a linear sequence of blocks. While effective, this model faces scalability issues, particularly with increasing transaction volumes. Enter BlockDAG Network , a novel approach that aims to address these limitations.\n\nBlockDAG has attracted investor\u2019s attention and capital as a decentralized network structure where transactions are arranged in a graph format rather than a linear chain. This architecture allows multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, significantly enhancing transaction throughput and scalability. Key characteristics of BlockDAG networks include parallel transactions, enhanced scalability, and improved security.\n\nNow BlockDAG Network has attracted even more attention within the industry with the release of its second keynote video, humorously titled \u201cFrom the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe project's presale has amassed over $40 million in record time for any cryptocurrency or digital asset initiative. This impressive funding surge underscores the rising interest in BlockDAG Network as a new store of value and passive income generator, akin to Bitcoin.\n\nThe momentum behind BlockDAG Network suggests that the $40 million raised is merely the beginning of what is poised to be a groundbreaking force in the digital market.\n\nThe Evolution of Crypto Assets and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's brief surpassing of $70,000 on Monday marked a peak amidst a fourth consecutive week of inflows into crypto investment products. CoinShares International Ltd. reported $185 million in inflows for the week ending May 31, with $2 billion invested in May alone. This surge underscored the growing institutional interest and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, characterized by its volatility, continues to evolve with significant developments like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe journey from Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network illustrates the rapid evolution and diversification of cryptocurrency technologies. From enabling peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized applications to enhancing scalability and security, these innovations are reshaping the financial landscape.\n\nThe digital evolution promises not only to disrupt traditional financial systems but also to democratize access to financial services, empowering users worldwide.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
