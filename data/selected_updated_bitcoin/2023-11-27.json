        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMagic Eden sees a crypto future that spans multiple blockchains\u2014and is launching its crypto wallet browser extension in closed beta to support that aim, the firm behind the NFT marketplace announced Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a multi-chain world for NFTs,\u201d Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu told Decrypt in an interview.\n\n\u201cUp until today, for a user to really experience all the different products and features and great content that we have on every chain, they effectively have to download three wallets,\u201d Lu said of the current challenges plaguing the wallet space that have led to user fragmentation on Magic Eden.\n\nThe marketplace\u2019s crypto wallet is launching for the Google Chrome browser first, but a Safari browser version and mobile app are also in the works. The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors. Beta version is now live and only available to a small group of early testers! Want to give it a try? You can get on the waiting list by downloading the extension and entering your\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5DsS5qhdlQ \u2014 Magic Eden \ud83e\ude84 (@MagicEden) November 27, 2023\n\n\u201cWe very much want to live up to that,\u201d Lu said of Magic Eden\u2019s belief in Web3, a term which refers to a hypothesized next iteration of the internet that offers users decentralized ownership through crypto. \u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to stick to something self-custodial.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s wallet promises a more user-friendly, cross-chain solution for crypto fans, allowing them to avoid bridging (transferring crypto from one chain to another) by doing cross-chain token swaps through the wallet.\n\nLu is also very much aware of the common issues that afflict crypto browser extensions. For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

DeFi protocols built using complex smart contracts, such as decentralised exchanges and lending protocols, have attracted tens of billions of dollars of deposits.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s TVL is minuscule because of its limited support for smart contracts.\n\nThe total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain is tiny compared to Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nFees and revenue\n\nWhile TVL is still a great way to gauge a blockchain\u2019s popularity at a glance, looking at other metrics within the Compare Chains dashboard can help create a more complete comparison.\n\nComparing the fees and revenue two blockchains create can yield insights into not only user activity, but also how financially sustainable they are.\n\nLet\u2019s use DefiLlama to compare Ethereum and Optimism.\n\nHere we can see a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees go back to the network as revenue \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case these fees are burned. On Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 network, a much smaller proportion of its fees are kept as revenue.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum layer 2, makes less revenue than the blockchain it is built on top of. (DefiLlama)\n\nThat is because Optimism has to pay the Ethereum network it is built on top of to confirm transactions. The majority of transaction fees Optimism charges users are paid to Ethereum, while Optimism keeps what\u2019s left.\n\nEven so, Optimism, along with other Ethereum layer 2 networks, produce millions of dollars of revenue each month.\n\nActive users and transactions\n\nThe Active Users and Transactions metrics are powerful in and of themselves. But when combined they can reveal deeper insights into the behaviour of the users on different blockchains.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s compare the active users on Polygon and Ethereum. On DefiLlama, the active users metric is synonymous with active wallet addresses.\n\nPolygon, a blockchain with lower transaction fees, has more active addresses than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nAs we can see in the example, Polygon has a little over 60,000 more active addresses than Ethereum does.\n\nNext, let\u2019s compare transactions.\n\nPolygon also processes many more transactions than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nHere we can see Polygon processes almost three times the number of transactions Ethereum does.\n\nNow, let\u2019s combine these two comparisons.\n\nBy dividing daily transactions by daily active addresses on Nov. 15, we find that each Polygon address made an average of 7.7 transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, however, each address only made an average of 3.5 transactions.\n\nSo, what might be behind this difference? Well, Ethereum transaction fees are much higher than those on Polygon, which could be one influence.\n\nBut be careful when comparing transactions \u2014 not all blockchains allow for a fair comparison.\n\nFor example, Solana\u2019s transaction count is much higher than any other blockchain DefiLlama lists. Is this because Solana users are just more active? Maybe not.\n\nIt\u2019s actually because around 85% of all Solana transactions are from validators communicating with each other every time the network creates a new block. Such transactions happen automatically to keep the blockchain running.\n\nWhy are blockchains different from each other?\n\nAside from popularity and marketing, there are fundamental differences between blockchains based on what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nA lot of what makes a specific blockchain unique can be boiled down to its approach to solving the so-called blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma posits that blockchains want to achieve sufficient security, scalability and decentralisation, but can only ever solve any two at the same time by sacrificing the third.\n\nIn the context of blockchains, security, scalability and decentralisation are defined as follows:\n\nSecurity.
