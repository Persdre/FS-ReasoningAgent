        "content": "U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs May See Modest Inflows Compared to Bitcoin, Citi Reports\n\nSpot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could experience net inflows at just 30%-35% of the levels seen by spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, according to a research report by Citi. This projection translates to a range of $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion in net inflows over a six-month period. The Citi analysts noted that these figures might be overestimated as both the inflows and ether\u2019s return beta relative to such flows could be lower than anticipated.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs are set to become tradable in the U.S. next week after receiving approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year. However, Citi analysts suggest that while Ethereum offers potential long-term diversification benefits due to its broader set of use cases, these advantages are not yet fully realized.\n\nCiti also highlighted that the lack of staking options in Ethereum spot ETFs might contribute to lower-than-expected inflows. Furthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage has already secured billions in inflows and strong performance before Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval in May.\n\nDespite these cautious forecasts, Citi\u2019s report noted that the timing of the spot Ethereum ETF launches coincides with an increasingly dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which may signal lower interest rates, a stronger equity market, and a weaker U.S. dollar. Such a macroeconomic environment could prove beneficial for the broader crypto market."

        "content": "Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, has outlined three key reasons why he believes Ethereum ETH/USD will reach a new all-time high following the launch of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs).\n\nWhat Happened: Hougan predicts that by year-end, Ethereum\u2019s price will surpass its previous record of $5,000, driven primarily by ETP inflows.\n\nHe bases this forecast on three structural factors that differentiate Ethereum from Bitcoin BTC/USD:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Lower Short-Term Inflation Rate: Unlike Bitcoin, which had a 1.7% inflation rate when its ETPs launched, Ethereum currently has a 0% inflation rate. This balance between new ETH creation and consumption through network activity creates a favorable supply-demand dynamic for price appreciation. Reduced Selling Pressure from Validators: Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake system doesn\u2019t require validators to sell ETH to cover operational costs, unlike Bitcoin miners who often need to sell newly mined coins. This results in less forced selling pressure on the Ethereum market. Significant Portion of ETH Supply Locked: Approximately 28% of all ETH is currently staked and unavailable for sale. An additional 13% is locked in decentralized finance smart contracts. With about 40% of the total supply off the market, there\u2019s potential for increased scarcity and price pressure.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump Comments On Crypto Pivot: \u2018If We Don\u2019t Do It, China Will\u2019\n\nHougan anticipates that new Ethereum ETPs will attract around $15 billion in assets over their first 18 months.\n\nGiven these factors and Ethereum\u2019s current price of approximately $3,400 (about 29% below its all-time high), he finds it difficult to imagine ETH not challenging its previous record.\n\nWhile Hougan expects some initial market choppiness due to potential outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE as it converts to an ETP, he remains confident in his bullish outlook for Ethereum by the end of the year.\n\nThis bullish outlook for Ethereum comes at a pivotal time for the cryptocurrency industry, as market participants eagerly await regulatory clarity and potential ETF approvals.\n\nInvestors and industry leaders will have the opportunity to delve deeper into these topics and explore their implications at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock"
