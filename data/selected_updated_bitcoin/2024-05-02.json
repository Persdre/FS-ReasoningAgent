        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBut the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.\n\nEconomist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve.\"\n\nAnalysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee\u2014which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates\u2014would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.\n\nSome thoughts on the current crypto cycle #1 The crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF. #2 ETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers. #3 Solana established itself as the chain of choice for\u2026 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) May 1, 2024\n\nDuring a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said, but warned that it was \u201clikely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.\u201d\n\nBut even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. \"I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut,\" he said during a press conference in Japan last month. \"This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that.\"\n\nHe was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Risk assets across the board got a boost from the Fed, with these three tokens seeing market-beating upside.\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector is getting a nice boost today from yesterday's commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The market received a jolt from Powell's commentary in a press release; he suggested the direction of the next Fed move will most likely be lower. The market had previously priced in some chance of an interest rate hike, which appears to be off the table, at least for now.\n\nWith a more accommodative monetary policy environment likely ahead, risk assets across the curve saw a big boost over the past 24 hours. Of course, the further out on the risk curve investors go, the more protracted this move can be. For top cryptos Bitcoin (BTC -3.28%), Ethereum (ETH -2.30%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -7.20%), it's meant a 24-hour move of 3.8%, 2.2%, and 4%, respectively, as of 4 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, there are some token-specific factors at play with these three tokens that investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's moving these closely watched digital assets.\n\nThe rally continues\n\nSince hitting a new all-time high right around the time of its most recent halving, Bitcoin's rally has faltered. Expectations for a potential continuation of this fall had taken hold because of economic factors that could affect the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut with interest rate hikes seemingly off the table, analysts have grown increasingly bullish on Bitcoin over the near and medium term. Lower interest rates should bring the U.S. dollar down, inflating the price of various commodities and goods that act as stores of value. For those who buy into this thesis for Bitcoin, that's a great thing. Indeed, yesterday's press conference likely had the greatest impact on Bitcoin for this very reason.\n\nEthereum's status as a commodity or store of value of sorts is also debatable. In second position in terms of market capitalization in this sector, Ethereum should benefit from a similar trend of capital flowing into cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin investors have benefited from. That's because the market is still expecting the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum ETFs at some point (though some suggest it's possible the SEC could still deem this asset a security), which should improve the supply and demand dynamics around this token. As Ethereum has shifted to a proof-of-stake protocol and taken on some deflationary measures for its token, there's a strong bull case building in the market that the same drivers that took Bitcoin on its run to record highs could be in play for Ethereum this year.\n\nDogecoin remains among the most speculative crypto assets out there, meaning it's a top choice for traders and investors looking to play short-term price swings in the market. It's no surprise that Dogecoin has seen a more pronounced move than its larger peers, for this reason alone. However, large liquidation data tied to a previous decline in these three tokens in recent days could also play a part in today's rally. Investors appear to have been looking for any reason to load up on risk and put capital to work on this dip. This recent macro catalyst appears to have provided the needed push.\n\nIs this rally poised to continue?\n\nToday's move needs to be put into context. Bitcoin declined to a low of around $58,000 per token yesterday, and while it's moving toward the $60,000 mark at the time of writing, that's still well off its all-time high of around $73,000 hit earlier this year. So, there's certainly both upside and downside potential in the near term, as this token did gap up quite quickly in short order.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin tend to follow Bitcoin's lead, so I'd say this is the token most investors should be focused on right now. I'm of the view that if a number of bullish catalysts materialize in the coming days, it's entirely possible Bitcoin could make another run at a new high, and Ethereum and Dogecoin could follow. It's just a question of whether this specific macro catalyst can be amplified by some additional news. Right now, there's not much on my radar, so I'm going to sit out this recent pop."
