        "content": "Bitcoin collapsed to $42,500, triggering a widespread market crash.\n\nThe 1-hour volume increased while many long positions were wiped out.\n\nThe enthusiasm about a Bitcoin [BTC] bull run in 2024 has faced a setback as the price fell by 4.85% in the last hour at press time.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC started the 3rd of January above $44,000 with many predicting that the coin would hit $50,0000 before the month ends.\n\nHowever, all that may have been put to rest at the moment as BTC\u2019s press time price was a little above $42,500. Furthermore, Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency affected.\n\nSolana [SOL] fell by 7% within the hour while XRP plunged by 12%. Ethereum [ETH] also joined in with a 5.30% plunge.\n\nBitcoin ETFs to be delayed?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto found that right before the dump Matrixport reported the U.S. SEC would not approve any Bitcoin ETFs this month.\n\nThe news sent panic waves around the market. Also, Economist and trader Alex Kruger noted earlier that a crash was coming.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume surged as a result. At press time, BTC volume surpassed $40 billion. This was proof of high selling pressure. Liquidations have also affected traders, especially longs.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, the Liquidation HeatMap showed that over $500 million had been wiped out. Bitcoin took a large part of the hit with $72.13 million.\n\nDetails from the HeatMap also showed that longs were the most affected."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap started 2024 on the front foot. ETH is up for three consecutive days and is currently hovering around the $2,376 mark. The leading altcoin is gearing up for a breakout and another leg-up could take it to the $2,500 level.\n\nAlso Read: 25 New Countries Ready To Join BRICS in 2024\n\nWhile 2024 started positively for Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market, will the momentum hold strong throughout the year? In this article, we will highlight how high Ethereum could trade in the indices this year in 2024.\n\nEthereum: How High Could ETH Trade In 2024?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nLeading on-chain metrics and price prediction firm Changelly has painted a rosy picture for Ethereum in 2024. The forecast estimates that ETH might sustainably scale up in the indices in the next 12 months.\n\nAlso Read: 5 U.S. Sectors To Be Affected If BRICS Ditches the Dollar For Trade\n\nAccording to the price prediction, ETH could reach a new yearly high of $3,988 in 2024. That\u2019s an uptick and return on investment of about 65% from its current price of $2,376. Therefore, an investment of $10,000 today could turn into $16,500 if the prediction becomes accurate.\n\nSource: Changelly\n\nThe positive prediction has taken into consideration the upcoming Bitcoin ETH, which could soon be approved by the SEC. However, if the Bitcoin ETF fails to make a debut, then the prices of BTC and ETH could head south.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Bitcoin & Ethereum: 3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024\n\nMost importantly, the cryptocurrency markets are subjected to extreme volatility and cuts both ways delivering losses to investors. There is no guarantee that ETH could rise 65% and reach $3,988 this year in 2024. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into ETH at the moment.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,376 and is up close to 0.5% in the 24-hours day trade. ETH is down nearly 51% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it reached in November 2021."

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is exploding in value after ETH founder Vitalik Buterin said the project is vital to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nButerin tells his five million followers on the social media platform X that all layer-2 (L2) projects should integrate with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a platform that lets users buy a \u201cdomain name\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain rather than using default addresses.\n\nThe domain names on ENS can be used to transfer and receive funds instead of using alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nSays Buterin,\n\n\u201cAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!\u201d\n\nAccording to data from blockchain data platform Dune Analytics, there are about 2.14 million active ENS names and more than 801,000 unique participants.\n\nLayer-2s, such as Optimism (OP) or Arbitrum (ARB), are built on top of Ethereum to improve scalability and costs.\n\nCCIP, or cross-chain interoperability protocol, is a protocol that allows for the resolution of information on or off-chain from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ENS was trading at a low of $8.88. After Buterin\u2019s social media post, ENS soared to $14.20, a nearly 60% gain. ENS has since given up some of those gains and is trading for $12.82 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Arbitrum One\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a remarkable increase of 15.9%, reaching a milestone of $10.22 billion in the past seven days, making it the first Layer 2 (L2) network to surpass the $10 billion TVL mark.\n\nThe achievement follows an incident on December 15, where Arbitrum One faced a two-hour partial outage due to a surge of Bitcoin Ordinals-inspired inscriptions that led to the triggering of a sequencer stop.\n\nArbitrum One Dominates Ethereum Layer 2 TVL\n\nAccording to data by L2Beat, the total TVL for Ethereum Layer 2 networks has reached $20.82 billion, with Arbitrum One contributing significantly by accounting for 48.03% of the total.\n\nArbitrum currently holds a diversified asset portfolio with 30.9% in Ethereum (ETH), 23.68% in its native governance token ARB, 29.66% allocated to stablecoins, and the remaining 15.76% spread across various other assets. Notably, the ARB token has registered a 14.3% increase in value over the past 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.\n\nThe success of Arbitrum One can be attributed to its ability to replicate the Ethereum experience while offering substantially lower transaction costs. This cost-effectiveness has attracted a considerable number of decentralized applications (dApps), with approximately 470 currently deployed on the network.\n\nThe implementation of the ARB token, serving as a governance token, has significantly contributed to the platform\u2019s growth. Governance tokens empower holders to actively participate in decision-making processes concerning the platform\u2019s development and policies, thereby incentivizing greater user engagement within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the Arbitrum One network boasts a well-established Security Council, a deployed and operational proof system, and accepts fraud proofs from a minimum of five external actors. Moreover, the platform offers a 7-day exit window without relying on a permissioned operator in the event of an unpopular upgrade by actors with more centralization than a security council.\n\nArbitrum One on Upward Trajectory After Outage\n\nArbitrum One faced downtime on December 15, which was categorized as a \u201cmajor outage\u201d on the dashboard. An investigation was initiated to identify the root cause and implement a fix.\n\nBefore the interruption, Arbitrum\u2019s layer-2 network had processed over 22.29 million transactions, as reported by l2beat, and boasted a total value locked of $2.3 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nThe incident on December 15 was not the first time Arbitrum faced disruptions. In June 2023, the DeFi Layer 2 network experienced a standstill for over an hour due to a bug in its sequencer. The bug caused the sequencer to revert batches on-chain, leading to the depletion of Ether (ETH) from the sequencer. Developers intervened by manually replenishing the sequencer, addressing the bug, and restoring normalcy to the Layer 2 network."

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Are Slumping Today. Here's Why. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A spot Bitcoin ETF was all but a sure thing -- has that changed?\n\nWell, that rally to end 2023 and into early 2024 had to end at some point.\n\nMany of the top cryptocurrencies in the market are reeling today, as risk assets across the board decline on a variety of headwinds. Ethereum (ETH 0.27%), Solana (SOL -1.54%), and XRP (XRP 1.99%) are among the tokens to watch for crypto investors, having declined 6.7%, 9.2%, and 8.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nA number of macro forces are driving most long-duration assets lower today. A strengthening U.S. dollar, a decline in long bonds (and corresponding surge in yields), and a widespread rotation to more defensive assets has plagued more speculative asset classes such as crypto over the past 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAdditionally, these three tokens have their own set of headwinds investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's driving this move in these three top-10 digital assets right now.\n\nI thought this was a crypto bull market -- what gives?\n\nA good portion of the recent rise in crypto assets over the past few months can be attributed to expectations about a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Expected by Jan. 10, such an ETF could pave the way for similar products for Ethereum (given there are proposals already underway) and potentially other major tokens such as Solana and XRP to follow.\n\nAccordingly, a narrative shift among many in the crypto market over the past day or so is wreaking havoc on investors relying on this catalyst. Some analysts and experts, such as Matrixport's Markus Thielen, believe that an ultimate approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF may still be a \"long shot.\"\n\nThis view appears to be spreading, with an increase in bearish bets on top cryptocurrencies driving some of the accelerated downside move today. Additionally, nearly $100 million in bullish perpetual contracts placed on Ethereum have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, as per Coinglass. XRP and Solana are also among the top five crypto tokens in terms of long liquidations today, suggesting leveraged upside bets on these tokens are turning sour.\n\nFundamentals weakening\n\nIn addition to the leveraged derivatives market, another key fundamental factor many investors consider when gauging the health of the crypto market over a specific time frame is total value locked (TVL). TVL generally reflects the amount of capital existing within specific crypto ecosystems. When times are good, capital flows into the crypto sector, and this number rises.\n\nUnfortunately, since the beginning of the year, the total TVL for all crypto projects has dropped 5.8% to $52.49 billion. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP saw similar declines in their TVL values, though these three projects have still seen their cumulative TVL numbers rally nicely off of last year's lows.\n\nWhile many still expect that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in short order (partly due to various meetings between Wall Street companies and the SEC in recent days), investors and users appear to be taking a cautious approach with their capital right now.\n\nBottom line\n\nOverall, the crypto sector, and many of its top tokens, appear to be feeling the effects of uncertainty today. At the end of the day, investing is about assessing probabilities. And up until a couple of days ago, the market seemed to be pretty certain that spot ETFs are coming in short order, leading to risk-on trades across this sector in projects that may follow Bitcoin's lead.\n\nThe expected decision date is now about a week away. Until then, I expect more volatility on the horizon, as additional leaks filter into the overall narrative for this sector."
