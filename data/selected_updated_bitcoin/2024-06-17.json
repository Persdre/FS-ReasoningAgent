        "content": "The Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, continues to update the general public on the highly anticipated launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the USA, moving his prediction to July 2.\n\nETF on Ethereum: Bloomberg\u2019s forecast for their launch is now July 2nd\n\nThe latest update from Eric Balchunas, analyst at Bloomberg, states a new forecast for the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the USA for July 2.\n\nThis is an anticipation compared to what was previously stated, which was July 4th.\n\nMakes sense. What I heard: issuers still waiting to get comments from Corp Fin on S-1s which they handed in 2wks ago. Corp Fin is just looking at these docs for first time (why? bc of the (highly likely) political last min 180 (remember they were as surprised by this as anyone\u2026 https://t.co/N32N6jFXBv \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 13, 2024\n\nUPDATE: we are moving our launch date for the Ether Spot ETF to July 2, having heard that the Staff sent comments on the S-1s to issuers today, and that they are quite light, nothing major, asking them to return within a week. There is a good chance they are working to declare it effective the following week and get it out of the way before the holidays. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess at the moment.\n\nIn practice, the new forecast date for the launch of spot ETFs on Ethereum, by Bloomberg\u2019s analyst, is based on the comments from the staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSuch comments are addressed to the issuers of the Ethereum spot ETFs, who are awaiting a response on their S-1s, for which it seems there is a good chance that the SEC will work on them for implementation as early as next week.\n\nEthereum spot ETF and Bloomberg forecasts: the new launch date is July 2\n\nJust the day before the publication of this update, Balchunas di Bloomberg had shared something quite different.\n\nIn fact, the issuers of spot Ethereum ETFs had not yet received a response, and for this reason, the analyst had postponed his previous forecast of July 4th.\n\nThe journalist from FOX Business, Eleanor Terrett, had also published the details on this topic. Basically, it seems that Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, would have stated \u201cduring this summer\u201d and Senator Bill Hagerty \u201cby the end of this summer\u201d.\n\nIt was May 23 when the SEC had approved the eight 19b-4 filings for the listing of spot ETFs on Ether in various US exchanges. Unfortunately, however, the real launch on the stock exchange can only occur when there are approvals for the S-1 registration statement.\n\nMark Cuban\u2019s thoughts on the SEC Chairman\n\nIn the meantime, Mark Cuban, the pro-bitcoin and crypto billionaire investor, has publicly stated his thoughts on the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler.\n\nIn practice, Cuban sees that Gensler\u2019s actions are an obstacle for Joe Biden\u2019s election to the presidency of the USA.\n\nThis is because the President of the SEC continues to act against crypto, leaving that the young crypto holder voters will pass their vote to other candidates.\n\nOn the contrary, in fact, there is Donald Trump who seems to use the crypto sector as an integral part of his election campaign, declaring himself in favor of its growth."

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Ethereum While It's Below $4,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Is Ethereum on its way to a new all-time high? These three factors say yes.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC -2.22%) captured the imagination of crypto investors. But don't sleep on Ethereum (ETH -4.27%). Up 54% year to date, it has largely kept pace with Bitcoin, and it has one new catalyst in place that could send it soaring in the second half of the year.\n\nSo this could be the time to put Ethereum on your investment radar. There are three good reasons why it could soar past the $4,000 mark on its way to a new all-time high.\n\nThe new ETFs\n\nThe big catalyst, of course, is the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. If they enjoy anywhere near the same success as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could send the price of Ethereum soaring. During the first six months of the year, the spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $30 billion from investors, and that is what led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in price by 60%. The current thinking is that the new spot Ethereum ETFs could pull in as much as $3 billion in their first six months.\n\nThe only question, really, is when the new ETFs will start trading. The original consensus was the end of May. That was then pushed back to the end of June. And now SEC head Gary Gensler says it will be sometime before the end of the summer. Maybe by the time you're back from summer vacation, you'll be able to buy them.\n\nEthereum's market dominance\n\nOne underappreciated fact about Ethereum is just how dominant it is in many niches of the blockchain world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, web3, and the metaverse, Ethereum is the clear market leader. Its blockchain technology powers so many of tomorrow's most powerful and interesting apps. That means more users, more developers, more active wallets, more transactions, and more cash flows than any other blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCase in point: In the world of DeFi, Ethereum currently accounts for 60% of all total value locked (TVL), one of the most important metrics for blockchain performance. By way of comparison, its chief rival Solana (SOL -4.85%) has only a 4% market share. Other up-and-coming rivals -- such as Sui and Aptos -- barely show up as blips on the radar. Thus, this group of \"Ethereum killers\" could pose less of an existential risk to Ethereum than originally feared.\n\nNew blockchain upgrades\n\nI can't think of another cryptocurrency that gets more attention for its blockchain upgrades than Ethereum. It has followed up The Merge (a massive blockchain upgrade) with a number of smaller technical upgrades meant to make its blockchain faster and cheaper to use. Last year, we had Shapella. Earlier this year, we had Dencun. And now the buzz is building for the next upgrade, known as Prague-Electra.\n\nThere are two reasons these stepwise upgrades are so important. First of all, they make it easier for Ethereum to fend off its rivals. Yes, Solana might be faster and cheaper to use right now, but Ethereum is doing everything in its power to narrow the gap. The ultimate goal is the ability to process 1 million transactions per second, and each new upgrade brings Ethereum closer to this target.\n\nAlso, each new upgrade helps to build confidence in Ethereum's roadmap for the future. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which often seem to have a helter-skelter feel to their overall development, Ethereum lays out a roadmap at the start of every year and patiently explains how all the steps in this roadmap fit together. I've always viewed this process as similar to the way that publicly traded corporations give guidance about upcoming results.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nGiven these three factors, I think there's a reasonable chance that we could be talking about a new all-time high of $5,000 for Ethereum sometime by early 2025. That's a 40% gain from today's price of $3,500.\n\nBut $5,000 may be entirely too low a future projection for Ethereum. It's not hard to find analysts predicting a price of $10,000 for Ethereum. And investment firm VanEck thinks Ethereum is on a rocket to $22,000 by the year 2030.\n\nIn many ways, this depends on how well those new spot Ethereum ETFs perform. If the end of summer comes and they still are not trading, or if new investor inflows disappoint, then it might be time to tamp down expectations. If you are comfortable with assuming that risk, it could be time to start thinking about investing in Ethereum while it's still trading below $4,000."
