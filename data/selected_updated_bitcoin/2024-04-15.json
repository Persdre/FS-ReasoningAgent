        "content": "Hong Kong Approves Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs\n\nChina Asset Management, Bosera Capital, HashKey Capital Limited announced that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved both spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications.\n\nHashkey Capital was founded in 2015 by current CEO Dr Xiao Feng, and is a digital asset platforms and investment fund prominent in Asia. It has $1 billion in AUM and recently seeked to raise funds at a $1 billion plus valuation. Shenzhen-based Bosera Capital is one of the first fund management companies in China, and manages $200 billion in assets. Meanwhile, China Asset Management is a prominent asset management firm founded in 1998. It manages one of the largest equity ETF products in China, with a total of $266 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBloomberg first reported about the imminent approval of the spot ETFs, with the listing details being finalized in time with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX). The report stated that the products could be launched by the end of this month, marking a significant development in the region's cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe approval of these ETF products in Hong Kong is anticipated to be a major driver for the cryptocurrency market, positioning the city as a leading digital asset hub in Asia. While the United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, resulting in a record-breaking price surge that propelled Bitcoin to reach $73,000, it has not yet approved Ethereum ETFs. In contrast, Hong Kong approved both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs at the same time. Meanwhile, expectations for the approval of spot Ether ETF products in the U.S. remain subdued due to the lack of SEC engagement with the applicants. JPMorgan analysts placed the approval of Ether ETFs by the final deadline in May at 50%.\n\nFollowing the news of the approval, BTC surged 2.81% in the past 24 hours to trade at $66,526, up from the lows of $62,000. Meanwhile, ETH gained 4.88% and is currently trading at $3,246. The crypto markets had a brutal sell-off last week following escalating tensions in the Middle East, which propelled fears of a blown-out war."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Slipped Over the Weekend - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) remain three of the most-watched tokens for good reason. Unfortunately, onlookers have seen mostly downside price action over the weekend. Since market close on Friday, these three top digital assets have sunk 4.2%, 2.5% and 11.2%, respectively, as of 12:45 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nAn initial sharp decline was seen in all three tokens in early Saturday trading, in line with the reported escalation of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. While each of these three tokens has made up some of this weekend's initial losses, it's clear that cryptocurrency is not immune from the geopolitical forces driving capital in and out of assets in times of uncertainty.\n\nThese moves are also significant because they come ahead of this week's expected Bitcoin halving, in which block rewards for miners will be cut in half. Typically, previous halvings have resulted in a booming price, which has bled into other crypto assets as well.\n\nBut given the anticipation around this rise, as well as capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, some investors appear to be betting that much of this rally might have already taken place, leading to caution heading into this key catalyst.\n\nLet's dive into some other key factors to consider when it comes to these three top tokens and their price action today.\n\nWhy all the negativity in the large-cap crypto space?\n\nBitcoin's move is perhaps most important to watch, as the largest cryptocurrency in the world heads into its latest halving, expected to take place on or about April 20. We'll have to see how the network responds, and how investors value the network as its inflation rate is halved yet again.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin did not rise on increased Iran-Israel tensions suggests that investors are continuing to view it more as a risk asset and less as a hedge against uncertainty. We'll have to see if this narrative shifts, particularly if some response from Israel is seen in the coming days.\n\nEthereum's move, while negative, has been the strongest of the three over the weekend. This is likely due to news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved applications from three Chinese companies to list Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in Hong Kong.\n\nNo official report from the SEC has been released, but this could signal that a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the U.S. is likely to be seen in short order. For now, overarching macro concerns appear to be stealing the spotlight from this otherwise positive catalyst. I would expect Ethereum to continue to outperform its fellow large-cap tokens in the coming weeks, as investors price this catalyst in.\n\nStory continues\n\nDogecoin's double-digit move lower over the weekend once again exemplifies this token's nature as a high-risk and high-leverage bet on momentum within the crypto space. A lack of any meaningful rhetoric from Elon Musk (and negative sentiment building around Tesla and its recent layoffs and full self-driving announcements) have investors seemingly looking for other options in the crypto realm right now.\n\nIs there upside on the horizon this week?\n\nCertainly, there are a number of bullish catalysts that could take these three top tokens higher this week. The Bitcoin halving and the reported approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs should be broadly bullish for the top two cryptos by market capitalization (and Dogecoin by default).\n\nThe thing is, uncertainty remains high right now, and investors remain on edge waiting to see if we're heading into yet another war. The feeling in financial markets is glum right now, meaning these catalysts could be overshadowed by this overarching sentiment, at least in the short term.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these top tokens perform next weekend, as additional news arises around the two aforementioned key catalysts every crypto investor is watching right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Which Crypto to Buy in 2024: Navigating Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Furrever Token (FURR) Market Trends - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the tumultuous sea of cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum (ETH) has recently demonstrated remarkable volatility, swiftly rebounding from a sharp drop to stabilize at a higher level, capturing the attention of both seasoned traders and crypto whales. This event underscores the persistent dynamism and significant capital movements within the crypto market. Concurrently, Dogecoin (DOGE) enjoys a hopeful rally, buoyed by broader market optimism and speculative interest ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Amidst these established giants, Furrever Token (FURR) continues to carve out its niche, showing impressive presale momentum and drawing substantial investments from a growing community of supporters. These developments highlight the ongoing activities and strategic plays in the cryptocurrency space, driven by key events and whale movements that often dictate market directions.\n\nWhales on the Move as Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds From $3,400\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently undergone a dramatic 24-hour period of trading that saw its price experiencing significant volatility. Initially, the cryptocurrency suffered a sharp 3.1% decline, dropping to $3,411, which led to the liquidation of tens of millions of dollars worth of positions within just an hour. However, not long after this steep drop, Ethereum saw a robust recovery, reaching a high of $3,615 before settling at $3,512 by the end of the day. Despite these substantial fluctuations, Ethereum's price remained essentially flat over the course of the 24-hour trading period.\n\nDuring this period of intense trading, the activities of major cryptocurrency investors, often referred to as 'crypto whales', were particularly noteworthy. According to a report from Spot On Chain, one such whale, known by the identifier \"0x347\", made a significant move by depositing 9,000 ETH into Binance. This deposit, valued at approximately $32 million, stands as the largest ETH deposit by this entity to date. After this transaction, \"0x347\" is now in possession of 29,738 ETH, which has an approximate market value of $106 million and has accrued an estimated profit of $68.5 million.\n\nIn addition, other reports by Lookonchain highlighted contrasting activities from another whale who took advantage of the market's dip to acquire 10,309 ETH, worth around $35.82 million. This purchase was part of a broader strategy that included a considerable investment just before a significant rise in Bitcoin's value on April 8.\n\nThe diverging actions of these major Ethereum holders reflect the mixed sentiments and strategies within the market regarding the short-term direction of Ethereum's price. While some see the recovery as a bullish sign indicating potential for further upward movement, others remain skeptical, viewing the rebound as merely a technical correction rather than the start of a sustained upward trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Ethereum constantly at the center of market speculation and analysis, the differing approaches of significant market players highlight the speculative and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to evolve, it remains a focal point for both opportunity and caution within the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 6% as Market Outlook Stays Hopeful\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), the leader among the world's meme cryptocurrencies, has experienced a surge, climbing 6% in the last 24 hours to reach $0.203. This increase comes amidst a broader wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market, spurred by the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. However, the excitement was short-lived as Dogecoin's price dipped to $0.192, culminating in a weekly gain of 3.2% and a monthly rise of 9.85%. Despite these fluctuations, Dogecoin maintains its status as the largest meme coin by market capitalization.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Dogecoin's current market position is that it trades at a considerable discount, 73% below its all-time high of $0.7316. This significant gap suggests potential undervaluation, fueling speculations that Dogecoin might be poised for substantial gains in the near future, especially as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\nMarket analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin's trajectory, predicting potential price increases leading up to the halving event slated for April 20th. This event is anticipated not only to impact Bitcoin but to have a ripple effect across various digital currencies, potentially ushering in another bull market.\n\nThe technical indicators on Dogecoin\u2019s price chart reinforce this optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), after peaking at 70, has seen a slight retreat, expected to stabilize around 60 or 55, suggesting that any declines might be short-lived and followed by further gains.\n\nAdditionally, trading volumes for Dogecoin have shown remarkable growth, with a 13% increase from the previous day, reaching around $2.52 billion. This heightened activity is indicative of growing investor interest, further evidenced by substantial purchases by whales on various trading platforms in recent days.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a strong likelihood that Dogecoin will experience significant price movements one or two more times before the Bitcoin halving event. This period could be critical for investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated market dynamics. As always, while the potential for high returns exists, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments calls for caution and thorough analysis before making any financial commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Near %200 Return Still Possible\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is rapidly gaining traction as a standout investment in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, capturing widespread interest due to its impressive growth potential and lucrative opportunities for investors. Demonstrating remarkable success across its presale phases, FURR has consistently drawn significant investments. Currently, in its sixth presale phase, the token has accumulated over $780,000, underscoring its popularity and the strong backing it has garnered from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nOffering investors the potential to achieve up to 15X returns from each presale phase, FURR positions itself as an exceptionally appealing investment within the crypto realm. Priced at just $0.00048, it offers an accessible entry point for investors keen on capitalizing on its expected growth trajectory.\n\nThe token's allure is further bolstered by the robust community support it enjoys. With over 4,300 active members on its official Telegram channel, FURR is at the heart of a vibrant hub for discussions, collaboration, and regular updates, which enriches the investment experience for its community members.\n\nLooking to the future, FURR\u2019s strategic roadmap and developmental initiatives indicate a strong commitment to achieving a dominant position within the meme coin sector. The team behind FURR plans to implement novel features, forge strategic partnerships, and engage in targeted marketing efforts, all designed to enhance its adoption and increase its value in the market.\n\nIn essence, Furrever Token presents a compelling investment proposition, backed by solid fundamentals, an active and engaged community, and a promising outlook for substantial growth. As FURR continues to progress towards achieving its strategic goals, it is well-placed to provide significant returns to early investors tapping into its potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Robert Smith support(at)furrevertoken.com https://furrevertoken.com/\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Halving 2024: How Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR)\u2019s are Poised to Transform in the New ETF-Driven Market Landscape - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency community approaches the 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) halving, excitement builds not just for the potential effects on Bitcoin's price, but also for the broader implications for the market, including Ethereum (ETH) and emerging assets like Furrever Token (FURR) . This particular halving event, set for April 2024, coincides with significant market developments, notably the rise of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which could reshape investment strategies and market liquidity. Bitcoin's upcoming halving will reduce the reward for mining transactions by half, potentially constricting supply and influencing prices in a market that has already seen Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others like Furrever Token, make substantial gains. The interplay between these factors and the new dynamic introduced by ETFs could lead to unprecedented outcomes in the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving: A New Chapter in Crypto With the Rise of ETFs\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) community is poised on the brink of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, an event that could catalyze the cryptocurrency landscape. Scheduled for April 2024, this halving is not just another cycle in Bitcoin's existence but may mark a significant turning point for broader crypto adoption. Unlike previous halvings, the upcoming event coincides with the emergence of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), introducing a dynamic that could reshape market reactions post-halving.\n\nBitcoin's supply is finite, capped at 21 million coins. Every four years, the Bitcoin network undergoes a 'halving' where the block rewards given to miners are reduced by half. This mechanism decreases the rate at which new bitcoins are created, aiming to prevent inflation and preserve scarcity. Historically, each halving event has led to considerable bullish trends in Bitcoin\u2019s price. For example, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price escalated from around $12 to over $1,000 within a year. Similar patterns followed the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with prices peaking at around $20,000 and over $60,000, respectively.\n\nWhile past performance due to halving is notable, it's crucial to recognize that these price surges also aligned with significant global economic events, such as the European debt crisis, the ICO boom, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events underscore the influence of broader economic contexts on Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior, indicating that halving impacts are intertwined with global economic health and investor sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2024 halving introduces a novel factor that could significantly influence Bitcoin's market dynamics\u2014the approval and operation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These financial products allow a wider range of investors to engage with Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency handling, potentially enhancing mainstream adoption. The first quarter following the introduction of these ETFs saw about $12.1 billion in total inflows, suggesting a strong demand for Bitcoin through this new investment avenue.\n\nThe presence of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially absorb some of the post-halving sell pressure typically expected from miners reducing their holdings due to lower block rewards. By offering a new route for capital inflow into the Bitcoin market, ETFs provide a buffer against the volatility usually associated with reduced miner income.\n\nAs the 2024 halving approaches, the interplay between reduced miner rewards and the influx of funds via ETFs could mirror yet another halving effect, softening potential price drops and supporting gradual price increases. This synergy between ETF adoption and evolving market structures lays a robust foundation for Bitcoin's sustained rise, potentially influencing the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market matures, the 2024 Bitcoin halving emerges as a pivotal event, augmented by the integration of ETFs into the market structure. For investors and market participants, understanding these shifts is crucial. Staying informed and adaptable will be key in navigating the intricacies of this halving event, enabling stakeholders to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potential challenges. In this evolving narrative, Bitcoin not only retains its status as the leading cryptocurrency but also demonstrates its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing financial landscape.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Dips Below the $3,200 Mark as Whales and Institutions Offload Holdings\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing significant selling pressure, exacerbated by large-scale dispositions from whales and key institutional players. As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, with over $900 million in liquidations recorded in the last 24 hours, Ethereum has not been spared, seeing its price struggle to maintain support levels.\n\nRecently, Ethereum's price momentarily dipped below the $3,200 mark to reach $3,161 before recovering slightly to hover around the $3,280 level, marking a 5.62% decrease within a single day. This volatility has been partly attributed to substantial sales by major Ethereum holders. According to data from Lookonchain, four significant entities offloaded a total of 31,683 ETH, worth approximately $106 million, contributing to the downward pressure on prices.\n\nThe transactions involved well-known entities in the crypto space:\n\n- Cumberland deposited 17,206 ETH onto exchanges, valued at around $57.3 million.\n\n- Wallet address 0xC3f8 moved 7,976 ETH to Binance, totaling about $26.6 million.\n\n- Wallet 0x1717 transferred 4,000 ETH, worth approximately $13.32 million, to various trading platforms.\n\n- Alameda/FTX was reported to have moved 2,500 ETH to Binance, which amounts to roughly $8.33 million.\n\nThese moves reflect a broader trend of large-scale Ethereum sales, which can significantly impact the market due to the substantial volumes involved.\n\nThe continuous flow of ETH to exchanges suggests that the selling pressure may not abate soon. Another report from Whale Alert highlighted an additional transfer of $158 million worth of Ethereum to Binance by an unknown wallet, indicating the potential for further sell-offs in the open market.\n\nAside from market actions, Ethereum is grappling with several ecosystem challenges that may be influencing investor sentiment negatively. Recent developments have cast doubt on the prospects for an Ethereum ETF, as regulatory and market hurdles continue to loom large. This uncertainty, combined with the active shedding of assets by major stakeholders like Alameda/FTX, suggests a tough road ahead for Ethereum.\n\nAs Ethereum navigates through these turbulent market conditions, the community and potential investors are closely monitoring these developments. The influx of large volumes of ETH onto exchanges and the accompanying sell-off activities by prominent institutional players are crucial factors that market participants will need to consider. These dynamics are pivotal in shaping Ethereum's short-term price movements and broader market standing amidst an already volatile financial landscape.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Presale Exceeds $780,000\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is swiftly making its mark as a distinguished investment in the vibrant cryptocurrency market, drawing significant interest for its robust growth potential and appealing investor opportunities. Demonstrating outstanding success through its presale events, FURR has consistently attracted substantial investments. Presently in its sixth presale phase, the token has successfully raised over $780,000, illustrating its escalating popularity and the strong endorsement it enjoys from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFURR positions itself as an exceptionally attractive investment by offering the potential for investors to achieve up to 15X returns from each presale stage. Currently priced at $0.00048, the token presents an opportune entry point for investors looking to leverage its projected growth.\n\nThe token's appeal is further reinforced by the robust community support it commands. With more than 4,300 active participants on its official Telegram channel, FURR is at the center of dynamic discussions, collaborative initiatives, and regular updates, all of which enrich the investment experience for its community members.\n\nLooking to the future, FURR's strategic roadmap and development plans signal a strong commitment to carving out a significant presence in the meme coin market. The team behind FURR is focused on rolling out innovative features, forging strategic partnerships, and launching targeted marketing efforts, all aimed at boosting the token's adoption and enhancing its market value.\n\nOverall, Furrever Token stands as a highly compelling investment proposition, supported by solid fundamentals, an active and enthusiastic community, and a promising outlook for expansive growth. As FURR advances toward achieving its strategic goals, it is well-equipped to provide significant returns to early investors who tap into its potential.\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH on Coinbase. This flexibility makes staking accessible to everyone, regardless of the amount of Ethereum they hold.\n\nHow Much Can You Earn Staking ETH on Coinbase?\n\nWhen staking Ethereum (ETH) on Coinbase in mid-April 2024, the estimated reward rate is approximately 2.61% if you stake for 365 days. This rate isn't fixed and can vary over time. You can check the latest applicable rates directly within your Coinbase account. Commission charges reduce your actual returns.\n\nRewards are distributed every four to five days after the activation period. However, the rewards may not settle in your account immediately because of network conditions. While the estimated reward rate gives you an idea of what you can earn, the actual rewards may take some time to reflect in your account.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Unstake ETH on Coinbase?\n\nTo unstake ETH on Coinbase, you follow a specific process. Once you initiate the unstaking action, your assets will enter an unbonding period. After this period ends, you can withdraw the asset. However, there's an additional step: unbonded assets must be included in a batch before withdrawal. You'll need to wait until the unbonding transaction is part of one of Coinbase's batch times.\n\nFor U.S. clients, batch times are Monday-Friday at 12:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. PST; and Saturday-Sunday at 2:00 p.m. PST.

You would go through the process of unstaking it first, which typically takes one to four days depending on network conditions. Once the unstaking transaction is processed, you'll be able to claim your funds and sell them.\n\nUnstaking and claiming are separate blockchain transactions, and both require gas fees, resulting in costs associated with both processes.\n\nIf you have staked Ethereum on Coinbase and want to move it, you have a couple of options. You can unstake it and sell it or you can wrap it into cbETH and trade it as a liquid staking token. However, cbETH trades at a discount, so if you're looking to sell at the full value of your staked Ethereum, unstaking and selling it may be the better option.\n\nCoinbase Stakers Earn Rewards\n\nStaking Ethereum on Coinbase offers a straightforward and accessible way for users to actively participate in the Ethereum network and earn rewards. With Coinbase's user-friendly platform, you can stake any amount of ETH, even as little as 0.01 ETH, without the need for a full Ethereum node. While there are potential risks and considerations to keep in mind, such as centralized exchange risks, commission charges and gas fees, the benefits of earning passive income, supporting network security and contributing to a more environmentally friendly blockchain ecosystem can make staking on Coinbase an attractive option for many investors."
