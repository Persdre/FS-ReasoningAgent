        "content": "ETF expert Nate Geraci predicts that the SEC will approve trading of spot Ethereum ETFs this week.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum's price surpasses $3,300 as the market awaits the SEC's trading approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAnalysts and industry leaders believe the imminent approval will boost Ethereum investment.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe price of Ethereum has rallied 5% to over $3,300 ahead of the key spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision, according to data from TradingView.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to greenlight the launch of several spot Ethereum ETFs by the end of this month. While the specific date remains speculative, ETF experts estimate that approval will come the week of July 15.\n\nNate Geraci, the president of the ETF Store, reiterated his prediction that the SEC will approve the S-1 filings this week after weeks of delays following initial listing acceptance in May. He believes there\u2019s no reason for further delay because issuers are ready for launch and recent filings require minimal changes.\n\n\u201cWelcome to spot [ETH] ETF approval week. I\u2019m calling it. Don\u2019t know anything specific, just can\u2019t come up [without] good reason for any further delay at this point. Issuers ready for launch,\u201d Geraci stated in a Sunday post.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart previously predicted the spot Ethereum ETFs could be approved and begin trading as soon as mid-July.\n\nSeyffart noted that Ethereum ETF issuers have been filing their final S-1 registration statements, which is the last regulatory hurdle before approval. Balchunas said the SEC\u2019s minimal feedback on these latest filings suggests they are close to being satisfied with the applications.\n\nMatt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, confirmed that minimal amendments suggest imminent approval.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is anticipated to have a major impact on the Ethereum market and the broader crypto industry. It could drive remarkable inflows of institutional and retail capital into Ethereum, potentially mirroring the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn a recent report, Hougan suggested that spot Ethereum ETFs could attract $15 billion in net inflows by the end of 2025."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs to coincide with Bitcoin Conference, potentially boosting market attention.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum ETFs are scheduled to begin trading on July 23, as reported by Bloomberg analyst.\n\nBitwise CIO projects $15 billion in inflows for Ethereum ETFs by the end of 2025.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe starting date for spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading in the US is July 23rd, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. He shared on X that the SEC is answering issuers today, asking them to return their final S-1 forms on Wednesday, July 17th.\n\n\u201cAnd then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course,\u201d he added.\n\nUpdate: Nate's instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course! https://t.co/D21FD9Qf94 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 15, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum ETF issuers filed their S-1 forms on July 8th but most of them left the fees out of their forms. According to Balchunas, this is likely a strategy from the asset managers to check how competitive the funds\u2019 fees are, especially BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form is an initial registration required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a security can be publicly traded.\n\nAs highlighted by Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart, this could mean that the Ethereum ETFs will start trading the same week as the Bitcoin Conference, set to happen in Nashville.\n\nThe launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs is a key step for crypto adoption by mainstream investors, as it solidifies the altcoin as a sound asset among institutional investors. An estimate by Bitwise CIO predicts that these investment instruments will capture $15 billion in inflows until the end of 2025, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum ETFs open the door for the approval of exchange-traded funds indexed to other crypto. VanEck and 21Shares both filed their form for the approval of the first spot Solana ETFs in the US on the last week of June."
