        "content": "While Bitcoin Ordinals are making headlines, inscriptions on Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains have gained traction in recent weeks, according to a Dragonfly data analyst.\n\nWhile Bitcoin inscriptions continue to gain headlines and spur debates, inscriptions on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains have gained traction in the past month, particularly on the Polygon network, according to an X thread from Hildobby, a data analyst at crypto-native venture capital firm Dragonfly.\n\nGas fees spent on inscriptions peaked at about $800,000 two weeks ago before retreating, but inscriptions have remained stronger on Polygon, representing 72% of overall transactions on the chain in the past week. Hildobby attributes much of this activity to the Polygon-focused inscription marketplace POLS Market.\n\n\u201cPolygon seems to be where most inscriptions are thanks to @PolsMarket whose inscription \u201cpols\u201d has seen the most minters with ~100k addresses,\u201d Hildobby wrote.\n\n1/ Inscriptions have gained traction on EVM chains over the past month, most notably on Polygon where they account for 20% of gas spent & 72% of transactions \ud83d\udcdd more below pic.twitter.com/1s78sUqyik \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) December 6, 2023\n\nInscriptions on EVM chains work by storing small amounts of metadata in the call data for a blockchain transaction. Similarly to Bitcoin Ordinals, EVM inscriptions essentially form smart contract-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And, like Ordinals, EVM inscriptions have raised concerns, including about whether the technology is scalable.\n\nBut Hildobby noted that he isn\u2019t advocating for EVM chain inscriptions, tweeting, \u201cFYI: Inscriptions go against every EVM design decisions, with gas costs being the only benefit, at the expense of indexing, non-compatibility, integration challenges.\u201d"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt comments on Ethereum price action as the market embarks on a fresh crypto rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged to $44,000 for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also soared in response to the bullish impulse, touching highs of $2,312 in today's trading session.\n\nIn a new tweet, Brandt asks his 705,100 followers if Ethereum will emerge from the shadows anytime soon. He says that at least three narratives are possible, about which he launched a poll for his followers to participate in.\n\nVisual for reference pic.twitter.com/16YP1sZMQL \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 6, 2023\n\nBrandt's three narratives include a classic wedge that targets the $900 price for ETH. The second narrative is a running wedge pattern, which, if verified, has a price target of $3,300.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famed trader's third narrative is \"Morphology ahead,\" which could imply that the Ethereum price action is still brewing and in the process of taking a particular form or structure. Brandt provides a visual representation of these price patterns.\n\nThe first option, the classic wedge, received 24% of votes in favor. The amount of 60.7% of respondents voted for the more likely option of a running wedge with a target of $3,300 given the current market standing. A total of 15.3% of the respondents voted for the 'Morphology ahead' option.\n\nTypically, a wedge pattern can indicate either bullish or bearish price reversals. A rising wedge (which indicates a bearish reversal) or a descending wedge (which indicates a bullish reversal) are the two types of wedge patterns.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had gained 2.16% in the previous 24 hours and was trading at $2,264.\n\nIn ETF-related news, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it will take more than 45 days to review a rule change that would allow Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline has been set for Jan. 25, 2024."
