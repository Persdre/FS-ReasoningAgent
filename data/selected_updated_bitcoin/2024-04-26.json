        "title": "Ethereum May Price Prediction: Can ETH Hit $4,000? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has undergone notable changes in recent times. On September 15, 2022, the network transitioned from a proof-of-work mining model to a proof-of-stake model. This transition has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption, with reports indicating a 99.95% decrease.\n\nA few days ago, the network implemented the Dencun upgrade, which was designed to improve its functionality and performance. However, following this upgrade, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, falling below the $4,000 mark.\n\nETH had recently shown growth, rising by 4.8% in the last seven days. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,150, according to CoinGecko data. ETH is up by 68.5% year-to-date and has regained the $3,100 level recently.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Makes Crucial Shibarium Announcement: Can SHIB Hit $0.0001 In May?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for May\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for May. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,271 and a maximum price of $3,399. The average price is expected to be $3,335.\n\nThe prediction reveals that ETH is unlikely to hit the $4,000 level by May. The recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the pump after the recent BTC retrace. With Bitcoin once again showing heightened volatility, the trajectory of ETH remains uncertain.\n\nAlso read: Dogwifhat: Can WIF Hit $10 In May?\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space. Its robust ecosystem, which hosts a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continues to drive innovation and adoption.\n\nHowever, Ethereum also faces challenges, such as high gas fees and scalability issues, which have led to the rise of competing blockchain networks.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 AI Cryptocurrencies To Buy For Gains As Nvidia Report Drops In May"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin hit a multi-year low in April.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the gap between the two could become more pronounced.\n\nInvestors are losing their faith in Ethereum as the cryptocurrency continuously fails to keep pace with Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains.\n\nAnd things could get worse for the world\u2019s biggest altcoin.\n\nNot only have the odds for a US spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund getting approved in May dropped, but Ethereum exchange-traded products suffered $34 million worth of outflows this past week, CoinShares data shows \u2014 making them the only asset group among those CoinShares tracks to register a net outflow since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cETH sentiment is anecdotally at the lowest it has been in years, despite recent developments such as the BUIDL fund by BlackRock,\u201d Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, told DL News.\n\nThe decreasing optimism comes as smaller altcoins, like Solana, have attracted investors who don\u2019t expect Ethereum investments to yield as high returns as they did in the past.\n\nA Bitcoin-driven market\n\nIn previous bull markets, Bitcoin has outperformed other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the cycle \u2014 a trend that looks to be playing out again.\n\nThis time the focus on Bitcoin has been catalysed by inflows to the 10 US Bitcoin ETFs that launched on January 11.\n\nThey have so far seen over $12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nYet, Ethereum has not managed to capitalise on the rally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin \u2014 or ETHBTC \u2014 fell to a low of 0.046 in April, creating the biggest price gap between the two assets in almost three years.\n\nThat means that since ETHBTC peaked in 2022, an investment in Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum by 44%.\n\nThe ETHBTC trading pair shows the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin. Traders use this metric to gauge the relative strength of Ethereum against benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEven though some people may not view ETH as an altcoin per se, its over- or underperformance relative to Bitcoin is a powerful metric to try and understand what kind of market we are in,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs continue to steam ahead, the price gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more pronounced.\n\nAnd there\u2019s reason to believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue to soar. Hong Kong recently approved the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which are set to begin trading April 30.\n\nEthereum ETF approval looks unlikely\n\nWhile Hong Kong also approved a spot Ethereum ETF, the odds of US regulators approving similar funds on May 23 \u2014 the deadline for when they have to either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s application \u2014 are low.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put odds for a May approval at around 25%.\n\nSimilarly, punters on blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket put the odds of an approval at 13%.\n\nThis week, BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF application while competitor Grayscale filed to convert its futures Ethereum ETF to a spot fund.\n\nDespite this, analysts remain sceptical that any US spot Ethereum ETF will be approved.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF is almost certainly going to be rejected in May, which has dampened flows into ETH in already existing [exchange-traded] products,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSolana steals the spotlight\n\nAmong so-called altcoins, Ethereum is the largest, with a market value of $384 billion. But this success is a double-edged sword, according to Nolan.\n\n\u201cETH has a large market cap and investors have turned to lower cap alternatives,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nOne popular alternative is Solana.\n\nMost traders assume it would be difficult for Ethereum\u2019s market value to exceed that of Bitcoin. So with Bitcoin sporting a market value of $1.27 trillion, Ethereum traders see limited upside potential.\n\nDespite rallying 546% over the past year, Solana\u2019s market cap is a comparatively low $64 billion, leaving more room for it to grow.\n\nTraders are also starting to pay more attention to Solana\u2019s price compared with other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI have noticed much more attention this cycle vs. last cycle to SOL/ETH and SOL/BTC pairs,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSigns of hope\n\nThere\u2019s still hope Ethereum could stop bleeding against Bitcoin \u2014 but not for a while.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF should help drive interest. Nolan said he expects an ETF will \u201clikely\u201d be approved in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, if the current bull market repeats previous ones, Ethereum should do better as time goes on.\n\nUntil then, traders will continue to watch the ETHBTC chart closely for clues as to where the top two cryptocurrencies are heading next.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.
