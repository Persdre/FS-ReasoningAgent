        "content": "Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin has undertaken a large-scale transaction involving trillions of meme tokens, leaving the broader cryptocurrency space curious about the motives behind the founder\u2019s decision.\n\nEthereum Founder Executes Massive Memecoin Sales\n\nEthereum inventor and founder, Vitalik Buterin has made new headlines as reports surface of his substantial memecoin sales. According to blockchain security company, PeckShield Alerts, a Vitalik labeled wallet address was seen swapping 100,000,000,000,111.111 DOBE tokens worth approximately $22,900 for 10.44 Ethereum tokens (ETH). Additionally, the wallet also initiated another sale of 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO tokens worth $6800 for 3.12 ETH.\n\nThe motivation behind the sell-offs remains unknown however the large-scale memecoin transaction has adequately caught the attention of cryptocurrency investors and the market as a whole.\n\nThe substantial meme coin sale follows a recent loss experienced by Buterin earlier this week. The Ethereum founder\u2019s publicly known crypto wallets became short of $29 million between December 15 and 21.\n\nThe loss was reported by blockchain analytics service, Arkham Intelligence. According to the analytics platform, the reason for the loss was due to crypto market fluctuations which saw Buterin\u2019s wallets losing 5% of the total value of its assets.\n\nETH price chart at $2,300 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nButerin Crypto Sell-Offs\n\nIn addition to Buterin\u2019s recent large-scale meme coin sell-off, there have been many other crypto sales executed by the ETH founder. Earlier this year, Buterin sold about 9.9 billion CULT tokens worth $332,420 at the time of the sales. The Ethereum founder subsequently revealed reasons for the sell-off, stating that the cryptocurrency held no cultural or moral value.\n\nLater in October, rumors surfaced about Buterin allegedly selling off his ETH holdings after the Ethereum founder sold about 500,000 USDC worth approximately $14.93 million at the time, to the Gemini exchange. Buterin clarified the sell-off allegations stating that the transactions were made to charitable organizations and other initiatives.\n\nMore times than not, large-scale crypto transactions from prominent leaders in the crypto space tend to capture the attention of investors as these sales could lead to a shift in the market. However, Buterin has also revealed that he has never sold Ethereum tokens (ETH) for his gain since 2018.\n\nThe Ethereum founder is known for making multiple ETH donations to charity organizations and COVID-related causes. Buterin is also known for purchasing and constantly dumping meme coins, causing the value of these tokens to plummet in several cases.\n\nFeatured image from Newsway, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the ongoing debate of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, renowned market trader Peter Brandt has expressed significant doubts about Ethereum\u2019s future, contrasting sharply with other market experts. Brandt, known for his blunt analysis, questioned Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nPeter Brandt Predicts Dim Future for Ethereum\n\nBrandt, a respected figure in market trading circles, has openly criticized Ethereum, challenging the popular notion that it might soon outpace Bitcoin. He raised a fundamental question regarding investors\u2019 preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin, which he sees as a superior store of value. His comments come amidst bullish forecasts from other market experts and institutions, including JPMorgan. These predictions often highlight Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, especially with its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum is rooted in its structural and functional aspects. He specifically pointed out the high transaction fees, or \u2018gas fees,\u2019 associated with Ethereum, labelling the digital currency as inefficient. These fees, in his view, severely detract from Ethereum\u2019s value as an investment asset. Furthermore, he controversially suggested that Ethereum might lose its relevance entirely within the next decade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Fate Tied to Key Price Level\n\nBrandt\u2019s stance starkly contrasts with other leading analysts like Raoul Pal, who have a more favorable outlook on Ethereum. Despite differing opinions, Brandt acknowledged his respect for these analysts but did not waver from his critical perspective.\n\nIn his analysis, Brandt emphasized the importance of the ETH/BTC price chart. He pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s future could hinge on its performance relative to Bitcoin, specifically if it manages to maintain above the 0.04803 level. Should this level hold, Brandt conceded that the \u201cimminent funeral\u201d for Ethereum could be postponed, albeit temporarily.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Brandt has expressed skepticism about Ethereum. In previous statements, he has questioned its decentralization and even referred to it as a \u201cpiece of crap\u201d cryptocurrency. His consistent critique of Ethereum has been a topic of discussion in trading circles, influencing perceptions among investors.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Price Prediction As Bull Trap Puts $ETH At Risk of 12% Drop\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great 2023, so has Ethereum (ETH), the second-most traded and recognizable crypto coin in the world. Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what promises to be a significant 2024 for cryptocurrency, analysts around the world have turned bullish on it. There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024. Also, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, with markets widely betting on rate hikes having come to an end and the first rate cut as early as first-quarter 2024, the crisis for crypto may have been averted.\n\nEthereum has already started to make good of the state of the market, and it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.
