        "content": "Solana (SOL) has shown impressive growth this year, surging by almost 800% and outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over the last 12 months, the token has increased by more than 770% according to CoinMarketCap, despite its recent dip to the $141 level.\n\nAlternatively, Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown 100% and 82% in the same time frame, respectively. The development has firmly established SOL alongside both BTC and ETH as the top three cryptocurrencies in the market. That fact has led two firms to file for Spot Solana ETFs this week alone.\n\nSource: Bitcoin.com\n\nAlso Read: Solana June End Prediction: Solana Blinks To Help SOL Cross $180?\n\nSOL Beats Both Bitcoin and Ethereum in Yearly Gains So Far\n\nThroughout 2024 thus far, the US has approved two crypto-based ETFs. That is expected to grow, and Solana has emerged as a favorite to get the investment product, especially as its 800% yearly gains have outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA recent report from GSR Markets has said SOL \u201ccemented itself as a part of crypto\u2019s Big Three.\u201d Additionally, they stated that it is \u201cjust a matter of time before Solana\u201d gets its own ETF. That would place the three assets in rarified air, but looks more and more like it will become reality.\n\nSource: Decrypt\n\nAlso Read: 21Shares Officially Files for Spot Solana ETF\n\nBoth 21Shares and VanEck have filed for the Solana investment product this week. It speaks as much to Sol\u2019s potential as an investment offering, as it does to the shifting regulatory conversion in the country. Moreover, it could speak to an even greater overarching change taking place.\n\nBloomberg recently said that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s performance is starting to be overshadowed by Ether and Solana\u201d as ETF hype grows. Additionally, there is the expectation that the latter could get a much-needed boost from the investment product discussions. If it does get approved, the industry, and the token itself, should be massively helped."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst and trader believes that one Ethereum (ETH) rival is well below fair market value.\n\nCrypto trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 722,500 followers on the social media platform X that layer-2 scaling solution Polkadot (DOT) could follow ETH\u2019s upward trend.\n\n\u201cDOT is likely going to follow Ethereum in its expansion upwards. This means that the current valuations of Polkadot are extremely low. I expect a lot from the Polkadot ecosystem with all the new segments.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, he suggests the possibility of a bullish divergence for DOT on the three-day chart, a metric where a lower low appears on the price chart but then a corresponding indicator shows a higher low.\n\nDOT is trading for $6.20 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will consolidate in the near term around the lower $60,000 range.\n\n\u201cBitcoin did make a retest at $61,000. I expect this to continue consolidating, where I\u2019m assuming that altcoins will have a higher return than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that Bitcoin will bounce around $60,000 and soon return to around $64,000.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $60,757 at time of writing, down 1.47% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the analyst says that leading blockchain oracle service Chainlink (LINK) will likely rally against Bitcoin (LINK/BTC) in the near term as it bounces off a trading range low on the weekly chart.\n\n\u201cPretty significant start for LINK with this weekly candle of +11% on the Bitcoin pair. It\u2019s still the cycle low and likely the bottom during this period of consolidation.\u201d\n\nLINK/BTC is trading for 0.0002308 BTC ($13.92) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
