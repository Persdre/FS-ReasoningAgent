This is a significant development since Fuelling calls for the governance to be decentralized and member-driven.\n\nAppreciate this public clarity from you, @sappenin. David also shared his proposal with me as a courtesy beforehand, as he did with XRPLF, and the Foundation was receptive to the proposal.

Schwartz noted that the proposal is a \u201cstraw man,\u201d and is designed to open dialogue in the XRPL community. It offers an opportunity for developers to collaborate and refine the governance of the Ledger and make it more transparent and democratic, in line with the community\u2019s input, he said.\n\nThe developer proposes that there is increased representation of stakeholders in the XRPLedger community and they are able to formally influence the affairs of the foundation. A more formalized membership could help facilitate the same and increase the participation of stakeholders.

        "content": "Ethereum Insider and former advisor Steven Nerayoff recently touched on his time working with Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin. As part of his comments, Nerayoff used certain adjectives to describe the duo while also revealing some things they had both done to dampen his reputation.\n\nVitalik An \u201cIdiot\u201d And Lubin A \u201cSociopath\u201d\n\nNerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he thought Vitalik was an \u201cidiot\u201d and Lubin a \u201csociopath.\u201d He further questioned the former\u2019s capabilities, stating that Vitalik being a \u201ccalculator\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he can build a protocol. Meanwhile, The Ethereum insider believed Lubin was a sociopath, which was a major reason he left him after starting ConsenSys.\n\nGiving further insights into his time working with Vitalik and Lubin, the former Ethereum advisor mentioned that he started getting \u201cbad vibes,\u201d especially when he was reviewing the \u201centire organization to save it.\u201d This was what reportedly prompted him to keep a record of everything, including key conversations.\n\nNerayoff wasn\u2019t on the technical side, so he said that he didn\u2019t have \u201cconcrete info\u201d on what was going on in the Ethereum ecosystem then. However, that has changed, as he claims that, due to his research and having to defend himself in court, he is well aware of what Vitalik and Lubin have done. By trying to take him out, \u201cthey created their worst nightmare,\u201d Nerayoff said.\n\nETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHow Ethereum Founders Created Their Worst Nightmare\n\nNerayoff alleged that Vitalik and Lubin had tried to imprison him for helping them. Nerayoff is known to have been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for extortion, although it was later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence. As such, he seemed to have been suggesting that Vitalik and Lubin had a hand in the legal ordeal he went through.\n\nThis could explain why the former Ethereum advisor is on a mission to get justice and see that the Ethereum founders are brought to book. Before now, Nerayoff had threatened to expose \u201ccriminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.\u201d Then, his remarks suggested that Vitalik Buterin was one of the criminals he was referring to.\n\nIn a more recent statement, Nerayoff highlighted how Vitalik had obtained a Montenegro passport, noting that the country happens to be one of the foremost non-extradition countries. Nerayoff promises that he will soon reveal all the evidence he has against the Ethereum founders.\n\nDespite all the allegations Nerayoff has made, neither Vitalik nor Lubin has yet to come out to deny them. The Ethereum insider stated that this just proves their guilt, as they would have come out to defend themselves if they weren\u2019t.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "PayPal\u2019s entrance into the stablecoin market on Aug. 7, 2023, was welcomed by many in the industry, with Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stating that competition from PayPal was \u2018great to have.\u2019\n\nThe news of the launch led to a modest 4% rise in the price of Bitcoin, and within days, exchanges were offering low-fee promotional opportunities for traders willing to utilize PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. Before the end of August, Coinbase, Kraken, and HTX had listed the stablecoin, adding Venmo support just a month later.\n\nFive months after its launch, PYUSD has now claimed the number eight position by market cap in the global stablecoin charts, having captured the $300 million mark around Jan. 22. However, PYUSD drops to eleventh overall when ordered by volume, with just $10 million in 24-hour trade volume. This puts it only slightly ahead of UST Classic, which, with a price 98% off its originally intended $1 peg, traded just $500,000 less over the past day.\n\nStill, PayPal\u2019s PYUSD climb to $300 million in value locked in five months is impressive. In addition to an increase in market cap, the token has seen steady on-chain activity, with a modest 200 \u2013 400 transactions per day.\n\nHowever, PYUSD has yet to break into the DeFi landscape in any meaningful way, as the below table and diagram highlight. The majority of the PYUSD liquidity sits on centralized exchanges, with Crypto.com being the largest single holder of the token at $113 million, just over one-third of the total market cap.\n\nThe visualization below depicts the transactions between major entities exclusively for PYUSD. Entities with more substantial PYUSD holdings are shown larger than those with smaller amounts. The entities with no logos on the far right are unknown wallets holding above $30,000. The logos in the top right depict business entity tokens, likely treasury holdings.\n\nInterestingly, there are several connections between PYUSD issuer Paxos, Uniswap, and Curve. Yet, these entities do not then link into the major exchanges, suggesting the DeFi and CEX ecosystems for PYUSD are wholly separate.\n\nWhile PayPal was subpoenaed by the SEC when PYUSD had half the current market cap, it was reported to have complied with requests, and little has been heard on the matter since. The announcement of the filing marked the local low for PayPal\u2019s stock price also, with it rallying 24% since November.\n\nFurther, PayPal Ventures has recently started using the PYUSD stablecoin as a mechanism for strategic investments, using it for a stake in the institutional crypto platform Mesh. Amman Bhasin, Partner at PayPal Ventures, commented,\n\n\u201cAs the world of financial services undergoes rapid transformation, we believe that user ownership and portability of assets will become a critical building block of product innovation, with crypto serving as the first beachhead where this is possible.\u201d\n\nThus, while PYUSD still has some way to go to catch behemoths such as Circle and Tether, the debutant and web2 disruptor is certainly in the process of cementing its position in the industry.\n\nMentioned in this article"
