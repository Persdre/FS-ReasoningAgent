        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is busy discussing the potential approval and implications of Ether ETFs. However, not all industry experts are optimistic about its immediate future.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg analyst, has expressed skepticism, comparing the excitement around Ether ETFs to an opening act trying to follow a headliner.\n\nThis might indicate that the much-hyped Ethereum ETFs may not live up to the hype, especially when compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis sentiment casts a shadow of doubt over the potential impact of Ether ETFs on the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMajor hurdles\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, recently expressed his concerns regarding the approval of ETH ETFs this year.\n\nCiting political pushback faced by the SEC during the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the current market's volatile nature, Chervinsky stressed the regulatory body's cautious stance.\n\nThe SEC's hesitancy, coupled with its ability to justify denial based on legal grounds, even if questionable, shows how hard it would be for Ether ETFs to get the green light.\n\nDespite BlackRock's influential position and previous successes in securing ETF approvals, Chervinsky argues that the SEC's request for withdrawal could be a likely scenario.\n\nStill big deal?\n\nNot everyone is subscribing to this cautious outlook. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, predicts that spot Ether ETFs could have a more significant impact than many anticipate.\n\nDrawing parallels with the underestimated demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Geraci points out ETH's substantial market capitalization, which stands at one-third of Bitcoin's.\n\nWith the spot Bitcoin ETF category already amassing approximately $50 billion, the introduction of Ether ETFs could potentially tap into a significant market interest.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF recently surpassed $10 billion in assets under management. It set a new record for the fastest ETF to reach this threshold. The record was previously held by a gold-focused fund for several decades."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was highly prosperous last week, witnessing a remarkable 16% surge in the global crypto market cap to $2.32 trillion. During this positive trend, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are among the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into Monday.\n\nETH, DOGE, and SHIB prices \u2013 March 3 | Source: Santiment\n\nETH breaches $3,400\n\nETH is up 9.6% this week.\n\nAs Bitcoin (BTC) garnered significant attention from market participants this week, Ethereum capitalized on the rally, achieving substantial surges beyond crucial psychological thresholds that had historically posed formidable challenges during its previous rallies.\n\nAt the onset of the week, Ethereum started on a positive note, securing an impressive three-day winning streak spanning from Feb. 26 to Feb. 28. During this period, the cryptocurrency overcame the psychological resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,300.\n\nRemarkably, Feb. 28 stood out as Ethereum\u2019s most bullish day, with the asset surging 4.40% amid Bitcoin\u2019s rally beyond $63,000. However, ETH experienced a pullback on Feb. 29 after reaching a peak of $3,521. The last time ETH saw the $3,500 level was in April 2022, before the Terra-induced price slump.\n\nAfter retesting $3,500 on Feb. 29 due to increased exchange outflows, Ethereum faced intense bearish pressure, resulting in a 1.33% decline \u2014 this marked Ethereum\u2019s first intraday loss for the week. Nonetheless, a recovery campaign on March 1 saw ETH breach and retain $3,400.\n\nDespite facing selling pressure attributed to rising exchange inflows and a potentially overbought RSI, Ethereum has managed to stay above $3,400, currently trading for $3,411 at the reporting time.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin options surge to $500m as whales apply cautious strategies\n\nDOGE records a 55% surge\n\nWhile Ethereum recorded a bullish week, its gains pale compared to Dogecoin. Notably, DOGE emerged as one of the most significant beneficiaries of the market uptrend despite commencing the week at a modest price of $0.08611.\n\nBefore the recent rally, Dogecoin had been in a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $0.094 and $0.076 since the beginning of the year, with $0.09438 acting as a formidable resistance level. On Feb. 27, DOGE successfully surpassed this threshold, rallying to a peak of $0.10058.\n\nFollowing the correction at the $0.10 resistance, Dogecoin maintained its position above the $0.094 level, concluding Feb. 27 at $0.00766 with an impressive 9.45% intraday gain. The meme coin built on this momentum, achieving a substantial 18.69% gain on Feb. 28, as it surpassed the $0.11 and $0.12 levels.\n\nDOGE sustained its uptrend until it hit a 16-month high of $0.15074 on March 2. This price represented a 75% increase from Dogecoin\u2019s weekly opening price of $0.08611. The token expectedly faced stern resistance at $0.15, but held up well above $0.14, closing the day at $0.14206.\n\nIn a notable retracement from the March 2 highs, Dogecoin has experienced a 6.07% drop today as the market corrects from the week-long uptrend. Despite these bearish developments, DOGE maintains a considerable 55% gain for the week, currently trading at $0.13335.\n\nSHIB makes it to the top gainers\u2019 list\n\nThe crypto market witnessed a resurgence of meme coins amid the uptrend, with Shiba Inu surfacing as one of the biggest gainers. SHIB began the week at the $0.000009 level, a threshold it had continued to trade at amid the previous market bearish consolidation phase.\n\nShiba Inu held above $0.000009 at the time, looking to leverage the threshold as a springboard for more substantial gains when a market uptrend comes up. This plan went well, as the asset took advantage of the Bitcoin rally to secure one of the most substantial weekly gains in the market.\n\nSHIB recorded multiple substantial intraday gains, with the lowest coming in at 4.18% on Feb. 26.\n\nThe month of March bode well for the token, as it recorded its largest intraday gains on March 1 and March 2 soaring 34.33% and 33.93%, respectively. SHIB eventually flipped MATIC, DOT and TRX to become the 12th largest asset by market cap.\n\nAmid these price surges, SHIB breached the $0.00001 and $0.00002 zones, soaring to a 22-month high of $0.00002390 on March 2 before witnessing a retracement. Despite the retracement, Shiba Inu has retained a spot among the top 5 gainers this week, changing hands at $0.00002176 amid a 125% weekly gain."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Hand Over Fist in March - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink are three cryptos that could be ready to soar even higher in 2024.\n\nAccording to a growing number of analysts, the next crypto bull market rally has officially started. Enthusiasm over the arrival of new crypto investment products is building, top cryptos are surging, and the long, cold \"crypto winter\" now seems to be a distant memory.\n\nIt's time to start looking for coins and tokens likely to skyrocket higher as part of a broad-based crypto market rally. Three that are on my short list are Bitcoin (BTC 0.24%), Ethereum (ETH -0.22%), and Chainlink (LINK -0.72%).\n\nBitcoin\n\nIf there is a no-brainer crypto investment in 2024, it's Bitcoin. After an awkward start to the year, when it briefly fell below $40,000, Bitcoin is now on a tear. It's up 35% for the year, and is holding strong above the $50,000 mark.\n\nMost of those gains, of course, have come on the basis of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early January. In a single move, the SEC gave the green light to Bitcoin as an asset that anyone could hold as part of a well-diversified portfolio. Investor fund inflows into the new Bitcoin ETFs have been off the charts. All of this new buying of Bitcoin, of course, should continue to send the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nAnd that's really just the start, because Bitcoin has another catalyst in place that might be much more powerful: the upcoming halving, scheduled for April. There have been three previous Bitcoin halving events, and each one has sent the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time-high.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future performance, of course, but investors are understandably excited about just how much higher Bitcoin could go after April. Suddenly, Bitcoin's all-time high of $69,000 looks well within reach, and many investors believe Bitcoin could end the year at $100,000 or higher.\n\nEthereum\n\nAmid all the buzz surrounding the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum is also soaring higher. This is primarily due to the growing narrative that Ethereum will be the next crypto in line to get its own spot ETF. A handful of Wall Street firms have already submitted applications, and SEC approval could come as early as May.\n\nThe only question, of course, is whether Ethereum will be another case of \"buy the rumor, sell the news,\" as Bitcoin was in January. Simply stated, the huge rally Ethereum has seen thus far in 2024 might fizzle out in May, as soon as the new ETFs become available to investors.\n\nThat being said, there's still enormous upside potential with Ethereum, which is currently undergoing yet another upgrade to remain a best-in-class blockchain.\n\nChainlink\n\nGiven that Bitcoin and Ethereum together account for nearly 70% of the total value of the $2 trillion crypto market, it's worth looking for ways to diversify your portfolio beyond just the two biggest names. Of all the cryptos that rank in the top 20 by market cap, my personal pick is Chainlink.\n\nThat's because Chainlink, as a data oracle network, is completely different from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Chainlink provides real-world data to smart contracts, which are one of the key building blocks of decentralized finance. Since Chainlink is the biggest and best-known data oracle network, it is also the most valuable. The crypto currently has a massive $11 billion market cap, which ranks No. 12 among all cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat makes Chainlink particularly interesting is that it is also a long-term play on an emerging trend known as real-world asset tokenization. This refers to the process of transforming traditional financial assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that live on the blockchain.\n\nThese financial assets require data for proper pricing, and that's where Chainlink comes into the picture. Right now, Chainlink is one of the leaders when it comes to real-world asset tokenization, which has the potential to become a multitrillion-dollar trend by the year 2030.\n\nPortfolio diversification and risk factors\n\nWhile the long-term prospects for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink look good, just remember to do your due diligence before investing. Crypto is notoriously volatile, and regulatory risk is always a very real risk factor. As a rule of thumb, it's best to invest in large-cap cryptos that have a diversified base of both retail and institutional investors.\n\nIf forced to rank these three cryptos, Bitcoin would easily be my No. 1 choice. But, as they say, it's best not to put all your eggs in the same basket. Portfolio diversification is key, and two cryptos that could play a key role in this regard are Ethereum and Chainlink."
